            <li>Found this to actually be very easy!</li>
            <li>and it seemed to get  good reviews on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I let it heat up for a good 15 minutes</li>
            <li>Ladies for 2 years these rollers worked fairly well.  </li>
            <li>To get good curls, hair sections should be +/-</li>
            <li>Pins are good quality.   </li>
            <li>Safety wise</li>
            <li>and I loved it...</li>
            <li>Good quality.  </li>
            <li>and I think he made a good choice.</li>
            <li>But I have some suggestions for people who don&#x27;t get good results.</li>
            <li>As a barber I put my very good strong seal of approval</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE these rollers!  </li>
            <li>I would surely encourage others to buy!</li>
            <li>Thanks Babyliss! &lt;3</li>
            <li>Love the curlers!  </li>
            <li>Love these rollers!</li>
            <li>always glad I purchased them!</li>
            <li>These are the best hot rollers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Glad i purchased the rollers!</li>
            <li>Certaiily better than kiiling my arms every day with my curling iron!</li>
            <li>The heat is excellent, nice and hot and I get the curl I want.  </li>
            <li>My wife says it works great, comfortable, and plenty of rollers and accessories.</li>
            <li>They looked like they&#x27;d be great; rollers came in three sizes and you got both pens (my preference) and clips to secure them.  </li>
            <li>Well they heat up nicely.  </li>
            <li>They heat up evenly and are comfy and make a nice curl.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled with the results once I took them out of my hair.</li>
            <li>and I liked the wire holders and the clamps.</li>
            <li>Still have not settled on the ideal time to turn it on, so it does the job but isn&#x27;t so HOT to the touch.</li>
            <li>The curlers were easy to use and I loved the ability to change from the butterfly clips to the metal clips.    </li>
            <li>It is also very easy to clip the hair into the roller.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell, heats up nicely, light works great, clips are nice, and easy to use without burning your hands.</li>
            <li>I then take them out and boom, soft, beautiful curls!</li>
            <li>This is a great product and is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very gentle on my hair and the curls turn out great.   </li>
            <li>She said it heats up quickly and is easy to use and her hair looks great.      </li>
            <li>This Hair product comes in a nice case with both kinds of clips, it is easy to  pack and take with me</li>
            <li>your hair curls easily, this set would be nice.  </li>
            <li>No problems with order or shipping it came very fast and now I can style my hair without ripping it out or causing heat damage!!!</li>
            <li>The plastic top broke early on, considering I take very good care of things</li>
            <li>and I love the 2 kinds of clips that come with them.  </li>
            <li>I love these curlers.  </li>
            <li>I love that they sent the clips and the pins.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure from the photos</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give them a five instead of a 4 if the clips were better</li>
            <li>The curling iron holds better for me</li>
            <li>I love them...</li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>I love this set.  </li>
            <li>Holds most of the day.  </li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this is that it comes with two types of clips to hold the curler in.</li>
            <li>my hair and these curlers work even better with those.</li>
            <li>I had to take them out of the case to be able to handle them.  </li>
            <li>For some reason, the 12-roller set produces much better, more long-lasting curls than the 20-roller set.  </li>
            <li>I think that the flocked rollers are gentler on my hair than most of the curling iron products.  </li>
            <li>Works perfectly with long fine layered hair!  </li>
            <li>these coils is very quick and easy to put your hair with waves for any event, in just two minutes as fact is a hairdo hairdresser, I am fascinated by them!</li>
            <li>All in all, I love these and would strongly recommend them to friends.</li>
            <li>They warm up quick</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly, have a nice variety of sizes and do not damage color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>but the rollers are soft and of better quality than most store bought rollers, so in all a good product.</li>
            <li>Best money I ever spent.</li>
            <li>I like the plastic clips as they are very easy and quick to.  </li>
            <li>The curlers are of a soft felt like roller with two types of clips which is a very nice feature; there are plenty of each clip for you to use your preference.  </li>
            <li>those have held up better then the original ones.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited about it, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure how to use it because mine did not have directions in the box.</li>
            <li>They are really easy to use and come with both butterfly or metal clips.</li>
            <li>and easy to work into my morning routine.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and give me a lot of body.  </li>
            <li>The velvet flocking makes them easy to roll</li>
            <li>Easy.</li>
            <li>My hair can break easily and these don&#x27;t seem to hurt my hair</li>
            <li>The clips are easy to use and the set stays in.  </li>
            <li>They heat rapidly, stay in well, and give me easy curls without a lot of fuss.  </li>
            <li>It is well made and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>a well made product that is easy to use .</li>
            <li>if i use the metal holders that come with it, it seems to work fine, but anytime i use those clips i have to straighten out the line, so i dont like that.</li>
            <li>I have A LOT of hair, but its medium to fine.</li>
            <li>After purchasing/returning 4 sets of hot rollers, I have finally found the perfect set!  </li>
            <li>After using them for the first time, I received multiple compliments on how shiny my hair was, and best of all, the curls stayed in all day!  </li>
            <li>The product was delivered quickly in fine condition.</li>
            <li>I figured the higher price for this product meant it was better than the many cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li>the flocking is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li>Wish this was available in Hawaii...</li>
            <li>but I finally came across this which had great reviews.</li>
            <li>I have medium length hair and only leave the rollers in for about 10 minutes and the results are great.</li>
            <li>welcome to the future again!</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and bought it, though the rollers are good enough, I just need more heat to hold the curls in my hair, which this set doesnt provide.</li>
            <li>The idea of ceramic (to hold a \\&quot;good\\&quot; heat) and the soft covering so as to not harm your hair seemed like a good paring.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s been a good investment thus far.</li>
            <li>This curler set is high quality, easy to use, with pretty quick heating and great heat distribution.  </li>
            <li>My wife absolutely loves this!!!    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they are better for your hair than the older type.</li>
            <li>I had not used hot rollers in my hair for 15 years and so was very surprised to see these heat up in about a minute and produce very nice body and curls.  </li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and are easy to curl.  </li>
            <li>The sides were slightly hot to the touch but not horrible.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used hot rollers in many years.  </li>
            <li>This roller set should work great for hair with a little wave or more.</li>
            <li>I loved the different sizes offered in this set.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t believe that the rollers just had to be in for five minutes, but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>I tend to switch back and forth - if I want a good curl with lots of body, I use Clairol.  </li>
            <li>they heat up fast (5-10 mins) and if you leave them in for another 10 minutes your hair looks fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved anything related to Conair products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Curlers are cool to the touch.</li>
            <li>, luckily my 99 cent store had Conair clips I picked up and</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>More rollers + smaller amt of hair &#x3D; better curls.   </li>
            <li>what&#x27;s quickly?  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>This heats fairly quickly and has three sizes of rollers.  </li>
            <li>The rollers do not get very hot.</li>
            <li>Because of my hair type I need something that gets very hot.</li>
            <li>The assortment of rollers were great for my long super straight hair.  </li>
            <li>she&#x27;s done a lot of hair with them and hasn&#x27;t asked for a better or new set</li>
            <li>Received theses for a Christmas present and loved them so much, I had to buy them as a gift for someone else!  </li>
            <li>I love the curls which are very soft and shiny looking.  </li>
            <li>The rollers heat up so fast, that if you don&#x27;t stand around and watch for the two mins, they might melt!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve was looking EVERYWHERE for some nice rollers to give me more volume and body in less time</li>
            <li>First time I took it out of the box, I used it on my hair and got volume and some good curls, but I didn&#x27;t put hairspray so understandably my hair fell flat within the hour.</li>
            <li>Set is gentle on my hair and rollers are flocked so they the hair grabs the rollers and stay around them securely.  </li>
            <li>During this time I have my hands free to do everything else to get myself ready.  </li>
            <li>It was definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Its worth to buy it.</li>
            <li>I like them even better than my old ones.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with them, I have chin-length natural curls &amp; they give a nice smoothness &amp; bounce to my mop.</li>
            <li>Love the soft flocked finish on these rollers.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Well this product has come a long way and I am a new proud owner of this unity.  </li>
            <li>The actual placing of the curls is very fast (much more so than a curling iron!)</li>
            <li>I have limited curling experience, but I assume that&#x27;s pretty good for my type of hair.</li>
            <li>The Babyliss doesn&#x27;t grip my hair as well, and does not give as good and as lasting a curl as the old tried and true Clairol set.  </li>
            <li>But was worried if I could style it okay, and look cool at the same time.</li>
            <li>Easy to transport, easy to use and get hot enough for my hair type.</li>
            <li>Last time I bought hot rollers was when they first came out in the early 1970&#x27;s (OK, so I&#x27;m admitting a bit of age!!), purchasing my Clairol Kindness set.</li>
            <li>They then cooled off immediately, so much so that by the time I&#x27;d put two or three in my hair, the rest were almost cool to the touch</li>
            <li>- Rollers heat up super fast: in about two mins in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>Quickly shipped and very well packaged.</li>
            <li>received product very fast without any problems.  </li>
            <li>Although the old set still worked fine (and weren&#x27;t made in China, by the way).  </li>
            <li>The product worked exactly like it said it would do</li>
            <li>but it does n ot heat up as hot as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>When I first tried it out, I wasn&#x27;t 100% with my hair results.</li>
            <li>Having hot rollers take practice and you will become quicker putting them in too.</li>
            <li>Third time I used it, the hair was more neatly sectioned and wound up, the rollers were heating for 15 min</li>
            <li>I read in some reviews that it works great on thick hair-</li>
            <li>\\&quot;This is my first time using hot rollers.</li>
            <li>The rollers got hot in about 5 minutes or so-</li>
            <li>THEY GET SO HOT</li>
            <li>The curlers get hot and they have two types of clips to hold the curlers in.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve never used hot curlers before, but since the xmas party season is upon us, I decided to spend money on these.</li>
            <li>- Rollers are not too hot to burn your fingers.  </li>
            <li>I was hopeful about this set of hot rollers.</li>
            <li>This is my first ever set of heated rollers</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not kidding when they say they heat up fast!  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I use the smaller rollers if I want more curl</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used hot rollers before</li>
            <li>First time I used these, they burned my scalp, but I think it was the inept way I put them in.  </li>
            <li>And still when I was done, I had to redo the first set.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that the smaller the roller, the better the curl stayed.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but a friend recommended I try hot rollers.</li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars if it had fewer of the largest size rollers and more of the two smaller sizes.</li>
            <li>Every once in a while part of a curler is too hot against my ear</li>
            <li>Once the rollers were hot (which did indeed happen</li>
            <li>These are the best curlers I have found for my very thin, very straight hair.</li>
            <li>I figured hot rollers would be a better option, but apparently not.  </li>
            <li>Even though curls dont last long I would have said Babyliss rollers were the best I ever used.........until last week when they melted.  </li>
            <li>It heated up fast and stayed pretty hot.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair that is long and the plastic clips that most hot rollers come with do not stay in place or leave creases along with the curls.  </li>
            <li>such curlers have a ready dot on the top</li>
            <li>I have only ever used the old fashion sets in my life, so it was nice to see that you can put your hair through the slit to hold the ends in and no water is needed to heat up the set.  </li>
            <li>This product helped me very much and easy to use and style my hair in a short time!</li>
            <li>i like these hot rollers, i have been really looking for somthing that doesnt leave that line in your hair.  </li>
            <li>I really like these hot rollers.</li>
            <li>Then I kept meeting women whose whole morning regime was made simpler by hot rollers--</li>
            <li>I really like Babyliss (aka Conair and Jibere) hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>Then I started thinking, I deserve a new set of hot rollers after almost 40 years!  </li>
            <li>If you have a lot of hair you might want to go with same product with more rollers, just a little more money, but worth it.</li>
            <li>These rollers are so easy to use and my curls last!  </li>
            <li>- Rollers have nice soft grey velvet fuzz on them, do not snag hair.</li>
            <li>I may have a perspective different from many users--I am older and have suffered from older versions of hot curlers.  </li>
            <li>I let it heat for 30mins, still I dont get strong curls and my hair falls flat after a while.</li>
            <li>My hair curls very well</li>
            <li>The curls deflated before my eyes as I tried to gently finger through them.</li>
            <li>Another issue is my straight hair.</li>
            <li>THEY REALLY BURN THE SCALP AND DO NOT CURL THE CURL</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a con, and I really wish this thing had an automatic safety turn off feature.</li>
            <li>After much reading of reviews on line, I decided on the Babyliss.  </li>
            <li>They have gentle heat</li>
            <li>so you can see when each roller is ready to use.  </li>
            <li>This is a bummer, considering I basically bought the set for the jumbo curlers, which didn&#x27;t do much of anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>By this time (20 mins or so), my hair is curled and i am ready to go.</li>
            <li>I really like the clips that come with it vs using the pins,</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, works well.</li>
            <li>1) heat the unit much longer than 2 minutes, 2)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The rollers will get much hotter at 10 minutes than at 2--but still not burn your hands if you hold at the edges.</li>
            <li>Seems very durable</li>
            <li>Very please with the results.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t show when the rollers are hot enough, tho it says it heats up quickly?  </li>
            <li>With this new knowledge, I then tried the hot rollers again.</li>
            <li>Pros: Heats up quickly, 3 sizes, strong hold, lasting curls, lots of body, and multiple clip options.     </li>
            <li>I guess I should start off by saying that I have a lot of long, stick straight, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something with more larger curlers, and not as many small.</li>
            <li>- The whole thing is a decent size - not too bulky.</li>
            <li>This is important, since my frizzy, naturally curly hair needs to be straightened first with a flat iron, and that is already a lot of abuse.  </li>
            <li>type of thing is when I  wish they would require all new products to shut off automatically after a certain period.  </li>
            <li>I have always had good luck with hot rollers in the past, especially the one inch size.</li>
            <li>THe various sizes as well is just enough larger, medium and smll.for finer and shorter hair strand; ther eis absoltely no reason in th worlk  THank you for improving onthe product over years, and giving us quality as well as a good price.  </li>
            <li>My only suggestion is that it needs more big rollers.</li>
            <li>Decent price.</li>
            <li>BUT they will be more able to do the job on difficult hair in 10 - 15 minutes than in two.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to send these back because I didn&#x27;t use them enough to make it work my while but love their products.</li>
            <li>If I use an iron, by the time I am on the last strand, the first strand I did is almost straight again, no matter how much hairspray I use.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these and remember to research the lowest price out there.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will purchase again when these quit working.  </li>
            <li>how big the set would be, it&#x27;s actually pretty small which is great if you&#x27;re short on space like I am.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Professional quality at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>but I really like them so far.</li>
            <li>I do a lot of vintage hairstyles that require more work than the the normal everyday style.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the function, doesn&#x27;t seem to be as tiring as curling one curl at a time (I have long fairly thick hair).</li>
            <li>Once again, by the time I was on the second layer, the first layer was straight.  </li>
            <li>leave the curlers in until your hair is cool, and 3) if you can&#x27;t leave them in that long</li>
            <li>- I had to buy some different clips that would actually hold the curlers tight in my hair - but they heat up fast, are easy to roll up, and easy to remove.</li>
            <li>I am investing in myself and redefining who I am at 49, new make up new wardrobe, new longer hair style.  </li>
            <li>and I had to retouch the ends with a regular hot curler.</li>
            <li>So I did some research on the proper method to put hot curlers in and tricks on how not to get the end sticking out.</li>
            <li>Wow what a difference!</li>
            <li>Finally hot rollers that actually work!!!    </li>
            <li>Hot curlers or sleeping in foam curlers are the only way to get my hair to hold a curl.</li>
            <li>Next time, I will use these hot rollers when my hair is damp.</li>
            <li>It was not perfect, but given that it was my first time using hot rollers, I was satisfied.</li>
            <li>I think each one should have an indicator, with different color gradings, so you can tell how hot they each are.</li>
            <li>My hair seems a bit bushy when they first come out, but overall the Babyliss Pro functions like it should.</li>
            <li>, I still like my old ones!  </li>
            <li>The clips provided are excellent to hold them in place, but the pins are difficult to use due to the slits in each side of the roller itself.</li>
            <li>in other words, make sure you have lotsa room for storing the big clunky heater and the clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>quickly),the rollers and roller pens were simply too hot to hold.  </li>
            <li>The 12-roller set has as many rollers as I need since I use only the largest rollers, and I bought an extra pack of these to replace some of the smaller ones.  </li>
            <li>I had to do them in sets of three: putting them in, waiting until they cool, putting them back in the case to heat up again and then on to the next layer.  </li>
            <li>but I am not very good with using them to curl my hair, I think I just need more patience and practice.</li>
            <li>then it takes with my old set.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old even asks me to use them on her, because she likes my hair after I&#x27;ve used them.</li>
            <li>but so far no one has contacted me...</li>
            <li>I am the mother of two young children</li>
            <li>Perhaps this will shorten the life of the product--but so far no problem.  </li>
            <li>The biggest downfall is my hair is so thick that I need way more rollers than what is offered in this set.  </li>
            <li>When separating the top half of hair from the bottom half, I use the 3/4\\&quot; rollers for the bottom half of my hair (medium and large rollers are reserved for the top half of my head).</li>
            <li>On the other hand, these heat up so quickly that it&#x27;s not really that much of a bother to stand around for a minute and then turn them off yourself.   </li>
            <li>The whole set up was clearly invented by a male not a female engineer.</li>
            <li>Holding up well but not big enough rollers for longer hair; I would like to see bigger choices in hot rollers.</li>
            <li>I would NOT buy this product unless you have long hair and they should make this VERY CLEAR in the product write-up!</li>
            <li>- Butterfly clips are awfully low quality, but seem to work so far.   </li>
            <li>It heats up fast,  but not hot</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve tried several different brands and it seems like it!</li>
            <li>I was only able to wrap my hair around the medium size one inch rollers approximately 1.5 times and the rollers could NOT be made secured with either the pins or the spider clamps.</li>
            <li>Second time I used it, it was a hot mess.</li>
            <li>- Not sure it&#x27;s all worth 50 bucks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this hot roller set for a few weeks now and use it almost every day.  </li>
            <li>I was slightly hesitant to get these only because I&#x27;ve had so many problems with curlers in the past.</li>
            <li>But if you can arrange your morning schedule to allow for 10 minutes heating up, at least ten minutes in your hair, and at least 5 minutes after carefully taking out the curlers so as not to undo the curl, I think you&#x27;ll be really happy with this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The second and third suggestions are based on the simple notion that if heat makes a curl it will unmake it--in fact some people deliberately comb their hair when a little hot to get softer waves.  </li>
            <li>A few years ago when the big white clips came on the market I again dug out the hot rollers--but still had problems.</li>
            <li>and I have a lot of it, so it&#x27;s not as if I have fine thin hair</li>
            <li>I probably should have used less hair per curler but that would mean I would need about 2 more sets of these.</li>
            <li>But I only have medium length hair - not long enough to wrap around each roller a couple of times - which is absolutely necessary to keep the rollers in place.</li>
            <li>if you have layered hair and having trouble getting the ends to get tucked in the roller, you can use a piece of aluminum or a sheet of toilet paper and fold it over the end of your hair and them wrap your hair onto the hot roller.</li>

            <li> As a barber I put my very good strong seal of approval</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these rollers!  </li>
            <li> I would surely encourage others to buy!</li>

            <li> Glad i purchased the rollers!</li>
            <li> Certaiily better than kiiling my arms every day with my curling iron!</li>
            <li> The heat is excellent, nice and hot and I get the curl I want.  </li>
            <li> My wife says it works great, comfortable, and plenty of rollers and accessories.</li>
            <li> They looked like they&#x27;d be great; rollers came in three sizes and you got both pens (my preference) and clips to secure them.  </li>
            <li> Well they heat up nicely.  </li>
            <li> They heat up evenly and are comfy and make a nice curl.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled with the results once I took them out of my hair.</li>
            <li> and I liked the wire holders and the clamps.</li>
            <li> Still have not settled on the ideal time to turn it on, so it does the job but isn&#x27;t so HOT to the touch.</li>
            <li> The curlers were easy to use and I loved the ability to change from the butterfly clips to the metal clips.    </li>
            <li> It is also very easy to clip the hair into the roller.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell, heats up nicely, light works great, clips are nice, and easy to use without burning your hands.</li>
            <li> I then take them out and boom, soft, beautiful curls!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very gentle on my hair and the curls turn out great.   </li>
            <li> She said it heats up quickly and is easy to use and her hair looks great.      </li>
            <li> This Hair product comes in a nice case with both kinds of clips, it is easy to  pack and take with me</li>
            <li> your hair curls easily, this set would be nice.  </li>
            <li> No problems with order or shipping it came very fast and now I can style my hair without ripping it out or causing heat damage!!!</li>
            <li> The plastic top broke early on, considering I take very good care of things</li>
            <li> and I love the 2 kinds of clips that come with them.  </li>
            <li> I love these curlers.  </li>
            <li> I love that they sent the clips and the pins.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure from the photos</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give them a five instead of a 4 if the clips were better</li>
            <li> The curling iron holds better for me</li>
            <li> I love them...</li>
            <li> and I love them.  </li>
            <li> I love this set.  </li>
            <li> Holds most of the day.  </li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this is that it comes with two types of clips to hold the curler in.</li>
            <li> my hair and these curlers work even better with those.</li>
            <li> I had to take them out of the case to be able to handle them.  </li>
            <li> For some reason, the 12-roller set produces much better, more long-lasting curls than the 20-roller set.  </li>
            <li> I think that the flocked rollers are gentler on my hair than most of the curling iron products.  </li>
            <li> Works perfectly with long fine layered hair!  </li>
            <li> these coils is very quick and easy to put your hair with waves for any event, in just two minutes as fact is a hairdo hairdresser, I am fascinated by them!</li>
            <li> All in all, I love these and would strongly recommend them to friends.</li>
            <li> They warm up quick</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly, have a nice variety of sizes and do not damage color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> but the rollers are soft and of better quality than most store bought rollers, so in all a good product.</li>
            <li> Best money I ever spent.</li>
            <li> I like the plastic clips as they are very easy and quick to.  </li>
            <li> The curlers are of a soft felt like roller with two types of clips which is a very nice feature; there are plenty of each clip for you to use your preference.  </li>
            <li> those have held up better then the original ones.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited about it, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure how to use it because mine did not have directions in the box.</li>
            <li> They are really easy to use and come with both butterfly or metal clips.</li>
            <li> and easy to work into my morning routine.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and give me a lot of body.  </li>
            <li> The velvet flocking makes them easy to roll</li>
            <li> Easy.</li>
            <li> My hair can break easily and these don&#x27;t seem to hurt my hair</li>
            <li> The clips are easy to use and the set stays in.  </li>
            <li> They heat rapidly, stay in well, and give me easy curls without a lot of fuss.  </li>
            <li> It is well made and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> a well made product that is easy to use .</li>
            <li> if i use the metal holders that come with it, it seems to work fine, but anytime i use those clips i have to straighten out the line, so i dont like that.</li>
            <li> I have A LOT of hair, but its medium to fine.</li>
            <li> After purchasing/returning 4 sets of hot rollers, I have finally found the perfect set!  </li>
            <li> After using them for the first time, I received multiple compliments on how shiny my hair was, and best of all, the curls stayed in all day!  </li>
            <li> The product was delivered quickly in fine condition.</li>
            <li> I figured the higher price for this product meant it was better than the many cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li> the flocking is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li> Wish this was available in Hawaii...</li>
            <li> but I finally came across this which had great reviews.</li>
            <li> I have medium length hair and only leave the rollers in for about 10 minutes and the results are great.</li>
            <li> welcome to the future again!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and bought it, though the rollers are good enough, I just need more heat to hold the curls in my hair, which this set doesnt provide.</li>
            <li> The idea of ceramic (to hold a \\&quot;good\\&quot; heat) and the soft covering so as to not harm your hair seemed like a good paring.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s been a good investment thus far.</li>
            <li> This curler set is high quality, easy to use, with pretty quick heating and great heat distribution.  </li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves this!!!    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they are better for your hair than the older type.</li>
            <li> I had not used hot rollers in my hair for 15 years and so was very surprised to see these heat up in about a minute and produce very nice body and curls.  </li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and are easy to curl.  </li>
            <li> The sides were slightly hot to the touch but not horrible.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used hot rollers in many years.  </li>
            <li> This roller set should work great for hair with a little wave or more.</li>
            <li> I loved the different sizes offered in this set.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe that the rollers just had to be in for five minutes, but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> I tend to switch back and forth - if I want a good curl with lots of body, I use Clairol.  </li>
            <li> they heat up fast (5-10 mins) and if you leave them in for another 10 minutes your hair looks fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved anything related to Conair products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Curlers are cool to the touch.</li>
            <li> , luckily my 99 cent store had Conair clips I picked up and</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> More rollers + smaller amt of hair &#x3D; better curls.   </li>
            <li> what&#x27;s quickly?  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> This heats fairly quickly and has three sizes of rollers.  </li>
            <li> The rollers do not get very hot.</li>
            <li> Because of my hair type I need something that gets very hot.</li>
            <li> The assortment of rollers were great for my long super straight hair.  </li>
            <li> she&#x27;s done a lot of hair with them and hasn&#x27;t asked for a better or new set</li>
            <li> Received theses for a Christmas present and loved them so much, I had to buy them as a gift for someone else!  </li>
            <li> I love the curls which are very soft and shiny looking.  </li>
            <li> The rollers heat up so fast, that if you don&#x27;t stand around and watch for the two mins, they might melt!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve was looking EVERYWHERE for some nice rollers to give me more volume and body in less time</li>
            <li> First time I took it out of the box, I used it on my hair and got volume and some good curls, but I didn&#x27;t put hairspray so understandably my hair fell flat within the hour.</li>
            <li> Set is gentle on my hair and rollers are flocked so they the hair grabs the rollers and stay around them securely.  </li>
            <li> During this time I have my hands free to do everything else to get myself ready.  </li>
            <li> It was definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Its worth to buy it.</li>
            <li> I like them even better than my old ones.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with them, I have chin-length natural curls &amp; they give a nice smoothness &amp; bounce to my mop.</li>
            <li> Love the soft flocked finish on these rollers.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Well this product has come a long way and I am a new proud owner of this unity.  </li>
            <li> The actual placing of the curls is very fast (much more so than a curling iron!)</li>
            <li> I have limited curling experience, but I assume that&#x27;s pretty good for my type of hair.</li>
            <li> The Babyliss doesn&#x27;t grip my hair as well, and does not give as good and as lasting a curl as the old tried and true Clairol set.  </li>
            <li> But was worried if I could style it okay, and look cool at the same time.</li>
            <li> Easy to transport, easy to use and get hot enough for my hair type.</li>
            <li> Last time I bought hot rollers was when they first came out in the early 1970&#x27;s (OK, so I&#x27;m admitting a bit of age!!), purchasing my Clairol Kindness set.</li>
            <li> They then cooled off immediately, so much so that by the time I&#x27;d put two or three in my hair, the rest were almost cool to the touch</li>
            <li> - Rollers heat up super fast: in about two mins in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Quickly shipped and very well packaged.</li>
            <li> received product very fast without any problems.  </li>
            <li> Although the old set still worked fine (and weren&#x27;t made in China, by the way).  </li>
            <li> The product worked exactly like it said it would do</li>
            <li> but it does n ot heat up as hot as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> When I first tried it out, I wasn&#x27;t 100% with my hair results.</li>
            <li> Having hot rollers take practice and you will become quicker putting them in too.</li>
            <li> Third time I used it, the hair was more neatly sectioned and wound up, the rollers were heating for 15 min</li>
            <li> I read in some reviews that it works great on thick hair-</li>
            <li> \\&quot;This is my first time using hot rollers.</li>
            <li> The rollers got hot in about 5 minutes or so-</li>
            <li> THEY GET SO HOT</li>
            <li> The curlers get hot and they have two types of clips to hold the curlers in.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve never used hot curlers before, but since the xmas party season is upon us, I decided to spend money on these.</li>
            <li> - Rollers are not too hot to burn your fingers.  </li>
            <li> I was hopeful about this set of hot rollers.</li>
            <li> This is my first ever set of heated rollers</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not kidding when they say they heat up fast!  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I use the smaller rollers if I want more curl</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used hot rollers before</li>
            <li> First time I used these, they burned my scalp, but I think it was the inept way I put them in.  </li>
            <li> And still when I was done, I had to redo the first set.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that the smaller the roller, the better the curl stayed.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but a friend recommended I try hot rollers.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars if it had fewer of the largest size rollers and more of the two smaller sizes.</li>
            <li> Every once in a while part of a curler is too hot against my ear</li>
            <li> Once the rollers were hot (which did indeed happen</li>
            <li> These are the best curlers I have found for my very thin, very straight hair.</li>
            <li> I figured hot rollers would be a better option, but apparently not.  </li>
            <li> Even though curls dont last long I would have said Babyliss rollers were the best I ever used.........until last week when they melted.  </li>
            <li> It heated up fast and stayed pretty hot.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair that is long and the plastic clips that most hot rollers come with do not stay in place or leave creases along with the curls.  </li>
            <li> such curlers have a ready dot on the top</li>
            <li> I have only ever used the old fashion sets in my life, so it was nice to see that you can put your hair through the slit to hold the ends in and no water is needed to heat up the set.  </li>
            <li> This product helped me very much and easy to use and style my hair in a short time!</li>
            <li> i like these hot rollers, i have been really looking for somthing that doesnt leave that line in your hair.  </li>
            <li> I really like these hot rollers.</li>
            <li> Then I kept meeting women whose whole morning regime was made simpler by hot rollers--</li>
            <li> I really like Babyliss (aka Conair and Jibere) hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> Then I started thinking, I deserve a new set of hot rollers after almost 40 years!  </li>
            <li> If you have a lot of hair you might want to go with same product with more rollers, just a little more money, but worth it.</li>
            <li> These rollers are so easy to use and my curls last!  </li>
            <li> - Rollers have nice soft grey velvet fuzz on them, do not snag hair.</li>
            <li> I may have a perspective different from many users--I am older and have suffered from older versions of hot curlers.  </li>
            <li> I let it heat for 30mins, still I dont get strong curls and my hair falls flat after a while.</li>
            <li> My hair curls very well</li>
            <li> The curls deflated before my eyes as I tried to gently finger through them.</li>
            <li> Another issue is my straight hair.</li>
            <li> THEY REALLY BURN THE SCALP AND DO NOT CURL THE CURL</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a con, and I really wish this thing had an automatic safety turn off feature.</li>
            <li> After much reading of reviews on line, I decided on the Babyliss.  </li>
            <li> They have gentle heat</li>
            <li> so you can see when each roller is ready to use.  </li>
            <li> This is a bummer, considering I basically bought the set for the jumbo curlers, which didn&#x27;t do much of anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By this time (20 mins or so), my hair is curled and i am ready to go.</li>
            <li> I really like the clips that come with it vs using the pins,</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, works well.</li>
            <li> 1) heat the unit much longer than 2 minutes, 2)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The rollers will get much hotter at 10 minutes than at 2--but still not burn your hands if you hold at the edges.</li>
            <li> Seems very durable</li>
            <li> Very please with the results.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t show when the rollers are hot enough, tho it says it heats up quickly?  </li>
            <li> With this new knowledge, I then tried the hot rollers again.</li>
            <li> Pros: Heats up quickly, 3 sizes, strong hold, lasting curls, lots of body, and multiple clip options.     </li>
            <li> I guess I should start off by saying that I have a lot of long, stick straight, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something with more larger curlers, and not as many small.</li>
            <li> - The whole thing is a decent size - not too bulky.</li>
            <li> This is important, since my frizzy, naturally curly hair needs to be straightened first with a flat iron, and that is already a lot of abuse.  </li>
            <li> type of thing is when I  wish they would require all new products to shut off automatically after a certain period.  </li>
            <li> I have always had good luck with hot rollers in the past, especially the one inch size.</li>
            <li> THe various sizes as well is just enough larger, medium and smll.for finer and shorter hair strand; ther eis absoltely no reason in th worlk  THank you for improving onthe product over years, and giving us quality as well as a good price.  </li>
            <li> My only suggestion is that it needs more big rollers.</li>
            <li> Decent price.</li>
            <li> BUT they will be more able to do the job on difficult hair in 10 - 15 minutes than in two.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to send these back because I didn&#x27;t use them enough to make it work my while but love their products.</li>
            <li> If I use an iron, by the time I am on the last strand, the first strand I did is almost straight again, no matter how much hairspray I use.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these and remember to research the lowest price out there.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and will purchase again when these quit working.  </li>
            <li> how big the set would be, it&#x27;s actually pretty small which is great if you&#x27;re short on space like I am.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Professional quality at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> but I really like them so far.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of vintage hairstyles that require more work than the the normal everyday style.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the function, doesn&#x27;t seem to be as tiring as curling one curl at a time (I have long fairly thick hair).</li>
            <li> Once again, by the time I was on the second layer, the first layer was straight.  </li>
            <li> leave the curlers in until your hair is cool, and 3) if you can&#x27;t leave them in that long</li>
            <li> - I had to buy some different clips that would actually hold the curlers tight in my hair - but they heat up fast, are easy to roll up, and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I am investing in myself and redefining who I am at 49, new make up new wardrobe, new longer hair style.  </li>
            <li> and I had to retouch the ends with a regular hot curler.</li>
            <li> So I did some research on the proper method to put hot curlers in and tricks on how not to get the end sticking out.</li>
            <li> Wow what a difference!</li>
            <li> Finally hot rollers that actually work!!!    </li>
            <li> Hot curlers or sleeping in foam curlers are the only way to get my hair to hold a curl.</li>
            <li> Next time, I will use these hot rollers when my hair is damp.</li>
            <li> It was not perfect, but given that it was my first time using hot rollers, I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> I think each one should have an indicator, with different color gradings, so you can tell how hot they each are.</li>
            <li> My hair seems a bit bushy when they first come out, but overall the Babyliss Pro functions like it should.</li>
            <li> , I still like my old ones!  </li>
            <li> The clips provided are excellent to hold them in place, but the pins are difficult to use due to the slits in each side of the roller itself.</li>
            <li> in other words, make sure you have lotsa room for storing the big clunky heater and the clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> quickly),the rollers and roller pens were simply too hot to hold.  </li>
            <li> The 12-roller set has as many rollers as I need since I use only the largest rollers, and I bought an extra pack of these to replace some of the smaller ones.  </li>
            <li> I had to do them in sets of three: putting them in, waiting until they cool, putting them back in the case to heat up again and then on to the next layer.  </li>
            <li> but I am not very good with using them to curl my hair, I think I just need more patience and practice.</li>
            <li> then it takes with my old set.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old even asks me to use them on her, because she likes my hair after I&#x27;ve used them.</li>
            <li> but so far no one has contacted me...</li>
            <li> I am the mother of two young children</li>
            <li> Perhaps this will shorten the life of the product--but so far no problem.  </li>
            <li> The biggest downfall is my hair is so thick that I need way more rollers than what is offered in this set.  </li>
            <li> When separating the top half of hair from the bottom half, I use the 3/4\\&quot; rollers for the bottom half of my hair (medium and large rollers are reserved for the top half of my head).</li>
            <li> On the other hand, these heat up so quickly that it&#x27;s not really that much of a bother to stand around for a minute and then turn them off yourself.   </li>
            <li> The whole set up was clearly invented by a male not a female engineer.</li>
            <li> Holding up well but not big enough rollers for longer hair; I would like to see bigger choices in hot rollers.</li>
            <li> I would NOT buy this product unless you have long hair and they should make this VERY CLEAR in the product write-up!</li>
            <li> - Butterfly clips are awfully low quality, but seem to work so far.   </li>
            <li> It heats up fast,  but not hot</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve tried several different brands and it seems like it!</li>
            <li> I was only able to wrap my hair around the medium size one inch rollers approximately 1.5 times and the rollers could NOT be made secured with either the pins or the spider clamps.</li>
            <li> Second time I used it, it was a hot mess.</li>
            <li> - Not sure it&#x27;s all worth 50 bucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hot roller set for a few weeks now and use it almost every day.  </li>
            <li> I was slightly hesitant to get these only because I&#x27;ve had so many problems with curlers in the past.</li>
            <li> But if you can arrange your morning schedule to allow for 10 minutes heating up, at least ten minutes in your hair, and at least 5 minutes after carefully taking out the curlers so as not to undo the curl, I think you&#x27;ll be really happy with this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The second and third suggestions are based on the simple notion that if heat makes a curl it will unmake it--in fact some people deliberately comb their hair when a little hot to get softer waves.  </li>
            <li> A few years ago when the big white clips came on the market I again dug out the hot rollers--but still had problems.</li>
            <li> and I have a lot of it, so it&#x27;s not as if I have fine thin hair</li>
            <li> I probably should have used less hair per curler but that would mean I would need about 2 more sets of these.</li>
            <li> But I only have medium length hair - not long enough to wrap around each roller a couple of times - which is absolutely necessary to keep the rollers in place.</li>
            <li> if you have layered hair and having trouble getting the ends to get tucked in the roller, you can use a piece of aluminum or a sheet of toilet paper and fold it over the end of your hair and them wrap your hair onto the hot roller.</li>
            <li> As an African American woman, it&#x27;s hard to find the right heated roller set</li>
            <li> Hopefully they will last as long as the very similar Conair brand (no longer manufactured)</li>
            <li> Thinking she may not have left them in long enough</li>
            <li> I have long blonde hair (past shoulders), thick and never holds a curl for more than an hour.</li>
            <li> I then style my hair and slightly spray them with my victorias secret so sexy hair spray.</li>
            <li> I gave up my flat iron and use these rollers instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried curling irons and flat irons to curl my hair but didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The curls are long lasting</li>
            <li> - These should be pink, not grey colored.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, and it takes about 30 min.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t take long at all to heat up either.</li>
            <li> It was a long process</li>
            <li> I try to leave them on as long as I can.</li>
            <li> I too tried it out in my hair ( we both have long hair)</li>
            <li> I waited to long to return</li>
            <li> I have thick straight hair.</li>
            <li> I had worried about purchasing them especially online, but after reading all of the other reviews, I decided to give it a try...</li>
            <li> (If I could have purchased smaller rollers for the other, I would have.)  </li>
            <li> I also have long, fake blonde hair extensions I put in from time to time to do something fun with</li>
            <li> I then roll them up in my dry hair and let them sit while I feed the animals and put my makeup on.</li>
            <li> - You can tell because the red dot on the one indicator roller turns dark.  </li>
            <li> What worries me now if anyone of us women were to burn our houses down because the rollers were accidentally left</li>
            <li> curl out in 3-4 hours, and i left the rollers in for about a half hour, hoping that would help keep a curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I want this product to work so badly, I am going to do more trial runs.</li>
            <li> (I suspect the unit was at least 30 years old).</li>
            <li> am disapointed as I researched this item carefully</li>
            <li> Butterfly clips can break easily, be careful.     </li>
            <li> If I divide my hair by 6, each section would be 2- 2 1/2\\&quot; wide.</li>
            <li> the directions didn&#x27;t say anything except it heats up quickly, not much else.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The instructions stated that they should be left in for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I have only used these rollers a few times....</li>
            <li> Does anyone know if I can I heat the rollers with the lid closed or not?</li>
            <li> However the rollers worked well, heated up quickly, never made my hair look dry or brittle.  </li>
            <li> A little on the pricey side, but the quality may out weigh that in the long term.</li>
            <li> other past rollers have left.  </li>
            <li> I read reviews on here and other beauty sites</li>
            <li> I took a star off because of the lack of safety features and another one off because I cannot offer comparison to other sets, and this did not blow my socks off.   </li>
            <li> Have not tested other sockets.   </li>
            <li> Other sets I would have had to set some hair, then wait, reheat and set the rest of my hair.  </li>
            <li> They heat up rapidly and are not hot to the touch.</li>
            <li> Whoever said that, obviously does not have thick hair.</li>
            <li> Previous product had teeth which made it easier to use on shorter hair.</li>
            <li> and I think the rollers are less harsh than using curling irons.</li>
            <li> I was a little rushed, so my hair was not neatly wound with the curler.</li>
            <li> She uses it almost everyday.  </li>
            <li> Posting this today is to confirm what a few others are saying.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve used this a few times already</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re having trouble with thecurl staying, that approach isn&#x27;t for you.  </li>
            <li> The original plastic clips were crap they broke at the hinge</li>
            <li> I remember my mother using the older 70&#x27;s version, they were awkward, bulky and the clips always broke.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I will keep these or give them to my niece who is 9.</li>
            <li> The 20 piece set gives 6 of these small rollers.</li>
            <li> I use the butterfly clips (not sure what they&#x27;re called) and ive had zero issues with it.</li>
            <li> so I was worried this would be hard for me.</li>
            <li> Lately I have been using a curling iron and, after years, decided to give the rollers a try.  </li>
            <li> I believe I&#x27;m having issues with this because of my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just because I have unusually thick hair, but my curls held for maybe 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> A perm with my thick hair will make me look at a poodle.</li>
            <li> THEY CAN CAUSE A SERIOUS BURN TO THE SCALP.</li>
            <li> I gave them up long ago because the pins wouldn&#x27;t hold the rollers in the positions I wanted and they burnt my fingers and my scalp badly as well.  </li>
            <li> Mine is very thick and holds a curl well.  </li>
            <li> I was not happy.  </li>
            <li> I hate to single out Babyliss</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so difficult to wind the ends of my hair to the curler because when I try, the ends stick out everywhere.</li>
            <li> It was difficult finding a set that included u-shaped fasteners rather than clips</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about buying something like this online.</li>
            <li> I use them when I&#x27;m in a pinch, need a change or having a bad hair day-</li>
            <li> I wish they&#x27;d put in a bag or something for the plastic clips though, they come on cardboard strips &amp; it&#x27;s annoying to have to arrange them &#x27;</li>
            <li> Very ugly and functional.</li>

            <li> I loved the different sizes offered in this set. It heated up fast and stayed pretty hot. Overall I would buy this again!</li>
            <li> received product very fast without any problems.  I would order again from this company store. The product worked exactly like it said it would do</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these rollers!  I had worried about purchasing them especially online, but after reading all of the other reviews, I decided to give it a try... It was definitely worth the money.  They are incredible!  I have been recommending them all to my friends.. I would surely encourage others to buy!</li>
            <li> I was so looking forward to getting these.  I read all the reviews and thought it would be a great buy.  Well they heat up nicely.  They stay in well.  The biggest downfall is my hair is so thick that I need way more rollers than what is offered in this set.  I am probably going to have to buy another set just for my hair. The plastic clips also leave really big dints in your hair.  The curl does last but I have never had a problem with curls staying my hair.  Not sure if I will keep these or give them to my niece who is 9.</li>
            <li> This Hair product comes in a nice case with both kinds of clips, it is easy to  pack and take with me&lt;br /&gt;I do like the on and off switch on this unit.&lt;br /&gt;I am disapointed as I researched this item carefully and it seemed to get  good reviews on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the rollers as well  but it does n ot heat up as hot as I thought it would.  It heats up fast,  but not hot&lt;br /&gt;like I would like.</li>
            <li> I did some research and finally decided on this set. When I first tried it out, I wasn&#x27;t 100% with my hair results. The back of my hair didn&#x27;t come out curly and I had to retouch the ends with a regular hot curler. So I did some research on the proper method to put hot curlers in and tricks on how not to get the end sticking out. With this new knowledge, I then tried the hot rollers again. I let it heat up for a good 15 minutes and then I let the rollers stay in my hair for 20 mins. Wow what a difference! My hair came out great. Also a tip if you have layered hair and having trouble getting the ends to get tucked in the roller, you can use a piece of aluminum or a sheet of toilet paper and fold it over the end of your hair and them wrap your hair onto the hot roller. Having hot rollers take practice and you will become quicker putting them in too. I highly recommend these and remember to research the lowest price out there.</li>
            <li> i like these hot rollers, i have been really looking for somthing that doesnt leave that line in your hair.  if i use the metal holders that come with it, it seems to work fine, but anytime i use those clips i have to straighten out the line, so i dont like that. but the rollers are soft and of better quality than most store bought rollers, so in all a good product.</li>
            <li> Finally hot rollers that actually work!!!    I do a lot of vintage hairstyles that require more work than the the normal everyday style. I&#x27;ve was looking EVERYWHERE for some nice rollers to give me more volume and body in less time then it takes with my old set. I was slightly hesitant to get these only because I&#x27;ve had so many problems with curlers in the past. I have A LOT of hair, but its medium to fine. Hot curlers or sleeping in foam curlers are the only way to get my hair to hold a curl. These curlers do not disappoint. Best purchase ever!! The curlers were easy to use and I loved the ability to change from the butterfly clips to the metal clips.    Pros: Heats up quickly, 3 sizes, strong hold, lasting curls, lots of body, and multiple clip options.     Cons: Butterfly clips can break easily, be careful.     All in all, I love these and would strongly recommend them to friends. Professional quality at a reasonable price. Thanks Babyliss! &lt;3</li>
            <li> Doesnt heat up enough for my long,straight hair. I read the reviews and bought it, though the rollers are good enough, I just need more heat to hold the curls in my hair, which this set doesnt provide. I let it heat for 30mins, still I dont get strong curls and my hair falls flat after a while. Oh well, I&#x27;ll keep using it till I find the perfect rollers set for my hair. This roller set should work great for hair with a little wave or more.</li>
            <li> Best result I have ever seen, got so many compliments. Its worth to buy it. I would recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> these coils is very quick and easy to put your hair with waves for any event, in just two minutes as fact is a hairdo hairdresser, I am fascinated by them!</li>
            <li> Received theses for a Christmas present and loved them so much, I had to buy them as a gift for someone else!  They warm up quick and I love the 2 kinds of clips that come with them.  They don&#x27;t put kinks in your hair as they heat up your stands of hair either unlike other past rollers have left.  Ceramic is the way to go!  I would definitely recommend them to others!</li>
            <li> Two words... Perfect and perfect!  The rollers never burn my scalp or hair and the metal clips are the best!  I have a lot of hair that is long and the plastic clips that most hot rollers come with do not stay in place or leave creases along with the curls.  I highly recommend this product and will purchase again when these quit working.  Hopefully they will last as long as the very similar Conair brand (no longer manufactured) I used to buy.  Wish this was available in Hawaii...</li>
            <li> Love the curlers!  Best I&#x27;ve used!  My hair curls very well and that&#x27;s without using product.  It is also very easy to clip the hair into the roller.</li>
            <li> These are great rollers. They heat up evenly and are comfy and make a nice curl. I just wish the curls lasted longer. But maybe all rollers have that problem. So far I&#x27;ve tried several different brands and it seems like it!</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves this!!!    She uses it almost everyday.  She said it heats up quickly and is easy to use and her hair looks great.      Perfect...</li>
            <li> These rollers retail for almost twice what I paid here on amazon. They are really easy to use and come with both butterfly or metal clips. I didn&#x27;t believe that the rollers just had to be in for five minutes, but it&#x27;s true. I gave up my flat iron and use these rollers instead. Great buy.</li>
            <li> These are the best curlers I have found for my very thin, very straight hair. It looks beautiful but falls after about 4-5 hours. I have limited curling experience, but I assume that&#x27;s pretty good for my type of hair. The actual placing of the curls is very fast (much more so than a curling iron!) and easy to work into my morning routine.</li>
            <li> I love these curlers.  They are easy to use and give me a lot of body.  My 4 year old even asks me to use them on her, because she likes my hair after I&#x27;ve used them.</li>
            <li> After purchasing/returning 4 sets of hot rollers, I have finally found the perfect set!  Works perfectly with long fine layered hair!  After using them for the first time, I received multiple compliments on how shiny my hair was, and best of all, the curls stayed in all day!  Love these rollers!</li>
            <li> Ladies for 2 years these rollers worked fairly well.  The plastic top broke early on, considering I take very good care of things I was not happy.  However the rollers worked well, heated up quickly, never made my hair look dry or brittle.  The original plastic clips were crap they broke at the hinge and I think I have about 4 left, luckily my 99 cent store had Conair clips I picked up and those have held up better then the original ones.  The assortment of rollers were great for my long super straight hair.  Even though curls dont last long I would have said Babyliss rollers were the best I ever used.........until last week when they melted.  I turned them on went to my bathroom to shower and about 30 minutes later walked into my dressing room and went to grab a roller but couldn&#x27;t get my fingers around them to pull one out.  Then I noticed a burning plastic smell, and after some prying pulled one or two out to find the bottom edges melted.  What worries me now if anyone of us women were to burn our houses down because the rollers were accidentally left on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This type of thing is when I  wish they would require all new products to shut off automatically after a certain period.  I knew these things happened but I always figured it took hours or a freak accident.  Posting this today is to confirm what a few others are saying.  Hopefully it doesnt take loss of life for something to be done.  I hate to single out Babyliss but this not acceptable to me.</li>
            <li> I just want to start by saying I did my research before purchasing this product. I read reviews on here and other beauty sites and I watched tutorials. So I&#x27;ve used this a few times already and I have mixed feelings. First time I took it out of the box, I used it on my hair and got volume and some good curls, but I didn&#x27;t put hairspray so understandably my hair fell flat within the hour. Second time I used it, it was a hot mess. I was a little rushed, so my hair was not neatly wound with the curler. It was heating up 10 min and I left them in for 10 min. After taking out the curlers, I misted with hairspray all over. The curls deflated before my eyes as I tried to gently finger through them. Third time I used it, the hair was more neatly sectioned and wound up, the rollers were heating for 15 min and I left them in my hair for 15 min. No improvement from the 2nd time. I believe I&#x27;m having issues with this because of my thick hair. I read in some reviews that it works great on thick hair- no it doesn&#x27;t. Whoever said that, obviously does not have thick hair. My hair is medium length- about 4\\&quot; below the shoulder. When separating the top half of hair from the bottom half, I use the 3/4\\&quot; rollers for the bottom half of my hair (medium and large rollers are reserved for the top half of my head). The 20 piece set gives 6 of these small rollers. If I divide my hair by 6, each section would be 2- 2 1/2\\&quot; wide. To get good curls, hair sections should be +/- 1\\&quot; for small/medium curlers. Another issue is my straight hair. It&#x27;s so difficult to wind the ends of my hair to the curler because when I try, the ends stick out everywhere. I&#x27;ve tried curling irons and flat irons to curl my hair but didn&#x27;t work. I want this product to work so badly, I am going to do more trial runs. Next time, I will use these hot rollers when my hair is damp. For another time, I will try switching my hairspray.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered quickly in fine condition. Heats up quickly. Still have not settled on the ideal time to turn it on, so it does the job but isn&#x27;t so HOT to the touch. Previous product had teeth which made it easier to use on shorter hair.</li>
            <li> The rollers do not get very hot. I have long hair, and it takes about 30 min. to get any type of curl. I&#x27;m sure they are better for your hair than the older type.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;This is my first time using hot rollers. I have to say it turned out great. I love that they sent the clips and the pins. The on/off switch is very handy. The rollers got hot in about 5 minutes or so- the red dot turned white. The sides were slightly hot to the touch but not horrible. I was thrilled with the results once I took them out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I WANTED THESE TO WORK BUT NO SUCH LUCK. THEY REALLY BURN THE SCALP AND DO NOT CURL THE CURL AS I WAS EXPECTING THEM TO. I WILL STICK TO MY CURLING IRON. THEY GET SO HOT THEY CAN CAUSE A SERIOUS BURN TO THE SCALP.</li>
            <li> I had a set of curlers that lasted for about 20 years but finally gave out, so I looked around and decided on these.  I like them even better than my old ones.  The curlers get hot and they have two types of clips to hold the curlers in.  There is a variety of sizes of the rollers, also.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure from the photos how big the set would be, it&#x27;s actually pretty small which is great if you&#x27;re short on space like I am.  They curlers themselves work well- the flocking is a huge plus.  I wish they&#x27;d put in a bag or something for the plastic clips though, they come on cardboard strips &amp; it&#x27;s annoying to have to arrange them &#x27;just so&#x27; after each use.  Overall I am pleased with them, I have chin-length natural curls &amp; they give a nice smoothness &amp; bounce to my mop.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve never used hot curlers before, but since the xmas party season is upon us, I decided to spend money on these. I did my research and these got the best reviews on Amazon. I was looking for something that works and that is within the $50 price range. The sets I&#x27;ve seen in places like Target can be more expensive. I took a star off because of the lack of safety features and another one off because I cannot offer comparison to other sets, and this did not blow my socks off.   Pros:  - Does the job and curls the hair. It was not perfect, but given that it was my first time using hot rollers, I was satisfied. I have thick straight hair. More rollers + smaller amt of hair &#x3D; better curls.   - Rollers heat up super fast: in about two mins in my bathroom. Have not tested other sockets.   - You can tell because the red dot on the one indicator roller turns dark.  - Rollers have nice soft grey velvet fuzz on them, do not snag hair. They have a groove, but this did not prevent even rolling of hair.   - Rollers are not too hot to burn your fingers.  - You get enough rollers to do your entire head (medium length hair in my case.) They come in 3 sizes.    - You also get 20 butterfly clips and 20 pins, pins of various sizes. Pins are good quality.   - There are two holes in which to store the pins.   - The whole thing is a decent size - not too bulky. But you cannot travel with this.   - There is an on/off switch.  Cons:  - You need to turn these off manually. The rollers heat up so fast, that if you don&#x27;t stand around and watch for the two mins, they might melt!! I basically turned them off when I got a hint of the \\&quot;plastic might burn soon\\&quot; smell. This is either a pro or con. Safety wise it&#x27;s a con, and I really wish this thing had an automatic safety turn off feature. On the other hand, these heat up so quickly that it&#x27;s not really that much of a bother to stand around for a minute and then turn them off yourself.   - The heat indicator dot is only on one roller. Why not all of them? How can you tell all of them are evenly heated?? It takes time to roll your hair, especially if you&#x27;re not too practiced at it. So I actually ended up reheating the rollers halfway through doing my hair, because I was not sure if all the rollers were still hot enough. I think each one should have an indicator, with different color gradings, so you can tell how hot they each are. C&#x27;mon - if the ironing and waxing engineers can come up with a solution, why not the roller guys?  - Butterfly clips are awfully low quality, but seem to work so far.   - These should be pink, not grey colored. In fact, there is nothing purple about this like in the picture. Very ugly and functional. The whole set up was clearly invented by a male not a female engineer. When will female engineers start getting employed in companies that make for-female-only products???   - Not sure it&#x27;s all worth 50 bucks. But it works and I don&#x27;t have time to run around the stores doing research. So they are keepers for the moment.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful about this set of hot rollers. The idea of ceramic (to hold a \\&quot;good\\&quot; heat) and the soft covering so as to not harm your hair seemed like a good paring. But I only have medium length hair - not long enough to wrap around each roller a couple of times - which is absolutely necessary to keep the rollers in place. I was only able to wrap my hair around the medium size one inch rollers approximately 1.5 times and the rollers could NOT be made secured with either the pins or the spider clamps. My hair is of medium coarseness and I have a lot of it, so it&#x27;s not as if I have fine thin hair, This should have worked for me given the way they advertise this product. The roller just fell out every time. I have always had good luck with hot rollers in the past, especially the one inch size. I would NOT buy this product unless you have long hair and they should make this VERY CLEAR in the product write-up! I have been asking to return this item but so far no one has contacted me... So beware if you are thinking you can return it if it does not work for you!</li>
            <li> These curlers work great.  I&#x27;d give them a five instead of a 4 if the clips were better - I had to buy some different clips that would actually hold the curlers tight in my hair - but they heat up fast, are easy to roll up, and easy to remove. My hair looks great after using them.</li>
            <li> This curler set is high quality, easy to use, with pretty quick heating and great heat distribution.  I use them when I&#x27;m in a pinch, need a change or having a bad hair day- always glad I purchased them!</li>
            <li> I let my hair grow out after years of wearing it short. But was worried if I could style it okay, and look cool at the same time. With this set all is possible. If you have a lot of hair you might want to go with same product with more rollers, just a little more money, but worth it.</li>
            <li> My mom used to wear these, so I wanted to give them a try. I have multiple curling irons. I&#x27;m happy with the function, doesn&#x27;t seem to be as tiring as curling one curl at a time (I have long fairly thick hair). The product itself is great. Doesn&#x27;t smell, heats up nicely, light works great, clips are nice, and easy to use without burning your hands. My hair seems a bit bushy when they first come out, but overall the Babyliss Pro functions like it should.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this maybe three or four times, my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curls well so I was hoping this would help. The curls from this last maybe an hour. The curling iron holds better for me</li>
            <li> This product helped me very much and easy to use and style my hair in a short time! Where ever I go, I&#x27;ll take it with me and I loved it...</li>
            <li> Last time I bought hot rollers was when they first came out in the early 1970&#x27;s (OK, so I&#x27;m admitting a bit of age!!), purchasing my Clairol Kindness set. Lately I have been using a curling iron and, after years, decided to give the rollers a try.  Then I started thinking, I deserve a new set of hot rollers after almost 40 years!  Although the old set still worked fine (and weren&#x27;t made in China, by the way).  After much reading of reviews on line, I decided on the Babyliss.  All I can say is, I still like my old ones!  The Babyliss doesn&#x27;t grip my hair as well, and does not give as good and as lasting a curl as the old tried and true Clairol set.  I tend to switch back and forth - if I want a good curl with lots of body, I use Clairol.  Just because I&#x27;m stubborn I pull out the Babyliss hoping it will finally give me the same quality curl - but I haven&#x27;t seen it yet!</li>
            <li> These make my hair look amazing! I love them...they heat up fast (5-10 mins) and if you leave them in for another 10 minutes your hair looks fantastic!</li>
            <li> I really like these hot rollers. The velvet flocking makes them easy to roll and I liked the wire holders and the clamps. They have gentle heat so they dont burn my fingers or hair. They don&#x27;t take long at all to heat up either.</li>
            <li> This is my first ever set of heated rollers and I love them.  They&#x27;re not kidding when they say they heat up fast!  They&#x27;re very gentle on my hair and the curls turn out great.   The clips provided are excellent to hold them in place, but the pins are difficult to use due to the slits in each side of the roller itself.</li>
            <li> This product is great and I use it almost weekly. My only suggestion is that it needs more big rollers.</li>
            <li> Love the soft flocked finish on these rollers.  They heat up quickly, have a nice variety of sizes and do not damage color treated hair.  A little on the pricey side, but the quality may out weigh that in the long term.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and is the perfect size to have on the bathroom counter or to travel with.  Beautiful hair in minutes!!!</li>
            <li> I love this set.  I was looking for set that had the number of rollers I needed.  Other sets I would have had to set some hair, then wait, reheat and set the rest of my hair.  The heat is excellent, nice and hot and I get the curl I want.  Sometimes I use the smaller rollers if I want more curl or I use the larger ones for body.  Holds most of the day.  Would definitely recommend buying to anyone who is looking.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002NGMEQC BaByliss Pro BABCHV21 Ceramic Instant Heat 20-Roller Set, Varied]]  No problems with order or shipping it came very fast and now I can style my hair without ripping it out or causing heat damage!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hot roller set for a few weeks now and use it almost every day.  I had not used hot rollers in my hair for 15 years and so was very surprised to see these heat up in about a minute and produce very nice body and curls.  Set is gentle on my hair and rollers are flocked so they the hair grabs the rollers and stay around them securely.  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> i have shoulder length hair, and had to use all 20 rollers.  it doesn&#x27;t show when the rollers are hot enough, tho it says it heats up quickly?  what&#x27;s quickly?  4 minutes, or one hour?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there is no place for the plastic clips, so you need a showcap or something to hold the plastic clips.  in other words, make sure you have lotsa room for storing the big clunky heater and the clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i got a perm, thinking it would hold the curl longer, but it&#x27;s still the same.  curl out in 3-4 hours, and i left the rollers in for about a half hour, hoping that would help keep a curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other such curlers have a ready dot on the top so you can see when each roller is ready to use.  the directions didn&#x27;t say anything except it heats up quickly, not much else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;see photo of all the clips you need to store somewhere.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about buying something like this online. I read review after review after review for every heat roller on amazon. It was a long process but I finally came across this which had great reviews. I wanted something with more larger curlers, and not as many small. This has it all which was great.  My favorite thing about this is that it comes with two types of clips to hold the curler in. I use the butterfly clips (not sure what they&#x27;re called) and ive had zero issues with it. If you use them properly, you won&#x27;t have marks in your hair. I haven&#x27;t had one in my hair yet.  I have long blonde hair (past shoulders), thick and never holds a curl for more than an hour. Because of my hair type I need something that gets very hot. These do! But I haven&#x27;t burnt myself yet on them. I&#x27;ve never used hot rollers before so I was worried this would be hard for me. Found this to actually be very easy! I let these rollers heat up while I rinse off in the shower and while I get my clothes on, so maybe 20 minutes. I then roll them up in my dry hair and let them sit while I feed the animals and put my makeup on. I try to leave them on as long as I can. I then take them out and boom, soft, beautiful curls! Easy. I then style my hair and slightly spray them with my victorias secret so sexy hair spray. My hair can break easily and these don&#x27;t seem to hurt my hair what so ever.  I like how it has a place on both sides for the metal clips as well. I also have long, fake blonde hair extensions I put in from time to time to do something fun with my hair and these curlers work even better with those. Doesn&#x27;t burn or damage my hair nor the extensions. Would recommend to others! Well worth the money.  ps.Quickly shipped and very well packaged. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used hot rollers in many years.  First time I used these, they burned my scalp, but I think it was the inept way I put them in.  I like the quality and sizes of these rollers.  Lid is attached and you get both types of  clips, the butterfly and the metal pins.</li>
            <li> These are the best hot rollers I&#x27;ve ever used. They heat up rapidly and are not hot to the touch. I have medium length hair and only leave the rollers in for about 10 minutes and the results are great. Great value for the money.</li>
            <li> I guess I should start off by saying that I have a lot of long, stick straight, fine hair.  I always have issues curling it.  If I use an iron, by the time I am on the last strand, the first strand I did is almost straight again, no matter how much hairspray I use.  I figured hot rollers would be a better option, but apparently not.  The instructions stated that they should be left in for a few minutes.  That didn&#x27;t work.  Once again, by the time I was on the second layer, the first layer was straight.  So I tried leaving them in until they cooled.  That helped a bit, but with the amount of hair I have, there is not enough rollers to do my entire head.  I had to do them in sets of three: putting them in, waiting until they cool, putting them back in the case to heat up again and then on to the next layer.  And still when I was done, I had to redo the first set.  In the end, it took over 2 hours.  I got a lot of compliments but the style didn&#x27;t last through the night.  I have to say that the smaller the roller, the better the curl stayed.  This is a bummer, considering I basically bought the set for the jumbo curlers, which didn&#x27;t do much of anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair curls easily, this set would be nice.  They heat up quickly and are easy to curl.  I have only ever used the old fashion sets in my life, so it was nice to see that you can put your hair through the slit to hold the ends in and no water is needed to heat up the set.  It comes with pens and plastic clips, so you may use whichever you prefer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but a friend recommended I try hot rollers. I am the mother of two young children so look for anything to shave off time in the mornings. I pop in the rollers, get my girls dressed. By this time (20 mins or so), my hair is curled and i am ready to go. The curls are long lasting and I think the rollers are less harsh than using curling irons. Glad i purchased the rollers!</li>
            <li> Theses are great curlers!  Arrived quickly.  Gives great curls.  Good quality.  I&#x27;ve always loved anything related to Conair products.&lt;br /&gt;The felt rollers don&#x27;t damage my hair. What I was looking for.  Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Kathy</li>
            <li> I have only used these rollers a few times....but I really like them so far. I really like the clips that come with it vs using the pins,</li>
            <li> These are great but I am not very good with using them to curl my hair, I think I just need more patience and practice.</li>
            <li> These rollers come in varied sizes and with clips and pins.  The clips are easy to use and the set stays in.  However, they do not heat up enough to provide a lasting curl.  I have been setting my hair daily for over 10 years and have not had a set that doesn&#x27;t leave curl in my hair after an hour.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item for my daughter and it could not even \\&quot;wave\\&quot; her hair. Thinking she may not have left them in long enough I too tried it out in my hair ( we both have long hair) it did not work at all! I waited to long to return so they went in the donation pile.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, works well. Decent price. It was a gift from my husband and I think he made a good choice.</li>
            <li> Although the hot-roller set I had by this company&#x27;s predecessor worked well, with shorter hair I needed a set with smaller rollers.  It was difficult finding a set that included u-shaped fasteners rather than clips (this has both).  (If I could have purchased smaller rollers for the other, I would have.)  This heats fairly quickly and has three sizes of rollers.  I would have given it 5 stars if it had fewer of the largest size rollers and more of the two smaller sizes.</li>
            <li> shipped and arrived on time. follow the directions to the t. I bought this for my girlfriend who is currently going to school to be a hair dresser. she&#x27;s done a lot of hair with them and hasn&#x27;t asked for a better or new set so it&#x27;s been a good investment thus far.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just because I have unusually thick hair, but my curls held for maybe 30 minutes.  I probably should have used less hair per curler but that would mean I would need about 2 more sets of these.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist recommended these heated rollers. As an African American woman, it&#x27;s hard to find the right heated roller set but these are great. Easy to transport, easy to use and get hot enough for my hair type. Excellent investment for me!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and is well worth the money. Warms up while I wash my face. Curls are set by the time I brush my teeth. Curls stay in all day. Curlers are cool to the touch. Pins are great for traveling and butterfly clips are great for home use. I wish I had found this product years ago. Best money I ever spent.</li>
            <li> Hi there, I bought this and I&#x27;m excited about it, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure how to use it because mine did not have directions in the box. Does anyone know if I can I heat the rollers with the lid closed or not?</li>
            <li> I may have a perspective different from many users--I am older and have suffered from older versions of hot curlers.  I gave them up long ago because the pins wouldn&#x27;t hold the rollers in the positions I wanted and they burnt my fingers and my scalp badly as well.  A few years ago when the big white clips came on the market I again dug out the hot rollers--but still had problems. (I suspect the unit was at least 30 years old). Then I kept meeting women whose whole morning regime was made simpler by hot rollers--so I thought I&#x27;d explore the net and found these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my perspective these are the best thing since sliced bread. They heat rapidly, stay in well, and give me easy curls without a lot of fuss.  I don&#x27;t get marks from the big white clips and they stay in the positions I want them to be in.  Every once in a while part of a curler is too hot against my ear so I just put a cotton ball between the curler and the flesh it&#x27;s bothering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that everybody&#x27;s hair is different.  Mine is very thick and holds a curl well.  But I have some suggestions for people who don&#x27;t get good results. 1) heat the unit much longer than 2 minutes, 2) leave the curlers in until your hair is cool, and 3) if you can&#x27;t leave them in that long do not brush your hair after taking out the rollers until your hair is air-cooled (which won&#x27;t be long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rollers will get much hotter at 10 minutes than at 2--but still not burn your hands if you hold at the edges. Perhaps this will shorten the life of the product--but so far no problem.  Of course the laws of physics still apply--they won&#x27;t continue getting hotter until infinity BUT they will be more able to do the job on difficult hair in 10 - 15 minutes than in two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second and third suggestions are based on the simple notion that if heat makes a curl it will unmake it--in fact some people deliberately comb their hair when a little hot to get softer waves.  But if you&#x27;re having trouble with thecurl staying, that approach isn&#x27;t for you.  I do get that having the curlers in longer may lengthen your morning prep--and you may simply not have the time.  But if you can arrange your morning schedule to allow for 10 minutes heating up, at least ten minutes in your hair, and at least 5 minutes after carefully taking out the curlers so as not to undo the curl, I think you&#x27;ll be really happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I got this as a present for my wife and to replace her former roller set which broke. This one has been great and she loves it. Seems very durable had it for over a year and still in great shape. My wife says it works great, comfortable, and plenty of rollers and accessories. No burn marks from use.</li>
            <li> These rollers are so easy to use and my curls last!  Now I have to get a travel size version!</li>
            <li> I made a mistake when I purchased these rollers.  They looked like they&#x27;d be great; rollers came in three sizes and you got both pens (my preference) and clips to secure them.  I figured the higher price for this product meant it was better than the many cheaper alternatives. Unfortunately, I was wrong.  Once the rollers were hot (which did indeed happen quickly),the rollers and roller pens were simply too hot to hold.  I had to take them out of the case to be able to handle them.  They then cooled off immediately, so much so that by the time I&#x27;d put two or three in my hair, the rest were almost cool to the touch and therefore they didn&#x27;t curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like Babyliss (aka Conair and Jibere) hot rollers.  For some reason, the 12-roller set produces much better, more long-lasting curls than the 20-roller set.  The 12-roller set has as many rollers as I need since I use only the largest rollers, and I bought an extra pack of these to replace some of the smaller ones.  I let the rollers heat for 10 minutes, then keep them on my head for 15 minutes.  During this time I have my hands free to do everything else to get myself ready.  I love the curls which are very soft and shiny looking.  I think that the flocked rollers are gentler on my hair than most of the curling iron products.  This is important, since my frizzy, naturally curly hair needs to be straightened first with a flat iron, and that is already a lot of abuse.  So this is a 5-star review for the Babyliss 12, but only 3 stars for the 20-roller product that I bought and returned.</li>
            <li> It is well made and easy to use.  I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> a well made product that is easy to use . Very please with the results. Would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> I had to send these back because I didn&#x27;t use them enough to make it work my while but love their products.</li>
            <li> remember the 70&#x27;s version of this unit with the prongs that dug into the skull?  Well this product has come a long way and I am a new proud owner of this unity.  The curlers are of a soft felt like roller with two types of clips which is a very nice feature; there are plenty of each clip for you to use your preference.  I like the plastic clips as they are very easy and quick to.  I am investing in myself and redefining who I am at 49, new make up new wardrobe, new longer hair style.  A perm with my thick hair will make me look at a poodle. I remember my mother using the older 70&#x27;s version, they were awkward, bulky and the clips always broke.  As a barber I put my very good strong seal of approval pn  THe various sizes as well is just enough larger, medium and smll.for finer and shorter hair strand; ther eis absoltely no reason in th worlk  THank you for improving onthe product over years, and giving us quality as well as a good price.  Certaiily better than kiiling my arms every day with my curling iron! welcome to the future again!</li>
            <li> Holding up well but not big enough rollers for longer hair; I would like to see bigger choices in hot rollers.</li>
