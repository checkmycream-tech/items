            <li>The product might be good for the face</li>
            <li>and it looked that good</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve gotten more color out of a drugstore brand for fair skin!</li>
            <li>Tan Towel tanning mist is better!</li>

            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>This works amazing</li>
            <li>My wife is light skinned and it still looks great on her.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li>Man this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think it smells like perfume or any type of warm vanilla sugar body lotion.</li>
            <li>and your hands will be nice and stained for about 4 days.  </li>
            <li>It does as promised when it comes to giving a nice bronze to the skin without looking orange and streaky.  </li>
            <li>I always get told that my skin color looks nice when i use it.</li>
            <li>i really liked the smell and consistency of the product</li>
            <li>I know what I&#x27;m doing when I apply it, but it just didn&#x27;t have a nice color on my feet.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product out of a review from a popular YouTube beauty guru</li>
            <li>It gave me a nice glowing tan.</li>
            <li>I bought this because a popular Youtuber rated it well.</li>
            <li>Best self Tanner on the market by far!  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for more of an olive undertone, gave me kind of a reddish tan, but that&#x27;s my preference.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love, this tanning solution!</li>
            <li>Gives a very nice golden color.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping I&#x27;d have good luck with this!  </li>
            <li>so I did a very light coat...</li>
            <li>As I said my wife is very light skinned which is nice, because it does not take much to get a good tan.  </li>
            <li>And there is no smell, which is a huge plus for me!</li>
            <li>So, from there on out, I applied more to those areas.</li>
            <li>so I researched better tanners.  </li>
            <li>Be sure as soon as you are done putting the lotion on to wash your hands.  </li>
            <li>and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect as everyone&#x27;s skin tone</li>
            <li>The second time I was more thorough and also applied more product because I was impressed with the color it made my skin (tan looking and not orange).  </li>
            <li>I legit LOVE</li>
            <li>You can apply more to darken your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I think its okay.</li>
            <li>but I did after a couple more.</li>
            <li>My favorite now is the luminous gold by xentan</li>
            <li>I really love this tanner.</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments on my tan.</li>
            <li>But other than my own fault this product is awesome.</li>
            <li>I have pretty fair skin</li>
            <li>It gives a beautiful natural look.</li>
            <li>Color came out pretty good.</li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim after watching a favorite Youtube guru talk about how much she loved it.</li>
            <li>Great natural color and virtually NO smell!</li>
            <li>I am a seasoned pro at sunless tanner, I know all the techniques for getting a flawless great tan,including starting with a good exfoliating scrub and not having any oils on your body prior to use.</li>
            <li>This stuff gave great, natural color that lasts..usually about 5-7 days.  </li>
            <li>, how there&#x27;s no smell, how easy it is to use...etc.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, is not greasy and does not make her skin orange.  </li>
            <li>I like the lotion and that it goes on easy after the shower.</li>
            <li>It does not have a strong smell and it tends fairly quick!</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best product I saw it advertised on Facebook</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this tanning lotion and will continue to use/purchase it as it&#x27;s easy to apply, leaves my skin looking very nicely tanned, and doesn&#x27;t stain like other sunless tanners do.  </li>
            <li>works fine, but not as tan as I had hoped</li>
            <li>I would just be sure to wash your hands after because it tans them quick and could look a bit unnatural.</li>
            <li>I put it on at night after a shower and when i wake up my legs are super tan and not orange!</li>
            <li>The girl at the phone may sound like she&#x27;s preoccupied with Facebook or something</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightly scented.</li>
            <li>works really well, but you will need 2 coats to get a nice brown tan</li>
            <li>They either gave great color that didn&#x27;t last, or gave streaky and unnatural color that lasted.  </li>
            <li>So far the St.tropez is by far the best</li>
            <li>it is amazing the natural color you get from a bottle!!!</li>
            <li>It gives a VERY good color even for it not be extreme.</li>
            <li>I use this lotion to supplement my natural summer tan and to keep from blinding passerbys with my super fair skin in the winter.</li>
            <li>OK I MUST HAVE MESSED UP THE FIRST USE BY APPLYING RIGHTTT AFTER MY SHOWER.</li>
            <li>This product definitely is unique -</li>
            <li>first the the tanner love this</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stain and everything comes out clean after being put in the laundry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The tan is nice and natural not orange!</li>
            <li>The real downside is the color was very light.</li>
            <li>Whether or not this will look good on every person or not I don&#x27;t know, since everyone is different.  </li>
            <li>It gives a really nice, natural tan.</li>
            <li>The smell is actually not bad.</li>
            <li>We re-apply about 6 days and it keeps her in a just right light brown tan.  </li>
            <li>They were nice and apologized and will apparently send me the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is great for the true pale girls that want a hint of tan.  </li>
            <li>only suggestion I would give is to make sure you wash your hands after every application - even if it&#x27;s a quick and light one.</li>
            <li>The next morning it looked amazing.</li>
            <li>For not exfoliating and not using a glove, AND being a first time self tanner, this sure came out pretty decent looking.</li>
            <li>To me it smells like other self tanners, kinda like that chocalaty smell but not as good.</li>
            <li>Very nice self tanner, pretty small bottle for the price, but it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky, rubs in well, dries quickly, and doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li>Natural, easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I do not have an olive skin tone, I have a fair skin tone, but my skin responds reasonably well to the sun and other self</li>
            <li>I WOKE UP PRETTY BRONZED.</li>
            <li>I took a shower before I put it on the first time.</li>
            <li>Wash them with hot water and soap for about 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I do really like this tanner!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say what exactly it does smell like</li>
            <li>I still occasionally go to a tanning bed but maybe will stop those visits now that I have Million Dollar Tan :)</li>
            <li>Works amazing....and not a weird color tan.</li>
            <li>The first time I applied</li>
            <li>Imwas able to get rid of them using a facial scrubber.  </li>
            <li>I did not see a difference after the first application</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless, I sampled the face lotion on my leg first.</li>
            <li>And L&#x27;Oreal Sublime is 1/3 of the cost and can be bought at any local drug store and most grocery stores.</li>
            <li>However, it is orange and streaky and pretty embarrassing.</li>
            <li>Now I really look like a SoCal girl!</li>
            <li>and you may wonder if you&#x27;ll need to call a second time, but no worries, she did a good job getting it right to FedEx the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;d highly recommend gloves because if you&#x27;re going to take the time to apply the product in a meticulous fashion, then you&#x27;re most likely going to end up with very tan/orange hands (and nails!).  </li>
            <li>The positive:</li>
            <li>The first time I used this self-tanning solution it worked really well.  </li>
            <li>I use it every other day and sometimes even less because the product gives you a good, healthy overall glow with just a light application.</li>
            <li>I made sure to dry myself off really well</li>
            <li>and I had to try amazing natural tan and absolutely no streaks at all ..</li>
            <li>I was really scared of what it was going to do to my hands</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t put as much on them -</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really smell it when I was using it</li>
            <li>and I noticed that I appeared much whiter where I didn&#x27;t apply the lotion</li>
            <li>but it sounded so convenient I decided to try it out with sheets I didn&#x27;t care about too much...</li>
            <li>so I had a straight tan line at my ankles.</li>
            <li>The color lasts about a week for me and its very tan, not orange.</li>
            <li>- oops!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, highly recommended product for self application!</li>
            <li>and I do not worry about using too much lotion.</li>
            <li>Now I really look like</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad and I only notice it on the first day after an application.</li>
            <li>One application gives a nice subtle but noticeable tint to my skin that tends to last about a week at most.</li>
            <li>The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the price, especially considering that proper application requires a pretty good amount of the stuff.</li>
            <li>You may have to give them a friendly call to remind them to actually ship your product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like this tanner any better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Rubbing it in was a little challenging as the lotion would be completely dry before you are sure you thoroughly got it on whatever part you were applying it on.</li>
            <li>but if you want to have a decent tan I wouldn&#x27;t invest in Million Dollar Tan lotion...perhaps other products they have work better.</li>
            <li>Next day I had a nice glowy color, definitely darker than my natural color.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to rub it down your feet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure exactly how many tans I got out of one bottle because sometimes I just apply to my arms and face or legs.  </li>
            <li>I am super white even though I am from SoCal and live 5 blocks from the beach.</li>
            <li>I have wasted my money on so many sunless tanner products...</li>
            <li>I normally always had to use gloves TRUST ME</li>
            <li>The tan that it gives you looks very natural when applied correctly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time I have ever used a sunless tanner at night and woke up the next morning with...NO TAN.</li>
            <li>This is the first tanning lotion that I have tried that doesn&#x27;t turn my skin yellow</li>
            <li>It rubs on clear</li>
            <li>It rubs on clear</li>
            <li>If you miss any spots you will notice it, but it works so fast that by the next day you won&#x27;t even notice.  </li>
            <li>This product puts an orange tint in your skin and does by no means look natural.</li>
            <li>As far as I know, it hasn&#x27;t been used yet.</li>
            <li>what i didn&#x27;t like that much is that my arms pale skin looked a bit more orange than expected</li>
            <li>But overall, a really nice self tanner, and I will probably repurchase in the extreme, so that I have to use less of the tanner.</li>
            <li>so it is very natural and it lasts for several days.</li>
            <li>It comes white, then turns clear on your skin as you work it in.</li>
            <li>i put it on directly after my shower and left it on over night .</li>
            <li>and I can barely smell it on me.</li>
            <li>Not harsh, but you will notice it for the following day.</li>
            <li>, it came off so splotchy after only 5-6 days that I had to cover up all my skin until it was completely faded, which took an additional week.</li>
            <li>I live in an area that has a long winter</li>
            <li>I was very impatient and really needed to find a decent lotion within a week for a big event.</li>

            <li> It is easy to use, is not greasy and does not make her skin orange.  </li>
            <li> I like the lotion and that it goes on easy after the shower.</li>
            <li> It does not have a strong smell and it tends fairly quick!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best product I saw it advertised on Facebook</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this tanning lotion and will continue to use/purchase it as it&#x27;s easy to apply, leaves my skin looking very nicely tanned, and doesn&#x27;t stain like other sunless tanners do.  </li>
            <li> works fine, but not as tan as I had hoped</li>
            <li> I would just be sure to wash your hands after because it tans them quick and could look a bit unnatural.</li>
            <li> I put it on at night after a shower and when i wake up my legs are super tan and not orange!</li>
            <li> The girl at the phone may sound like she&#x27;s preoccupied with Facebook or something</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightly scented.</li>
            <li> works really well, but you will need 2 coats to get a nice brown tan</li>
            <li> They either gave great color that didn&#x27;t last, or gave streaky and unnatural color that lasted.  </li>
            <li> So far the St.tropez is by far the best</li>
            <li> it is amazing the natural color you get from a bottle!!!</li>
            <li> It gives a VERY good color even for it not be extreme.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion to supplement my natural summer tan and to keep from blinding passerbys with my super fair skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> OK I MUST HAVE MESSED UP THE FIRST USE BY APPLYING RIGHTTT AFTER MY SHOWER.</li>
            <li> This product definitely is unique -</li>
            <li> first the the tanner love this</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stain and everything comes out clean after being put in the laundry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tan is nice and natural not orange!</li>
            <li> The real downside is the color was very light.</li>
            <li> Whether or not this will look good on every person or not I don&#x27;t know, since everyone is different.  </li>
            <li> It gives a really nice, natural tan.</li>
            <li> The smell is actually not bad.</li>
            <li> We re-apply about 6 days and it keeps her in a just right light brown tan.  </li>
            <li> They were nice and apologized and will apparently send me the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is great for the true pale girls that want a hint of tan.  </li>
            <li> only suggestion I would give is to make sure you wash your hands after every application - even if it&#x27;s a quick and light one.</li>
            <li> The next morning it looked amazing.</li>
            <li> For not exfoliating and not using a glove, AND being a first time self tanner, this sure came out pretty decent looking.</li>
            <li> To me it smells like other self tanners, kinda like that chocalaty smell but not as good.</li>
            <li> Very nice self tanner, pretty small bottle for the price, but it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky, rubs in well, dries quickly, and doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li> Natural, easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I do not have an olive skin tone, I have a fair skin tone, but my skin responds reasonably well to the sun and other self</li>
            <li> I WOKE UP PRETTY BRONZED.</li>
            <li> I took a shower before I put it on the first time.</li>
            <li> Wash them with hot water and soap for about 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I do really like this tanner!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say what exactly it does smell like</li>
            <li> I still occasionally go to a tanning bed but maybe will stop those visits now that I have Million Dollar Tan :)</li>
            <li> Works amazing....and not a weird color tan.</li>
            <li> The first time I applied</li>
            <li> Imwas able to get rid of them using a facial scrubber.  </li>
            <li> I did not see a difference after the first application</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless, I sampled the face lotion on my leg first.</li>
            <li> And L&#x27;Oreal Sublime is 1/3 of the cost and can be bought at any local drug store and most grocery stores.</li>
            <li> However, it is orange and streaky and pretty embarrassing.</li>
            <li> Now I really look like a SoCal girl!</li>
            <li> and you may wonder if you&#x27;ll need to call a second time, but no worries, she did a good job getting it right to FedEx the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;d highly recommend gloves because if you&#x27;re going to take the time to apply the product in a meticulous fashion, then you&#x27;re most likely going to end up with very tan/orange hands (and nails!).  </li>
            <li> The positive:</li>
            <li> The first time I used this self-tanning solution it worked really well.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other day and sometimes even less because the product gives you a good, healthy overall glow with just a light application.</li>
            <li> I made sure to dry myself off really well</li>
            <li> and I had to try amazing natural tan and absolutely no streaks at all ..</li>
            <li> I was really scared of what it was going to do to my hands</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t put as much on them -</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really smell it when I was using it</li>
            <li> and I noticed that I appeared much whiter where I didn&#x27;t apply the lotion</li>
            <li> but it sounded so convenient I decided to try it out with sheets I didn&#x27;t care about too much...</li>
            <li> so I had a straight tan line at my ankles.</li>
            <li> The color lasts about a week for me and its very tan, not orange.</li>
            <li> - oops!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, highly recommended product for self application!</li>
            <li> and I do not worry about using too much lotion.</li>
            <li> Now I really look like</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad and I only notice it on the first day after an application.</li>
            <li> One application gives a nice subtle but noticeable tint to my skin that tends to last about a week at most.</li>
            <li> The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the price, especially considering that proper application requires a pretty good amount of the stuff.</li>
            <li> You may have to give them a friendly call to remind them to actually ship your product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this tanner any better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Rubbing it in was a little challenging as the lotion would be completely dry before you are sure you thoroughly got it on whatever part you were applying it on.</li>
            <li> but if you want to have a decent tan I wouldn&#x27;t invest in Million Dollar Tan lotion...perhaps other products they have work better.</li>
            <li> Next day I had a nice glowy color, definitely darker than my natural color.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to rub it down your feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure exactly how many tans I got out of one bottle because sometimes I just apply to my arms and face or legs.  </li>
            <li> I am super white even though I am from SoCal and live 5 blocks from the beach.</li>
            <li> I have wasted my money on so many sunless tanner products...</li>
            <li> I normally always had to use gloves TRUST ME</li>
            <li> The tan that it gives you looks very natural when applied correctly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time I have ever used a sunless tanner at night and woke up the next morning with...NO TAN.</li>
            <li> This is the first tanning lotion that I have tried that doesn&#x27;t turn my skin yellow</li>
            <li> It rubs on clear</li>
            <li> It rubs on clear</li>
            <li> If you miss any spots you will notice it, but it works so fast that by the next day you won&#x27;t even notice.  </li>
            <li> This product puts an orange tint in your skin and does by no means look natural.</li>
            <li> As far as I know, it hasn&#x27;t been used yet.</li>
            <li> what i didn&#x27;t like that much is that my arms pale skin looked a bit more orange than expected</li>
            <li> But overall, a really nice self tanner, and I will probably repurchase in the extreme, so that I have to use less of the tanner.</li>
            <li> so it is very natural and it lasts for several days.</li>
            <li> It comes white, then turns clear on your skin as you work it in.</li>
            <li> i put it on directly after my shower and left it on over night .</li>
            <li> and I can barely smell it on me.</li>
            <li> Not harsh, but you will notice it for the following day.</li>
            <li> , it came off so splotchy after only 5-6 days that I had to cover up all my skin until it was completely faded, which took an additional week.</li>
            <li> I live in an area that has a long winter</li>
            <li> I was very impatient and really needed to find a decent lotion within a week for a big event.</li>
            <li> I find that once I apply one day I just skip those areas completely the next to avoid dark stains.</li>
            <li> The other thing you will want to be prepared for is that it does smell a little funny.  </li>
            <li> and I apply in small sections which works really well</li>
            <li> The color develops over a few hours and is very natural but noticeable.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried it I didn&#x27;t take it as seriously as I should&#x27;ve.  </li>
            <li> Very subtle scent that is only noticed right when you apply the product then goes away.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been self tanning for a long time.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and no streaks.</li>
            <li> for the con:  I noticed after several applications, my face broke out with a bunch of tiny black heads.  </li>
            <li> &quot; it was different than other tanners, but there still was one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;CUSTOMER</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re debating on the extreme versus regular (this one), I took a gamble and used this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed because the tan is believable!  </li>
            <li> I think this product works the same as any other sunless tanner</li>
            <li> I CAME UPSTAIRS TO DRY AND HAD NO COLOR.</li>
            <li> LET DRY FOR A COUPLE MINUTES ..</li>
            <li> and then put lotion on the dry places (knees, elbows, etc.).</li>
            <li> So I put this lotion on, put my clothes on after it was dry and then hopped into bed.</li>
            <li> She lets it dry for about 1/2 hour before we get in bed</li>
            <li> I shower every single night</li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say, the poor little bottle is on that FedEx truck again going right back to where it came from.</li>
            <li> The only thing I did was forgot to rub it down onto my feet</li>
            <li> Even if you want it a little darker, you can put another coat on the next day.</li>
            <li> Well maybe a minimal difference,</li>
            <li> I had used a sunless tanning lotion before and never really cared for it.</li>
            <li> My feet were not covered as well either since I was EXTREMELY careful of not putting a lot on.</li>
            <li> The color is orange and it doesn&#x27;t last my skin isn&#x27;t even pale and the color still doesn&#x27;t suit well.</li>
            <li> When i woke up the next morning there was very little change in color.</li>
            <li> (since other reviewers were saying their hands were orange afterwards)</li>
            <li> If you want a darker tan or have an already bronzed skin tone, use the Cabana Tan Extreme.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an extreme change.  </li>
            <li> You do have to be careful on your palms as those might stain a little as did mine</li>
            <li> know I&#x27;ve never seen a review under 5 stars for this product, about how dark you get</li>
            <li> and I used this dark tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money or the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pale skin toned in the winter with pink undertones</li>
            <li> even though I love the initial result of the tan, I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again due to the horrific fading results</li>
            <li> unhealthy white to a subtle natural color.</li>
            <li> However, I could tell that I washed my hands too well because there was a slight tan line where I washed them off afterwards.</li>
            <li> you are less prone to overtanning those areas.</li>
            <li> I used less pumps than what I have seen others used and still had these results.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about doing that</li>
            <li> I just receievd this a few days ago.</li>
            <li> (that sounded like she was home with a baby crying behind her), and she had someone call me back.</li>
            <li> I am the palest of the pale.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to put any face makeup because my face went from the pale</li>
            <li> THE SMELL IS PRETTY BAD.</li>
            <li> I hate wearing shorts because of how self conscious I am of my white legs.</li>
            <li> I was not sure what to expect</li>
            <li> The color slowly develops over a few hours</li>
            <li> The product was purchased for my 17 year old, who did not want to \\&quot;fake and bake\\&quot; and she loves it!  </li>
            <li> and  I don&#x27;t like looking pale and washed out!  </li>
            <li> My wife uses this product, and I help put it on those hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> but I was expecting coconut or at least what sun tan lotion would smell like</li>
            <li> And it is subtle so you can keep applying.</li>
            <li> As it fades it looks something like a cross between bad cellulite and</li>
            <li> but I do not think its bad enough to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time, and the tan lasts about a weak.</li>
            <li> I went up at least 3-4 shades darker!!</li>
            <li> My fake bake will be here Monday</li>
            <li> skipping the face just in case something bad happens.</li>
            <li> They stated in the description that it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell but to me, it does.  </li>
            <li> Turned orange and smelled bad.</li>
            <li> so disappointed because this was 40 dollars.</li>
            <li> IT WAS VERY ANNOYING.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t have a horrible smell.</li>
            <li> The tanner he was using smelled AWFUL</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i bought this because of carlibybel on utube.. she applied and came back a couple hours later glowing and tan... i put it on directly after my shower and left it on over night . woke up to nothing. im so disappointed because this was 40 dollars. i just reapplied it rubbing in circular motion. one pump to each section of body part. skipping the face just in case something bad happens. will update if it changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDate. OK I MUST HAVE MESSED UP THE FIRST USE BY APPLYING RIGHTTT AFTER MY SHOWER. THE BATHROOM WAS STILL A BIT HUMID WHILE I WAS APPLYING SO IT MUST HAVE MELTED AWAY ? LOL IDK. I CAME UPSTAIRS TO DRY AND HAD NO COLOR. THE SECOND TIME I APPLIED IN THE CENTRAL AIR LET DRY FOR A COUPLE MINUTES .. GOT DRESSED AND WENT TO SLEEP.. I WOKE UP PRETTY BRONZED. BUTTT I WENT TO WORK LATER ON THAT DAY.. WAS SWEATING FROM 90 DEGREE WEATHER AND I STARTED TO SMELL A BURNING SMELL... IT WAS VERY ANNOYING. I FELT LIKE I SMELLED LIKE I WAS ON FIRE... THATS THE ONLY DOWNFALL OF THIS PRODUCT. IF U SWEAT.. THE SMELL IS PRETTY BAD. AND WHEN IT WASHES AWAY IT CAN BE A BIT PATCHY.</li>
            <li> works fine, but not as tan as I had hoped</li>
            <li> This product definitely is unique - It&#x27;s the first time I have ever used a sunless tanner at night and woke up the next morning with...NO TAN. Well maybe a minimal difference, but I&#x27;ve gotten more color out of a drugstore brand for fair skin! I know this must not happen to everyone, but know it is possible that it could happen to you. I am especially puzzled because I bought the \\&quot;Extreme\\&quot; form of this product. I do not have an olive skin tone, I have a fair skin tone, but my skin responds reasonably well to the sun and other self tanners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I&#x27;ve never seen a review under 5 stars for this product, about how dark you get, how there&#x27;s no smell, how easy it is to use...etc. I am a seasoned pro at sunless tanner, I know all the techniques for getting a flawless great tan,including starting with a good exfoliating scrub and not having any oils on your body prior to use. so I know I did not do anything wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rubbing it in was a little challenging as the lotion would be completely dry before you are sure you thoroughly got it on whatever part you were applying it on. So you have to use a lot. I did not want to mix it with lotion because i did not want to dilute the \\&quot;color\\&quot;. But this did not matter in the end....lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I woke up in the middle of the night and noticed the \\&quot;cooking smell\\&quot;, once again contrary to what I&#x27;ve been told about this \\&quot;miracle product\\&quot; it was different than other tanners, but there still was one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;CUSTOMER SERVICE\\&quot; WARNING: You may have to give them a friendly call to remind them to actually ship your product. The girl at the phone may sound like she&#x27;s preoccupied with Facebook or something and you may wonder if you&#x27;ll need to call a second time, but no worries, she did a good job getting it right to FedEx the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, the poor little bottle is on that FedEx truck again going right back to where it came from. Let&#x27;s hope they actually refund my money!</li>
            <li> Tan Towel tanning mist is better!</li>
            <li> This works amazing I use it all the time, and the tan lasts about a weak. This product smells amazing and its not blotchy or anything! I would just be sure to wash your hands after because it tans them quick and could look a bit unnatural.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim after watching a favorite Youtube guru talk about how much she loved it. I had used a sunless tanning lotion before and never really cared for it. I would always just go to the tanning salon to get my tan on. After a while, I didn&#x27;t have enough time to go to the salon every day (nor did I have the energy or money). I decided to try this out and see what it did. I absolutely love it! I took a shower before I put it on the first time. I made sure to dry myself off really well and then put lotion on the dry places (knees, elbows, etc.). After that, I put the lotion on from head to toe. I was really scared of what it was going to do to my hands (since other reviewers were saying their hands were orange afterwards) so I didn&#x27;t put as much on them - I did the same thing with my feet. So I put this lotion on, put my clothes on after it was dry and then hopped into bed. The next morning it looked amazing. However, I could tell that I washed my hands too well because there was a slight tan line where I washed them off afterwards. My feet were not covered as well either since I was EXTREMELY careful of not putting a lot on. So, from there on out, I applied more to those areas. The smell is actually not bad. I couldn&#x27;t really smell it when I was using it and I can barely smell it on me. Of course, if you put your nose up to your arm or something, you will smell the lotion. However, it doesn&#x27;t have a horrible smell. It&#x27;s lightly scented. Don&#x27;t think it smells like perfume or any type of warm vanilla sugar body lotion. If you&#x27;re looking for a good sunless tanning lotion, this would be the one! If you&#x27;re debating on the extreme versus regular (this one), I took a gamble and used this one. It gives a VERY good color even for it not be extreme. Even if you want it a little darker, you can put another coat on the next day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this but my husband does.  The tanner he was using smelled AWFUL so I researched better tanners.  This one is awesome!  Great natural color and virtually NO smell!</li>
            <li> This a great product.  Whether or not this will look good on every person or not I don&#x27;t know, since everyone is different.  My wife uses this product, and I help put it on those hard to reach places.  My wife is light skinned and it still looks great on her.  You do have to be cery careful to rub it on evenly and completely.  If you miss any spots you will notice it, but it works so fast that by the next day you won&#x27;t even notice.  She puts it on at night, and by the next morning you can&#x27;t even notice there was a problem.  As I said my wife is very light skinned which is nice, because it does not take much to get a good tan.  We re-apply about 6 days and it keeps her in a just right light brown tan.  She lets it dry for about 1/2 hour before we get in bed and we have not had any problem.  Be sure as soon as you are done putting the lotion on to wash your hands.  Wash them with hot water and soap for about 2 minutes.  I found that any longer than that and your hands will be nice and stained for about 4 days.  The other thing you will want to be prepared for is that it does smell a little funny.  Not harsh, but you will notice it for the following day.</li>
            <li> Natural, easy to apply. My holy grail tan lotion. If you want a darker tan or have an already bronzed skin tone, use the Cabana Tan Extreme.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> I do really like this tanner!  It does as promised when it comes to giving a nice bronze to the skin without looking orange and streaky.  However, the smell is a different thing.  I shower every single night but I notice that the smell of the lotion definitely lingers in my skin for about 3 days after application!  They stated in the description that it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell but to me, it does.  I can&#x27;t say what exactly it does smell like but I was expecting coconut or at least what sun tan lotion would smell like but nope.  I think if Million Dollar Tan could reformulate this lotion, it would be perfect.  The scent is the only reason I gave it four stars but if that doesn&#x27;t bother you, then I would definitely recommend this self tanner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried practically every sunless tanning lotion there is and this is my favorite.  It rubs on clear so I can put it on in the morning just like regular lotion.  The color develops over a few hours and is very natural but noticeable.  I&#x27;m not sure exactly how many tans I got out of one bottle because sometimes I just apply to my arms and face or legs.  But it lasted for awhile.  And there is no smell, which is a huge plus for me!</li>
            <li> The color is orange and it doesn&#x27;t last my skin isn&#x27;t even pale and the color still doesn&#x27;t suit well. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for this for this price. My fake bake will be here Monday so we will see how that goes.</li>
            <li> I put it on at night after a shower and when i wake up my legs are super tan and not orange! Doesn&#x27;t even rub off. I always get told that my skin color looks nice when i use it. I recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this produce because a youtube beauty guru did a video about it and I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect as everyone&#x27;s skin tone etc is going to be different (What worked for this girl might not work for me).  The first time I tried it I didn&#x27;t take it as seriously as I should&#x27;ve.  This product does indeed give the tanned skin look and I noticed that I appeared much whiter where I didn&#x27;t apply the lotion (ex. in between my toes!).  The second time I was more thorough and also applied more product because I was impressed with the color it made my skin (tan looking and not orange).  However, I&#x27;d highly recommend gloves because if you&#x27;re going to take the time to apply the product in a meticulous fashion, then you&#x27;re most likely going to end up with very tan/orange hands (and nails!).  I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this produce and people were saying they used it after their shower and before bed.  I was a little worried about doing that but it sounded so convenient I decided to try it out with sheets I didn&#x27;t care about too much...and I had no problems.  I do notice the smell on my skin in the mornings.  Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this tanning lotion and will continue to use/purchase it as it&#x27;s easy to apply, leaves my skin looking very nicely tanned, and doesn&#x27;t stain like other sunless tanners do.  I still occasionally go to a tanning bed but maybe will stop those visits now that I have Million Dollar Tan :)</li>
            <li> this is the best tanning lotion ever!! not streaky at all.. goes on white and within two applications (over 2 days) you look a perfect golden brown!! lasts for about 5 days without reapplying. I legit LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
            <li> Works amazing....and not a weird color tan.</li>
            <li> The product was purchased for my 17 year old, who did not want to \\&quot;fake and bake\\&quot; and she loves it!  It is easy to use, is not greasy and does not make her skin orange.  We will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> i really liked the smell and consistency of the product what i didn&#x27;t like that much is that my arms pale skin looked a bit more orange than expected thats why i give 4 stars</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this tanner any better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.  I know what I&#x27;m doing when I apply it, but it just didn&#x27;t have a nice color on my feet.  I&#x27;m really white and my feet are the hardest to tan.  I shave, use a sugar scrub and lotion before I use a self tanner.  I also wipe off around my wrists and ankles.  I just didn&#x27;t like it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this three stars because though it gave a beautiful, bronze, even tan, it came off so splotchy after only 5-6 days that I had to cover up all my skin until it was completely faded, which took an additional week. This tan stains the skin, so as your skin comes off, so does the tan. As it fades it looks something like a cross between bad cellulite and 90-year-old wrinkled lady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So even though I love the initial result of the tan, I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again due to the horrific fading results</li>
            <li> I have pretty fair skin and I used this dark tanning lotion. It gives a beautiful natural look. The only thing I did was forgot to rub it down onto my feet so I had a straight tan line at my ankles. But other than my own fault this product is awesome. Just make sure to rub it down your feet.</li>
            <li> I just receievd this a few days ago. The first time I applied I was not sure what to expect so I did a very light coat...Still got some color but just did a heavier one the next daya nd it is amazing the natural color you get from a bottle!!!</li>
            <li> Great self tanner!  Does not leave the color on clothes or sheets.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on a UTube tutorial so I bought it.  It definitely gives you an even tan in literally 4 to 5 hours.  You put it on at night and wake up tan.  You can apply more to darken your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the con:  I noticed after several applications, my face broke out with a bunch of tiny black heads.  I use a magnifying mirror every day and couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I never had blackheads before I used this product.  Nobody noticed them but I could see them with the mirror.  It says on the bottle that it doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  It clogged mine.  Imwas able to get rid of them using a facial scrubber.  I&#x27;m really disappointed because the tan is believable!  No orange marks etc.  but for the price, I won&#x27;t buy this again.  I was really hoping I&#x27;d have good luck with this!  Darn!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost done with my bottle and I think its okay. You definitely have to build the color on. I did not see a difference after the first application but I did after a couple more. The smell is not bad and I only notice it on the first day after an application. The color lasts about a week for me and its very tan, not orange.</li>
            <li> It was alright. gave me some color but got patchy in some areas and I&#x27;ve been self tanning for a long time. My favorite now is the luminous gold by xentan</li>
            <li> This product puts an orange tint in your skin and does by no means look natural. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Awful. Turned orange and smelled bad. I will never buy this again. It&#x27;s not worth the money or the time.</li>
            <li> I think this product works the same as any other sunless tanner</li>
            <li> Tanning lotion, must put on evenly and read the instructions, follow what it says about knees, elbows, toes or you will have orange joints and toes.  Put it on after your nightly shower and in the  morning visibly tanner body.</li>
            <li> works really well, but you will need 2 coats to get a nice brown tan</li>
            <li> I am the palest of the pale.  I have wasted my money on so many sunless tanner products...drugstore and more expensive brands.  They either gave great color that didn&#x27;t last, or gave streaky and unnatural color that lasted.  This stuff gave great, natural color that lasts..usually about 5-7 days.  This one is great for the true pale girls that want a hint of tan.  It&#x27;s not an extreme change.  If you want that, try to &amp;#34;cabana extreme&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my daughter.  As far as I know, it hasn&#x27;t been used yet. Maybe she will use it soon.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this self-tanning solution it worked really well.  The second time I used it I found that the face lotion does come off and also the lotion used on my legs and arms came off too.  This is the first tanning lotion that I have tried that doesn&#x27;t turn my skin yellow so I will continue to use it.  I live in an area that has a long winter and  I don&#x27;t like looking pale and washed out!  I haven&#x27;t noticed it coming off on my clothes just on my towels and my pillow case.  It doesn&#x27;t stain and everything comes out clean after being put in the laundry.</li>
            <li> Great Tan! It rubs on clear so I can put it on in the morning just like regular lotion. The color slowly develops over a few hours so it is very natural and it lasts for several days. I like that is doesn&#x27;t smell, too.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love, this tanning solution! It does not have a strong smell and it tends fairly quick!</li>
            <li> I tried this product out of a review from a popular YouTube beauty guru and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I use it every other day and sometimes even less because the product gives you a good, healthy overall glow with just a light application. The bottle lasts quite a while as well as the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only suggestion I would give is to make sure you wash your hands after every application - even if it&#x27;s a quick and light one. I made the mistake once of not washing and I had blotches on my hand for a day or two - oops!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, highly recommended product for self application!</li>
            <li> Very nice self tanner, pretty small bottle for the price, but it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky, rubs in well, dries quickly, and doesn&#x27;t streak. Gives a very nice golden color. I was hoping for more of an olive undertone, gave me kind of a reddish tan, but that&#x27;s my preference. But overall, a really nice self tanner, and I will probably repurchase in the extreme, so that I have to use less of the tanner.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin looking tan, not ORANGE!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this lotion to supplement my natural summer tan and to keep from blinding passerbys with my super fair skin in the winter. The tan that it gives you looks very natural when applied correctly. One application gives a nice subtle but noticeable tint to my skin that tends to last about a week at most. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the price, especially considering that proper application requires a pretty good amount of the stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this! Best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Very good product. Goes on well. Just need to follow the instructions for perfect coverage.</li>
            <li> I bought on the website because it was cheaper but this stuff is awesome. I went up at least 3-4 shades darker!! It gave me a nice glowing tan. It does not look fake like most brands. It looks like I went to Florida all summer. I also put it on my face with no problem.</li>
            <li> I dont like that the lotion does not have a color guide. I applied it before bed on my legs to test it.  It took forever to get it to rub into my skin. I used gloves to rub in.  When i woke up the next morning there was very little change in color. i would never but this product again in the lotion form. I just ordered the spray to try it. I have used about every self tanner out there.... this one is at the bottom of my list.  So far the St.tropez is by far the best</li>
            <li> Very subtle scent that is only noticed right when you apply the product then goes away.  Applies evenly with a noticeable change in skin color immediately.</li>
            <li> AWESOME color! Best I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> I really love this tanner. It gives a really nice, natural tan. It comes white, then turns clear on your skin as you work it in. You start seeing it develop within 4 hours. It does have an odor, but it&#x27;s manageable.</li>
            <li> I ordered the combo...Cabana tan body and face sunless tanning lotion. When I received the package, only the face lotion was there. I tried calling customer service but got an answering machine, so I contacted them online. No one got back to me. Eventually I tried again, left a message, still no luck. Finally, 3 weeks after, I finally got in contact with them by reaching a woman (that sounded like she was home with a baby crying behind her), and she had someone call me back. They were nice and apologized and will apparently send me the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, I sampled the face lotion on my leg first. I was very impatient and really needed to find a decent lotion within a week for a big event. Color came out pretty good. Last night I applied it to my upper body and face. Now I did not exfoliate, which I know I should have. I moisturized my elbows, combined some moisturizer with the tanner for my face, etc. Next day I had a nice glowy color, definitely darker than my natural color. I&#x27;m pale skin toned in the winter with pink undertones and I tend to turn tan with olive tones. There are some streaks around the chest area and wrists, but I didn&#x27;t even use a glove. For not exfoliating and not using a glove, AND being a first time self tanner, this sure came out pretty decent looking. I would say a second layer of color will fix any mistakes. But use a GLOVE. I didn&#x27;t have to put any face makeup because my face went from the pale unhealthy white to a subtle natural color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using self-tanner for over 20 years now...so consider myself somewhat of an expert. I&#x27;m a red-head with fair skin and have tried almost every product on the market over the years. I heard some rave reviews for Million Dollar tan and was expecting something wonderful. The positive: I like the lotion and that it goes on easy after the shower. Negatives: The real downside is the color was very light. I could almost not tell I had applied self-tanner even after applying 3 days in a row. Alternatively when I use L&#x27;Oreal sublime you can tell the very next day that you have a bronze glow. And L&#x27;Oreal Sublime is 1/3 of the cost and can be bought at any local drug store and most grocery stores. The product might be good for the face but if you want to have a decent tan I wouldn&#x27;t invest in Million Dollar Tan lotion...perhaps other products they have work better.</li>
            <li> I bought this because a popular Youtuber rated it well. However, it is orange and streaky and pretty embarrassing.</li>
            <li> Best self Tanner on the market by far!  Lasts a long time and no streaks.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best product I saw it advertised on Facebook and I had to try amazing natural tan and absolutely no streaks at all ..I normally always had to use gloves TRUST ME NOT AT ALL WITH THIS PRODUCT !! I always use reg daily lotion first the the tanner love this they have a costumer for life ....</li>
            <li> I am super white even though I am from SoCal and live 5 blocks from the beach. I hate wearing shorts because of how self conscious I am of my white legs. Tanning in the sun would take days! I do not have money to get spray tanned monthly and I do not like UV rays form beds. I&#x27;ve tried self tanners which did not go so well. I saw a review on youtube from CarliBybel and thought if she used it and it looked that good I will try it! Man this thing is amazing. No stains, no orange. You do have to be careful on your palms as those might stain a little as did mine but even then it did not look bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tan is nice and natural not orange! And it is subtle so you can keep applying. I just reapplied for two days before a beach trip I had. I got so many compliments on my tan. When I told people what it was they couldn&#x27;t believe it. I already got two of my friends to try it. If you follow the instructions about applying lotion to kneees, elbows, and feet you are less prone to overtanning those areas. I find that once I apply one day I just skip those areas completely the next to avoid dark stains. This works great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did read comments about the smell. To me it smells like other self tanners, kinda like that chocalaty smell but not as good. It is a bit there but I do not think its bad enough to stop using it. It goes away after a shower. I work out every day and sweat A LOT and did not notice a big difference in odor. Also, I read about applying and it drying before you can get it to everywhere you want... Well I don&#x27;t know about you but my logic kicks in once in a while and I apply in small sections which works really well and I do not worry about using too much lotion. I am known to extend the life of products I use because of how froogle I am when using them. This is no exception. I used less pumps than what I have seen others used and still had these results. You can&#x27;t expect a miracle worker so for the price and for what it does I think this product is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for finally making something that works! Now I really look like a SoCal girl!t is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for finally making something that works! Now I really look like a SoCal girl!</li>
