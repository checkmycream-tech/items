            <li>Definitely not recommended on first date or work it is best for spraying car interior or clothes in your closet.</li>
            <li>perfumes , high reviews never mean the perfume is nice and good to buy .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great perfume for low price.</li>
            <li>Will make a great gift for any male.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let ANYONE tell ya different about this one, its great.</li>
            <li>my expectations is very useful</li>
            <li>THIS PERFUME IS WELCOME, HAVE A LASTING AROMA COOL</li>
            <li>Tiene un aroma excelente, el producto lleg&amp;oacute; en su empaque original y la entrega en tiempo oportuno.</li>
            <li>in all, the product is either tampered or diluted, in any case, is not the original smell, therefor, a</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay fresh cologne it kind of smells like old spice.</li>
            <li>This is a great cologne my wife loves the scent very manly but soft smell itvwont give you headaches.</li>
            <li>The product is original and is in good conditions for its use personal.</li>
            <li>Besides being scammed, I have spent a great shame because the product was for sale in Colombia.</li>
            <li>huband and myself are very well pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30 and it seems to fit just right.</li>
            <li>I strongly recomended it for those hot days of summer.</li>
            <li>The package was delivered very quickly and item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>and he loves it, a fresh and modern fragance it smells very good and stays all day long.   </li>
            <li>The opening is very strong :) and fades after couple of hours but fragrance will remain on your clothes for a long time.</li>
            <li>Mild scent, not overpowering like some of the others out there.</li>
            <li>Really, the material and design left me happy.</li>
            <li>However, it was only $10 in TJ-Max, so it&#x27;s actually really good for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>This fragrance has a brand name trademark and super affordable.</li>
            <li>Another clean masculine scent the ladies love and the guys want to know what it is</li>
            <li>After using it, I decided it was too strong for daytime, so I don&#x27;t use it very often now.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it .</li>
            <li>I liked the product and The entire purchase and delivery process was fulfilled according to programming, I will continue shopping hereby</li>
            <li>Brother let me tell ya, I&#x27;ve tried about 50 different colognes in my life so far, but this one out of all of &#x27;em has gotten the most attention from the ladies!!</li>
            <li>Tht Good Dont Listen To The Other Review</li>
            <li>Otherwise, save yourself a few dollars from trying this out and get an elegant attractive scent fragrance like Chanel Bleu or Lacoste essential sport.</li>
            <li>It has a lasting effect on the skin and its very strong and masculine; also cheap</li>
            <li>Amazon Rocks, this was my first time ordering something with such great results, I will definitely  purchase again through Amazon</li>
            <li>My boyfriend couldn&#x27;t believe I found his favorite cologne and in the big bottle.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend really likes this fragrance, which means I like it!</li>
            <li>But all those complements are with in the first hour of wearing it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe the product was authentic Perris Ellis; product was not up to Perry Ellis standards, nor did the scent last.</li>
            <li>It was delivered surpsingly fast!</li>
            <li>My first impression of the cologne...</li>
            <li>it smells almost exactly like Oleg Cassini.</li>
            <li>Definitely it&#x27;s a modern fresh fragance that makes you impress people when they&#x27;re close to you,</li>
            <li>MORE LASTING</li>
            <li>However, the smell according to my taste is somewhat strong and unlikely to win the impression from others.</li>
            <li>I would say if I had to choose between this and the tried and true Cool Water by Davidoff, I would go with the latter.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended moneys worth 100%.</li>
            <li>Nice classy scent that&#x27;s light enough for afternoon summer wear, but stands up enough for evening wear also.  </li>
            <li>It;s not too strong, but strong enough to last all day.</li>
            <li>I wanted something clean and crisp smelling, and this was definitely the one.  </li>
            <li>The bottle looks suspicious with its huge white sticker, didn&#x27;t even come with the container shown in the pictures.</li>
            <li>I feel its what a real man is suppose to smell like.</li>
            <li>he really likes it.</li>
            <li>Got to me fast.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t take to much</li>
            <li>so you will not have to use much.</li>
            <li>I really like this fragrance</li>
            <li>I really like this and all my friends tell me that this is my signature scent.  </li>
            <li>, I feel very cheated.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>This cologne is real, keeps</li>
            <li>I really like it, all my friends like it.</li>
            <li>For preference context, my favorite colognes are Black by Kenneth Cole, Hei by Alfred Sung, Guess for Men, and Vetyver by L&#x27;Occitane.</li>
            <li>I have used this product previously and love it.</li>
            <li>I like ordering it on here because you get more for less.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle and this is the only cologne I&#x27;ve purchased more than once.</li>
            <li>This sent is for an older guy like 40 years and older.</li>
            <li>A co-worker said it reminded her of scent that her older brother in law would wear.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for any high class person.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li>I liked the smell of all these fragrances but hardly remember getting any complements.  </li>
            <li>the product is what I expected much filled</li>
            <li>The problem is, that I ordered the 360 perfume, but its not the right smell, if you compare it to one you buy in a mall or a specific place for perfumes, you can diferentiate the smells.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>I picked up a bottle of this recently at a local department store having a huge sale (about same price as Amazon, but without the shipping).</li>
            <li>This brand and this particular fragrance is one of my favorite ones but unfortunately even after buying it from Amazon.com, I basically got swindled and received a fragrance that smelled authentic but didn&#x27;t last an hour.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive about smells but with this one, I don&#x27;t get headaches or nausea.  </li>
            <li>Also, this is suitable for mature guys ( 45 and older ), Duh, Perry Ellis.</li>
            <li>By contrast, I have Perry Ellis products and they not only smell exactly as they claim</li>
            <li>but they last the whole day too!</li>
            <li>My husband loves his Perry Ellis 360, me too, its aroma is clean and sharp.</li>
            <li>And it cost much less than in the Caribbean duty free shops.</li>
            <li>I had to experiment with the amount of sprays to use so far, as it seems to wear off after a couple hours.  </li>
            <li>but they did in the early</li>
            <li>It is not a knock off, or old, like another brand I purchased, thru another</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it quite pleasant, except for a lingering (and very subtle) baby-powderish scent behind the more forward notes, although the scent deepens throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing that there are people so filthy and not have the slightest consideration for other people who purchase in good faith.</li>
            <li>80&amp;#34;s :) Not too bad but a bit strong for my taste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent twice as much for it in stores!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last long and in Indian Climates (hot and humid)</li>
            <li>Last pretty long...</li>
            <li>There is no other fragrance that compares to this.</li>
            <li>Now I purchased it for my teenage son who is practically a young man, and he loves this cologne...</li>
            <li>I have tried various colognes and this is the only one so far has gotten me complements.</li>
            <li>Its not terribly strong so its a nice subtle scent.</li>

            <li> Definitely not recommended on first date or work it is best for spraying car interior or clothes in your closet.</li>
            <li> perfumes , high reviews never mean the perfume is nice and good to buy .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great perfume for low price.</li>
            <li> Will make a great gift for any male.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let ANYONE tell ya different about this one, its great.</li>
            <li> my expectations is very useful</li>
            <li> THIS PERFUME IS WELCOME, HAVE A LASTING AROMA COOL</li>
            <li> Tiene un aroma excelente, el producto lleg&amp;oacute; en su empaque original y la entrega en tiempo oportuno.</li>
            <li> in all, the product is either tampered or diluted, in any case, is not the original smell, therefor, a</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay fresh cologne it kind of smells like old spice.</li>
            <li> This is a great cologne my wife loves the scent very manly but soft smell itvwont give you headaches.</li>
            <li> The product is original and is in good conditions for its use personal.</li>
            <li> Besides being scammed, I have spent a great shame because the product was for sale in Colombia.</li>
            <li> huband and myself are very well pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 and it seems to fit just right.</li>
            <li> I strongly recomended it for those hot days of summer.</li>
            <li> The package was delivered very quickly and item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> and he loves it, a fresh and modern fragance it smells very good and stays all day long.   </li>
            <li> The opening is very strong :) and fades after couple of hours but fragrance will remain on your clothes for a long time.</li>
            <li> Mild scent, not overpowering like some of the others out there.</li>
            <li> Really, the material and design left me happy.</li>
            <li> However, it was only $10 in TJ-Max, so it&#x27;s actually really good for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> This fragrance has a brand name trademark and super affordable.</li>
            <li> Another clean masculine scent the ladies love and the guys want to know what it is</li>
            <li> After using it, I decided it was too strong for daytime, so I don&#x27;t use it very often now.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it .</li>
            <li> I liked the product and The entire purchase and delivery process was fulfilled according to programming, I will continue shopping hereby</li>
            <li> Brother let me tell ya, I&#x27;ve tried about 50 different colognes in my life so far, but this one out of all of &#x27;em has gotten the most attention from the ladies!!</li>
            <li> Tht Good Dont Listen To The Other Review</li>
            <li> Otherwise, save yourself a few dollars from trying this out and get an elegant attractive scent fragrance like Chanel Bleu or Lacoste essential sport.</li>
            <li> It has a lasting effect on the skin and its very strong and masculine; also cheap</li>
            <li> Amazon Rocks, this was my first time ordering something with such great results, I will definitely  purchase again through Amazon</li>
            <li> My boyfriend couldn&#x27;t believe I found his favorite cologne and in the big bottle.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend really likes this fragrance, which means I like it!</li>
            <li> But all those complements are with in the first hour of wearing it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe the product was authentic Perris Ellis; product was not up to Perry Ellis standards, nor did the scent last.</li>
            <li> It was delivered surpsingly fast!</li>
            <li> My first impression of the cologne...</li>
            <li> it smells almost exactly like Oleg Cassini.</li>
            <li> Definitely it&#x27;s a modern fresh fragance that makes you impress people when they&#x27;re close to you,</li>
            <li> MORE LASTING</li>
            <li> However, the smell according to my taste is somewhat strong and unlikely to win the impression from others.</li>
            <li> I would say if I had to choose between this and the tried and true Cool Water by Davidoff, I would go with the latter.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended moneys worth 100%.</li>
            <li> Nice classy scent that&#x27;s light enough for afternoon summer wear, but stands up enough for evening wear also.  </li>
            <li> It;s not too strong, but strong enough to last all day.</li>
            <li> I wanted something clean and crisp smelling, and this was definitely the one.  </li>
            <li> The bottle looks suspicious with its huge white sticker, didn&#x27;t even come with the container shown in the pictures.</li>
            <li> I feel its what a real man is suppose to smell like.</li>
            <li> he really likes it.</li>
            <li> Got to me fast.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t take to much</li>
            <li> so you will not have to use much.</li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance</li>
            <li> I really like this and all my friends tell me that this is my signature scent.  </li>
            <li> , I feel very cheated.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> This cologne is real, keeps</li>
            <li> I really like it, all my friends like it.</li>
            <li> For preference context, my favorite colognes are Black by Kenneth Cole, Hei by Alfred Sung, Guess for Men, and Vetyver by L&#x27;Occitane.</li>
            <li> I have used this product previously and love it.</li>
            <li> I like ordering it on here because you get more for less.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and this is the only cologne I&#x27;ve purchased more than once.</li>
            <li> This sent is for an older guy like 40 years and older.</li>
            <li> A co-worker said it reminded her of scent that her older brother in law would wear.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for any high class person.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> I liked the smell of all these fragrances but hardly remember getting any complements.  </li>
            <li> the product is what I expected much filled</li>
            <li> The problem is, that I ordered the 360 perfume, but its not the right smell, if you compare it to one you buy in a mall or a specific place for perfumes, you can diferentiate the smells.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I picked up a bottle of this recently at a local department store having a huge sale (about same price as Amazon, but without the shipping).</li>
            <li> This brand and this particular fragrance is one of my favorite ones but unfortunately even after buying it from Amazon.com, I basically got swindled and received a fragrance that smelled authentic but didn&#x27;t last an hour.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive about smells but with this one, I don&#x27;t get headaches or nausea.  </li>
            <li> Also, this is suitable for mature guys ( 45 and older ), Duh, Perry Ellis.</li>
            <li> By contrast, I have Perry Ellis products and they not only smell exactly as they claim</li>
            <li> but they last the whole day too!</li>
            <li> My husband loves his Perry Ellis 360, me too, its aroma is clean and sharp.</li>
            <li> And it cost much less than in the Caribbean duty free shops.</li>
            <li> I had to experiment with the amount of sprays to use so far, as it seems to wear off after a couple hours.  </li>
            <li> but they did in the early</li>
            <li> It is not a knock off, or old, like another brand I purchased, thru another</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it quite pleasant, except for a lingering (and very subtle) baby-powderish scent behind the more forward notes, although the scent deepens throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing that there are people so filthy and not have the slightest consideration for other people who purchase in good faith.</li>
            <li> 80&amp;#34;s :) Not too bad but a bit strong for my taste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent twice as much for it in stores!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long and in Indian Climates (hot and humid)</li>
            <li> Last pretty long...</li>
            <li> There is no other fragrance that compares to this.</li>
            <li> Now I purchased it for my teenage son who is practically a young man, and he loves this cologne...</li>
            <li> I have tried various colognes and this is the only one so far has gotten me complements.</li>
            <li> Its not terribly strong so its a nice subtle scent.</li>
            <li> It last all day long</li>
            <li> As one of the negative reviewers mentioned, I would have to agree that Perry Ellis 360 is  more for the \\&quot;suits and ties\\&quot; professional crowd than the teens and early 20-somethings in casual apparel, but it&#x27;s certainly not an \\&quot;old person&#x27;s\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li> The other fragrances I&#x27;ve used are Versace Dreamer, Drakkar Noir, Perry Ellis Red, Versace eau fraiche, Acqua di gio &amp; Blue seduction.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this fragrance for my husband for a long time and am elated to see it on-line.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smell for a long while..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weak and smells exactly like the &amp;#34;Cool Water&amp;#34; I had purchased along with it.</li>
            <li> He tried other brands and went back for this one.</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly and was much less expensive than in department stores.  </li>
            <li> It was just as I expected.  </li>
            <li> Deliverd a day before expected.</li>
            <li> My order was delivered sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Even once a unknown girl asked to me</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Daily wear possible, inexpensive (certainly not cheap!), Line of cosmetics to go with it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I will continue to use Perry Ellis 360 and maybe even try out some of the other line.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they are married and want to know so they can get it for their man.</li>
            <li> Perry may try other smells</li>
            <li> Urban, and summer like scent create an edgy feel when worn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not too heavy and lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> the worst cologne i tried in my life smell like something very cheap do not spend your money in this s</li>
            <li> this product would do it but it is not possible, the product you received is a fake.</li>
            <li> Subtle.</li>
            <li> Terrible , got nothing to do with fresh fruits touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you spray it on and can&#x27;t smell any trace of it within an hour, chances are you have a fake one.</li>
            <li> Bad Cologne Dosent Smell All</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed  with this item.</li>
            <li> I am in Colombia and I can not do anything to return this crap</li>
            <li> Rip off a vicious scam.</li>

            <li> I got this as a Chistmas gift and the person I gave it to absolutely loved it. It was his favorite cologne and he couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. I&#x27;m happy I found it here, the price was great, and it turned out to be a very good present.</li>

            <li> Im happy with the product and delivery time great fragance i got it as a gift for my brother he really likes it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this cologne!! It smells so good on him and he gets tons of compliments(which he loves!!) I will definitely purchase again, its manly but not overpowering just stays for hours. Subtle.I am a fan of Perry ellis and this cologne will not disappoint. Will make a great gift for any male.</li>
            <li> As you know this is Eau De toilette, thus, its a diluted perfume. It doesn&#x27;t last long and in Indian Climates (hot and humid) it does not control the sweat odor from clothes. The smell stays in the clothes, but doesn&#x27;t come out, so people at a distance won&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> Thank you Tucini! My boyfriend couldn&#x27;t believe I found his favorite cologne and in the big bottle. And it cost much less than in the Caribbean duty free shops.</li>

I liked the smell of all these fragrances but hardly remember getting any complements.  Now I am almost out of this cologne, I am debating whether should i go for this or Perry Ellis M. This is my second bottle and this is the only cologne I&#x27;ve purchased more than once.</li>
            <li> It smells great. Packaged every well. Got to me fast. Very happy with this buy. The smell is nice it doesn&#x27;t take to much so you will not have to use much. So it will last.</li>
            <li> Go Perry Go! Another clean masculine scent the ladies love and the guys want to know what it is&lt;br /&gt;so they can get some!</li>
            <li> this is my favorite perfume for my boyfriend&lt;br /&gt;so it was a present for him but i feel is a present for me&lt;br /&gt;i have when the &#x27;people smell so good.</li>
            <li> Grate and even better for the price</li>
            <li> The Perry Ellis 360 was a gift for my father&#x27;s 100th (yes, 100th) birthday.  He has used this product for many years and still loves it.  It arrived very quickly and was much less expensive than in department stores.  The fragrance is not too heavy and lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> i mean...it smells good if your 45. If your 23 and trying to get laid its not gonna stand out. not a fan if this at all....</li>

            <li> I have used this product previously and love it. I was very impressed with the product size from Amazon. It was much larger than the one I used to purchase at retail. Great value for the price!</li>
            <li> Tiene un aroma excelente, el producto lleg&amp;oacute; en su empaque original y la entrega en tiempo oportuno. Buen precio comparado con el tama&amp;ntilde;o del producto. Recomiendo este perfume y este vendedor para sus futuras compras.</li>

            <li> I order as a gift also.  He used it all and was waiting to see what I will order him next. He love it all!</li>
            <li> This perfume has a strong/sweet fragrance, it&#x27;s good for every day use. And it is very cheap.</li>
            <li> Bad Cologne Dosent Smell All Tht Good Dont Listen To The Other Review If I Was Yu I Rather Get Unbound Its 100% Better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Perry Ellis 360 since this winter. I really like this fragrance and it works well for evening&#x27;s out as well as around the office. Its not terribly strong so its a nice subtle scent. Urban, and summer like scent create an edgy feel when worn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Daily wear possible, inexpensive (certainly not cheap!), Line of cosmetics to go with it (body wash etc)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Seems to wear off in like 6-8 hours, bottle seems kinda fragile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I will continue to use Perry Ellis 360 and maybe even try out some of the other line.</li>
            <li> I really like this and all my friends tell me that this is my signature scent.  It is there without being obnoxious and there is my highest recommendation - it is not obnoxious just enough to be known.</li>
            <li> I have a feeling the seller sent me a knock off its just not what I remember it to be. It&#x27;s weak and smells exactly like the &amp;#34;Cool Water&amp;#34; I had purchased along with it. The bottle looks suspicious with its huge white sticker, didn&#x27;t even come with the container shown in the pictures.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe the product was authentic Perris Ellis; product was not up to Perry Ellis standards, nor did the scent last. Also no one I knew was impressed with the scent.</li>
            <li> Very fresh and attractive smell, soft and nice. I can have it on for 7 hours and it will still smell, even better when it penetrates the skin I simply love it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for a gift and he loved it. It smells really good and nice bottle size for the price.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful on my husband.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites! Love it when my husband uses it!!</li>
            <li> The women just the the smell of this. They always ask me what is that great smell. Unfortunately they are married and want to know so they can get it for their man. I let them know what a great deal this is on amazon and that is where they go to buy it</li>
            <li> Excellent cologne. Mild scent, not overpowering like some of the others out there. Good size and really just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This  cologne is one of my favorites. It last all day long I strongly recomended it for those hot days of summer.</li>
            <li> VERY SATISFIED ........... EXCELLENT VERY GOOD GOOD OPTION FOR QUALITY RECOMMEND THE PRICE AND QUALITY ... MUYBUEN TO BUY  EXCELENT</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne for a few months now.  I constantly get compliments on it.  It&#x27;s a great value for a great scent.  It was delivered surpsingly fast!</li>
            <li> Excellent seller recommend</li>
            <li> I am so happy with the product and delivery time Amazon Rocks, this was my first time ordering something with such great results, I will definitely  purchase again through Amazon Thank you</li>
            <li> The problem is, that I ordered the 360 perfume, but its not the right smell, if you compare it to one you buy in a mall or a specific place for perfumes, you can diferentiate the smells.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the product is either tampered or diluted, in any case, is not the original smell, therefor, a ripoff.&lt;br /&gt;The originall product, I would recommend to anyone, the one being sold by the person that I bought this from, I would not recomend to anyone.</li>
            <li> i remember purchasing this for my bf years ago..when the bottle had finished, he didn&#x27;t even want to part with it...actually it&#x27;s still there on his dresser...so his bday is coming up soon...I promised myself I was gonna get him another...</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments with this cologne... My fav for over 4 years! Gotta love Perry Ellis baby!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and love the smell. Its a great value for the money and also a name brand. I know he loves the smell as well.</li>
            <li> My first impression of the cologne...it smells almost exactly like Oleg Cassini. Not even sure if they make that anymore but they did in the early 80&amp;#34;s :) Not too bad but a bit strong for my taste. I think it would be described as a &amp;#34;woodsie&amp;#34; fragrance?  Three stars is based on my preference in cologne only. The bottle and packaging are very nice looking.</li>
            <li> Excellent. i have no complains what so ever about the product. The package was delivered very quickly and item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Excellent article came at the indicated time. I am very happy with the item for a reasonable price. Really it is very satisfied and recommend your purchase. Really, the material and design left me happy.</li>
            <li> Es una fragancia de uso diario, tiene un aroma suave que puede ser llevado en cualquier ocasion pero solo de dia. Es muy sueve para la noche, a mi gusto.</li>
            <li> This cologne is my boyfriends favorite. I like ordering it on here because you get more for less. At stores a smaller bottle goes for 30 and this is bigger and cheaper. It always arrives in great shape and it lasts a while. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Excelente proveedor 100% recomendable,todo llego en perfecto estado condiciones y en el tiempo programado , las producto publicado paso  las expectativas de compra y deseo seguir poder teniendo negocio con el vendedor .</li>
            <li> Great Product. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> ARRIVED IN GOOD CONDITION, YOU RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> guess I should have hit the mall after all to smell colognes before purchasing.. Perry Ellis has always had great colognes that smell very manly but this one sort of smells like baby powder.</li>
            <li> I love this!! A great scent, I&#x27;ve had pregnant woman and even a 92 year Lady how much they like it!!!</li>
            <li> Spanish:&lt;br /&gt;Si pudiera darle una calificacion inferior a cero a este producto lo haria pero no es posible, el producto que recibi es una falsificación. Ademas de haber sido estafado, he pasado una gran verguenza ya que el producto era para una venta en Colombia. Es increible que haya gente tan puerca y que no tenga la mas minima consideración con otra gente que compra de buena fe. Señores de Amazon, ustedes como dueños de este espacio deberian multar a este tipo de proveedores inescrupulosos que le roban el dinero a la gente. El producto no huele a nada, el empaque esta notablemente manipulado. Una estafa una vil estafa. No lo recomiendo para nada. Me encuentro en Colombia y no puedo hacer nada para devolver esta porqueria, me siento muy engañado.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;English:&lt;br /&gt;If I could give a score below zero this product would do it but it is not possible, the product you received is a fake. Besides being scammed, I have spent a great shame because the product was for sale in Colombia. It&#x27;s amazing that there are people so filthy and not have the slightest consideration for other people who purchase in good faith. Lords of Amazon, you as the owner of this space should be fined for this type of unscrupulous providers who steal money from people. The product does not smell at all, the packaging is noticeably manipulated. Rip off a vicious scam. Not recommended at all. I am in Colombia and I can not do anything to return this crap, I feel very cheated.</li>
            <li> I received this parfume as a gift, and I just totally liked it, as anyone who smells i when I wear it. I would highly recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT NICE FRAGRANCE</li>

            <li> Excelente, fue entregado en el tiempo previsto y sin ningun inconvenientes, lo recomiendo, es responsable 100%. Satisfecho con el servicio prestado</li>
            <li> I love this is a christmas gift for my kids grandfather. I know he&#x27;s going to love it. Great sale!!!</li>
            <li> My husband loves his Perry Ellis 360, me too, its aroma is clean and sharp. He tried other brands and went back for this one.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this fragrance for my husband for a long time and am elated to see it on-line.  I simply love it and so do my husband.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay fresh cologne it kind of smells like old spice. However, it was only $10 in TJ-Max, so it&#x27;s actually really good for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself I really like it</li>
            <li> todo llego en muy buen estado me encanta ... lo recomiendo 100% la entrega fue en el tiempo estimado tal como lo esperaba no tuve ningún problema gracias</li>
            <li> excelente perfume, toda la ropa que tengo huele a este perfume, luego de varias lavadas mantiene el olor y sin utilizar demasiado. me gusta tanto que estoy esperando que llegue otro que compre. gracias</li>
            <li> great buy. love the smell</li>
            <li> Great fragance, it&#x27;s just what i&#x27;ve been looking for my son and he loves it, a fresh and modern fragance it smells very good and stays all day long.   Definitely it&#x27;s a modern fresh fragance that makes you impress people when they&#x27;re close to you, that&#x27;s great.</li>

            <li> the worst cologne i tried in my life smell like something very cheap do not spend your money in this s***</li>
            <li> Terrible , got nothing to do with fresh fruits touch.&lt;br /&gt;with perfumes , high reviews never mean the perfume is nice and good to buy .&lt;br /&gt;go to store , smell perfumes fiscally and then buy it online .</li>
            <li> Great deal super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Gotta smell good in this tropical island.</li>
            <li> thank you very much I really liked the product is what I expected much filled my expectations is very useful thank you very much for the excellent product delivery</li>
            <li> This cologne will have you smelling like a million dollar man. My wife loves it and I bought my dad a bottle also.</li>
            <li> Perfume de especial aroma para uso diario. Recomendable para cualquier ocasión. Buen precio. Originalidad confiable. Entrega a tiempo según plan de envío seleccionado</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll make the review as short as possible. This fragrance has a brand name trademark and super affordable. However, the smell according to my taste is somewhat strong and unlikely to win the impression from others. Also, this is suitable for mature guys ( 45 and older ), Duh, Perry Ellis. Definitely not recommended on first date or work it is best for spraying car interior or clothes in your closet. Otherwise, save yourself a few dollars from trying this out and get an elegant attractive scent fragrance like Chanel Bleu or Lacoste essential sport.</li>
            <li> This fragrance has a nice clean scent.  I have thousands of dollars in scent and this is one of my favorites.  I have had many compliments when wearing it out and like the scent a lot.</li>
            <li> It was just as I expected.  After using it, I decided it was too strong for daytime, so I don&#x27;t use it very often now.</li>
            <li> I have been using Perry Ellis 360 for many years and I love the smell. Many people also have told me that they too love the smell. I</li>
            <li> Loved it :) :D it was standee shipping and it came fast XD thanks ^~^</li>
            <li> excellent purchase, recommended seller</li>
            <li> This is a great cologne my wife loves the scent very manly but soft smell itvwont give you headaches. Highly recommended moneys worth 100%.</li>
            <li> exellent product 100% recomendado</li>
            <li> Deliverd a day before expected.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance for office wear!!!</li>
            <li> My wife bought me Perry Ellis 360 for Xmas two years ago. Brother let me tell ya, I&#x27;ve tried about 50 different colognes in my life so far, but this one out of all of &#x27;em has gotten the most attention from the ladies!! Don&#x27;t let ANYONE tell ya different about this one, its great.</li>
            <li> The product is original and is in good conditions for its use personal. I wait buy others fragances come soon</li>
            <li> I have been buying Perry ellis 360 for men for years. It;s not too strong, but strong enough to last all day. My order was delivered sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I wanted something clean and crisp smelling, and this was definitely the one.  When my husband puts it on, he smells absolutely amazing</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s most favorite perfume. Love it.</li>
            <li> I just love this perfume on my husband.  I order it for him often. I am very sensitive about smells but with this one, I don&#x27;t get headaches or nausea.  It is smooth and sexy.  :)</li>
            <li> This is one of the best colognes out there. I first bought a 5 piece variety set and this one was the best one out of the 5, so that&#x27;s what I went for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.&lt;br /&gt;  I didn&#x27;t know the bottle was so big though! (that&#x27;s a plus)</li>
            <li> Very good product fast shipping, good price.</li>
            <li> This cologne is real, keeps it&#x27;s smell for a long while..It is not a knock off, or old, like another brand I purchased, thru another company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My huband and myself are very well pleased.</li>
            <li> i use it in the morning and at night before i put sunblock! and i could see the results after using it constantly!</li>
            <li> good price for an excellent male fragrance, sober and elegant</li>
            <li> Excelent seller and product</li>
            <li> fits good on me... just love it!</li>
            <li> I really like it, all my friends like it. One of best fragances I ever used. Even once a unknown girl asked to me what is the name of the fragance because she love it!.</li>
            <li> This sent is for an older guy like 40 years and older. A co-worker said it reminded her of scent that her older brother in law would wear.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price.</li>
