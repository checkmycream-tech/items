            <li>great looking skin, I trade off between this and the Shea Terra Nilotic Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also works great for detangling, something that has become my nemesis since I started color treating my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a repeat order and am happy with it.</li>
            <li>One could probably add this Argan to olive or almond oil, or both, and have a great shaving experience while stretching the oil even farther.      </li>

            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy I decided to purchase this oil...</li>
            <li>It also works great as cuticle oil ( I would use it on my fingers and toes after I paint my nails).</li>
            <li>, the oil is otherwise very nice.  </li>
            <li>oil is very nice on the skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for your hair though.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been thrilled!</li>
            <li>For good measure, I sometimes use it as an aftershave balm, as well.  </li>
            <li>it is a good value for the amount</li>
            <li>The oil was good</li>
            <li>My skin feels so good after using it.</li>
            <li>Good for smoothing the frizzies and softening cuticles.</li>
            <li>Good news is that the smell goes away</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>Good buy for the price.</li>
            <li>After buying a crappy argan oil (agadir) I was determined to find an argan oil that was going to take care of my hair :) Some one recommended this product to me and know I am really happy with what it does to my hair.</li>
            <li>IS A HAPPY PERSON :)</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it works great there too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really wonderful stuff make my hair smooth and shiny love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Lovely product!</li>
            <li>but I love it!</li>
            <li>This pure argan oil feels wonderful on the face and hair.</li>
            <li>It works amazing on mosquito bites.  </li>
            <li>This seems like a nice oil.  </li>
            <li>My hair has a nice shine and gloss.</li>
            <li>I use it on my hair, face (it gives a warm glow), neck, and body.</li>
            <li>I have used this kind of oil from another company and never&lt;br /&gt;had</li>
            <li>after hearing the change that argan oil can make to hair, I decided to try it out, and honestly I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>I put it on my face and my skin absorbs it soo nicely.</li>
            <li>It worked nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>it kind of made my hair look brittle.</li>
            <li>I honestly thought it was a coincidence that my skin improved because in the meanwhile, I started drinking water.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li>Feels wonderful and moisturizing, and I feel confident knowing I&#x27;m using a pure, non-chemical product.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s still some scars, but I can see it getting better too! :)</li>
            <li>This is by far the best oil I have ever used on my face and hair.</li>
            <li>It makes my face and hands look very smooth and moisturized and more youthful.  </li>
            <li>Terra&#x27;s version had great reviews, and it seems to be pure Argan</li>
            <li>I mostly use it after I&#x27;m home for the day and have washed my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would say it helps a somewhat, but the most benefit I get from this product is that it helps my skin not to scar or bruise from breakouts.</li>
            <li>I do like it better than the more odorous Moringa oil I ordered.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many products and lotions that did one of two things...</li>
            <li>I can see what they are talking about, but to me it smells a bit more like a Band-Aid.</li>
            <li>We love the product.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>keeps my body and hair healthy and that makes it okay in my book.</li>
            <li>this is a reputable company who understands its brand well&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably just purchase the Acure oil (which I do like just a bit better) or try to find something else that comes with a dropper cap.</li>
            <li>I have tried a couple brands and for some reason this one absorbs into my skin better.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my face and have been satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as good as the reviews I&#x27;ve read, however I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It does sit on top of your face for a while...</li>
            <li>I love argan oil.</li>
            <li>I love the flexibility of this oil.  </li>
            <li>Not by a lot, but if you have stubby lashes like I do, it&#x27;s the difference between being able to grasp my lashes with the curler or crimping my skin instead.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that exposure to oxygen lessens the shelf life of argan oil (which is about a year), so the pump on the bottle is an added bonus (no need to unscrew the top).</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this argan oil and so does my husband.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>most oils I have tried before.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a silicon-free alternative to the famous turquoise Moroccan oil brand I used for my hair before.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>does make my hair more oily than shiny, which is not the effect I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I love this Shea Terra argan oil.  </li>
            <li>This one has a pump top and I like that better than the dropper.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>The oil has a nice smooth texture on your skin</li>
            <li>My hair stylist swears by the stuff too, which makes me feel confident that it&#x27;s more than a passing fad.</li>
            <li>2 pumps does a good job of taming my curls and frizz with no artificial fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The result is a softer, shinier look than with top quality shampoo/conditioner alone.</li>
            <li>My hair looks healthy again.</li>
            <li>I love this oil.  </li>

            <li>This oil gives a healthy shine to the skin.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>I am the most pickiest person when it comes to my hair.</li>
            <li>My favorite beard, hair and skin oil.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes and softens better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>So glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>I have not used it more than once</li>
            <li>It provided a refreshing experience&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>had read about Argan oil and wanted to know and experience more about it.</li>
            <li>I do not like using products that have too many ingredients or added fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I put this on my hair, face....love, love it.</li>
            <li>I researched this oil on various sites and thought this was the best deal.</li>
            <li>and I am able to retain length, something I haven&#x27;t been able to do in years.  </li>
            <li>Great service and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Much better and faster results.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better now that it ever has.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Argan oil on my hair and skin (my face mostly) for about a month now.</li>
            <li>Love this oil and use it on my hair, skin, bath and even on leather.</li>
            <li>marvelous product been using for 2 years very moisturizing and am pretty sure it has helped my face maintain moisture/elasticity.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>This works great where I live for any skin issues caused by heat or chafing.</li>
            <li>and I was able to extract them easily, without damaging my skin.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a great, natural product and have recommended it friends.</li>
            <li>Happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>Smooths my skin texture, makes stubborn and stuck comedones easily extracted.  </li>
            <li>This is good quality, and I love the pump action.</li>
            <li>I use this with the Emu oil and it works great, it would be fantastic on its own, but I have very DRY skin, so I use them combined.</li>
            <li>I am 52, and I have mostly normal skin (good for my age) with spotty dryness in the colder months.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have a lot of them and it must be doing some good because I&#x27;m not getting new ones.</li>
            <li>I do have some fine lines</li>
            <li>it is helping tremendously with irritation,redness,flaking,etc!  </li>
            <li>It is a really fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, but I think when I finish this bottle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li>but I never saw results from any of the others, so I honestly didn&#x27;t have much hope for this product</li>
            <li>The argan oil smells fresh and authentic (nutty);</li>
            <li>The oil leaves my skin FABULOUS.</li>
            <li>Argan oil is non-greasy, absorbs immediately into the skin, and leaves skin smooth,  </li>
            <li>went on line to Amazon.com and filled in a request for return of the&lt;br /&gt;product and followed the instructions.  </li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t leave my hair silky smooth</li>
            <li>and I just like feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it as a supplement to my moisturizer in the winter and as a stand alone in the summer.</li>
            <li>It has no smell and the body is light which I like.</li>
            <li>However, I am still getting the same great results and I suppose the value of this product somewhat makes up for that.</li>
            <li>Overall a great beauty oil.</li>
            <li>It is such a great product.</li>
            <li>And since my face was doing great, I experimented applying it on my back.</li>
            <li>Make my skin smooth</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel silky smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I like the way it seems to smooth out my skin.</li>
            <li>Great product, I definitely recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good, but don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li>I like it very much and have already bought two more bottles.</li>
            <li>The price at first almost turned me away, but I decided to take a chance, and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I like the level of moisture this oil gives my face, it does feel like oil, there&#x27;s not doubt about that, but it feels clean.</li>
            <li>it has an amber pump bottle, which pumps clean (no splurts), thereby minimizing exposure to oxygen and light&lt;</li>
            <li>The light sesame like odor doesn&#x27;t bother me and dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li>Love this, cause it is pure oil.</li>
            <li>This product has been great, even better for my hair (less glue-like, more fluid-like) and even works on the skin (and I have very sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>It is also good for knees, elbows and upper arms.</li>
            <li>I love this so much</li>
            <li>He uses it every morning all over his face and his skin looks so good and way younger.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and actually has helped to bring some under the surface acne to a head (which is a good thing).</li>
            <li>Smells good and leaves a non sticky shine in the hair with out giving it a sticky look or feel if used properly.</li>
            <li>it made my hair nice and soft without all that grease on it.</li>
            <li>It works great in conjunction with my other hair products and does not make my hair greasy whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>Yes, there is a mild scent.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs into my skin fairly quickly, and I soon cannot tell I have applied it.</li>
            <li>As for the smell, it fades quickly once applied.</li>
            <li>but with the argan oil it feels so light, comfortable and dries fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on my face too, it absorbs quickly, and softens the skin without being oily.</li>
            <li>I apply this to my nails and massage in every 2 days or so and it has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>Was very happy to receive it earlier than I thought especially since I&#x27;m going on vacation and need it.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look normal and healthy.</li>
            <li>The odor is not unpleasant, though, and fades rapidly.    </li>
            <li>oil absorbs quickly and easily if you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>My hair is softer, less frizzy, and my curls have great definition.</li>
            <li>My curls are more defined and bouncy and my hair is super soft.</li>
            <li>Fabulous for hair, it&#x27;s everything you hear about Argan oil, and 100% pure organic.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great and a little goes</li>
            <li>My face is so smooth and the acne has really improved.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so soft and shiny :)</li>
            <li>I bought this because I wanted to use a more natural remedy.</li>
            <li>something that would be nice to have considering it only keeps for about a year.</li>
            <li>Love how it moisture&#x27;s and makes your skin soft...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff make your skin so soft like a newborn baby...</li>
            <li>I have been using this on my nails with much success.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it is a good product, a much cheaper alternative to Josie M.&#x27;s</li>
            <li>but the product is easily absorbed by your skin.  </li>
            <li>They are smaller, easily extracted and most of the time virtually invisible if I remain consistent with application.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing special in a positive way about this product.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is rather nutty at first but dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>I would use it right after</li>
            <li>right before I began using this product.  </li>
            <li>I am an Estee Lauder person - however, use this on my face first thing in the morning, throw some moisturizing sun screen over the top and people are amazed when they find out how old I am.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive &amp; fair skin, and this oil irritated my facial skin.</li>
            <li>I have a few other brands of this oil and this one is really the best, it must be that it&#x27;s more concentrated or</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about the moisturizing properties, but unless you love splashing oil EVERYWHERE, and believe me, speaking as a dextrous and careful person who never spills, you WILL fling oil at some point all over a mirror, a blouse, a carpet...</li>
            <li>I bought this product about a month ago, and my hair hasn&#x27;t been this smooth and shinny since maybe I was little, and all natural ingredients makes it even better!!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any magical differences (I don&#x27;t believe in magic in any case!)</li>
            <li>I would have never dreamed I would ever use oils on my acne prone skin, but I believe these products really have helped me tremendously.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly greasy but seems to do a good job moisturising my skin.</li>
            <li>And the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>So little of this oil is needed to achieve your desired look which makes it a good value.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
            <li>I prefer the more plush, viscous texture of Acure&#x27;s oil, but they do seem to sink into skin and moisturize the same.</li>
            <li>You can thank me later :)</li>
            <li>My first experience with argan oil was based on the recommendation of a Moroccan tour guide.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 2 months since the first application and the last bike ride I took, I was able to comb the tangles out.</li>
            <li>On some days the skin can appear a bit too shiny, however a simple run over with a tissue suffices and the appropriate level of shine remains.</li>
            <li>But after I&#x27;ve religiously applied this to my face every night, I noticed my skin getting smoother and the color start to get better.</li>
            <li>I put this on my skin first and then apply the Shea Terra body cream...</li>
            <li>At first it looks like its going to go on greasy</li>
            <li>This has kept my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments on my hair looking soft and the color more rich.  </li>
            <li>so I originally bought this for my hair because I’ve used argan oils in the past and liked them.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many, many different moisturizers over the years, but nothing really helped enough.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend (who is very sensitive to smells) doesn&#x27;t mind the mild smell at all.</li>
            <li>Price is high but the product is worth it.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>(it got a lot of positive ratings hence my purchase) but</li>
            <li>I pretty much use it all over even my hair...</li>
            <li>Using pure, organic argan oil is far superior to any of the other so-called Moroccan argan products on the market I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The oil is slightly thinner and clearer than Acure&#x27;s, and to be honest</li>
            <li>Made my skin feel awesome and kept it well hydrated through the rough winter months when it usually dries out.</li>
            <li>My skin used to be slightly dry, but not any more.</li>
            <li>pure argan \\&quot;Moroccan\\</li>
            <li>I have ordered it twice to give it a real chance and to determine any thing positive results from using it.</li>
            <li>The pure argan oil is supposed to have roasted smell ,which it does , but I&#x27;m not liking the smell that much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to try this as my ultimate goal is to grow my hair out long and healthy.</li>
            <li>I like it even better than Moroccanoil - no strong perfumes, and it absorbs into the skin/hair quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great stuff because it is very thick and viscous.  </li>
            <li>This product has really worked for my skin.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>&quot; oil really nourishes hair and leaves it glossy yet never oily looking.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference using this oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Maple Holistics Argan shampoo and Silk 18 conditioner along with this, and it&#x27;s so much prettier.</li>
            <li>I really like Acure, but the bottle is frosted glass</li>
            <li>(at a much cheaper price!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews noted the smell of the product, but it does not bother me.  </li>
            <li>Can really tell the difference when I use this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shared it with co-workers, who also really like it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
            <li>Stays a bit oily if you use too much is all</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>He also likes how it dries fast without that</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast and the item is as described.</li>
            <li>but this oil helps so much.  </li>
            <li>Smells much like macadamia nuts.</li>
            <li>After much research I decided to give this product a try.</li>
            <li>It squirts out waaaaay too much.  </li>
            <li>very Greece&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what is causing that, and it may not be the argan oil.</li>
            <li>I like the product so much that I&#x27;m ordering a bottle for my mom and my mother-n-law.</li>
            <li>The pump cap cannot be removed - or at least I haven&#x27;t figure out how to do it - and a good amount of the oil remains inside after it stops pumping.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am hoping the few sun-spots/blemish marks I have on my face will disappear with continued use, and honestly I think they will because it has practically changed the texture of my skin over night.</li>
            <li>It absorbs super quickly and my skin is left feeling very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>On wet hair, it absorbs right in making my hair light and silky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to edit my original review to include the fact that my aging hair, which was beginning to be very prone to breakage, has actually been strengthened by this oil.</li>
            <li>question whether it has any greater benefits over any other oil you could slather on your skill, like almond, coconut or even olive oil.</li>
            <li>It is a great value for the price as well because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Purchased it mainly to see if it really helps with psoriasis.</li>
            <li>After trying and loving a sample of Acure&#x27;s argan oil, I went looking for a larger bottle and debated for an embarrassingly long time over which brand to order.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, and it works really well for bumps on the upper arms.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too soon to tell if that&#x27;s true, but it has now replaced my facial moisturizer!</li>
            <li>more like something I’d cook fish with less like something I want to wear.</li>
            <li>I use Tretinoin Cream from my dermatologist, so my face gets really dry and it starts to peal, as soon as I put this on, my face is so smooth, and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I mainly used it on my face, and added some to my lotion.</li>
            <li>I use the in all over my body mainly on my head.</li>
            <li>While it is a different scent, it is mild and you eventually forget it is even there.</li>
            <li>I havent used it in my hair much but the times that I did use it in my hair, it made it very soft and shiney.</li>
            <li>I am incredibly surprised with all of the positive reviews for this product.  </li>
            <li>so I tried using more and my head was an oily mess.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>would highly  recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Beats</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>just received my bottle, so I&#x27;ve only used it once and can&#x27;t attest to long-term results, but my first impression is mostly positive.</li>
            <li>It takes an hour or more to really absorb, so I use very little</li>
            <li>Bought this for my girlfriend, she says the product really does keep her skin moisturized all day and that she&#x27;s used it to completely replace her lotion.</li>
            <li>I use it more at night but it can also be worn under makeup, if you let it set a few minutes before you apply the makeup.</li>
            <li>I love my grey hair, but it lacks the luster of my former sable brunette.  </li>
            <li>They told me that was normal and it would go</li>
            <li>Used on my face a few times which was okay.</li>
            <li>I figured women who live in high temp areas must know what they are talking about.  </li>
            <li>Not only did it do wonders for my dry hair, but my skin never felt and looked better.</li>
            <li>All in all, a good product and probably preferable to other face creams because it&#x27;s natural, but not the miracle worker I expected from reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>My hair no longer feels like straw on the ends, and it stays that way right through to my next hair cut (I go every 6 weeks)</li>
            <li>Great product, a little goes a long way - last forever!!!!</li>
            <li>really think and pure product, would prefer a different brand or smell</li>
            <li>My hair was super dry -</li>
            <li>No, it&#x27;s not cheap, but I love that it&#x27;s a natural product with no perfumes or fillers.</li>
            <li>but it gave me milia, and it weighs down my fine hair for either styler or conditioner.</li>
            <li>It has a very natural and nutty fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>First let me say that I do believe this is authentic raw Argan Oil from the extensive research I&#x27;ve done on the oil.</li>
            <li>and I prefer dark amber bottles to protect against light damage.</li>
            <li>The results were silky soft hair that never tangled again!</li>
            <li>It literally made my sore, chapped hands soft with one application!</li>
            <li>Wile my hair is fizz free and soft , but it becomes oily more quickly ,which I&#x27;m not liking :(</li>
            <li>Less is more, I only use one pump of oil for whatever I&#x27;m going to use it for: hair or skin.</li>
            <li>The oil is very light and absorbs well--it doesn&#x27;t feel like an extra heavy layer.</li>
            <li>I have MY real 30 year old&#x27;s head of hair back!  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin with mild-moderate adult acne.</li>
            <li>It does not cause breakouts and makes the skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>After using this for about 5 months, I noticed that this phenomenon had been completely eradicated.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>oil has also smoothed my skin completely.</li>
            <li>The smell is similar to sesame oil but is much milder.</li>
            <li>I buy it at my natural grocers after I bought it here because I can get it cheaper there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Shea Terra Organics Argan Oil for about a week now and my hair has completely changed.</li>
            <li>It works so well for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>Although, DOES the job, my curly hair is soft, and non greasy looking but</li>
            <li>While it may do wonders for your hair, no one will want to stand near you.</li>
            <li>I recommend this oil if you are looking for a natural skin and hair care product.</li>
            <li>The only real negatives to this oil is the scent.</li>
            <li>I have stopped using hair conditioner or styling gel completely.</li>
            <li>I wake up with skin that looks radiant and is amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and shiny, and my cystic acne and winter skin disappear.</li>
            <li>(3) it should have a mild nutty fragrance and (4) it should be stored in a dark glass bottle.</li>
            <li>You can pay less and get inferior quality and pay more for no particular reason.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other beauty oils in the past (jojoba being an incredibly popular one)</li>
            <li>It has really helped my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>From research I&#x27;ve seen the scent most commonly described as either nutty or similar to rubberbands.</li>
            <li>Mine smelled mildly nutty like plain popcorn.</li>
            <li>My skin went from dull looking to smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend is using it to clear up the bumps on the back of his arms</li>
            <li>I researched argan oil and there are several brands out there that vary wildly in price.</li>
            <li>They haven&#x27;t completely disappeared yet but are alot smaller</li>
            <li>sit here typing with zit cream on my now many pimples because after using this product for a week I broke out worse than a teenager after a chocolate bar binger.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hands, arms, and face feel as smooth as a thick lotion would</li>
            <li>Only my real purpose for ordering was for my face which is very dry.</li>
            <li>I found it to be very helpful due to my skin issues and dryer skin in the winter month&#x27;s ...</li>
            <li>A small amount seems to go a long way, and it leaves my skin feeling nourished and smooth.  </li>
            <li>long lasting and makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is just a little dry and this makes my hair super oily.</li>
            <li>Compounding the natural dryness of the grey with the chemical body</li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth the price and a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li>Before it gets too dry, I add a few drops (a little goes a long way) to my palms and warm it up, then run it through the ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li>my colour treated and slightly dry hair becomes a soft, shiny halo of well defined and glossy curls.  </li>
            <li>I have skin that doesn&#x27;t get too dry or too oily and so far this hasnt change how my skin feels (besides making it softer).</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel soft, but makes my skin burn a little that&#x27;s from chemicals still in body skins very sensitive</li>
            <li>i subject it to makes it appear even more dull.  </li>
            <li>Initially, I used the dime-sized amount I normally need with other products and the result was a slicked back look reminiscent of guys from the 50s.</li>

            <li> Good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> After buying a crappy argan oil (agadir) I was determined to find an argan oil that was going to take care of my hair :) Some one recommended this product to me and know I am really happy with what it does to my hair.</li>
            <li> IS A HAPPY PERSON :)</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it works great there too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really wonderful stuff make my hair smooth and shiny love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Lovely product!</li>
            <li> but I love it!</li>
            <li> This pure argan oil feels wonderful on the face and hair.</li>
            <li> It works amazing on mosquito bites.  </li>
            <li> This seems like a nice oil.  </li>
            <li> My hair has a nice shine and gloss.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair, face (it gives a warm glow), neck, and body.</li>
            <li> I have used this kind of oil from another company and never&lt;br /&gt;had</li>
            <li> after hearing the change that argan oil can make to hair, I decided to try it out, and honestly I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I put it on my face and my skin absorbs it soo nicely.</li>
            <li> It worked nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> it kind of made my hair look brittle.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought it was a coincidence that my skin improved because in the meanwhile, I started drinking water.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful and moisturizing, and I feel confident knowing I&#x27;m using a pure, non-chemical product.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s still some scars, but I can see it getting better too! :)</li>
            <li> This is by far the best oil I have ever used on my face and hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my face and hands look very smooth and moisturized and more youthful.  </li>
            <li> Terra&#x27;s version had great reviews, and it seems to be pure Argan</li>
            <li> I mostly use it after I&#x27;m home for the day and have washed my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would say it helps a somewhat, but the most benefit I get from this product is that it helps my skin not to scar or bruise from breakouts.</li>
            <li> I do like it better than the more odorous Moringa oil I ordered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many products and lotions that did one of two things...</li>
            <li> I can see what they are talking about, but to me it smells a bit more like a Band-Aid.</li>
            <li> We love the product.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> keeps my body and hair healthy and that makes it okay in my book.</li>
            <li> this is a reputable company who understands its brand well&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably just purchase the Acure oil (which I do like just a bit better) or try to find something else that comes with a dropper cap.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple brands and for some reason this one absorbs into my skin better.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my face and have been satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good as the reviews I&#x27;ve read, however I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It does sit on top of your face for a while...</li>
            <li> I love argan oil.</li>
            <li> I love the flexibility of this oil.  </li>
            <li> Not by a lot, but if you have stubby lashes like I do, it&#x27;s the difference between being able to grasp my lashes with the curler or crimping my skin instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that exposure to oxygen lessens the shelf life of argan oil (which is about a year), so the pump on the bottle is an added bonus (no need to unscrew the top).</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this argan oil and so does my husband.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> most oils I have tried before.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a silicon-free alternative to the famous turquoise Moroccan oil brand I used for my hair before.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> does make my hair more oily than shiny, which is not the effect I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I love this Shea Terra argan oil.  </li>
            <li> This one has a pump top and I like that better than the dropper.  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> The oil has a nice smooth texture on your skin</li>
            <li> My hair stylist swears by the stuff too, which makes me feel confident that it&#x27;s more than a passing fad.</li>
            <li> 2 pumps does a good job of taming my curls and frizz with no artificial fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The result is a softer, shinier look than with top quality shampoo/conditioner alone.</li>
            <li> My hair looks healthy again.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  </li>

            <li> My favorite beard, hair and skin oil.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes and softens better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> So glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> I have not used it more than once</li>
            <li> It provided a refreshing experience&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> had read about Argan oil and wanted to know and experience more about it.</li>
            <li> I do not like using products that have too many ingredients or added fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I put this on my hair, face....love, love it.</li>
            <li> I researched this oil on various sites and thought this was the best deal.</li>
            <li> and I am able to retain length, something I haven&#x27;t been able to do in years.  </li>
            <li> Great service and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Much better and faster results.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better now that it ever has.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Argan oil on my hair and skin (my face mostly) for about a month now.</li>
            <li> Love this oil and use it on my hair, skin, bath and even on leather.</li>
            <li> marvelous product been using for 2 years very moisturizing and am pretty sure it has helped my face maintain moisture/elasticity.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> This works great where I live for any skin issues caused by heat or chafing.</li>
            <li> and I was able to extract them easily, without damaging my skin.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a great, natural product and have recommended it friends.</li>
            <li> Happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> Smooths my skin texture, makes stubborn and stuck comedones easily extracted.  </li>
            <li> This is good quality, and I love the pump action.</li>
            <li> I use this with the Emu oil and it works great, it would be fantastic on its own, but I have very DRY skin, so I use them combined.</li>
            <li> I am 52, and I have mostly normal skin (good for my age) with spotty dryness in the colder months.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have a lot of them and it must be doing some good because I&#x27;m not getting new ones.</li>
            <li> I do have some fine lines</li>
            <li> it is helping tremendously with irritation,redness,flaking,etc!  </li>
            <li> It is a really fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, but I think when I finish this bottle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li> but I never saw results from any of the others, so I honestly didn&#x27;t have much hope for this product</li>
            <li> The argan oil smells fresh and authentic (nutty);</li>
            <li> The oil leaves my skin FABULOUS.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is non-greasy, absorbs immediately into the skin, and leaves skin smooth,  </li>
            <li> went on line to Amazon.com and filled in a request for return of the&lt;br /&gt;product and followed the instructions.  </li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave my hair silky smooth</li>
            <li> and I just like feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it as a supplement to my moisturizer in the winter and as a stand alone in the summer.</li>
            <li> It has no smell and the body is light which I like.</li>
            <li> However, I am still getting the same great results and I suppose the value of this product somewhat makes up for that.</li>
            <li> Overall a great beauty oil.</li>
            <li> It is such a great product.</li>
            <li> And since my face was doing great, I experimented applying it on my back.</li>
            <li> Make my skin smooth</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel silky smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I like the way it seems to smooth out my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product, I definitely recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far so good, but don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I like it very much and have already bought two more bottles.</li>
            <li> The price at first almost turned me away, but I decided to take a chance, and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I like the level of moisture this oil gives my face, it does feel like oil, there&#x27;s not doubt about that, but it feels clean.</li>
            <li> it has an amber pump bottle, which pumps clean (no splurts), thereby minimizing exposure to oxygen and light&lt;</li>
            <li> The light sesame like odor doesn&#x27;t bother me and dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li> Love this, cause it is pure oil.</li>
            <li> This product has been great, even better for my hair (less glue-like, more fluid-like) and even works on the skin (and I have very sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> It is also good for knees, elbows and upper arms.</li>
            <li> I love this so much</li>
            <li> He uses it every morning all over his face and his skin looks so good and way younger.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and actually has helped to bring some under the surface acne to a head (which is a good thing).</li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves a non sticky shine in the hair with out giving it a sticky look or feel if used properly.</li>
            <li> it made my hair nice and soft without all that grease on it.</li>
            <li> It works great in conjunction with my other hair products and does not make my hair greasy whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> Yes, there is a mild scent.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs into my skin fairly quickly, and I soon cannot tell I have applied it.</li>
            <li> As for the smell, it fades quickly once applied.</li>
            <li> but with the argan oil it feels so light, comfortable and dries fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my face too, it absorbs quickly, and softens the skin without being oily.</li>
            <li> I apply this to my nails and massage in every 2 days or so and it has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> Was very happy to receive it earlier than I thought especially since I&#x27;m going on vacation and need it.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look normal and healthy.</li>
            <li> The odor is not unpleasant, though, and fades rapidly.    </li>
            <li> oil absorbs quickly and easily if you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer, less frizzy, and my curls have great definition.</li>
            <li> My curls are more defined and bouncy and my hair is super soft.</li>
            <li> Fabulous for hair, it&#x27;s everything you hear about Argan oil, and 100% pure organic.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and a little goes</li>
            <li> My face is so smooth and the acne has really improved.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft and shiny :)</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted to use a more natural remedy.</li>
            <li> something that would be nice to have considering it only keeps for about a year.</li>
            <li> Love how it moisture&#x27;s and makes your skin soft...</li>
            <li> I love this stuff make your skin so soft like a newborn baby...</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my nails with much success.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it is a good product, a much cheaper alternative to Josie M.&#x27;s</li>
            <li> but the product is easily absorbed by your skin.  </li>
            <li> They are smaller, easily extracted and most of the time virtually invisible if I remain consistent with application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing special in a positive way about this product.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is rather nutty at first but dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> I would use it right after</li>
            <li> right before I began using this product.  </li>
            <li> I am an Estee Lauder person - however, use this on my face first thing in the morning, throw some moisturizing sun screen over the top and people are amazed when they find out how old I am.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive &amp; fair skin, and this oil irritated my facial skin.</li>
            <li> I have a few other brands of this oil and this one is really the best, it must be that it&#x27;s more concentrated or</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about the moisturizing properties, but unless you love splashing oil EVERYWHERE, and believe me, speaking as a dextrous and careful person who never spills, you WILL fling oil at some point all over a mirror, a blouse, a carpet...</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a month ago, and my hair hasn&#x27;t been this smooth and shinny since maybe I was little, and all natural ingredients makes it even better!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any magical differences (I don&#x27;t believe in magic in any case!)</li>
            <li> I would have never dreamed I would ever use oils on my acne prone skin, but I believe these products really have helped me tremendously.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly greasy but seems to do a good job moisturising my skin.</li>
            <li> And the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> So little of this oil is needed to achieve your desired look which makes it a good value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
            <li> I prefer the more plush, viscous texture of Acure&#x27;s oil, but they do seem to sink into skin and moisturize the same.</li>
            <li> You can thank me later :)</li>
            <li> My first experience with argan oil was based on the recommendation of a Moroccan tour guide.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 2 months since the first application and the last bike ride I took, I was able to comb the tangles out.</li>
            <li> On some days the skin can appear a bit too shiny, however a simple run over with a tissue suffices and the appropriate level of shine remains.</li>
            <li> But after I&#x27;ve religiously applied this to my face every night, I noticed my skin getting smoother and the color start to get better.</li>
            <li> I put this on my skin first and then apply the Shea Terra body cream...</li>
            <li> At first it looks like its going to go on greasy</li>
            <li> This has kept my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments on my hair looking soft and the color more rich.  </li>
            <li> so I originally bought this for my hair because I’ve used argan oils in the past and liked them.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many, many different moisturizers over the years, but nothing really helped enough.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend (who is very sensitive to smells) doesn&#x27;t mind the mild smell at all.</li>
            <li> Price is high but the product is worth it.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> (it got a lot of positive ratings hence my purchase) but</li>
            <li> I pretty much use it all over even my hair...</li>
            <li> Using pure, organic argan oil is far superior to any of the other so-called Moroccan argan products on the market I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The oil is slightly thinner and clearer than Acure&#x27;s, and to be honest</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel awesome and kept it well hydrated through the rough winter months when it usually dries out.</li>
            <li> My skin used to be slightly dry, but not any more.</li>
            <li> pure argan \\&quot;Moroccan\\</li>
            <li> I have ordered it twice to give it a real chance and to determine any thing positive results from using it.</li>
            <li> The pure argan oil is supposed to have roasted smell ,which it does , but I&#x27;m not liking the smell that much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to try this as my ultimate goal is to grow my hair out long and healthy.</li>
            <li> I like it even better than Moroccanoil - no strong perfumes, and it absorbs into the skin/hair quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great stuff because it is very thick and viscous.  </li>
            <li> This product has really worked for my skin.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> &quot; oil really nourishes hair and leaves it glossy yet never oily looking.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference using this oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Maple Holistics Argan shampoo and Silk 18 conditioner along with this, and it&#x27;s so much prettier.</li>
            <li> I really like Acure, but the bottle is frosted glass</li>
            <li> (at a much cheaper price!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews noted the smell of the product, but it does not bother me.  </li>
            <li> Can really tell the difference when I use this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shared it with co-workers, who also really like it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
            <li> Stays a bit oily if you use too much is all</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> He also likes how it dries fast without that</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast and the item is as described.</li>
            <li> but this oil helps so much.  </li>
            <li> Smells much like macadamia nuts.</li>
            <li> After much research I decided to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> It squirts out waaaaay too much.  </li>
            <li> very Greece&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what is causing that, and it may not be the argan oil.</li>
            <li> I like the product so much that I&#x27;m ordering a bottle for my mom and my mother-n-law.</li>
            <li> The pump cap cannot be removed - or at least I haven&#x27;t figure out how to do it - and a good amount of the oil remains inside after it stops pumping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am hoping the few sun-spots/blemish marks I have on my face will disappear with continued use, and honestly I think they will because it has practically changed the texture of my skin over night.</li>
            <li> It absorbs super quickly and my skin is left feeling very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> On wet hair, it absorbs right in making my hair light and silky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to edit my original review to include the fact that my aging hair, which was beginning to be very prone to breakage, has actually been strengthened by this oil.</li>
            <li> question whether it has any greater benefits over any other oil you could slather on your skill, like almond, coconut or even olive oil.</li>
            <li> It is a great value for the price as well because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Purchased it mainly to see if it really helps with psoriasis.</li>
            <li> After trying and loving a sample of Acure&#x27;s argan oil, I went looking for a larger bottle and debated for an embarrassingly long time over which brand to order.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, and it works really well for bumps on the upper arms.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to tell if that&#x27;s true, but it has now replaced my facial moisturizer!</li>
            <li> more like something I’d cook fish with less like something I want to wear.</li>
            <li> I use Tretinoin Cream from my dermatologist, so my face gets really dry and it starts to peal, as soon as I put this on, my face is so smooth, and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I mainly used it on my face, and added some to my lotion.</li>
            <li> I use the in all over my body mainly on my head.</li>
            <li> While it is a different scent, it is mild and you eventually forget it is even there.</li>
            <li> I havent used it in my hair much but the times that I did use it in my hair, it made it very soft and shiney.</li>
            <li> I am incredibly surprised with all of the positive reviews for this product.  </li>
            <li> so I tried using more and my head was an oily mess.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> would highly  recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Beats</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> just received my bottle, so I&#x27;ve only used it once and can&#x27;t attest to long-term results, but my first impression is mostly positive.</li>
            <li> It takes an hour or more to really absorb, so I use very little</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend, she says the product really does keep her skin moisturized all day and that she&#x27;s used it to completely replace her lotion.</li>
            <li> I use it more at night but it can also be worn under makeup, if you let it set a few minutes before you apply the makeup.</li>
            <li> I love my grey hair, but it lacks the luster of my former sable brunette.  </li>
            <li> They told me that was normal and it would go</li>
            <li> Used on my face a few times which was okay.</li>
            <li> I figured women who live in high temp areas must know what they are talking about.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it do wonders for my dry hair, but my skin never felt and looked better.</li>
            <li> All in all, a good product and probably preferable to other face creams because it&#x27;s natural, but not the miracle worker I expected from reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> My hair no longer feels like straw on the ends, and it stays that way right through to my next hair cut (I go every 6 weeks)</li>
            <li> Great product, a little goes a long way - last forever!!!!</li>
            <li> really think and pure product, would prefer a different brand or smell</li>
            <li> My hair was super dry -</li>
            <li> No, it&#x27;s not cheap, but I love that it&#x27;s a natural product with no perfumes or fillers.</li>
            <li> but it gave me milia, and it weighs down my fine hair for either styler or conditioner.</li>
            <li> It has a very natural and nutty fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> and I have very sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I do believe this is authentic raw Argan Oil from the extensive research I&#x27;ve done on the oil.</li>
            <li> and I prefer dark amber bottles to protect against light damage.</li>
            <li> The results were silky soft hair that never tangled again!</li>
            <li> It literally made my sore, chapped hands soft with one application!</li>
            <li> Wile my hair is fizz free and soft , but it becomes oily more quickly ,which I&#x27;m not liking :(</li>
            <li> Less is more, I only use one pump of oil for whatever I&#x27;m going to use it for: hair or skin.</li>
            <li> The oil is very light and absorbs well--it doesn&#x27;t feel like an extra heavy layer.</li>
            <li> I have MY real 30 year old&#x27;s head of hair back!  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin with mild-moderate adult acne.</li>
            <li> It does not cause breakouts and makes the skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> After using this for about 5 months, I noticed that this phenomenon had been completely eradicated.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> oil has also smoothed my skin completely.</li>
            <li> The smell is similar to sesame oil but is much milder.</li>
            <li> I buy it at my natural grocers after I bought it here because I can get it cheaper there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Shea Terra Organics Argan Oil for about a week now and my hair has completely changed.</li>
            <li> It works so well for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Although, DOES the job, my curly hair is soft, and non greasy looking but</li>
            <li> While it may do wonders for your hair, no one will want to stand near you.</li>
            <li> I recommend this oil if you are looking for a natural skin and hair care product.</li>
            <li> The only real negatives to this oil is the scent.</li>
            <li> I have stopped using hair conditioner or styling gel completely.</li>
            <li> I wake up with skin that looks radiant and is amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and shiny, and my cystic acne and winter skin disappear.</li>
            <li> (3) it should have a mild nutty fragrance and (4) it should be stored in a dark glass bottle.</li>
            <li> You can pay less and get inferior quality and pay more for no particular reason.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other beauty oils in the past (jojoba being an incredibly popular one)</li>
            <li> It has really helped my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> From research I&#x27;ve seen the scent most commonly described as either nutty or similar to rubberbands.</li>
            <li> Mine smelled mildly nutty like plain popcorn.</li>
            <li> My skin went from dull looking to smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is using it to clear up the bumps on the back of his arms</li>
            <li> I researched argan oil and there are several brands out there that vary wildly in price.</li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t completely disappeared yet but are alot smaller</li>
            <li> sit here typing with zit cream on my now many pimples because after using this product for a week I broke out worse than a teenager after a chocolate bar binger.  </li>
            <li> It makes your hands, arms, and face feel as smooth as a thick lotion would</li>
            <li> Only my real purpose for ordering was for my face which is very dry.</li>
            <li> I found it to be very helpful due to my skin issues and dryer skin in the winter month&#x27;s ...</li>
            <li> A small amount seems to go a long way, and it leaves my skin feeling nourished and smooth.  </li>
            <li> long lasting and makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is just a little dry and this makes my hair super oily.</li>
            <li> Compounding the natural dryness of the grey with the chemical body</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth the price and a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> Before it gets too dry, I add a few drops (a little goes a long way) to my palms and warm it up, then run it through the ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li> my colour treated and slightly dry hair becomes a soft, shiny halo of well defined and glossy curls.  </li>
            <li> I have skin that doesn&#x27;t get too dry or too oily and so far this hasnt change how my skin feels (besides making it softer).</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel soft, but makes my skin burn a little that&#x27;s from chemicals still in body skins very sensitive</li>
            <li> i subject it to makes it appear even more dull.  </li>
            <li> Initially, I used the dime-sized amount I normally need with other products and the result was a slicked back look reminiscent of guys from the 50s.</li>
            <li> Both have a slightly odd smell, which is normal and desired for argan oil - to me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since Feb 20, 2012 and the blackheads from my nose have decreased significantly.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this, I used it very sparingly because it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
            <li> Likewise, when I apply it on wet hair and then immediately blow dry, it keeps my hair soft, shiny, manageable, and healthy-looking.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because the scent (which the bottle says is natural) is slightly off-putting.</li>
            <li> My cheeks used to have small comedones that weren&#x27;t very visible, but could be felt under the skin.</li>
            <li> I am normally a budget shopper, so I do not like to waste my money on anything.  </li>
            <li> When I let my hair down in the morning, it is silky soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything good or bad when used on my long (dry) hair.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last very long at all.</li>
            <li> So I use it on my face especially my forehead that is dry.</li>
            <li> As much as I love the concept and want to use products free of chemicals that are also beneficial to my hair, this is the worst smelling product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Bought this to work into my beard prior to my daily wet shave.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy Moroccan Oil, but decided to try something different for a change since this got very positive reviews and is basically the same price of the Moroccan Oil small bottle but is over double the size.  </li>
            <li> One was very pricey compared to Shea Terra, the other a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> However you become acclamated to the scent and it doesn&#x27;t linger long after application.</li>
            <li> But the dry, flaking skin disappears and stays gone for long hours.</li>
            <li> Recently over the past few years my skin has become drier ( but some would still probably consider it really oily).</li>
            <li> a &#x27;very&#x27; long way.</li>
            <li> It has cleared up my acne and dry skin issues.</li>
            <li> share this with my friends and it works on both oily and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I use Retin A, which helps, but also causes flaking, dry skin.</li>
            <li> bought this because of its claimed benefits for acne prone and dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin gets dry on occasion, but tends to be oily.</li>
            <li> I went looking for argon oil after my hairdresser suggested I rub some on my chronically dry and brittle ends.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any hair products and don&#x27;t abuse it with heat damage, but my hair was always really dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> It helps me to soothe dry skin.</li>
            <li> This can also be applied to dry hair before washing as a moisturising treatment.  </li>
            <li> In the winter, I sometimes use it as a face or body moisturizer when I get dry patches.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my dry skin and can see a difference after just one use.</li>
            <li> I shower and towel dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> main complaint, and the reason for the 4 star review, is the packaging.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s also problematic because once you get down to the bottom of the bottle, there&#x27;s going to be quite a bit of oil left inside</li>
            <li> My very fine hair got destroyed by a bad dye job.  </li>
            <li> I came back from a motorcycle ride and my hair was a tangled mess, so I put some of the Argan Oil on my dry hair and wrapped it in a towel for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I wrote a bit of a negative review at first but after using it for a few months it I change my review to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> my overall hair health improves in next few weeks , I will upgrade my rating to 5 , but for now it remains 3 !</li>
            <li> It has helped some deep black heads on my cheek.  </li>
            <li> As I was unable to assess products on line, I think I got lucky, and have re-ordered</li>
            <li> Now that depends on which branding mogul is backing the brand and the marketing costs, but really, when it comes down to it, you should be looking for four things: (1) 100% pure argan oil (there should be no other ingredients), (2) it should be cold-pressed,</li>
            <li> My hair is still very dry</li>
            <li> so my hands, nails and cuticals get very dry.</li>
            <li> This is a 2 oz bottle, but I imagine this lasting me a while since I use so little.</li>
            <li> You can even add a little lavender or frankensense essential oil to cover the scent and get additional nutrients.</li>
            <li> My friend, on the other hand, has dry skin and the argan oil helps her with her acne and keeps her skin moist all day.</li>
            <li> far as my acne goes, it does not aggravate it in the least bit.</li>
            <li> Small bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit expensive, but the quality of this product is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t at all noticeable to me - just a hint of a nutty fragrance, which is to be expected from a nut-based oil.</li>
            <li> One pump applied to my wet hair just after the shower</li>
            <li> I add this to a base with some other oils for a nice skin are combo.</li>
            <li> A little it goes a long way, too.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way while applying.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long ways, will re purchase</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This little bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way and it makes my skin and hair softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> A little of this oil goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I also use this oil on the ends of my hair since it tends to get a little brittle from wearing my hair in a tight bun all day, and the ends of my hair are softer almost instantly.</li>
            <li> Family members have not mentioned that I smell any worse than normal.</li>
            <li> I will NEVER buy any other brand of Argan Oil (unless of course the product changes in some way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottle says that you can use it as a deep conditioning treatment by massaging the oil into your scalp and then shampooing as usual.</li>
            <li> Turns out, Morocco Oil is silicone-based and only has a small amount of Argan Oil in it.</li>
            <li> a lot of other oils</li>
            <li> I notice with this oil I can extend my shampoo to every other day.</li>
            <li> Even though I did notice a difference with the other two, it was nothing like Shea Terra.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my wrinkles, though, nor in small and occasional rashes/irritations that I used to get before using the oil</li>
            <li> but they are very minimal.</li>
            <li> I also use it everyday on my face and neck and don&#x27;t have that itchy dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li> So I’m a lousy pimple faced clammy haired strange smelling scientist whose chance on a new beauty product didn’t pay off.</li>
            <li> They must have been there for at least two months before and then suddenly came to head</li>
            <li> Like the dark brown glass bottle too.  </li>
            <li> The oil is good, cold pressed and real argan yet smells very bad (rancid).</li>
            <li> It is raw, not highly processed, oil.  </li>
            <li> That silicone will build up and cause problems down the line, according to what I read, so I wondered if I could just buy the Argan and skip all the fillers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> An extremely small amount goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> Shea Terra&#x27;s scent is slightly milder and less noticeable, if that sort of thing bothers you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> complaints about the smell are a bit overrated , there is a slight odor</li>
            <li> I found no real redeeming qualities to the product, except the bottle.</li>
            <li> Puritan&#x27;s Pride has their brand for much less.</li>
            <li> Just a tiny dab will suffice for shoulder length hair ... seriously.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t believe what wonders it worked on my graying, slightly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It did not smell like the previous ones.  </li>
            <li> and I have to get a half perm, plus I have color in my hair, so</li>
            <li> Slightly nutty smell</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not doing it right or whatever, but it&#x27;s also incredibly annoying that this is meant to be used as a deep conditioner...</li>
            <li> I have really thick south Asian hair , so wanted something to tame the fizz and improve the health of my hair.</li>
            <li> Usually I put it on wet hair and then tie in up into a bun and sleep on it overnight.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and there is a nutty smell that I hardly notice anymore.</li>
            <li> It does take a little longer to absorb than a typical moisturizer so plan the nightly routine accordingly.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit odd, but after a few seconds that is gone.  </li>
            <li> Deducting half a star because of the pump which can be messy.</li>
            <li> it smells a little rubbery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a little bit of a smell to it</li>
            <li> I even put a little in the bath sometimes.</li>
            <li> I have purchased two other brands in the past.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad (assuming its fresh).</li>
            <li> I was an avid user on JM argan oil and that one did not have this slightly unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li> It also helps to diminish past discoloration from breakouts, but not really so much for past</li>
            <li> they either moisturized my skin and gave me breakouts or dried out my skin and kept the acne at bay.</li>
            <li> But within a few minutes the scent goes away.</li>
            <li> it a few weeks</li>
            <li> The skin was not smooth, but rather uneven and porous.</li>
            <li> After they raised their prices a few months ago I started to look for something else.</li>
            <li> It doesnt have a girly scent or a heavy medicine smell.</li>
            <li> I am 50 and it revived my hair with 1 or 2 drops on towel dried hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;A couple of pumps (a few drops) of oil improves my hair&#x27;s texture and makes it manageable.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops makes the frizz go away.</li>
            <li> I have had a few problems around my nose</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not strong, distracting or even that noticeable after applying.</li>
            <li> I ended up with Shea Terra because it had overall positive reviews, is from a trust-worthy company, comes in a dark bottle, and at less than $20 for 2 oz on Amazon, the price is an insane steal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is raw, cold-pressed and organic&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to control how much oil comes out, and pretty impossible to dispense a very small amount like you could with a dropper cap.</li>
            <li> something I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since the oil is expensive, this situation is especially frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other brand I bought had such a bad smell I don&#x27;t even use it</li>
            <li> At least it hasn&#x27;t irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it under my eyes, on my skin, and in &#x27;very&#x27; small amounts on my hair.</li>
            <li> I desperately needed something for my dry, highlighted hair.</li>
            <li> Smearing oil on your face not a good idea,</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with this product and am sending back.</li>
            <li> so for all of you that worry about the secret ingredients, there isn&#x27;t any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I understand I may have chosen the wrong product for my skin type, there was nothing indicating what type of skin it is designed for.</li>
            <li> awful, greasy left over feeling that</li>
            <li> I began to have a halo of hair that broke off just a few inches from my scalp which looked awful.</li>
            <li> However, I was afraid to use it on my face during the summer as I am acne prone.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it might be too greasy, but that is not the case at all.  </li>
            <li> I wrong as ever!</li>
            <li> Someone stole it from me :(</li>
            <li> I hate the pump.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product has really worked for my skin. I have combination skin with mild-moderate adult acne. Recently over the past few years my skin has become drier ( but some would still probably consider it really oily). I like the level of moisture this oil gives my face, it does feel like oil, there&#x27;s not doubt about that, but it feels clean. It takes an hour or more to really absorb, so I use very little and I do not apply makeup afterwards. I mostly use it after I&#x27;m home for the day and have washed my face.&lt;br /&gt;As far as my acne goes, it does not aggravate it in the least bit. I would say it helps a somewhat, but the most benefit I get from this product is that it helps my skin not to scar or bruise from breakouts. It also helps to diminish past discoloration from breakouts, but not really so much for past scarring.&lt;br /&gt;I have also used olive oil soap from kiss my face in conjunction with this oil. I would have never dreamed I would ever use oils on my acne prone skin, but I believe these products really have helped me tremendously.</li>
            <li> This seems like a nice oil.  I&#x27;m trying it for the first time.  I do like it better than the more odorous Moringa oil I ordered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to using Argan oil in my hair but this stuff was so oily it made my hair look greasy. Won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive &amp; fair skin, and this oil irritated my facial skin. My cheeks became really red. When I stopped using it on my face, the redness went away. I do like it for my hands, cuticles &amp; feet. Only my real purpose for ordering was for my face which is very dry. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many products and lotions that did one of two things...they either moisturized my skin and gave me breakouts or dried out my skin and kept the acne at bay. I&#x27;ve even used 100% Argan Oil and products that contained Argan Oil and none work as well as this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil absorbs quickly and easily if you don&#x27;t use too much. It has cleared up my acne and dry skin issues. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad (assuming its fresh). Another reviewer mentioned it has a rubberband-like smell...I can see what they are talking about, but to me it smells a bit more like a Band-Aid. It&#x27;s not strong, distracting or even that noticeable after applying. Family members have not mentioned that I smell any worse than normal. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure it&#x27;s a bit expensive, but the quality of this product is definitely worth it. I will NEVER buy any other brand of Argan Oil (unless of course the product changes in some way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For great looking skin, I trade off between this and the Shea Terra Nilotic Shea Butter. I always apply after shaving my face, showering or before bed.</li>
            <li> This oil is wonderful.  It does not cause breakouts and makes the skin so soft.  The smell is a bit odd, but after a few seconds that is gone.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t care for the smell. I suppose it does smell a bit like toasted sesame oil. But within a few minutes the scent goes away. It absorbs quickly, and it works really well for bumps on the upper arms. A little it goes a long way, too.</li>
            <li> Great service and great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blond. My hair loves this product!. It Is anti freeze. My hair has a nice shine and gloss. It is healthier since I started using Shea terra argan oil.</li>
            <li> Excellent for hair. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to edit my original review to include the fact that my aging hair, which was beginning to be very prone to breakage, has actually been strengthened by this oil. I began to have a halo of hair that broke off just a few inches from my scalp which looked awful. After using this for about 5 months, I noticed that this phenomenon had been completely eradicated. It is a really fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pure argan \\&quot;Moroccan\\&quot; oil really nourishes hair and leaves it glossy yet never oily looking. After using this item for about one week, a man that I didn&#x27;t know asked me if I had just returned from having my hair done. The irony was I combed the oil into my damp hair and left without giving it a second look. His comment was that he thought it looked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also works great for detangling, something that has become my nemesis since I started color treating my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice: Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it. So little of this oil is needed to achieve your desired look which makes it a good value.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I use it everywhere!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my hair (as the directions said I could use it) but it wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be. So I use it on my face especially my forehead that is dry. I like the way it feels on my skin. It is also good for knees, elbows and upper arms. I use it more at night but it can also be worn under makeup, if you let it set a few minutes before you apply the makeup. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Nothing special in a positive way about this product. I have ordered it twice to give it a real chance and to determine any thing positive results from using it. My dermatologist thinks it is the cause of my scalp hair follicles clogging up and resulting in my scalp to become irritated.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference using this oil. I mainly used it on my face, and added some to my lotion. I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a repeat order and am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Bought this to work into my beard prior to my daily wet shave.  It&#x27;s great stuff because it is very thick and viscous.  One press of oil, massaged into my whiskers, makes for an excellent shave when I use it with a good shaving soap.  For good measure, I sometimes use it as an aftershave balm, as well.  A little goes a long way.  One could probably add this Argan to olive or almond oil, or both, and have a great shaving experience while stretching the oil even farther.      Yes, there is a mild scent.  It is raw, not highly processed, oil.  The odor is not unpleasant, though, and fades rapidly.    Bottom line:  Great product. Great price.</li>
            <li> Shinier healthier hair.  My hair was super dry - I&#x27;ve been using Maple Holistics Argan shampoo and Silk 18 conditioner along with this, and it&#x27;s so much prettier.</li>
            <li> We love the product.  It softens skin like nothing else we&#x27;ve tried.  We also use it in our hair.</li>
            <li> I use this with the Emu oil and it works great, it would be fantastic on its own, but I have very DRY skin, so I use them combined. Try this prod. you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> This product is the miracle solution. Goes from skin to hair. keeps my body and hair healthy and that makes it okay in my book. Great product.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) it is raw, cold-pressed and organic&lt;br /&gt;2) it is a good value for the amount&lt;br /&gt;3) this is a reputable company who understands its brand well&lt;br /&gt;4) this company hand-selected a cooperative of women in Morocco as the source for the oil&lt;br /&gt;5) it has an amber pump bottle, which pumps clean (no splurts), thereby minimizing exposure to oxygen and light&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I share this with my friends and it works on both oily and dry skin.  I would say it has a plumping effect, it absorbs well, and it lasts all day on my skin.</li>
            <li> After trying and loving a sample of Acure&#x27;s argan oil, I went looking for a larger bottle and debated for an embarrassingly long time over which brand to order. I really like Acure, but the bottle is frosted glass and I prefer dark amber bottles to protect against light damage. I ended up with Shea Terra because it had overall positive reviews, is from a trust-worthy company, comes in a dark bottle, and at less than $20 for 2 oz on Amazon, the price is an insane steal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received my bottle, so I&#x27;ve only used it once and can&#x27;t attest to long-term results, but my first impression is mostly positive. The oil is slightly thinner and clearer than Acure&#x27;s, and to be honest I prefer the more plush, viscous texture of Acure&#x27;s oil, but they do seem to sink into skin and moisturize the same. Both have a slightly odd smell, which is normal and desired for argan oil - to me it smells a little rubbery. Shea Terra&#x27;s scent is slightly milder and less noticeable, if that sort of thing bothers you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main complaint, and the reason for the 4 star review, is the packaging. I hate the pump. It&#x27;s very difficult to control how much oil comes out, and pretty impossible to dispense a very small amount like you could with a dropper cap. I thought maybe I could just switch the pump cap out for a dropper, but nope, the cap doesn&#x27;t come off. That&#x27;s also problematic because once you get down to the bottom of the bottle, there&#x27;s going to be quite a bit of oil left inside that the pump can&#x27;t get to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, but I think when I finish this bottle I&#x27;ll probably just purchase the Acure oil (which I do like just a bit better) or try to find something else that comes with a dropper cap.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple brands and for some reason this one absorbs into my skin better.  No greasy residue in the morning.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I am in my 40s, and have always had problems with acne. I use Retin A, which helps, but also causes flaking, dry skin. I have tried many, many different moisturizers over the years, but nothing really helped enough. Until I found this oil. It&#x27;s fabulous. It absorbs into my skin fairly quickly, and I soon cannot tell I have applied it. But the dry, flaking skin disappears and stays gone for long hours. Nothing else has even come close to this.It makes my skin look normal and healthy. I would give it six stars out of five! Even my 13-year-old daughter, who has almost no skin problems, loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I no longer use hair styling products on my hair. My hair no longer feels like straw on the ends, and it stays that way right through to my next hair cut (I go every 6 weeks) I have been using this product since Jan 2015 and this is my 2nd order. I will continue on ordering too!</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel awesome and kept it well hydrated through the rough winter months when it usually dries out.</li>
            <li> I love this so much so I cannot put it into words but would like to say that I bought one for my Mom and a great friend .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a few weeks and you WILL notice a difference , I use a Mia skincare brush and this oil and don&#x27;t wear any powders or foundations and I am 40 .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some complaints about the smell are a bit overrated , there is a slight odor but it&#x27;s natural so it shouldn&#x27;t smell like something it isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY BUY IT !! You can thank me later :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my face and have been satisfied with it. It&#x27;s as good as the reviews I&#x27;ve read, however I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.  Just one person&#x27;s opinion though, the oil is otherwise very nice.  Though I didn&#x27;t notice any age-reducing effects which is what argan oil is praised for.</li>
            <li> It is great.  It is not oily.  It makes my face and hands look very smooth and moisturized and more youthful.  I highly recommend this product. A little bit goes a long way while applying.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Makes my skin glow from within.  Smooths my skin texture, makes stubborn and stuck comedones easily extracted.  It does sit on top of your face for a while...It doesn&#x27;t sink in after 30 seconds for me which is bothersome a bit.  But the benefits outweigh this.  The packaging is also great.  I got the pump bottle so that I didn&#x27;t have to keep opening it and exposing it to air.  It has not oxidized (knock on wood) and I have about 2/3 -3/4 left since purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because of its claimed benefits for acne prone and dry skin. I&#x27;ve used other beauty oils in the past (jojoba being an incredibly popular one) but I never saw results from any of the others, so I honestly didn&#x27;t have much hope for this product either.&lt;br /&gt;Was I wrong as ever! Three days after using this product, all of the stubborn comedones from my cheek bones had purged out. They must have been there for at least two months before and then suddenly came to head and I was able to extract them easily, without damaging my skin. That&#x27;s just the beginning of it. I&#x27;ve been using this product since Feb 20, 2012 and the blackheads from my nose have decreased significantly. They are smaller, easily extracted and most of the time virtually invisible if I remain consistent with application.&lt;br /&gt;This oil has also smoothed my skin completely. My cheeks used to have small comedones that weren&#x27;t very visible, but could be felt under the skin. The skin was not smooth, but rather uneven and porous. Now, I don&#x27;t have any of these issues.</li>
            <li> I wrote a bit of a negative review at first but after using it for a few months it I change my review to 5 stars. It is a great oil for the skin. The smell is similar to sesame oil but is much milder. This is a great price for the amount of oil you get.</li>
            <li> I love argan oil. This is good quality, and I love the pump action. I buy it at my natural grocers after I bought it here because I can get it cheaper there.</li>
            <li> I had parathyroid disease and had some hair loss being a woman I was concerned and went to the internet and found argon oil. I ordered and used it but it made my head itch.</li>
            <li> The argan oil smells fresh and authentic (nutty); great product.  I use it on my skin, hair and nails.</li>
            <li> I add this to a base with some other oils for a nice skin are combo.</li>
            <li> Great product!!  I love the flexibility of this oil.  It is light-weight and can be used on skin and hair.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> Does not smell the best but it works well really think and pure product, would prefer a different brand or smell</li>
            <li> When I first bought this, I used it very sparingly because it&#x27;s so expensive. I only used it for my eye area, hoping to stave off wrinkles. Then I noticed after some time that my lashes are longer. Not by a lot, but if you have stubby lashes like I do, it&#x27;s the difference between being able to grasp my lashes with the curler or crimping my skin instead. So just for that this oil has my loyalty.&lt;br /&gt;Now I use it for my face after I use the salicylic gel peel. It&#x27;s slightly greasy but seems to do a good job moisturising my skin. I haven&#x27;t noticed any effect on my wrinkles but I don&#x27;t have a lot of them and it must be doing some good because I&#x27;m not getting new ones.</li>
            <li> I like the oil, but am not sure how much it really penetrates the skin vs just sitting on the surface(or rubbing off on my pillow at night!).  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any magical differences (I don&#x27;t believe in magic in any case!) At least it hasn&#x27;t irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I question whether it has any greater benefits over any other oil you could slather on your skill, like almond, coconut or even olive oil. (at a much cheaper price!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews noted the smell of the product, but it does not bother me.  It has a very natural and nutty fragrance.  So far so good, but don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and makes my hair so soft! A little bit goes a long ways, will re purchase</li>
            <li> Works great on hair!! Can really tell the difference when I use this stuff. Makes my hair so soft and shiny :)</li>
            <li> The oil was good but it had a stronger odor than I was accustomed to.</li>
            <li> My skin gets dry on occasion, but tends to be oily. I bought this because I wanted to use a more natural remedy. The product made me break out. It felt like I was rubbing vegetable oil all over my face. I did not care for the texture or the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I understand I may have chosen the wrong product for my skin type, there was nothing indicating what type of skin it is designed for. The smell was not the best, either. I found no real redeeming qualities to the product, except the bottle. I did like that it was in a glass bottle.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a 4 oz size, so when I got it and saw it was only 2 oz I sent it back. Puritan&#x27;s Pride has their brand for much less.</li>
            <li> I went looking for argon oil after my hairdresser suggested I rub some on my chronically dry and brittle ends. I don&#x27;t use any hair products and don&#x27;t abuse it with heat damage, but my hair was always really dry and damaged. I&#x27;ve been using Shea Terra Organics Argan Oil for about a week now and my hair has completely changed. My curls are more defined and bouncy and my hair is super soft. I apply it on my damp ends after I&#x27;ve showered. Less is more, I only use one pump of oil for whatever I&#x27;m going to use it for: hair or skin. The bottle says that you can use it as a deep conditioning treatment by massaging the oil into your scalp and then shampooing as usual. I&#x27;m excited to try this as my ultimate goal is to grow my hair out long and healthy. This is a 2 oz bottle, but I imagine this lasting me a while since I use so little. I&#x27;ve read that exposure to oxygen lessens the shelf life of argan oil (which is about a year), so the pump on the bottle is an added bonus (no need to unscrew the top). It&#x27;s also a great post facial-cleanse moisturizer! Again I only use one pump, rub it between my hands and then apply to my face. It absorbs super quickly and my skin is left feeling very soft and hydrated. I&#x27;ve read that it evens out skin tone and fades acne scars? It&#x27;s too soon to tell if that&#x27;s true, but it has now replaced my facial moisturizer! I researched argan oil and there are several brands out there that vary wildly in price. Now that depends on which branding mogul is backing the brand and the marketing costs, but really, when it comes down to it, you should be looking for four things: (1) 100% pure argan oil (there should be no other ingredients), (2) it should be cold-pressed, (3) it should have a mild nutty fragrance and (4) it should be stored in a dark glass bottle. As for the smell, it fades quickly once applied. Mine smelled mildly nutty like plain popcorn. I&#x27;m giving this brand 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t seem to have an expiration date on it, something that would be nice to have considering it only keeps for about a year.</li>
            <li> I have a few other brands of this oil and this one is really the best, it must be that it&#x27;s more concentrated or something I&#x27;m not sure but I love it. The other brand I bought had such a bad smell I don&#x27;t even use it and it didn&#x27;t soak in like this one. I love this argan oil and so does my husband. He uses it every morning all over his face and his skin looks so good and way younger. He is having me order another one, for this price I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase and will be ordering it from now on. Love it.</li>
            <li> I use the in all over my body mainly on my head. I went through breast cancer and after losing all my hair and finished up all my treatment I went back to using when my hair started growing. Makes my hair feel soft, but makes my skin burn a little that&#x27;s from chemicals still in body skins very sensitive</li>
            <li> My first experience with argan oil was based on the recommendation of a Moroccan tour guide.  I figured women who live in high temp areas must know what they are talking about.  This works great where I live for any skin issues caused by heat or chafing.</li>
            <li> I like it very much and have already bought two more bottles. would highly  recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Beats most oils I have tried before.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really wonderful stuff make my hair smooth and shiny love it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a silicon-free alternative to the famous turquoise Moroccan oil brand I used for my hair before.&lt;br /&gt;This oil is very nice on the skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for your hair though.&lt;br /&gt;It does make my hair more oily than shiny, which is not the effect I was hoping for. If you are looking for a good skincare product, go for it!</li>
            <li> Love this, cause it is pure oil. Great for face, hands and hair. It helps me to soothe dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love this Shea Terra argan oil.  It has really helped my dry skin.  This one has a pump top and I like that better than the dropper.  Like the dark brown glass bottle too.  It&#x27;s a winner.</li>
            <li> This is a an awesome product!!!!&lt;br /&gt; I found it to be very helpful due to my skin issues and dryer skin in the winter month&#x27;s ...Iv used for years now and never stopped buying it plus u can use it all over your body and hair...Love this.</li>
            <li> The oil leaves my skin FABULOUS. I cannot say enough good things about the moisturizing properties, but unless you love splashing oil EVERYWHERE, and believe me, speaking as a dextrous and careful person who never spills, you WILL fling oil at some point all over a mirror, a blouse, a carpet... I&#x27;m resorting to opening it and dabbing with my finger tip. A little goes a long way. Maybe an eye-dropper bottle could be re-purposed... but don&#x27;t let that keep you from getting this product. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of oils on the market but I bought this for myself and as a gift so I was picky about it being organic and from a company with product integrity.  I found all that in this argan oil. It works well on face, body and in my hair.  The fragrance is rather nutty at first but dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> I make this purchase once per month.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product as moisturizer for my hair. It works so well for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I had used the brand-name Moroccan Oil for years. After they raised their prices a few months ago I started to look for something else. This product has been great, even better for my hair (less glue-like, more fluid-like) and even works on the skin (and I have very sensitive skin). Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like the oil. The smell isn&#x27;t at all noticeable to me - just a hint of a nutty fragrance, which is to be expected from a nut-based oil. I use it on my hair and sometimes my skin. I like it even better than Moroccanoil - no strong perfumes, and it absorbs into the skin/hair quickly. And the price was very reasonable. I&#x27;ve shared it with co-workers, who also really like it. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a month now and I love it!!!  Love how it moisture&#x27;s and makes your skin soft...</li>
            <li> I mix this with silk drops and apply to the ends of my hair when it is damp from the shower, and it does wonders for my ends.  They feel like fresh-cut ends.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> Since everyone is different maybe this product will work for you (it got a lot of positive ratings hence my purchase) but it did not please me.&lt;br /&gt;I sit here typing with zit cream on my now many pimples because after using this product for a week I broke out worse than a teenager after a chocolate bar binger.  Smearing oil on your face not a good idea, who knew?&lt;br /&gt;The smell…more like something I’d cook fish with less like something I want to wear. Now I know I know “it’s organic…all natural…blah blah”  Turns out I’m a fan of chemistry and things like fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Ok so I originally bought this for my hair because I’ve used argan oils in the past and liked them.  I saw the stars the rave reviews and thought nature made must be better…right? No.  Nature made hurricanes and cockroaches and I don’t like those either.  The oil has a nice smooth texture on your skin but it turns sticky and tacky in your hair.  I experimented with amount and couldn’t find one that worked for me.  So I’m a lousy pimple faced clammy haired strange smelling scientist whose chance on a new beauty product didn’t pay off.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my hair after reading about it in another review.  I use it solely as a treatment for my hair, using about a dime size amount worked through starting with the ends.  Usually I put it on wet hair and then tie in up into a bun and sleep on it overnight.  When I let my hair down in the morning, it is silky soft and shiny.  Likewise, when I apply it on wet hair and then immediately blow dry, it keeps my hair soft, shiny, manageable, and healthy-looking.  I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments on my hair looking soft and the color more rich.  My hair stylist swears by the stuff too, which makes me feel confident that it&#x27;s more than a passing fad.</li>
            <li> 2 pumps does a good job of taming my curls and frizz with no artificial fragrance.  I like that it&#x27;s organic, too.</li>
            <li> Tried using this on my hair.  Was recommended by a hairstylist.  It didn&#x27;t do much for me so I tried using more and my head was an oily mess.  I give up.</li>
            <li> I love my grey hair, but it lacks the luster of my former sable brunette.  Compounding the natural dryness of the grey with the chemical body wave i subject it to makes it appear even more dull.  Using pure, organic argan oil is far superior to any of the other so-called Moroccan argan products on the market I&#x27;ve used. Just a tiny dab will suffice for shoulder length hair ... seriously. Initially, I used the dime-sized amount I normally need with other products and the result was a slicked back look reminiscent of guys from the 50s. This bottle will last for months, making it an inexpensive investment for hair care.  The result is a softer, shinier look than with top quality shampoo/conditioner alone. My hair looks healthy again.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  My skin feels so good after using it. It does take a little longer to absorb than a typical moisturizer so plan the nightly routine accordingly.</li>
            <li> My skin glows from using this stuff! Don&#x27;t worry about the smell others mention. While it is a different scent, it is mild and you eventually forget it is even there. You can even add a little lavender or frankensense essential oil to cover the scent and get additional nutrients. I use one pump in the am and one in the pm (after wash) and I never feel or look greasy. I use it 365 days a year without issues. My skin used to be slightly dry, but not any more. Also works great on cuticles.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff make your skin so soft like a newborn baby...no crows feet for this sister..I pretty much use it all over even my hair...its great product</li>
            <li> The oil is good, cold pressed and real argan yet smells very bad (rancid). I can smell it 1 hr after I applied in my hair (curly) and skin. Although, DOES the job, my curly hair is soft, and non greasy looking but moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend if you can pass the smell, that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I desperately needed something for my dry, highlighted hair. I was told to get Morrocon Oil by my Hairdresser, but after finding this product on Amazon, I decided to give it a try. I came back from a motorcycle ride and my hair was a tangled mess, so I put some of the Argan Oil on my dry hair and wrapped it in a towel for 30 minutes. The results were silky soft hair that never tangled again! It&#x27;s been 2 months since the first application and the last bike ride I took, I was able to comb the tangles out. This has never happened before!!!  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> marvelous product been using for 2 years very moisturizing and am pretty sure it has helped my face maintain moisture/elasticity. Can&#x27;t be proven, of course. Helps the moisturizer go on. Stays a bit oily if you use too much is all</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Morocco Oil at my last haircut and I couldn&#x27;t believe what wonders it worked on my graying, slightly frizzy hair. Soooo smooooooth! When I checked it out on Amazon, I almost swallowed my tongue at the price, though, so I started researching. Turns out, Morocco Oil is silicone-based and only has a small amount of Argan Oil in it. That silicone will build up and cause problems down the line, according to what I read, so I wondered if I could just buy the Argan and skip all the fillers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea Terra&#x27;s version had great reviews, and it seems to be pure Argan so I invested and I&#x27;ve been thrilled! I not only use it on my hair to help with the frizzes, but also my face. It soaks in instantaneously and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feeling whatsoever. No, it&#x27;s not cheap, but I love that it&#x27;s a natural product with no perfumes or fillers. I&#x27;d pay extra for that privilege but with Shea Terra Argan Oil I don&#x27;t have to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review gave you information that was helpful, please feel free to click the YES button below!</li>
            <li> Argan oil is non-greasy, absorbs immediately into the skin, and leaves skin smooth,  I use it on my hair, face (it gives a warm glow), neck, and body. An extremely small amount goes a very long way. It literally made my sore, chapped hands soft with one application!</li>
            <li> As much as I love the concept and want to use products free of chemicals that are also beneficial to my hair, this is the worst smelling product I have ever used. I put it in my hair before bed and I had to immediately wash it out because I smelled like a horse farm. While it may do wonders for your hair, no one will want to stand near you. I had to return.</li>
            <li> When I opened the product and put it on my face, it smelled rancid.&lt;br /&gt;I called the company.  They told me that was normal and it would go&lt;br /&gt;away.  I have used this kind of oil from another company and never&lt;br /&gt;had any problem.&lt;br /&gt;I went on line to Amazon.com and filled in a request for return of the&lt;br /&gt;product and followed the instructions.  Amazon has notified me that&lt;br /&gt;they are giving me a refund.</li>
            <li> After buying a crappy argan oil (agadir) I was determined to find an argan oil that was going to take care of my hair :) Some one recommended this product to me and know I am really happy with what it does to my hair. It doesnt have a girly scent or a heavy medicine smell. Its just regular. I hope this helps all of you and HAPPY HAIR IS A HAPPY PERSON :)</li>
            <li> . The dispenser is wonderful and so is the price, but the scent me from wanting to repurchase it, and from recommending it.</li>
            <li> This product is brilliant! after hearing the change that argan oil can make to hair, I decided to try it out, and honestly I couldn&#x27;t be happier. One pump applied to my wet hair just after the shower and I am done for the day- my colour treated and slightly dry hair becomes a soft, shiny halo of well defined and glossy curls.  This can also be applied to dry hair before washing as a moisturising treatment.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my hair..but didn&#x27;t make my hair any better...Used on my face a few times which was okay. kinda greasy and takes a while to absorb</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I wondered if it might make my face feel oily, but it doesn&#x27;t at all. Feels wonderful and moisturizing, and I feel confident knowing I&#x27;m using a pure, non-chemical product. Also gives my face a beautiful glow!</li>
            <li> This product did not work well on my hair at all and it wasn&#x27;t cheap.  It didn&#x27;t leave my hair silky smooth like I thought it would, it left it greasy and I didn&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> This is not made for all hair types. My hair is just a little dry and this makes my hair super oily. I cannot even use it.  Also, on the bottle it says to put on in the shower and rinse out (which I did) but I was looking for something leave-in.</li>
            <li> I use this oil on my face more than I use it in my hair. I love this product, it is not greasy at all. I put it on my face and my skin absorbs it soo nicely. It leaves my skin very soft and hydrated. I havent used it in my hair much but the times that I did use it in my hair, it made it very soft and shiney. I recommend this oil if you are looking for a natural skin and hair care product.</li>
            <li> It softens the skin, no question on that. Didn&#x27;t try it on the hair and not planning to. Purchased it mainly to see if it really helps with psoriasis. It doesn&#x27;t. Not a bit.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems legit. You can pay less and get inferior quality and pay more for no particular reason. I use this mostly as a nail treatment and moisturizer for my fingers and toes during my self-pedicures. In the winter, I sometimes use it as a face or body moisturizer when I get dry patches. I have tried it as a facial moisturizer but it gave me milia, and it weighs down my fine hair for either styler or conditioner. I have friends with coarser hair and dryer skin and it works wonders for them, though!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and a little goes a &#x27;very&#x27; long way. I&#x27;ve used it under my eyes, on my skin, and in &#x27;very&#x27; small amounts on my hair. Its time for a re-order, and I definitely will!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It makes your hands, arms, and face feel as smooth as a thick lotion would but with the argan oil it feels so light, comfortable and dries fast. My boyfriend is using it to clear up the bumps on the back of his arms and I just like feeling silky smooth. This product says that you can also use in your hair which I have not done yet but I&#x27;m sure it works great there too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a little bit of a smell to it but it doesn&#x27;t last very long at all. My boyfriend (who is very sensitive to smells) doesn&#x27;t mind the mild smell at all. He also likes how it dries fast without that awful, greasy left over feeling that a lot of other oils leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is 100% argan oil so for all of you that worry about the secret ingredients, there isn&#x27;t any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more of this stuff for sure :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh! and for those of you that are worried about using this on your face. I have skin that doesn&#x27;t get too dry or too oily and so far this hasnt change how my skin feels (besides making it softer). My friend, on the other hand, has dry skin and the argan oil helps her with her acne and keeps her skin moist all day.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my Shea Terra Organics Argan Face and Body oil.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and love the price, quality and results.</li>
            <li> This oil works. I was sceptical, but decided to try it. I have used it on my dry skin and can see a difference after just one use. I am going to try it on my hair next.</li>
            <li> This little bottle lasts a long time.  I enjoy using it as a supplement to my moisturizer in the winter and as a stand alone in the summer.</li>
            <li> It worked nice on my skin. It didn&#x27;t do anything good or bad when used on my long (dry) hair.</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast and the item is as described. I mostly use it on my body and hair as an alternative to my body butter and hair conditioners. It has no smell and the body is light which I like. So far so good!</li>
            <li> I really love this; I can use it for everything. I even put a little in the bath sometimes. a little goes a long way and it makes my skin and hair softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> This was my third bottle of the same brand, purchased through Amazon.  It did not smell like the previous ones.  It smelled rancid.</li>
            <li> Good for smoothing the frizzies and softening cuticles. Lasts forever.</li>
            <li> My very fine hair got destroyed by a bad dye job.  Finally something is working.  My hair is still very dry but this oil helps so much.  I also use it everyday on my face and neck and don&#x27;t have that itchy dry winter skin.  My skin feels great!</li>
            <li> This pure argan oil feels wonderful on the face and hair. In my opinion the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because the scent (which the bottle says is natural) is slightly off-putting. I was an avid user on JM argan oil and that one did not have this slightly unpleasant scent. However, I am still getting the same great results and I suppose the value of this product somewhat makes up for that. Overall a great beauty oil.</li>
            <li> My daughter stole this from me! It is such a great product. I used it for my hair and my face!</li>
            <li> First let me say that I do believe this is authentic raw Argan Oil from the extensive research I&#x27;ve done on the oil. I am using this product as a facial moisturizer. I suffer from acne and have not had a problem with this product. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and actually has helped to bring some under the surface acne to a head (which is a good thing). This oil gives a healthy shine to the skin. My skin went from dull looking to smooth and glowing. A little of this oil goes a long way. The only real negatives to this oil is the scent. The oil has a distinctive scent. From research I&#x27;ve seen the scent most commonly described as either nutty or similar to rubberbands. I personally side with the rubberband scent. However you become acclamated to the scent and it doesn&#x27;t linger long after application. On some days the skin can appear a bit too shiny, however a simple run over with a tissue suffices and the appropriate level of shine remains. The oil is very light and absorbs well--it doesn&#x27;t feel like an extra heavy layer. I would order this Shea Terra Argan Oil (Certified Organic) again.</li>
            <li> This oil is great for both the hair and skin. It gives my hair just enough shine without looking greasy (I&#x27;ve got curly hair). I also use it on my face and it doesn&#x27;t break me out and I have very sensitive acne prone skin. I&#x27;ve already purchased it twice and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Fabulous for hair, it&#x27;s everything you hear about Argan oil, and 100% pure organic. I&#x27;ve used it on my face too, it absorbs quickly, and softens the skin without being oily. Smells much like macadamia nuts.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product. I am the most pickiest person when it comes to my hair. I have a pixie cut and I have to get a half perm, plus I have color in my hair, so it kind of made my hair look brittle. I bought this product about a month ago, and my hair hasn&#x27;t been this smooth and shinny since maybe I was little, and all natural ingredients makes it even better!! It&#x27;s also a great moisturizer, I use this for my face too. I use Tretinoin Cream from my dermatologist, so my face gets really dry and it starts to peal, as soon as I put this on, my face is so smooth, and moisturized. GREAT PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> My favorite beard, hair and skin oil. Moisturizes and softens better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. Two pumps gives me the perfect amount for my beard and hair.</li>
            <li> I have really thick south Asian hair , so wanted something to tame the fizz and improve the health of my hair. After much research I decided to give this product a try. Wile my hair is fizz free and soft , but it becomes oily more quickly ,which I&#x27;m not liking :( May be I need to reduce the amount of oil I put into my hair after washing it ( before blow drying)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the smell is not that great. The pure argan oil is supposed to have roasted smell ,which it does , but I&#x27;m not liking the smell that much. Good news is that the smell goes away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my overall hair health improves in next few weeks , I will upgrade my rating to 5 , but for now it remains 3 !</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have recommended it to others.  convenient packaging .  As I was unable to assess products on line, I think I got lucky, and have re-ordered</li>
            <li> I am usin thi on my face after retin-a nd it is helping tremendously with irritation,redness,flaking,etc!  So glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful product. Soaked into skin within 5-10 minutes, no oily residue. However, I was afraid to use it on my face during the summer as I am acne prone. But I continue to use the oil on my hair. On wet hair, it absorbs right in making my hair light and silky. I notice with this oil I can extend my shampoo to every other day. Lovely product!</li>
            <li> For a while, I&#x27;ve had these bumps on my skin and discoloration... But after I&#x27;ve religiously applied this to my face every night, I noticed my skin getting smoother and the color start to get better. I honestly thought it was a coincidence that my skin improved because in the meanwhile, I started drinking water.&lt;br /&gt;BUT NO while my face was clearing, my back was still... ech. And since my face was doing great, I experimented applying it on my back. There&#x27;s still some scars, but I can see it getting better too! :)</li>
            <li> 4.5 Stars. Deducting half a star because of the pump which can be messy. Recommended by my dermatologist for my skin, turned out to be incredible for my hair.  I am 50 and it revived my hair with 1 or 2 drops on towel dried hair.  My hair is no longer brittle and frizzy - I have MY real 30 year old&#x27;s head of hair back!  I have stopped using hair conditioner or styling gel completely. Wonderful on the skin. The light sesame like odor doesn&#x27;t bother me and dissipates quickly.  Not oily at all 5 minutes after applying.  Price is high but the product is worth it.</li>
            <li> I put this on my skin first and then apply the Shea Terra body cream...long lasting and makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this And having purchased an oil very similar but from a different company I know that the oil should not have the consistency  or smell this had. I have not used it more than once cause it didn&#x27;t set well in my hair at all like the others I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> Not only did it do wonders for my dry hair, but my skin never felt and looked better.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Make my skin smooth</li>
            <li> I like the product. I do not like the packaging. The pump cap cannot be removed - or at least I haven&#x27;t figure out how to do it - and a good amount of the oil remains inside after it stops pumping.&lt;br /&gt;Since the oil is expensive, this situation is especially frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of pumps (a few drops) of oil improves my hair&#x27;s texture and makes it manageable.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops makes the frizz go away. Smells good and leaves a non sticky shine in the hair with out giving it a sticky look or feel if used properly.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best oil I have ever used on my face and hair. I apply Shea Terra Argan Oil to my face at night after washing and in the morning I wake up with skin that looks radiant and is amazingly soft. I am hoping the few sun-spots/blemish marks I have on my face will disappear with continued use, and honestly I think they will because it has practically changed the texture of my skin over night. I also use this oil on the ends of my hair since it tends to get a little brittle from wearing my hair in a tight bun all day, and the ends of my hair are softer almost instantly. It is a great value for the price as well because a little goes a long way. I am so happy I decided to purchase this oil... It will be a staple in my beauty regime for years to come.</li>
            <li> It provided a refreshing experience&lt;br /&gt;I had read about Argan oil and wanted to know and experience more about it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my nails with much success.  I work in the health industry so I wash my hands a lot and do not always have access to hand lotion so my hands, nails and cuticals get very dry. I apply this to my nails and massage in every 2 days or so and it has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not doing it right or whatever, but it&#x27;s also incredibly annoying that this is meant to be used as a deep conditioner...tried it as a leave in and my hair got WAYYYYYY crunchy.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my hair. I loved it. it made my hair nice and soft without all that grease on it. I would recommend this to everybody.</li>
            <li> Pros: It is what it says to be.  It is Argan oil opposed to what others have said it might not be.  The product works quite well for my hair. I would use it right after I shower and towel dry my hair.  Before it gets too dry, I add a few drops (a little goes a long way) to my palms and warm it up, then run it through the ends of my hair.  It makes my hair feel silky smooth and shiny.  I don&#x27;t put any on my bangs because it would make it look too shiny.  I also use it on my face (1-2 drops and warmed in my hands then patted on my face) as well as all over my body.  Especially my knees and elbows!! It also works great as cuticle oil ( I would use it on my fingers and toes after I paint my nails). Overall, it is a good product, a much cheaper alternative to Josie M.&#x27;s brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I don&#x27;t like the pump.  It squirts out waaaaay too much.  I just unscrew the bottle and use the ends as sloooow droppers.  I wish it had the dropper version instead of the pump version.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks , I don&#x27;t see any improvement , is very Greece&lt;br /&gt;But I will keep using it until finish.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face and neck after showering and again at night after cleansing before bed.  A small amount seems to go a long way, and it leaves my skin feeling nourished and smooth.  I have had no adverse effects from using this oil.  It especially seems to improve the texture of the skin on my neck and under my eyes.  I was afraid it might be too greasy, but that is not the case at all.  I am 52, and I have mostly normal skin (good for my age) with spotty dryness in the colder months.  I do not like using products that have too many ingredients or added fragrance.  A person should not need a degree in chemistry to understand the products they are using on their skin.  This has one ingredient.  I am normally a budget shopper, so I do not like to waste my money on anything.  The price at first almost turned me away, but I decided to take a chance, and I am glad I did.  I have not tried it on my hair yet, but that may be next.  I would definitely recommend this product, and I will continue to use it myself.</li>
            <li> I put this on my hair, face....love, love it. I&#x27;m a repeat buyer</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend, she says the product really does keep her skin moisturized all day and that she&#x27;s used it to completely replace her lotion. Good buy for the price. Slightly nutty smell but it&#x27;s not that obvious once you have it on you.</li>
            <li> I researched this oil on various sites and thought this was the best deal. I like the way it seems to smooth out my skin. I have had a few problems around my nose so I will be avoiding putting the oil there...I really don&#x27;t know what is causing that, and it may not be the argan oil. It has helped some deep black heads on my cheek.  They haven&#x27;t completely disappeared yet but are alot smaller and I&#x27;m hoping they&#x27;ll continue to shrink until they&#x27;re gone. I think it&#x27;s a great, natural product and have recommended it friends.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth the price and a little does go a long way. I have been using this product on my hair since March and it has worked wonders. It has helped to reduce the amount of spit ends I get and I am able to retain length, something I haven&#x27;t been able to do in years.  My last trim was in March right before I began using this product.  My hair is softer, less frizzy, and my curls have great definition. It works great in conjunction with my other hair products and does not make my hair greasy whatsoever.  Great product, I definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Update 7/19/2012:  I reordered this product on Friday July 13th 2012 and recieved it on Wednesday July 18th 2012 although the estimated delivery date was July 24th.  Was very happy to receive it earlier than I thought especially since I&#x27;m going on vacation and need it. Great service and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This is the best Argan Oil. I have purchased two other brands in the past. One was very pricey compared to Shea Terra, the other a little cheaper. Shea Terra gets 5*****. Even though I did notice a difference with the other two, it was nothing like Shea Terra. Much better and faster results.This product for me is a miracle worker, and I will never be without it. My skin, hair, hands and cuticles look ammazing.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order this product since I have acne prone skin...but I love it! My face is so smooth and the acne has really improved. I like the product so much that I&#x27;m ordering a bottle for my mom and my mother-n-law.</li>
            <li> I had never used Argan oil before but tried it at a friend&#x27;s house.  It works amazing on mosquito bites.  I use it also for extra moisture before putting on my moisturizer.  At first it looks like its going to go on greasy but the product is easily absorbed by your skin.  Small bottle will last a long time. Happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> I use this oil for my face and I like the way it softens my skin. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my wrinkles, though, nor in small and occasional rashes/irritations that I used to get before using the oil and I also get now when using the oil. All in all, a good product and probably preferable to other face creams because it&#x27;s natural, but not the miracle worker I expected from reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> I am incredibly surprised with all of the positive reviews for this product.  I usually buy Moroccan Oil, but decided to try something different for a change since this got very positive reviews and is basically the same price of the Moroccan Oil small bottle but is over double the size.  I used it once and it made by hair so greasy I had to rewash my hair immediately.  I am disappointed with this product and am sending back.</li>
            <li> Someone stole it from me :(</li>
            <li> I have been been using this for years on my face. I am in my early 40&#x27;s and I tan or out in the sun here in Texas. This has kept my skin smooth and soft. My skin looks better now that it ever has. I do have some fine lines but they are very minimal.</li>
            <li> I am an Estee Lauder person - however, use this on my face first thing in the morning, throw some moisturizing sun screen over the top and people are amazed when they find out how old I am.  Great product, a little goes a long way - last forever!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Argan oil on my hair and skin (my face mostly) for about a month now. It makes my hair soft and shiny, and my cystic acne and winter skin disappear. I&#x27;m very, very happy with this product! A little goes a long way and there is a nutty smell that I hardly notice anymore.</li>
            <li> Love this oil and use it on my hair, skin, bath and even on leather. Use it every day</li>
    </ol>
