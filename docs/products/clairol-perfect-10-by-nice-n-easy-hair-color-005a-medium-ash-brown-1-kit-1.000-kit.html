            <li>I was my hair with Neutrogena&#x27;s clarifying shampoo the night before, and then I color in the morning, and I get great results!</li>

            <li>Very nice coverage.  </li>

            <li>I made very sure</li>
            <li>This is a great product, easy to apply and looks good.</li>
            <li>I was trying to save some moolah, and after doing some research on Amazon and elsewhere, I went ahead and settled on Perfect 10 for my first self-coloring experience in decades.  </li>
            <li>and i love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and love how quickly it works and also that it gives excellent gray coverage.</li>
            <li>BUT THE COLOR WAS NICE ON THE HAIRS</li>
            <li>The color I chose is perfect for me (5A Medium Ash Brown), but it doesn&#x27;t really having the staying power that I like.</li>
            <li>Since the store doesn&#x27;t sell any colors that I liked in &amp;#34;Ash&amp;#34; I went online to find it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li>After the coloring, my hair color was more warm than cool/ash and there were even more visible orange pigments than before.</li>
            <li>This color is so beautiful and so realistic looking.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Ok color.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any grays, but it my hair better than not coloring it.  </li>
            <li>Love The Color</li>
            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>love the process.</li>
            <li>I have not used it yet, but looks okay for my hair.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this hair color.</li>
            <li>Since red/orange make my skin appear more blemished</li>
            <li>Defiantly would used this color again (if not just for the awesome job) for the fact that it really only takes 10 minutes!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Oh, and the color was a nice rich brown.</li>
            <li>It did process in 10 minutes and the color looked good before the first cleansing.  </li>
            <li>This product did the job of covering my gray and was really easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Applicator makes it easy.</li>
            <li>also could not believe how easy it was.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Not too strong smelling and color lasts til hair grows out (about a month).</li>
            <li>I love the color and was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Perfect 10 is the perfect hair color -- it only takes ten minutes -- it does a great job covering the gray which lasts at least 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Pretty awesome for the simple fact that you don&#x27;t have to fiddle your thumbs for 30 minutes waiting.</li>
            <li>I am devestated that this color is no longer available in stores.</li>
            <li>Used this product fir several years, works great.</li>
            <li>The conditioner that comes with it leaves my hair shiny and smooth, and there&#x27;s plenty to use weekly between colorings.</li>
            <li>excited that it was still available online</li>
            <li>This product is quick &amp; easy to use for root touch ups.  </li>
            <li>I pay a prettier penny with eSalon to get a professional grade individualized color and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li>It also does a great job covering the grey.</li>
            <li>and in the time it took for me to clean up</li>
            <li>I am ready to style my hair in twenty minutes, most products do not process color until 30 minutes .LOVE</li>
            <li>I purchased 2 Medium Ash Brown boxes (I was doing a full hair color).</li>
            <li>And I mean best ever either at home coloring or at the salon.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it, no dye is great for your hair, but this product doesn&#x27;t seem to do as much damage and the color stays true until my next coloring.  </li>
            <li>Natural looking, smooth as silk, easy and quick.</li>
            <li>As long as I can keep buying Clairol Perfect 10 on Amazon, this will be the only coloring kit I use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so worth the price.</li>
            <li>However, I will continue to purchase because the 10 minute process is so appealing to my busy lifestyle and</li>
            <li>Although this says it&#x27;s permanent color, it does not last as long as Nice &amp; Easy original permanent color.  </li>
            <li>This hair product is so easy and color is so natural.</li>
            <li>Because of its speed, ease and shine, I am willing to give it another go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**A</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I left it on my hair for 45 minutes to make sure that most of the red is removed.</li>
            <li>I love that it only takes 10 minutes, even for stubborn grays.</li>
            <li>The price varies at different retail stores but this is actually a better price than I could find anywhere else.</li>
            <li>No more red and my hair turned out perfect!</li>
            <li>My hair stays soft and full of body with great color for at least 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I have used Clairol Perfect 10 for several years now but it has become hard to find the color that I use.  </li>
            <li>Good color and only ten minutes.</li>
            <li>Pretty color, sets in hair fast</li>
            <li>, I keep a few boxes of hair color on hand at all times, as well as temporary touch up products that come in handy if I notice a white strand of hair while out &amp; about.  :-)  </li>
            <li>It is a true ash brown which is my natural hair color</li>
            <li>On a positive note, I want to say that the process did not damage or dry my hair, it is still healthy.</li>
            <li>My hair is dark brown, so the bright white hairs that have been multiplying since my 40th bday last year are even more immediately noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I haveto say, a much more positive experience than I expected thus far!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this comb applicator, this was the first time I&#x27;ve dyed my hair and didn&#x27;t get dye on my ears or other hands.</li>
            <li>And the process itself was so fast and really simple!&lt;br</li>
            <li>so i didnt need the whole box</li>
            <li>Very shiney.</li>
            <li>I was ready to rinse.</li>
            <li>I normally, really prefer this color product.</li>
            <li>really wish I had tried this product sooner.</li>
            <li>So, it is only the next day, but so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>few years later - I pretty much had to give up on drugstore brand hair colors as my greys are clearly exceptionally stubborn.  </li>
            <li>right it is either way too dark or too light.</li>
            <li>These days I am trying to keep as close to my true color as possible, cover my grays, and avoid reddish or brassy highlights.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smelled harsher than before, and the color was a much more opaque dark brown than the ashy brown that I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>My new go-to for hair dye!</li>
            <li>My main issue is with the color tint.</li>
            <li>The Medium Ash Brown color is perfect and not too dark at all, no brassy highlights, the tough grays are covered, and my hair is very silky and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I used the comb applicator, which somebody in a review for a different shade complained about, but which I personally found to be very easy to use, and which really helped to get all the color in quickly (quick seemed important to me in order to obtain the right overall timing for the color.)  </li>
            <li>It also leaves my hair feeling soft and healthy, not brittle like some other brands.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m only looking to cover gray hairs in my otherwise dark brown hair, this product is a quick and easy fix at home.</li>
            <li>my treatments like some of the more harsh products.  </li>
            <li>And normally the smell of hair dye just about bowls me over</li>
            <li>This is definitely my new hair color.</li>
            <li>I am just mentioning this as an option for anyone else out there who may be having similar issues - but again it is more expensive and more time-consuming.</li>
            <li>Covers gray completely and lasts until my hair grows out!</li>
            <li>The color itself is a rich dark brown on my medium brown hair.</li>
            <li>This box on the other hand strongly recommends not to leave it on any longer than ten minutes.</li>
            <li>BUY A FAST ACTING DYE AGAIN.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now, and it leaves my hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>However, I was surprised to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I liked everything else about this product, but the fact that I needed touch ups (not due to new growth but due to the color not lasting) so soon after application made it not worthwhile.  </li>
            <li>As I said before, I can be sensitive sometimes, but there was no indication of this type of reaction in the allergy test (though admittedly I only did the test for 24 hours rather than the recommended 48.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided I wanted a change and went back to my natural color.</li>
            <li>Okay, but not great gray coverage for me.</li>
            <li>In my youth when I was just having fun with color, I always managed to get it too dark and it always looked kinda of flat.  </li>
            <li>I use the ash brown, I leave it in a little longer so it gets a little darker and lasts longer :)</li>
            <li>It does not dry my hair out as much as the other brand and my hair seems smoother.  </li>
            <li>There is no other product out there that only takes 10 minutes for the color to take.</li>
            <li>I am willing to concede to possible user error--I might need to leave it in a little longer at the temples.  </li>
            <li>I found that 10 minutes is not long enough to open and penetrate the hair structure.</li>

            <li> Since I&#x27;m only looking to cover gray hairs in my otherwise dark brown hair, this product is a quick and easy fix at home.</li>
            <li> my treatments like some of the more harsh products.  </li>
            <li> And normally the smell of hair dye just about bowls me over</li>
            <li> This is definitely my new hair color.</li>
            <li> I am just mentioning this as an option for anyone else out there who may be having similar issues - but again it is more expensive and more time-consuming.</li>
            <li> Covers gray completely and lasts until my hair grows out!</li>
            <li> The color itself is a rich dark brown on my medium brown hair.</li>
            <li> This box on the other hand strongly recommends not to leave it on any longer than ten minutes.</li>
            <li> BUY A FAST ACTING DYE AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now, and it leaves my hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> However, I was surprised to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I liked everything else about this product, but the fact that I needed touch ups (not due to new growth but due to the color not lasting) so soon after application made it not worthwhile.  </li>
            <li> As I said before, I can be sensitive sometimes, but there was no indication of this type of reaction in the allergy test (though admittedly I only did the test for 24 hours rather than the recommended 48.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided I wanted a change and went back to my natural color.</li>
            <li> Okay, but not great gray coverage for me.</li>
            <li> In my youth when I was just having fun with color, I always managed to get it too dark and it always looked kinda of flat.  </li>
            <li> I use the ash brown, I leave it in a little longer so it gets a little darker and lasts longer :)</li>
            <li> It does not dry my hair out as much as the other brand and my hair seems smoother.  </li>
            <li> There is no other product out there that only takes 10 minutes for the color to take.</li>
            <li> I am willing to concede to possible user error--I might need to leave it in a little longer at the temples.  </li>
            <li> I found that 10 minutes is not long enough to open and penetrate the hair structure.</li>
            <li> I hate the time it takes to color my hair so the fact that this works in ten minutes is great, and it lasts as long as the 30 minute hair color I was using before.</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking that 10 minutes wouldn&#x27;t be long enough.</li>
            <li> I have been a red head for 5 years but my natural color is about this color I bought (maybe a little lighter).</li>
            <li> only caveat is that I did have a very temporary and relatively slight itchy-burny reaction around the temple area after the fact, but nothing serious, and not as much as I have felt sometimes previously at the salon.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**A month later I am back to report that a few of my tougher grays popped back out within 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> All the box colors say that they don&#x27;t take that long</li>
            <li> I should know, I have spent a lot of money on color that doesn&#x27;t hide the gray, takes a long time to process and turns orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very dark (almost black) brown hair and my underlying pigment is orange, so every now and then with direct lighting you&#x27;ll see streaks of orange.</li>
            <li> it was one big mess.</li>
            <li> BUT if you actually want the color to work I always have to leave it on for a little longer.</li>
            <li> a few days later i go in it and its foaming all over in my cabinet!!!</li>
            <li> some reason, it is getting harder to find.</li>
            <li> The last few months I now get an allergic skin reaction sort of like a poison ivy rash with blisters.</li>
            <li> I actually made a mess while I was applying (my fault-I&#x27;m a mess)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t k ow why one cannot purchase it anywhere anymore other than online.</li>
            <li> With shoulder length hair, I usually had plenty of color solution left over.</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair not more then twice a week and use WEN cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li> The other name for this color is Swift Chocolate.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and there is much LESS in the solution than before.</li>
            <li> I also do Keratin treatments every few months &amp; this product doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;ruin&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It matched the color on the box and it wasn&#x27;t messy or drippy.  </li>
            <li> Regular hair color is less expensive and  works just as well.</li>
            <li> I have purchased it in the past.  </li>
            <li> the come dispenser combed through all of my hair with a thick cream application.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the result.</li>
            <li> I came out too dark, but nothing bad happened with using it.</li>
            <li> In just a mere 10 minutes, it was already time to wash it out.</li>
            <li> --it does look like Clairol will reimburse you if you do have a bad reaction.)  </li>
            <li> I went towards a neutral ash brown. :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Why this can&#x27;t be found in stores any longer is unfathomable. Best hair color on the market.  Natural looking, smooth as silk, easy and quick. Thank goodness for amazon!</li>
            <li> I was trying to save some moolah, and after doing some research on Amazon and elsewhere, I went ahead and settled on Perfect 10 for my first self-coloring experience in decades.  In my youth when I was just having fun with color, I always managed to get it too dark and it always looked kinda of flat.  These days I am trying to keep as close to my true color as possible, cover my grays, and avoid reddish or brassy highlights. I have been going to a salon for years to achieve this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I carefully followed directions, including the allergy test (I can be sensitive and I read some horror stories here regarding this--it does look like Clairol will reimburse you if you do have a bad reaction.)  I used the comb applicator, which somebody in a review for a different shade complained about, but which I personally found to be very easy to use, and which really helped to get all the color in quickly (quick seemed important to me in order to obtain the right overall timing for the color.)  I made very sure I didn&#x27;t leave the color in any longer than 10 minutes so it wouldn&#x27;t get too dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  So, it is only the next day, but so far, so good.  The Medium Ash Brown color is perfect and not too dark at all, no brassy highlights, the tough grays are covered, and my hair is very silky and shiny.  And the process itself was so fast and really simple!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only caveat is that I did have a very temporary and relatively slight itchy-burny reaction around the temple area after the fact, but nothing serious, and not as much as I have felt sometimes previously at the salon.  As I said before, I can be sensitive sometimes, but there was no indication of this type of reaction in the allergy test (though admittedly I only did the test for 24 hours rather than the recommended 48.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use the included conditioner as recommended and will check back here in a couple of weeks to report on how well the color and condition has held up.  I haveto say, a much more positive experience than I expected thus far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**A month later I am back to report that a few of my tougher grays popped back out within 2 weeks.  I am willing to concede to possible user error--I might need to leave it in a little longer at the temples.  Because of its speed, ease and shine, I am willing to give it another go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**A few years later - I pretty much had to give up on drugstore brand hair colors as my greys are clearly exceptionally stubborn.  I liked everything else about this product, but the fact that I needed touch ups (not due to new growth but due to the color not lasting) so soon after application made it not worthwhile.  I pay a prettier penny with eSalon to get a professional grade individualized color and have been very pleased.  I am just mentioning this as an option for anyone else out there who may be having similar issues - but again it is more expensive and more time-consuming.</li>
            <li> Perfect 10 is the perfect hair color -- it only takes ten minutes -- it does a great job covering the gray which lasts at least 4 weeks.  I have used this product for several years and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This hair product is so easy and color is so natural. I have been using it for 10 about years. It also does a great job covering the grey. There is no other product out there that only takes 10 minutes for the color to take. When I color my hair I am ready to style my hair in twenty minutes, most products do not process color until 30 minutes .LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product did the job of covering my gray and was really easy to apply. I love this comb applicator, this was the first time I&#x27;ve dyed my hair and didn&#x27;t get dye on my ears or other hands. I will definitely use this again. Oh, and the color was a nice rich brown.</li>
            <li> This product is quick &amp; easy to use for root touch ups.  My hair is dark brown, so the bright white hairs that have been multiplying since my 40th bday last year are even more immediately noticeable.  UGH!&lt;br /&gt;So, I keep a few boxes of hair color on hand at all times, as well as temporary touch up products that come in handy if I notice a white strand of hair while out &amp; about.  :-)  I also do Keratin treatments every few months &amp; this product doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;ruin&amp;#34; my treatments like some of the more harsh products.  I stock up on whatever is on sale...</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Don&#x27;t k ow why one cannot purchase it anywhere anymore other than online.</li>
            <li> Pretty color, sets in hair fast and i love it! I use the ash brown, I leave it in a little longer so it gets a little darker and lasts longer :)</li>
            <li> the  best on the market--10 minutes is just enought time I have</li>
            <li> Ok color. Im a guy so i didnt need the whole box i dye my hair every 2 weeks. I kept the bottle in my medicine cabinet a few days later i go in it and its foaming all over in my cabinet!!! I never had this happen with any hair dye i bought before i will not buy this again it was one big mess.</li>
            <li> Perfect color every time.</li>
            <li> Color doesn&#x27;t stay on at all.  I will never buy this again. Crappy color.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very nice coverage.  I have purchased it in the past.  I don&#x27;t have any grays, but it my hair better than not coloring it.  Very shiney.</li>
            <li> Great for men too. Applicator makes it easy.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m only looking to cover gray hairs in my otherwise dark brown hair, this product is a quick and easy fix at home. Not too strong smelling and color lasts til hair grows out (about a month).</li>
            <li> I Just Did. Love The Color It Gives Me. I Dont Have Anything Else To Say. Thank You And Goodbye</li>
            <li> This is my hair color product. I have never used anything that left such a shine in my hair! I am devestated that this color is no longer available in stores. I now have to order it online, which is a pain, but I will do it to have this color to use!</li>
            <li> I should know, I have spent a lot of money on color that doesn&#x27;t hide the gray, takes a long time to process and turns orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not one of those colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes 10 minutes on the roots, 5-10 to pull it through to the ends and the color is excellent! My hair is shiny, has depth and does not look dyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, it is getting harder to find. I truly hope Clairol is going to continue to make it available!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, easy to apply and looks good. I get lots of compliments on hos shiney my haor looks after I use it.</li>
            <li> Okay, but not great gray coverage for me.</li>
            <li> Pretty awesome for the simple fact that you don&#x27;t have to fiddle your thumbs for 30 minutes waiting. I actually made a mess while I was applying (my fault-I&#x27;m a mess) and in the time it took for me to clean up I was ready to rinse. I love the color and was quick and easy. My new go-to for hair dye!</li>
            <li> Worked as claims. Washed out in 10 minutes and it was perfect. the come dispenser combed through all of my hair with a thick cream application. it covered everything. I didn&#x27;t have to rub it in. Does not need to be kept in longer than 10 minutes at all. It&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li> i COULD STILL SEE MY GRAYS, i WON&#x27;T BUY A FAST ACTING DYE AGAIN. BUT THE COLOR WAS NICE ON THE HAIRS IT DID. COVER.</li>
            <li> Used this product fir several years, works great.</li>
            <li> Easiest hair color I ever used.  It matched the color on the box and it wasn&#x27;t messy or drippy.  It did take only 10 minutes!  I will definitely buy this again.  You can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
            <li> I normally, really prefer this color product. I don&#x27;t know if this was out of date or the only one like this? However, it was running out of the package as I opened it. And, I almost never got it MIXED; it was in clumps! I have never seen that before with this product. I was hesitant to use it, however I did. I came out too dark, but nothing bad happened with using it.</li>
            <li> love it.  love the process.</li>
            <li> I have not used it yet, but looks okay for my hair.</li>
            <li> I found that 10 minutes is not long enough to open and penetrate the hair structure. I left it on my hair for 45 minutes to make sure that most of the red is removed. I also added &amp;#34;Red out&amp;#34;  drops to the mixture. Regular hair color is less expensive and  works just as well.</li>
            <li> Something has changed in the formula. I&#x27;ve used this before and there is much LESS in the solution than before. With shoulder length hair, I usually had plenty of color solution left over. This time I ran out before I was done.  Not cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smelled harsher than before, and the color was a much more opaque dark brown than the ashy brown that I&#x27;m used to. Feels like I&#x27;m wearing a wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy again</li>
            <li> excited that it was still available online</li>
            <li> 10 minutes to perfect, who can argue with that?  My hair stays soft and full of body with great color for at least 6 weeks.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Good color and only ten minutes.</li>
            <li> Covers gray completely and lasts until my hair grows out!</li>
            <li> Brilliant! just what I wanted excellent speedy delivery</li>
            <li> For 20+ years I used the same hair coloring from a competing brand.  I happened upon this one day and I&#x27;m never going back!  The color does not fade, or gradually turn my hair reddish.  It does not dry my hair out as much as the other brand and my hair seems smoother.  Let&#x27;s face it, no dye is great for your hair, but this product doesn&#x27;t seem to do as much damage and the color stays true until my next coloring.  As long as I can keep buying Clairol Perfect 10 on Amazon, this will be the only coloring kit I use.</li>
            <li> Last about a month.  Subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> Claiton has always been a good product.</li>
            <li> Have used this for over 1 1/2 years and has always been great. The last few months I now get an allergic skin reaction sort of like a poison ivy rash with blisters. Had to stop using it. Did Clairol change their formula ?</li>
            <li> I love this hair color. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now, and it leaves my hair silky and smooth. I hate the time it takes to color my hair so the fact that this works in ten minutes is great, and it lasts as long as the 30 minute hair color I was using before. I was my hair with Neutrogena&#x27;s clarifying shampoo the night before, and then I color in the morning, and I get great results! The conditioner that comes with it leaves my hair shiny and smooth, and there&#x27;s plenty to use weekly between colorings. The color itself is a rich dark brown on my medium brown hair. It doesn&#x27;t redden my hair like some colors do. It is a true ash brown which is my natural hair color so it works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> Although this says it&#x27;s permanent color, it does not last as long as Nice &amp; Easy original permanent color.  I only wash my hair not more then twice a week and use WEN cleansing conditioner.  It&#x27;s only been about 2 weeks and I need another color job.  It did process in 10 minutes and the color looked good before the first cleansing.  Probably won&#x27;t spend the extra $&#x27;s for this product again.</li>
            <li> I have used this line of hair color for about 8 years now and I swear by it. I won&#x27;t use anything else. I love that it only takes 10 minutes, even for stubborn grays. It also leaves my hair feeling soft and healthy, not brittle like some other brands. The price varies at different retail stores but this is actually a better price than I could find anywhere else.</li>
            <li> And I mean best ever either at home coloring or at the salon. This color is so beautiful and so realistic looking. Even when I go to a salon they never quite get my hair color right it is either way too dark or too light. The other name for this color is Swift Chocolate.&lt;br /&gt;I also could not believe how easy it was. In just a mere 10 minutes, it was already time to wash it out. And normally the smell of hair dye just about bowls me over but this dye&#x27;s scent was not overpowering or offensive. It also did not burn my scalp and it did not drip!&lt;br /&gt;And there are no allergic ingredients in the conditioner unlike the conditioners included in Clairol&#x27;s Colorblend dye box that has Sunflower and Coconut oils which would cause me to react with allergic dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;I really wish I had tried this product sooner. This is definitely my new hair color. And it covered my grays as well.</li>
            <li> It only took ten minutes waiting.  The color and conditioning were perfect.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 Medium Ash Brown boxes (I was doing a full hair color). Applying it was not an issue and I left it on for 10 minutes as instructed. My main issue is with the color tint. I have very dark (almost black) brown hair and my underlying pigment is orange, so every now and then with direct lighting you&#x27;ll see streaks of orange. Since red/orange make my skin appear more blemished and I wanted to try a lighter color I went towards a neutral ash brown. :( After the coloring, my hair color was more warm than cool/ash and there were even more visible orange pigments than before. I was not happy with the result. On a positive note, I want to say that the process did not damage or dry my hair, it is still healthy. I just would not recommend coloring to medium ash brown.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and love how quickly it works and also that it gives excellent gray coverage.</li>
            <li> The color I chose is perfect for me (5A Medium Ash Brown), but it doesn&#x27;t really having the staying power that I like. However, I will continue to purchase because the 10 minute process is so appealing to my busy lifestyle and the color is perfect.</li>
            <li> I have been a red head for 5 years but my natural color is about this color I bought (maybe a little lighter). I decided I wanted a change and went back to my natural color. I have tried to dye my hair brown before but the red still came through the color. The hairstylist told me if I wanted to get rid of the red I had to counteract it with an &amp;#34;Ash&amp;#34; to get the red out. Since the store doesn&#x27;t sell any colors that I liked in &amp;#34;Ash&amp;#34; I went online to find it. I purchased this thinking that 10 minutes wouldn&#x27;t be long enough. All the box colors say that they don&#x27;t take that long BUT if you actually want the color to work I always have to leave it on for a little longer. This box on the other hand strongly recommends not to leave it on any longer than ten minutes. So I followed the directions and it did the job. No more red and my hair turned out perfect! Defiantly would used this color again (if not just for the awesome job) for the fact that it really only takes 10 minutes!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Time is only 10 min. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have used Clairol Perfect 10 for several years now but it has become hard to find the color that I use.  However, I was surprised to find it on Amazon.  Great Color and Great Product!!!!!!</li>
