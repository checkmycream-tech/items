            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This is a FANTASTIC product!!</li>
            <li>gawd, how I love my AMAZON!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for using by itself, or it&#x27;s great for very gently moisturizing when I get out of the shower, and mix this in with the water from the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Impressive, and with heavier oils like sweet almond it takes alot more than just one dropper to carry the scent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Lightly applied, this is great.</li>
            <li>This is the best body oil in the whole world.</li>
            <li>Effective, non-greasy moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Gives the skin a nice finish and feel.</li>
            <li>This product is light but still very effective.  </li>
            <li>At first, I thought that the scented version of this was the greatest, but then I tried this unscented version, and I&#x27;m totally in love.</li>
            <li>full five stars for this great product.</li>
            <li>This stuff is very light, no smell, and it goes on nice, and doesnt leave you feeling like you just took an oil shower.  </li>
            <li>have tried so far with excellent results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbs well, but I&#x27;d prefer something more effective.</li>
            <li>A #1000 one liter Pyrex beaker works great for this (microwave the water for 2 minutes; it should be hot but not boiling).&lt;br</li>
            <li>For a massage oil or just for general lubricating use, this fragrant-free SESAME formula is excellent.</li>
            <li>No unpleasant flavor, good for massage.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;s unscented because I don&#x27;t always want to smell a fragrance on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>This is my favorite skin oil.</li>
            <li>Great product, very moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I use this but also love the Neutrogena Rainbath.</li>
            <li>Skin feels nice and smooth after that.</li>
            <li>And should be OK once we try it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, and within about an hour, any oiliness is gone and my skin just feels nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t smell anything from this, so it&#x27;s a great way to use body oil without smelling oily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s miles better than any lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is awesome, because you can MIX IN YOUR FAVORITE ESSENTIAL OILS!!</li>
            <li>This makes it the PERFECT carrier for all of your essential oils!</li>
            <li>No itchy legs for me :)</li>
            <li>I love to also use this oil as a massage oil.</li>
            <li>My skin always have a healthy glow - even during winter.  </li>
            <li>I wish they made this in the 32 oz size; but, I&#x27;m glad they made it at all.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this products for many years.</li>
            <li>Many stores sell the scented version of this oil</li>
            <li>I love love love love this oil.</li>
            <li>Even if I end up skipping a use in the shower, my skin is still better</li>
            <li>This oil is also a staple my the bedroom for those &amp;#34;intimate moments.&amp;#34;  If you purchase it just for that reason alone, you will be pleased that you did.</li>
            <li>Like this better than lotion.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s going to be stoked after getting a sensual massage! :)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, use it after I shower....</li>
            <li>Many people suffer from all sorts of allergies more than ever today.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>I have tried lots of body oils, but this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I have not found an oil that works better than this product.</li>
            <li>This is still the best treatment for dry skin that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It has been the best product I have found to moisturize dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially nice for hydrating when my skin gets way too dry.</li>
            <li>Although I love the mildly scented version of this oil, my husband has a strong sensitivity to fragrances, so I am thrilled to have found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>have found that 5 mL is the PERFECT amount to lightly fragrance your entire body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light that you don&#x27;t feel it at all, and the scent is very light too.  </li>
            <li>This is a fairly light weight oil that has a very light to no scent.  </li>
            <li>Always love this product and enjoy the quality of this product.  </li>
            <li>:  Make a mental note the this makes for an excellent massage oil.</li>
            <li>Good product, I do n ot like the scent too much</li>
            <li>How delighted I was to find my old favorite on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>and I found it way too strong.</li>
            <li>As another reviewer said, it doesn&#x27;t smell like food or anything; it smells fine.</li>
            <li>but it smells too strong and is not as good for sensitive skin or those with allergies.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product, though.</li>
            <li>Do you want to know why Neutrogena Fragrance Free Body Oil is so great?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that is not why Neutrogena Fragrance Free Body Oil is so awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This fragrance free product is a light and refined sesame oil with NO scent to it whatsoever.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve ever wanted a great way to use your essential oils, this is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the frangrance free formula works with any perfume or scent.</li>
            <li>Easy peasy to clean though.</li>
            <li>Ditch the lotion for this fantastic body oil.  </li>
            <li>but it is not always available</li>
            <li>It is light and fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>Use it in the bath or lightly in the shower and you will not feel oily like with others.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into your skin but keeps you smooth.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic moisturizer.</li>
            <li>oil is fantastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the fragrance free type, which I like.</li>
            <li>When I use it after showering, once it dries the light smell goes away.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t realize it was fragrance free.</li>
            <li>but I prefer the light sesame fragrance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s too light.  </li>
            <li>my wifes skin is as smooth as a baby ass.</li>
            <li>I did however love the way it absorbed into my skin and did not feel greasy</li>
            <li>so I was delighted to find a smaller bottle that cost more and was fragrant free.</li>
            <li>Loved this oil after the shower my skin is so soft now.</li>
            <li>It is a very light oil, and is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>This goes on soooooo easily and absorbs quickly into my skin.  </li>
            <li>Thanks and happy new year</li>
            <li>I like the smell of the original.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re not used to on your skin first to make sure you&#x27;re not allergic to it or</li>
            <li>/&gt;Have fun!</li>
            <li>Great skin product all year long.</li>
            <li>The finish is clean, never greasy.</li>
            <li>It is light and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Great Body oil for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my skin without being too greasy and it soaks right in!</li>
            <li>It turns out that the vapors bother my eyes and the smell is somewhat too sweet.</li>
            <li>I love this oil because it absorbs very well.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the fragrance free oil because I have allergies and the oil with fragrance has a strong and repulsive odor in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>It is not oily and absorbs in quickly</li>
            <li>This vendor sent the correct oil and extremely quickly.</li>
            <li>It drys quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
            <li>If you put it on right after your shower, when you&#x27;re still wet, it soaks in and your skin feels great.  </li>
            <li>This body oil has made post-shower moisturizing fast and easy.</li>
            <li>It feels good on my arms, legs and chest areas and keeps my dry skin moister and smoother.  </li>
            <li>(And, of course, thank you Neutrogena, for developing the product in the first place!)</li>
            <li>My skin is rather dry so for me this product was okay, but nothing I have to have as a part of my favorite beauty regimen.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s available in the larger size, which is a better deal.</li>
            <li>so I can get dressed right away.</li>
            <li>I apply it right after a shower or bath.</li>
            <li>this has just the right consistency.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs right into damp skin.</li>
            <li>You can use this in bath or right from the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I get right after I put this on.</li>
            <li>It works best if applied to wet skin after bathing, then towel dry gently.  </li>
            <li>It dries as your body dries and leaves your skin feeling really soft and looking really vibrant but the oil itself is so light!</li>
            <li>To me this oil is almost exactly like skin oils lost to washing with even the mildest soaps.</li>
            <li>First of all, I always buy the unscented body oil because I use a dropper and squirt some of my favorite aromatherapy essential oils into it before I use it.</li>
            <li>Then, use another #222 pipette to ADD 5 mL of your favorite essential oil!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thick oils or absolutes may need to be heated in a hot water bath first (microwave the water).</li>
            <li>Would not buy this product again, expecially since my favorite oil is back on the market.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin smooth and soft after shower.</li>
            <li>if it doesn&#x27;t I will never go back to lotion again because I can&#x27;t handle feeling slimy, and don&#x27;t ever want to give up the glowing healthy skin feeling</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find them at local stores like Walgreens or CVS, but was able to buy them at amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how nicely it worked the first time; the results were immediate and have been lasting.</li>
            <li>Light, fragrance-free -- which is essential for me -- and easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>This fragrance free version is much better because there is no strong smell to clash with anything else you may wear.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion for dry legs in winter.  </li>
            <li>and I do both, but putting it on after a shower and allowing it to dry works more thoroughly for</li>
            <li>Love this for itchy dry winter skin!</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>Plus it adds a sexy sheen (as in shine, not Charlie).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also great for suntanning, though suntanning is bad for skin anyway...</li>
            <li>I have searched everywhere for a body oil that was fragrance- free, and I finally found that in Neutrogena!</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really use it anymore.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Having used this fragrance free oil for years, I was saddened to find it had disappeared from my local stores.  </li>
            <li>And yet it really, really works.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Jasmine Sambac Absolute</li>
            <li>&lt;--(This one&#x27;s a real winner!)&lt;br /&gt;Osmanthus Absolute&lt;br /&gt;Neroli</li>
            <li>Wanted the Fagrance Free but got the gross smelly oil.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and has a sesame smell I really like.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper here than at Target,</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic because I don&#x27;t feel oily, slimy, or gross!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had much luck with lotions on these areas.</li>
            <li>After several weeks, I haven&#x27;t had any problems -- just smooth skin.</li>
            <li>(My local drug store has discontinued the fragrance free version).  </li>
            <li>I use it too and my skin is much softer than before.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and is not too heavily fragranced so that it bothers my allergis.</li>
            <li>Most all essential oils will homogenize with the sesame oil in the Neutrogena right away with minimal</li>
            <li>If you workout like I do, and have a decent mascular definition, It sure helps to show off your muscles as it has a slight shimmer when applied.</li>
            <li>For most Amber resins, a little bit of precipitate afterwards is normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use a little more liberally on my arms and shoulders if I want a bit of a sheen.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out and is light enough to dab on the ends of my hair as a final conditioner without even the faintest hint of greasiness; my skin glows and there&#x27;s absolutely no &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; look or feel, just soft healthy skin.</li>
            <li>But when I was skin tested for allergies for new skin issues, it was discovered that I have an allergy to fragrance.</li>
            <li>Only the scented one is available locally, and after trying it, I vowed never to use it again.  </li>
            <li>Add to a small amount of shaving foam and water, leave on for 2-3 minutes, wet beard with hot water and apply shaving cream as normal and get a super smooth shave with this oil as a lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t like scents, and so I love that this has no scent.</li>
            <li>makes your skin so soft!</li>
            <li>No heavy perfume smell!</li>
            <li>Stand the bottlein a hot water bath (as mentioned above) for about 10 minutes, then shake until completely dissolved and homogenized.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and leaves no oily residue</li>
            <li>This stuff, once you put it, disappears completely, with no oily residue.</li>
            <li>Lotus Absolute (from Blue Lotus Exports)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the results so much that I no longer buy traditional lotions.  </li>
            <li>I bought it, although I often am sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li>I like this almond oil product amd use it on my sensitive skin after showering.  </li>
            <li>It seals in moisture after my shower, absorbs as soon as you evenly distribute it, and makes my skin soft and</li>
            <li>: It does not seem to last the whole day.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s oil, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or greasy -- just soft and fully moisturized.</li>
            <li>It really does a terrific job moisturizing without feeling goopy and greasy.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin really soft afterwards though.</li>
            <li>This oil can be adapted to suit skins highly sensitive to any odour or smell.</li>
            <li>it is not too greasy and you can put it directly on the skin or in the bath water.  </li>
            <li>I like to put it in a little mini-spray-bottle and spray it on, rubbing it gently into my skin right after my shower.</li>
            <li>This is my daily treatment for my super dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I love the scent and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This is so hard to find in the store - and I have to have fragrance free</li>
            <li>think for tropical or humid climates is enough because is not heavy or too oily.</li>
            <li>Slimy isn&#x27;t a natural feeling for human skin!</li>
            <li>It takes no more than one dropper full to completely scent the entire bottle of body oil.</li>
            <li>keeps my skin smooth and soft without being heavy like some creams and other oils.</li>
            <li>It is light and a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Not dry at all.</li>
            <li>After only two applications when I&#x27;m ultra-dry, my skin always go back to normal for quite a long time.</li>
            <li>Regular use will restore dry skin to a soft, supple condition.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel so smooth and so soft, even during the tough winter months!</li>

            <li> is also is a great pre-shave lotion,</li>
            <li> Happy showering in the Winter.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil.</li>
            <li> I also use this after I shave as a moisturizer, and it works great at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great oil with no smell.  </li>
            <li> - this was a great find on line.</li>
            <li> GREAT massage oil.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy and great to add to the bath.</li>
            <li> Otherwise makes a very nice massage oil..</li>
            <li> This is amazing for massages, no oily residue!</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Body oil, Light Sesame Formula is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Have not used it yet; looks and smells good.</li>
            <li> I have alleries and excema and thought this might be good for my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and perfect for summer.  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, light body oil that doesn&#x27;t leave your body feeling oily or</li>
            <li> It works good on my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> Perfect light scent.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff.  </li>
            <li> perfect for a full body massage.</li>
            <li> the one with fragrance is very nice, my husband love</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a FANTASTIC product!!</li>
            <li> gawd, how I love my AMAZON!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for using by itself, or it&#x27;s great for very gently moisturizing when I get out of the shower, and mix this in with the water from the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Impressive, and with heavier oils like sweet almond it takes alot more than just one dropper to carry the scent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Lightly applied, this is great.</li>
            <li> This is the best body oil in the whole world.</li>
            <li> Effective, non-greasy moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Gives the skin a nice finish and feel.</li>
            <li> This product is light but still very effective.  </li>
            <li> At first, I thought that the scented version of this was the greatest, but then I tried this unscented version, and I&#x27;m totally in love.</li>
            <li> full five stars for this great product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very light, no smell, and it goes on nice, and doesnt leave you feeling like you just took an oil shower.  </li>
            <li> have tried so far with excellent results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absorbs well, but I&#x27;d prefer something more effective.</li>
            <li> A #1000 one liter Pyrex beaker works great for this (microwave the water for 2 minutes; it should be hot but not boiling).&lt;br</li>
            <li> For a massage oil or just for general lubricating use, this fragrant-free SESAME formula is excellent.</li>
            <li> No unpleasant flavor, good for massage.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;s unscented because I don&#x27;t always want to smell a fragrance on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> This is my favorite skin oil.</li>
            <li> Great product, very moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I use this but also love the Neutrogena Rainbath.</li>
            <li> Skin feels nice and smooth after that.</li>
            <li> And should be OK once we try it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, and within about an hour, any oiliness is gone and my skin just feels nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t smell anything from this, so it&#x27;s a great way to use body oil without smelling oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s miles better than any lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is awesome, because you can MIX IN YOUR FAVORITE ESSENTIAL OILS!!</li>
            <li> This makes it the PERFECT carrier for all of your essential oils!</li>
            <li> No itchy legs for me :)</li>
            <li> I love to also use this oil as a massage oil.</li>
            <li> My skin always have a healthy glow - even during winter.  </li>
            <li> I wish they made this in the 32 oz size; but, I&#x27;m glad they made it at all.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this products for many years.</li>
            <li> Many stores sell the scented version of this oil</li>
            <li> I love love love love this oil.</li>
            <li> Even if I end up skipping a use in the shower, my skin is still better</li>
            <li> This oil is also a staple my the bedroom for those &amp;#34;intimate moments.&amp;#34;  If you purchase it just for that reason alone, you will be pleased that you did.</li>
            <li> Like this better than lotion.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s going to be stoked after getting a sensual massage! :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, use it after I shower....</li>
            <li> Many people suffer from all sorts of allergies more than ever today.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years.  </li>
            <li> I have tried lots of body oils, but this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I have not found an oil that works better than this product.</li>
            <li> This is still the best treatment for dry skin that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> It has been the best product I have found to moisturize dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially nice for hydrating when my skin gets way too dry.</li>
            <li> Although I love the mildly scented version of this oil, my husband has a strong sensitivity to fragrances, so I am thrilled to have found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> have found that 5 mL is the PERFECT amount to lightly fragrance your entire body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light that you don&#x27;t feel it at all, and the scent is very light too.  </li>
            <li> This is a fairly light weight oil that has a very light to no scent.  </li>
            <li> Always love this product and enjoy the quality of this product.  </li>
            <li> :  Make a mental note the this makes for an excellent massage oil.</li>
            <li> Good product, I do n ot like the scent too much</li>
            <li> How delighted I was to find my old favorite on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> and I found it way too strong.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer said, it doesn&#x27;t smell like food or anything; it smells fine.</li>
            <li> but it smells too strong and is not as good for sensitive skin or those with allergies.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product, though.</li>
            <li> Do you want to know why Neutrogena Fragrance Free Body Oil is so great?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that is not why Neutrogena Fragrance Free Body Oil is so awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This fragrance free product is a light and refined sesame oil with NO scent to it whatsoever.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever wanted a great way to use your essential oils, this is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the frangrance free formula works with any perfume or scent.</li>
            <li> Easy peasy to clean though.</li>
            <li> Ditch the lotion for this fantastic body oil.  </li>
            <li> but it is not always available</li>
            <li> It is light and fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> Use it in the bath or lightly in the shower and you will not feel oily like with others.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into your skin but keeps you smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic moisturizer.</li>
            <li> oil is fantastic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the fragrance free type, which I like.</li>
            <li> When I use it after showering, once it dries the light smell goes away.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t realize it was fragrance free.</li>
            <li> but I prefer the light sesame fragrance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s too light.  </li>
            <li> my wifes skin is as smooth as a baby ass.</li>
            <li> I did however love the way it absorbed into my skin and did not feel greasy</li>
            <li> so I was delighted to find a smaller bottle that cost more and was fragrant free.</li>
            <li> Loved this oil after the shower my skin is so soft now.</li>
            <li> It is a very light oil, and is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> This goes on soooooo easily and absorbs quickly into my skin.  </li>
            <li> Thanks and happy new year</li>
            <li> I like the smell of the original.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re not used to on your skin first to make sure you&#x27;re not allergic to it or</li>
            <li> /&gt;Have fun!</li>
            <li> Great skin product all year long.</li>
            <li> The finish is clean, never greasy.</li>
            <li> It is light and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> Great Body oil for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my skin without being too greasy and it soaks right in!</li>
            <li> It turns out that the vapors bother my eyes and the smell is somewhat too sweet.</li>
            <li> I love this oil because it absorbs very well.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the fragrance free oil because I have allergies and the oil with fragrance has a strong and repulsive odor in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> It is not oily and absorbs in quickly</li>
            <li> This vendor sent the correct oil and extremely quickly.</li>
            <li> It drys quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
            <li> If you put it on right after your shower, when you&#x27;re still wet, it soaks in and your skin feels great.  </li>
            <li> This body oil has made post-shower moisturizing fast and easy.</li>
            <li> It feels good on my arms, legs and chest areas and keeps my dry skin moister and smoother.  </li>
            <li> (And, of course, thank you Neutrogena, for developing the product in the first place!)</li>
            <li> My skin is rather dry so for me this product was okay, but nothing I have to have as a part of my favorite beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s available in the larger size, which is a better deal.</li>
            <li> so I can get dressed right away.</li>
            <li> I apply it right after a shower or bath.</li>
            <li> this has just the right consistency.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs right into damp skin.</li>
            <li> You can use this in bath or right from the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I get right after I put this on.</li>
            <li> It works best if applied to wet skin after bathing, then towel dry gently.  </li>
            <li> It dries as your body dries and leaves your skin feeling really soft and looking really vibrant but the oil itself is so light!</li>
            <li> To me this oil is almost exactly like skin oils lost to washing with even the mildest soaps.</li>
            <li> First of all, I always buy the unscented body oil because I use a dropper and squirt some of my favorite aromatherapy essential oils into it before I use it.</li>
            <li> Then, use another #222 pipette to ADD 5 mL of your favorite essential oil!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thick oils or absolutes may need to be heated in a hot water bath first (microwave the water).</li>
            <li> Would not buy this product again, expecially since my favorite oil is back on the market.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin smooth and soft after shower.</li>
            <li> if it doesn&#x27;t I will never go back to lotion again because I can&#x27;t handle feeling slimy, and don&#x27;t ever want to give up the glowing healthy skin feeling</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find them at local stores like Walgreens or CVS, but was able to buy them at amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how nicely it worked the first time; the results were immediate and have been lasting.</li>
            <li> Light, fragrance-free -- which is essential for me -- and easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> This fragrance free version is much better because there is no strong smell to clash with anything else you may wear.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion for dry legs in winter.  </li>
            <li> and I do both, but putting it on after a shower and allowing it to dry works more thoroughly for</li>
            <li> Love this for itchy dry winter skin!</li>
            <li> Very highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> Plus it adds a sexy sheen (as in shine, not Charlie).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also great for suntanning, though suntanning is bad for skin anyway...</li>
            <li> I have searched everywhere for a body oil that was fragrance- free, and I finally found that in Neutrogena!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really use it anymore.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Having used this fragrance free oil for years, I was saddened to find it had disappeared from my local stores.  </li>
            <li> And yet it really, really works.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Jasmine Sambac Absolute</li>
            <li> &lt;--(This one&#x27;s a real winner!)&lt;br /&gt;Osmanthus Absolute&lt;br /&gt;Neroli</li>
            <li> Wanted the Fagrance Free but got the gross smelly oil.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and has a sesame smell I really like.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper here than at Target,</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic because I don&#x27;t feel oily, slimy, or gross!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much luck with lotions on these areas.</li>
            <li> After several weeks, I haven&#x27;t had any problems -- just smooth skin.</li>
            <li> (My local drug store has discontinued the fragrance free version).  </li>
            <li> I use it too and my skin is much softer than before.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and is not too heavily fragranced so that it bothers my allergis.</li>
            <li> Most all essential oils will homogenize with the sesame oil in the Neutrogena right away with minimal</li>
            <li> If you workout like I do, and have a decent mascular definition, It sure helps to show off your muscles as it has a slight shimmer when applied.</li>
            <li> For most Amber resins, a little bit of precipitate afterwards is normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a little more liberally on my arms and shoulders if I want a bit of a sheen.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out and is light enough to dab on the ends of my hair as a final conditioner without even the faintest hint of greasiness; my skin glows and there&#x27;s absolutely no &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; look or feel, just soft healthy skin.</li>
            <li> But when I was skin tested for allergies for new skin issues, it was discovered that I have an allergy to fragrance.</li>
            <li> Only the scented one is available locally, and after trying it, I vowed never to use it again.  </li>
            <li> Add to a small amount of shaving foam and water, leave on for 2-3 minutes, wet beard with hot water and apply shaving cream as normal and get a super smooth shave with this oil as a lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like scents, and so I love that this has no scent.</li>
            <li> makes your skin so soft!</li>
            <li> No heavy perfume smell!</li>
            <li> Stand the bottlein a hot water bath (as mentioned above) for about 10 minutes, then shake until completely dissolved and homogenized.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and leaves no oily residue</li>
            <li> This stuff, once you put it, disappears completely, with no oily residue.</li>
            <li> Lotus Absolute (from Blue Lotus Exports)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the results so much that I no longer buy traditional lotions.  </li>
            <li> I bought it, although I often am sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li> I like this almond oil product amd use it on my sensitive skin after showering.  </li>
            <li> It seals in moisture after my shower, absorbs as soon as you evenly distribute it, and makes my skin soft and</li>
            <li> : It does not seem to last the whole day.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s oil, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or greasy -- just soft and fully moisturized.</li>
            <li> It really does a terrific job moisturizing without feeling goopy and greasy.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin really soft afterwards though.</li>
            <li> This oil can be adapted to suit skins highly sensitive to any odour or smell.</li>
            <li> it is not too greasy and you can put it directly on the skin or in the bath water.  </li>
            <li> I like to put it in a little mini-spray-bottle and spray it on, rubbing it gently into my skin right after my shower.</li>
            <li> This is my daily treatment for my super dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I love the scent and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is so hard to find in the store - and I have to have fragrance free</li>
            <li> think for tropical or humid climates is enough because is not heavy or too oily.</li>
            <li> Slimy isn&#x27;t a natural feeling for human skin!</li>
            <li> It takes no more than one dropper full to completely scent the entire bottle of body oil.</li>
            <li> keeps my skin smooth and soft without being heavy like some creams and other oils.</li>
            <li> It is light and a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not dry at all.</li>
            <li> After only two applications when I&#x27;m ultra-dry, my skin always go back to normal for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Regular use will restore dry skin to a soft, supple condition.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel so smooth and so soft, even during the tough winter months!</li>
            <li> I use it regularly right after showering, keeps skin moist without the heavy oily feel/buildup so may other body oils leave.</li>
            <li> This bottle will last one person a very long time.</li>
            <li> Moisturization doesn&#x27;t last very long, as I find myself reapplying often.</li>
            <li> I suffer from chronically dry skin and a deep hatred for the slimy feeling I get when I use lotion.</li>
            <li> Especially in the dry climate we have now(Jan) in the NorthEast.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, especially on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> Cheap and expensive oils alike work great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use several drops while wet, before towelling off in the shower.</li>
            <li> goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> After I shower, I put it on my legs and they never get dry, either.  </li>
            <li> This product keeps me from having dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> If skin is allowed to dry,  it does not absorb as well.  </li>
            <li> Wrap a towel around me and let it dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not itchy from this terribly dry winter we&#x27;re having</li>
            <li> greasy in the bathtub&lt;br /&gt;Hydrating&lt;br /&gt;Soothing for itchy dry skin</li>
            <li> It has helped my cracked dry feet, however, about halfway through the day, my feet hurt and feel dry again.</li>
            <li> that I prefer inadequate moisturizers and dry</li>
            <li> If you have dry winter skin</li>
            <li> I bought these because they were recommended by my parents&#x27; doctor for dry skin treatment.  </li>
            <li> use this after my shower, and just a few drops on my hand can cover an entire body area (lower leg, upper leg, arm, ect).</li>
            <li> /&gt;You splash this on after a shower, when your body is still wet, then towel dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product numerous times in drugstores in the past, but for some reason the product I received was a different formula and didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d anticipated.</li>
            <li> You need only a few drops for each section of your body, so it lasts a long time.  </li>

            <li> I purchased a small spray bottle at the same time.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the other type.</li>
            <li> The oil does not stain clothes even though it has a slight color to it.</li>
            <li> and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight.</li>
            <li> I squirt a little in the tub when I run a bath, and it keeps my skin from drying out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Always remember to test a little bit of oil</li>
            <li> get a little pricey&lt;br /&gt;Must...</li>
            <li> I use this immediately after I shower and a little</li>
            <li> I put a little in my bath water and just soak.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To use, I rub a little bit over my skin in the bath and soak, or rub a little on after taking a shower.</li>
            <li> That way, we don&#x27;t have to use a lot of heavy lotions instead.</li>
            <li> I started using this with my mother, chemo dried her skin out.</li>
            <li> I just keep it in the bathroom and rub a few drops all over immediately after a shower.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to perfumes and it&#x27;s difficult to find this product in the unscented form....</li>
            <li> No fragrance, just a faint natural scent and moisturization like nothing else.</li>
            <li> I like to use it after exfoliating with a stiff scrub brush.</li>
            <li> There is a very slight shimmer upon application.  </li>
            <li> Put it on after you shower, it soaks in, it doesn&#x27;t leave greasy mess!</li>
            <li> this at least helps keep the skin moist and isn&#x27;t so heavy that it makes me feel sticky afterwards.</li>
            <li> This bottle is quite small.  </li>
            <li> I was too lazy to reach.</li>
            <li> The price is comparable to that I have paid in Wal-mart in the past.</li>
            <li> so it would be hard to overdo it like lotion.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your skin silky smooth without annoying too slickness!</li>
            <li> To the Body Oil, add about 7 grams of Amber resin broken into small pieces.</li>
            <li> This is probably because of how crazy dry my skin is.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Sometime hard to find the unscented in drugstores, but not on Amazon!</li>
            <li> The lotions that do moisturize leave my skin extremely greasy, which is so unpleasant -- both to look at and to feel --</li>
            <li> It softens, and seems to help with roughnesses, without being cloying, or irritating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin</li>
            <li> I have tried all sorts of lotions but they take too long to soak in and feel greasy, which I hate.</li>
            <li> About six years ago I tried a bottle of this oil that has fragrance and was thoroughly disgusted with the horrible \\&quot;Old</li>
            <li> A lot of products like this leave the skin feeling very slick and oily and kinda nasty.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed and missed the return window.</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> As a guy, I desire to keep my skin moisturized without the annoying scents that tradition body lotions tend to have.  </li>
            <li> Even in the Summer, I need moisture on my body otherwise I&#x27;m horribly itchy.</li>
            <li> And, you don&#x27;t get that awful winter dryness.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wish that Neutrogena still sold this unscented version in the 32-oz size! This is still the best treatment for dry skin that I have ever used.  Absorbs almost immediately, leaves no residue and does not interfere with perfume.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it after every shower to moisturize my very dry skin.  Sometimes I will mix it with a lotion when I apply it and sometimes I apply it alone.  It has been the best product I have found to moisturize dry skin. I really appreciate the fragrance free oil because I have allergies and the oil with fragrance has a strong and repulsive odor in my opinion.  I really enjoy this product, though.</li>
            <li> I never thought a body oil would be so great.  When I hear \\&quot;body oil,\\&quot; I think, \\&quot;greasy,\\&quot; \\&quot;thick,\\&quot; and \\&quot;gross.\\&quot;  Neutrogena body oil is none of those things.  I squirt a little in the tub when I run a bath, and it keeps my skin from drying out.  After I shower, I put it on my legs and they never get dry, either.  It&#x27;s so light that you don&#x27;t feel it at all, and the scent is very light too.  I did, however, order the unscented version for when my current bottle runs out.  My husband is hooked on this stuff too.  We keep a bottle in the shower, and when we turn the water off, we just put some on our arms and legs before we get out.  That way, we don&#x27;t have to use a lot of heavy lotions instead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still too oily to be hair oil......</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion for dry legs in winter.  It is not oily and absorbs in quickly so I can get dressed right away.</li>
            <li> I started using this with my mother, chemo dried her skin out. I use it after a shower, 2-3 times a week. I like the smell of the original. thisis best for everyhting but hands, for that I use working hands, my hands take a beating. The amazon price is excellant.</li>
            <li> I have searched everywhere for a body oil that was fragrance- free, and I finally found that in Neutrogena! It moisturizes my skin without being too greasy and it soaks right in! It doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes like some lotions and body creams do! I apply it right after a shower or bath.I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;s unscented because I don&#x27;t always want to smell a fragrance on my skin. I love this and I will continue to purchase it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite skin oil. Light, fragrance-free -- which is essential for me -- and easily absorbed into the skin. It softens, and seems to help with roughnesses, without being cloying, or irritating.</li>
            <li> It is not an organic oil so I don&#x27;t really use it anymore.</li>
            <li> Worked great as a massage oil!</li>
            <li> To me this oil is almost exactly like skin oils lost to washing with even the mildest soaps. I&#x27;ve not found another product I can say that about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviewers I use several drops while wet, before towelling off in the shower. The finish is clean, never greasy. Just give it a minute or two . . . it absorbs into skin and skin feels pliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also is a great pre-shave lotion, Add to a small amount of shaving foam and water, leave on for 2-3 minutes, wet beard with hot water and apply shaving cream as normal and get a super smooth shave with this oil as a lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me it also fights dryness on the face, along the hairline and into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great all around men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s grooming product. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I use it in my bath. Love it!</li>
            <li> First of all, I always buy the unscented body oil because I use a dropper and squirt some of my favorite aromatherapy essential oils into it before I use it. It takes no more than one dropper full to completely scent the entire bottle of body oil. Impressive, and with heavier oils like sweet almond it takes alot more than just one dropper to carry the scent.&lt;br /&gt;I use this after my shower, and just a few drops on my hand can cover an entire body area (lower leg, upper leg, arm, ect). I find the moisture to be helpful, but not enough for my legs, so I use lotion there, too. But it helps, definitely. Plus it adds a sexy sheen (as in shine, not Charlie).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also great for suntanning, though suntanning is bad for skin anyway...this at least helps keep the skin moist and isn&#x27;t so heavy that it makes me feel sticky afterwards.</li>
            <li> Loved this oil after the shower my skin is so soft now.</li>
            <li> Good product, I do n ot like the scent too much</li>
            <li> This is amazing for massages, no oily residue!</li>
            <li> Great product, very moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t praise this item enough. As recommended on the bottle put it on after you shower while still damp. It dries as your body dries and leaves your skin feeling really soft and looking really vibrant but the oil itself is so light!</li>
            <li> My skin is rather dry so for me this product was okay, but nothing I have to have as a part of my favorite beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> Always love this product and enjoy the quality of this product.  This bottle is quite small.  Happy showering in the Winter.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Body oil, Light Sesame Formula is an excellent product. It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and is not too heavily fragranced so that it bothers my allergis.</li>
            <li> No unpleasant flavor, good for massage. I like using it every time when I do massage on my leg. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Use it after every shower and would not be without it.  This product keeps me from having dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> This oils absorbs inmediately and you can add lotion after and your skins stays hidrated all day.&lt;br /&gt;I think for tropical or humid climates is enough because is not heavy or too oily.</li>
            <li> This is perfect if you have allergies to fragrance as I do.  I use this but also love the Neutrogena Rainbath.</li>
            <li> Lightly applied, this is great. I love the scent and a little goes a long way. This bottle will last one person a very long time.</li>
            <li> A few drops on the wet skin after shower and pat dry. Skin feels nice and smooth after that. Not dry at all.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil. I use this oil all over my body. It leaves my skin soft and leaves no oily residue</li>
            <li> Have not used it yet; looks and smells good. And should be OK once we try it.Thanks and happy new year</li>
            <li> This is the best body oil in the whole world. At first, I thought that the scented version of this was the greatest, but then I tried this unscented version, and I&#x27;m totally in love. This is great body oil! It&#x27;s great for using by itself, or it&#x27;s great for very gently moisturizing when I get out of the shower, and mix this in with the water from the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, and within about an hour, any oiliness is gone and my skin just feels nice and smooth. It&#x27;s especially nice for hydrating when my skin gets way too dry. After only two applications when I&#x27;m ultra-dry, my skin always go back to normal for quite a long time. I usually don&#x27;t like scents, and so I love that this has no scent. I really can&#x27;t smell anything from this, so it&#x27;s a great way to use body oil without smelling oily. I also use this after I shave as a moisturizer, and it works great at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Unscented&lt;br /&gt;+Works great&lt;br /&gt;+Excellent for moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;+Great container&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t come in a larger size</li>
            <li> Having used this fragrance free oil for years, I was saddened to find it had disappeared from my local stores.  Only the scented one is available locally, and after trying it, I vowed never to use it again.  How delighted I was to find my old favorite on Amazon.  It works best if applied to wet skin after bathing, then towel dry gently.  It is a very light oil, and is absorbed quickly. Regular use will restore dry skin to a soft, supple condition. Very highly recommended.  Thank you, Amazon! (And, of course, thank you Neutrogena, for developing the product in the first place!)</li>
            <li> Effective, non-greasy moisturizer. I have tried all sorts of lotions but they take too long to soak in and feel greasy, which I hate. This stuff, once you put it, disappears completely, with no oily residue. And yet it really, really works. I recommend the unscented version - I have tried the scented one and I found it way too strong.</li>
            <li> Do you want to know why Neutrogena Fragrance Free Body Oil is so great?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You splash this on after a shower, when your body is still wet, then towel dry. It leaves NO greasy feeling whatsoever. It&#x27;s miles better than any lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that is not why Neutrogena Fragrance Free Body Oil is so awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is awesome, because you can MIX IN YOUR FAVORITE ESSENTIAL OILS!! This fragrance free product is a light and refined sesame oil with NO scent to it whatsoever. This makes it the PERFECT carrier for all of your essential oils! It works BEAUTIFULLY!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the 8.5 ounce size of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a #222 disposable transfer pipette to REMOVE 5 mL of body oil from the bottle (5 draws). Then, use another #222 pipette to ADD 5 mL of your favorite essential oil! Shake it up, and it&#x27;s good to go! Most all essential oils will homogenize with the sesame oil in the Neutrogena right away with minimal effort!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that 5 mL is the PERFECT amount to lightly fragrance your entire body. If you&#x27;ve ever wanted a great way to use your essential oils, this is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thick oils or absolutes may need to be heated in a hot water bath first (microwave the water). After adding, you may need to then stand the Neutrogena bottle in a water bath, then shake. A #1000 one liter Pyrex beaker works great for this (microwave the water for 2 minutes; it should be hot but not boiling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Eden Botanicals for best quality to price ratio! Cheap and expensive oils alike work great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried so far with excellent results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sandalwood&lt;br /&gt;Patchouli&lt;br /&gt;Yuzu&lt;br /&gt;Jasmine Sambac Absolute &lt;--(This one&#x27;s a real winner!)&lt;br /&gt;Osmanthus Absolute&lt;br /&gt;Neroli&lt;br /&gt;Rose Otto&lt;br /&gt;Frangipani Absolute&lt;br /&gt;Blue Lotus Absolute (from Blue Lotus Exports)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also do an Amber from an Amber Resin. To the Body Oil, add about 7 grams of Amber resin broken into small pieces. Stand the bottlein a hot water bath (as mentioned above) for about 10 minutes, then shake until completely dissolved and homogenized. For most Amber resins, a little bit of precipitate afterwards is normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always remember to test a little bit of oil you&#x27;re not used to on your skin first to make sure you&#x27;re not allergic to it or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun!</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as I thought it would be. Would not buy this product again, expecially since my favorite oil is back on the market.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly light weight oil that has a very light to no scent.  It works well if used immediately after showering/bathing.  If skin is allowed to dry,  it does not absorb as well.  When applied to damp skin it works wonders.  The oil does not stain clothes even though it has a slight color to it. I like the results so much that I no longer buy traditional lotions.  As a guy, I desire to keep my skin moisturized without the annoying scents that tradition body lotions tend to have.  In my opinion, this oil is heavier than water but lighter than baby oil....it is closer to baby oil, but not as thick/heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI:  Make a mental note the this makes for an excellent massage oil.</li>
            <li> Even in the Summer, I need moisture on my body otherwise I&#x27;m horribly itchy. The lotion game takes so long and with everything else I do, it was becoming a daunting task after showers. This body oil has made post-shower moisturizing fast and easy. I just keep it in the bathroom and rub a few drops all over immediately after a shower. Wrap a towel around me and let it dry or, pat myself off if I&#x27;m in a hurry. No itchy legs for me :)</li>
            <li> this has just the right consistency.  i use it on damp skin out of the shower and to remove waterproof eyemakeup at night.  the frangrance free formula works with any perfume or scent.</li>
            <li> BUT NOT ANYMORE!!! This product is awesome. I put just a wee bit in my bathwater and voila!! Gets to places I was too lazy to reach. I&#x27;m not itchy from this terribly dry winter we&#x27;re having and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight. I love to also use this oil as a massage oil. There&#x27;s no fragrance which I like because it allows me to put on perfume without feeling too scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy in the bathtub&lt;br /&gt;Hydrating&lt;br /&gt;Soothing for itchy dry skin&lt;br /&gt;Spreads easily&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Can get a little pricey&lt;br /&gt;Must...have....more.....</li>
            <li> Wanted the Fagrance Free but got the gross smelly oil. Otherwise makes a very nice massage oil..</li>
            <li> This goes on soooooo easily and absorbs quickly into my skin.  There is a very slight shimmer upon application.  NOT greasy at all!!!!  Since this product is fragrance-free, I&#x27;ve also used it in my hair, and it works as well as the Fekkai hair oil I use.  It&#x27;s thin so it would be hard to overdo it like lotion.  The only thing is that when I&#x27;m in a rush, some oil droplets find their way to the floor or my counter.  Easy peasy to clean though.</li>
            <li> Ditch the lotion for this fantastic body oil.  I use this immediately after I shower and a little goes a long way.  My skin always have a healthy glow - even during winter.  My skin is moist and NOT OILY.  This is a FANTASTIC product!!</li>
            <li> Soothe well, and I like the aroma, prefer to buy bigger bottle to save money but it is not always available</li>
            <li> This is like a dream when is winter time.&lt;br /&gt;I use it and my skin feels awesome, the one with fragrance is very nice, my husband love it.&lt;br /&gt;For my niece I bought the one with no fragrance and she likes it. (The chlorine from the pool makes her skin very dry)</li>
            <li> Great skin product all year long.</li>
            <li> I needed something to use as a massage/moisturizer product for my wife and me. I have alleries and excema and thought this might be good for my skin. I bought it, although I often am sensitive to fragrances. It turns out that the vapors bother my eyes and the smell is somewhat too sweet. Being a low viscosity oil, it gets messy coming out of the bottle. When I used it the smell permeated the room, to the dismay of my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t use it with my wife. I might use it sparingly after I shower or dab it on my excema spots until it&#x27;s gone. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this for itchy dry winter skin! I put a little in my bath water and just soak. Makes a big difference. Be careful using in bathtub due to slip risk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and years. I wish they made this in the 32 oz size; but, I&#x27;m glad they made it at all.  I use to use the fragranced one; but, my boyfriend didn&#x27;t like the scent.  With this one, I can have no scent or add an essential oil of my choice - like lavender.</li>
            <li> I love this oil because it absorbs very well. It doesnt remain greasy on my skin either. It makes my skin smooth and soft after shower.</li>
            <li> I have been using this products for many years. Absorbs right into damp skin. does not leave you feeling greasy like baby oil. My local drug stores and big box stores don&#x27;t always have it in stock and i dont like to be without. Gives the skin a nice finish and feel.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of this body oil.  I am a constant customer.  It is not greasy and has a sesame smell I really like.  Only wish it came in larger sizes online.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and perfect for summer.  Much cheaper here than at Target, and it&#x27;s available in the larger size, which is a better deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product numerous times in drugstores in the past, but for some reason the product I received was a different formula and didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d anticipated. Disappointed and missed the return window.</li>
            <li> I used this product to take off eye makeup regularly, it works well.  It is light and fragrance free.  I will order it again</li>
            <li> makes your skin so soft! I use it regularly right after showering, keeps skin moist without the heavy oily feel/buildup so may other body oils leave.</li>
            <li> Great oil with no smell.  You can use this in bath or right from the bottle.  Try it you will like it!</li>
            <li> I like this almond oil product amd use it on my sensitive skin after showering.  It is light and absorbs quickly.  It feels good on my arms, legs and chest areas and keeps my dry skin moister and smoother.  Many stores sell the scented version of this oil but it smells too strong and is not as good for sensitive skin or those with allergies.  The price is comparable to that I have paid in Wal-mart in the past.</li>
            <li> For years I have used oil on my wet skin after a shower/bath because of its moisturizing power. But when I was skin tested for allergies for new skin issues, it was discovered that I have an allergy to fragrance. That&#x27;s when I switched to this product. It does what I need it to.</li>
            <li> I love love love love this oil. Use it in the bath or lightly in the shower and you will not feel oily like with others. This is my daily treatment for my super dry sensitive skin and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. It absorbs into your skin but keeps you smooth. I use a little more liberally on my arms and shoulders if I want a bit of a sheen.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel so smooth and so soft, even during the tough winter months! I like to put it in a little mini-spray-bottle and spray it on, rubbing it gently into my skin right after my shower. You&#x27;ll never want or need another lotion after trying this!</li>
            <li> I have had this product for about a week. I purchased a small spray bottle at the same time. I suffer from chronically dry skin and a deep hatred for the slimy feeling I get when I use lotion. This product is fantastic because I don&#x27;t feel oily, slimy, or gross! It seals in moisture after my shower, absorbs as soon as you evenly distribute it, and makes my skin soft and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the only thing I dislike about it: It does not seem to last the whole day. This is probably because of how crazy dry my skin is. It has helped my cracked dry feet, however, about halfway through the day, my feet hurt and feel dry again. I&#x27;m hoping that as my skin heals this product will start to last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if it doesn&#x27;t I will never go back to lotion again because I can&#x27;t handle feeling slimy, and don&#x27;t ever want to give up the glowing healthy skin feeling I get right after I put this on. Slimy isn&#x27;t a natural feeling for human skin!</li>
            <li> This is a terrific body oil.  You need only a few drops for each section of your body, so it lasts a long time.  If you put it on right after your shower, when you&#x27;re still wet, it soaks in and your skin feels great.  And, you don&#x27;t get that awful winter dryness.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This is so hard to find in the store - and I have to have fragrance free - this was a great find on line.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic moisturizer. I have very dry skin, especially on my arms and legs. I haven&#x27;t had much luck with lotions on these areas. The lotions that do moisturize leave my skin extremely greasy, which is so unpleasant -- both to look at and to feel -- that I prefer inadequate moisturizers and dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is fantastic. Although it&#x27;s oil, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or greasy -- just soft and fully moisturized. I was surprised how nicely it worked the first time; the results were immediate and have been lasting. Even if I end up skipping a use in the shower, my skin is still better overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had another concern about using oil: clogged pores, which can lead to acne or ingrown hair. After several weeks, I haven&#x27;t had any problems -- just smooth skin. I epilate, so ingrown hair can become a problem without exfoliating, which I also do regularly. But even with exfoliating, I think if this stuff clogged pores then I would have noticed by now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use, I rub a little bit over my skin in the bath and soak, or rub a little on after taking a shower. Either way works well and I do both, but putting it on after a shower and allowing it to dry works more thoroughly for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the fragrance free type, which I like. I haven&#x27;t tried the other type. As another reviewer said, it doesn&#x27;t smell like food or anything; it smells fine. When I use it after showering, once it dries the light smell goes away. When I use it in the bath I can&#x27;t smell it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A full five stars for this great product. I don&#x27;t ever want to be without it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product thinking it was the sesame scented but I didn&#x27;t realize it was fragrance free. The initial oil works the same but I prefer the light sesame fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love the unscented Neutrogena Body Oil and it is difficult to find. I am allergic to the regular sesame oil. This vendor sent the correct oil and extremely quickly. I am very happy and plan to reorder from them.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It really does a terrific job moisturizing without feeling goopy and greasy. Although I love the mildly scented version of this oil, my husband has a strong sensitivity to fragrances, so I am thrilled to have found it on Amazon. (My local drug store has discontinued the fragrance free version).  When I take a bath, I squeeze some in the tub, and when I shower, I apply immediately after toweling off, while my skin is still moist.  By the  way...This oil is also a staple my the bedroom for those &amp;#34;intimate moments.&amp;#34;  If you purchase it just for that reason alone, you will be pleased that you did.</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by the reviews, but I actually wouldn&#x27;t bother to order this again.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too light.  It absorbs well, but I&#x27;d prefer something more effective.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, light body oil that doesn&#x27;t leave your body feeling oily or greasy!&lt;br /&gt;It hydrates your skin.  perfect for a full body massage.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Would recommend. Like this better than lotion. It drys quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel oily. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like this oil a lot as its non sticky and keeps my skin from drying out.  I recoment this to anyone. If you workout like I do, and have a decent mascular definition, It sure helps to show off your muscles as it has a slight shimmer when applied.</li>
            <li> It works good on my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> Planning to use this for a christmas present for my girlfriend. She&#x27;s going to be stoked after getting a sensual massage! :)</li>
            <li> A lot of products like this leave the skin feeling very slick and oily and kinda nasty.  This stuff is very light, no smell, and it goes on nice, and doesnt leave you feeling like you just took an oil shower.  GREAT massage oil.</li>
            <li> Moisturization doesn&#x27;t last very long, as I find myself reapplying often. Makes my skin really soft afterwards though.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, use it after I shower....keeps my skin smooth and soft without being heavy like some creams and other oils. I am sensitive to perfumes and it&#x27;s difficult to find this product in the unscented form....gawd, how I love my AMAZON!</li>
            <li> Many people suffer from all sorts of allergies more than ever today. For a massage oil or just for general lubricating use, this fragrant-free SESAME formula is excellent. This oil can be adapted to suit skins highly sensitive to any odour or smell.</li>
            <li> This product is light but still very effective.  This fragrance free version is much better because there is no strong smell to clash with anything else you may wear.  I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Non-greasy and great to add to the bath.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years.  I have tried lots of body oils, but this is my favorite.  Sometime hard to find the unscented in drugstores, but not on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I bought this oil for dual purpose.  Not only does in mosturize it also repells bugs (i.e. sand fleas)  I travel to an island where sand fleas can be a problem and this oil repels them.  Perfect light scent.</li>
            <li> I could go on and on about this stuff! If you have dry winter skin this is a life saver! Put it on after you shower, it soaks in, it doesn&#x27;t leave greasy mess! No heavy perfume smell!</li>
            <li> I have used this body oil for years now.  Just pour some into your hand. Glide it over damp skin.  Instant velvet!</li>
            <li> No fragrance, just a faint natural scent and moisturization like nothing else. Doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out and is light enough to dab on the ends of my hair as a final conditioner without even the faintest hint of greasiness; my skin glows and there&#x27;s absolutely no &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; look or feel, just soft healthy skin.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff.  it is not too greasy and you can put it directly on the skin or in the bath water.  I like to use it after exfoliating with a stiff scrub brush.</li>
            <li> I bought these because they were recommended by my parents&#x27; doctor for dry skin treatment.  I couldn&#x27;t find them at local stores like Walgreens or CVS, but was able to buy them at amazon.com. I use it too and my skin is much softer than before.</li>
            <li> my wifes skin is as smooth as a baby ass.</li>
            <li> About six years ago I tried a bottle of this oil that has fragrance and was thoroughly disgusted with the horrible \\&quot;Old Lady\\&quot; fragrance and gave it away. I did however love the way it absorbed into my skin and did not feel greasy so I was delighted to find a smaller bottle that cost more and was fragrant free. Living in Vermont I need to apply an after shower oil over my entire body to keep from drying out in the winter. I have not found an oil that works better than this product. It is light and a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years... Love it!</li>
            <li> Great Body oil for dry skin. Especially in the dry climate we have now(Jan) in the NorthEast. Leaves your skin silky smooth without annoying too slickness!</li>
