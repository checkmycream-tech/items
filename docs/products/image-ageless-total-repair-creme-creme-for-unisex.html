            <li>Some people can use these types of treatments every night but many can&#x27;t because of skin sensitivity.</li>

            <li>I love this moisturizer.  </li>

            <li>Great Night Cream can tell a huge difference already,Face is firm and smooth the fine lines around eyes are fading, works great for our aging skin.update.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use this every night because it is too strong.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell either.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and well packaged!  </li>
            <li>Great Product, this is the one I always come back to.</li>
            <li>and this is not the original one.</li>
            <li>I noticed an improvement 24 hours after applying the cream which is rich, and the skin of my face loves</li>
            <li>I suggest combining with a full Image system of your choice.</li>
            <li>It does have a very mediciney smell which I do not like, wish it smelled better.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased from a salon and found it on Amazon much more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Because the creme encourages the skin to regenerate, it is amazing for any facial blemish.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>(Yeah, right -</li>
            <li>Not only does my skin look healthier, I look better than I do 20 years ago.</li>
            <li>the smell when you first put it on.  </li>
            <li>The first one was.</li>
            <li>I have been using image products for years now and this is the first time i purchased the repair cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to order through Amazon...found the product at a derm office, but live too far away.  </li>
            <li>Results more than expected</li>
            <li>And the whole Image line</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I took this to a spa that now sells this and looks nothing like the real deal.</li>
            <li>my absolute &#x27;go to&#x27; night cream.</li>
            <li>But I dread putting this particular product on before bed.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Cream works very well although it caused some irritation to my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>But I apply it in places where I even get the inkling acne might sprout up, as well as along my forehead to make the skin look new.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is very exfoliating but not good for sensitive skin because it is very strong.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this cream, it stung but only in one area.</li>
            <li>In the morning I wake up with a clearly renewed skin.</li>
            <li>Started really really using this every night and w/in 2 weeks saw a big difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I use this at night after cleansing and it makes my face feel soft and moist.  </li>
            <li>I started using this for adult acne and it has worked miracles.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, it has no paraben; on the negative side, it is in a wide-mouthed jar that compromises the product (better to have it in a tube).</li>
            <li>Recently tried this line and really like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s either the ammonia, or since it&#x27;s professional line, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;stronger.&amp;#34; I wouldn&#x27;t order unless you talk to a professional....</li>
            <li>And I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The first times I could feel a little bit of tingling (my beautician had informed me about that, it&#x27;s normal).</li>
            <li>I recently purchased a new one in January 2016</li>
            <li>I am very conscious of my skin and regularly see a dermatologist and get regular facials.</li>
            <li>I really like the other products from Image skincare though.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok, don&#x27;t see any dramatic difference</li>
            <li>definitely for mature skin and helps it look younger!</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad and seems to hydrate fairly well.</li>

            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad and seems to hydrate fairly well.</li>
            <li> Can be very harsh at first.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin but have not noticed reddness or tingling with the use as mentioned by other.  </li>
            <li> This creme stings a little when I use it at night, but when I wake up in the morning my skin is very firm and smooth.  </li>
            <li> May have to take it slow at first.</li>
            <li> My skin is not sensitive at all.</li>
            <li> I could only use it for 3 days after I spent the money for it.</li>
            <li> Never had such problem with any of my other creams.</li>
            <li> It actually burns a little after I put it on, but never makes my face red or causes and skin problems.  </li>
            <li> You could narrow it down to your particular needs as to which products you choose.  </li>
            <li> But it definitely works; the appearance of my skin has improved and crow&#x27;s feet are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> and you only need a little.  </li>
            <li> Not really.</li>
            <li> Was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I put this on every other night as it is a little too harsh for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I only apply a small amount though.  </li>
            <li> the only reason why I give it 3 stars is, on the ingredient list it says &amp;#34;ammonia&amp;#34;... not sure why you would need to put that on your face, but keep in mind.</li>
            <li> I could only use 2 to 3 days out of the week, until it truly sloughed off the skin layers slowly.</li>
            <li> This cream does not smell like it should, it smells like medicine, still have it, untouched because i was afraid it wasnt the right product in container.</li>
            <li> It truly turns over skin, and softer less blotchy skin is revealed.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was a little pricey</li>
            <li> So unfortunately I wasted money and don&#x27;t have any results.</li>
            <li> I use this cream every few nights at the suggestion of my dermatologist, and like the way it leaves my skin feeling and looking refreshed.</li>
            <li> I know, hard to believe,</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> One negative</li>
            <li> It is just weird.  </li>
            <li> My daughter also said this is fake .</li>
            <li> Smells bad and irritates around eyes so don&#x27;t get close</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad</li>
            <li> Hate this, it burns your skin.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best product, best price!</li>
            <li> This is it! I bought this while at a spa in Turks and Caicos. I am blown away with how it has improved the texture, suppleness of my skin. Not only does my skin look healthier, I look better than I do 20 years ago. I know, hard to believe, but if I can upload pics, I would. I&#x27;m 47 and I have both men and women telling me I can pass for 20-something. (Yeah, right - but I love it!)</li>
            <li> Not what I thought and it did not deliver. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> Everything Image works for me.  It&#x27;s easy to order through Amazon...found the product at a derm office, but live too far away.  Ordering on line works for me</li>
            <li> Love the product. Results more than expected</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this product, I have had numerous comments on how &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; I look.  At the age of 65, I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!! And the whole Image line</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent night cream.</li>
            <li> This is very exfoliating but not good for sensitive skin because it is very strong. Excellent for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s. Started really really using this every night and w/in 2 weeks saw a big difference in my skin. Even people at work asked what I was doing. This is the best.</li>
            <li> This does just what it says. Can be very harsh at first. It takes a while for skin to adjust. It truly turns over skin, and softer less blotchy skin is revealed.  May have to take it slow at first. I could only use 2 to 3 days out of the week, until it truly sloughed off the skin layers slowly. Then what you see is a true difference!</li>
            <li> One of the best night creams I&#x27;ve tried. Worth the money.  I suggest combining with a full Image system of your choice. I like ageless fir my maturing skin.</li>
            <li> Good combination the quality and price.</li>
            <li> Best face cream I have found, and I have tried most.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and well packaged!  I use this product all the time with great results.</li>
            <li> I use this at night after cleansing and it makes my face feel soft and moist.  I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, don&#x27;t see any dramatic difference but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad and seems to hydrate fairly well.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.  I love the way that is is non-greasy and it just absorbs into your skin immediately.  It never leaves you feeling greasy.  One negative though....the smell when you first put it on.  It is just weird.  Please put some fragrance in it and then I will give it a 5 star.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, I wake up with skin smooth as silk.  I have very sensitive skin and it does not irritate it at all. Note that an esthetician told me that it&#x27;s like using a peel, so for my skin, 3x a week is enough.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!&lt;br /&gt; This is one of the few face creams that really does make a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Hate this, it burns your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T purchase from 101 Beauty Store, they deny your return!</li>
            <li> I started using this for adult acne and it has worked miracles.  Because the creme encourages the skin to regenerate, it is amazing for any facial blemish.  I only use it on &amp;#34;trouble spots.&amp;#34;  But I apply it in places where I even get the inkling acne might sprout up, as well as along my forehead to make the skin look new.  It is worth the price.  I couldn&#x27;t imagine giving it up at this point.</li>
            <li> Image products are wonderful!  This creme stings a little when I use it at night, but when I wake up in the morning my skin is very firm and smooth.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Great Product, this is the one I always come back to.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I first purchased from a salon and found it on Amazon much more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I received a recommendation from a friend regarding this product and thought I would give it a try. I am very conscious of my skin and regularly see a dermatologist and get regular facials. This product is  a great find. I use it at night and as soon as I put it in I feel the tingle of the retinol. I have recommended this product to my friends as well.</li>
            <li> My esthetician gave me a sample of this, and I&#x27;m going to buy a regular size. Buyers should note: this is NOT a night cream or moisturizer in the traditional sense. It&#x27;s a TREATMENT of glycolic/retinol. Some people can use these types of treatments every night but many can&#x27;t because of skin sensitivity. The first time I tried this cream, it stung but only in one area. I tried it again after a week, with no stinging. Now I use it about twice a week. I cleanse my face, add pea size of the product for each cheek and forehead, then I add a good night moisturizer. On the plus side, it has no paraben; on the negative side, it is in a wide-mouthed jar that compromises the product (better to have it in a tube).</li>
            <li> Cream works very well although it caused some irritation to my sensitive skin therefore I have to use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for about the week.  I have not noticed any difference, but guessing it will take longer than a weeks use.  It does have a very mediciney smell which I do not like, wish it smelled better.  I also have sensitive skin but have not noticed reddness or tingling with the use as mentioned by other.  I only apply a small amount though.  Hoping with more use will see results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this every night because it is too strong. Use about twice a week. Love the Image line!</li>
            <li> I love this product line.  Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Great Night Cream can tell a huge difference already,Face is firm and smooth the fine lines around eyes are fading, works great for our aging skin.update.I recently purchased a new one in January 2016 and this is not the original one.The first one was.I took this to a spa that now sells this and looks nothing like the real deal.This one is yellow and burns ,a gel like consistency. The one at spa is white ,just wish I knew this spa started selling this I would have purchased there instead of here.My daughter also said this is fake .</li>
            <li> Great seller, authentic product, good price. Recently tried this line and really like it. Will like to try image MD as well.</li>
            <li> This is a re-order of a product I am using.</li>
            <li> This is the best night cream I have ever used. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love Image products. But I don&#x27;t like this one. I should have listened to the reviews that said it burns and smells like medicine. My skin is not sensitive at all. I have used many products for my skin and even had peels. But I dread putting this particular product on before bed. So unfortunately I wasted money and don&#x27;t have any results.</li>
            <li> the only reason why I give it 3 stars is, on the ingredient list it says &amp;#34;ammonia&amp;#34;... not sure why you would need to put that on your face, but keep in mind. I love the Image line and I use it, but this cream... not so sure. I use facial brush when I wash my face, and I can&#x27;t put this cream on after I&#x27;ve used the brush. Never had such problem with any of my other creams. It&#x27;s either the ammonia, or since it&#x27;s professional line, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;stronger.&amp;#34; I wouldn&#x27;t order unless you talk to a professional....</li>
            <li> definitely for mature skin and helps it look younger!</li>
            <li> I have been using image products for years now and this is the first time i purchased the repair cream.  I have to say my face felt great afterwards.</li>
            <li> I discovered that brand and that line in a Beauty Salon (had a facial done with those products). I use the Total Repair creme at night, on the Image Skincare Ageless Total Anti-Aging Serum. The first times I could feel a little bit of tingling (my beautician had informed me about that, it&#x27;s normal). Now I am used to it. In the morning I wake up with a clearly renewed skin.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this before and I love it!</li>
            <li> My favorite product of Image.  Noticeable difference in texture of skin within 3months.</li>
            <li> Smells bad and irritates around eyes so don&#x27;t get close</li>
            <li> my absolute &#x27;go to&#x27; night cream. i&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 years. there is enough tingle after exfoliating to know it&#x27;s &#x27;working&#x27;. i get compliments on my skin. at 62, that&#x27;s enough for me.</li>
            <li> This cream does not smell like it should, it smells like medicine, still have it, untouched because i was afraid it wasnt the right product in container.</li>
            <li> Feel the tingle! This cream works great!</li>
            <li> I put this on every other night as it is a little too harsh for my sensitive skin.  But it definitely works; the appearance of my skin has improved and crow&#x27;s feet are less noticeable.  As is it drying, I follow with moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product works, but it does smell like cat urine.  I really like the other products from Image skincare though.</li>
            <li> Not really. Was not what I expected. It made my skin have a burning sensation so therefore I had to stop using it. It&#x27;s too bad I could only use it for 3 days after I spent the money for it.</li>
            <li> I have many of the products through the Image line.  Love them all.  They have made a big difference in the appearance of my skin.  My skin is smoother and healthier looking.  I would not hesitate to purchase any of their products.  You could narrow it down to your particular needs as to which products you choose.  This one is to be used in the evening for overnight repair.</li>
            <li> Excellent! I noticed an improvement 24 hours after applying the cream which is rich, and the skin of my face loves</li>
            <li> Image skincare has change my life! I love their products, the ageless repair creme has improve the skin texture and condition on my face, I love it!!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great price and product</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a number of months and like the way it makes my skin feel and look.  I use a number of products from this line.</li>
            <li> I got it sooner then i thought!!! It&#x27;s been great!</li>
            <li> I use this cream every few nights at the suggestion of my dermatologist, and like the way it leaves my skin feeling and looking refreshed.</li>
            <li> I give this 5 stars because for me it was like a facelift in a bottle.  I use Image face cleanser and moisturizer so this was the third product I needed - a night cream.  I thought it was a little pricey but it is a good sized jar and you only need a little.  It actually burns a little after I put it on, but never makes my face red or causes and skin problems.  And I have sensitive skin.  It has reduce sagging and wrinkles tht nothing else seemed to help.  Doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell either.  It works more than great for me.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  I use it at night and I feel it makes a difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
