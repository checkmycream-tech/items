            <li>The brush it comes with does not help the product to be an on the go item, but it makes me think the item may have been even more affordable with out this sort of packaging.</li>
            <li>I love this powder.</li>
            <li>I love this powder.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Translucent powder should have no pigment and this one has a lovely orange hue.</li>
            <li>its ok.</li>
            <li>It gives good coverage, but maybe not as good as the other brand.</li>
            <li>this true match naturale face powder is okay</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 66 years old and am very happy with the natural finish of this powder.</li>
            <li>is important have this product</li>
            <li>Have high quality and amazing performance.</li>
            <li>True Match Naturale Finish</li>
            <li>This makeup goes on so quickly and neatly.</li>
            <li>very much was cheap and will order again</li>
            <li>It gives a very soft, dewy appearance on top of makeup , and gives it a finished look.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years, and I love it!</li>
            <li>, I expected more than cute packaging.</li>
            <li>So this whole process of using a litte powder, than applying and then trying to get more powder takes alot to apply to my whole face.</li>
            <li>It might not be as lasting, but I love the way it interacts with my skin.</li>
            <li>i actually would like it better if the brush wasnt attached.</li>
            <li>Without adding or removing any color from your freshly applied makeup, this finisher just makes your fine lines and larger pores all but disappear.</li>
            <li>I just really do like L&#x27;Oreal products and this one is another hit for me.  </li>
            <li>so it really didn&#x27;t do much for me.  </li>
            <li>Also, it goes on very sparingly no matter how much you apply.  </li>
            <li>This item got here on a reasonable time when I really needed powder and didn&#x27;t have the time to go to the store</li>
            <li>I really like this powder, but it does have a tendency to get everywhere</li>
            <li>I live in Texas and it is way to hot in the summer for liquid make up.</li>
            <li>This product is better than i expected!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light on my face and matches my skin tone with is really hard when I&#x27;m really lightly olive skinned.&lt;br</li>
            <li>was it right size package and was a little light for me</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have never used it just on its own only over other makeup.  </li>
            <li>I bought the L&#x27;Oreal Mineral Finish thinking it would help make my makeup application look a little more refined.  </li>
            <li>it comes with because you seem to waste more that way.</li>
            <li>Usually use it over top of BB cream to diffuse the dewy moist feel.</li>
            <li>I regularly use higher-end makeup (NARS, Urban Decay, Makeup Forever), and I found that after trying several finishing powders, this still remains my favorite.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nowhere to pour it into except the clear plastic lid.</li>
            <li>this product help for complete anything.</li>
            <li>I like it with my own brush though you still need to be careful it is messy!</li>
            <li>This works okay, but the brush it comes with is not good at all the bristles come off on my face every time.  </li>
            <li>This was just too light on my skin...which is hard to do because I am white as paper.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure quite HOW it does what it does, but it does it very well.</li>
            <li> Seems to last a long time too.</li>
            <li> For redness and blemishes, I use a flat brush or my finger to press the powder onto the area to cover and even the tone.</li>
            <li> so it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> so if you try to tap out some powder you&#x27;ll either lose half on the counter or lose some into this clear lid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for a long time.</li>
            <li> However, the application process takes so long</li>
            <li> i feel like i loose a lot of powered when i remove the brush.....</li>
            <li> I would be crushed if they ever discontinue it.</li>
            <li> On the other hand it does waht it made for a translucent cover giving you that nautale finish.</li>
            <li> The product itself is quality in my opinion but it does leave a slightly shiny look to the skin that could be mistaken for oil.  </li>
            <li> cause it can make you look a little ghostly.</li>
            <li> I use it as a base and really don&#x27;t feel that I also need powder.  </li>
            <li> Translucent is my base and powder all in one.</li>

            <li> This is really a nice product.  I use it as a base and really don&#x27;t feel that I also need powder.  I just really do like L&#x27;Oreal products and this one is another hit for me.  Recommend that you buy this one.</li>
            <li> was it right size package and was a little light for me but i am very happy ty very much was cheap and will order again</li>
            <li> This powder is good if you have good skin.  I tend to have problem skin so it really didn&#x27;t do much for me.  Also, it goes on very sparingly no matter how much you apply.  I guess it doesn&#x27;t have enough coverage for me.</li>
            <li> This product is better than i expected! Have high quality and amazing performance. I will buy anothers products like this.</li>
            <li> Great powder- feels nice, good color</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years, and I love it!</li>
            <li> I love how this powder gives me a flawless finish.</li>
            <li> I used to only use the more expensive bareminerals brand, but when I saw this and read the reviews, I thought why not give it a try. I do like it, and I love the price. Seems to last a long time too. It gives good coverage, but maybe not as good as the other brand. Still, it works for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure quite HOW it does what it does, but it does it very well. Without adding or removing any color from your freshly applied makeup, this finisher just makes your fine lines and larger pores all but disappear. Stays on all day, provides a beautiful finish to mineral foundation!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for a long time. L&#x27;Oreal is the only company I can find that makes the translucent powder. It gives a very soft, dewy appearance on top of makeup , and gives it a finished look.  Couldn&#x27;t use makeup without it. Thanks for a great product. Don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
            <li> This works great as a finishing powder.  I have never used it just on its own only over other makeup.  Usually use it over top of BB cream to diffuse the dewy moist feel.</li>
            <li> this true match naturale face powder is okay, I expected more than cute packaging.

            <li> I love this powder. It makes my skin look flawless after concealer and foundation application. The color doesn&#x27;t compete with my foundation. It doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines. It doesn&#x27;t cause me any breakouts. I have used this powder for 5 years now. I would be crushed if they ever discontinue it.</li>
            <li> True Match Naturale Finish Translucent is my base and powder all in one. For redness and blemishes, I use a flat brush or my finger to press the powder onto the area to cover and even the tone. I finish with a dusting of the powder overall. I&#x27;m 66 years old and am very happy with the natural finish of this powder.</li>
            <li> I love the way it covers!</li>
            <li> I regularly use higher-end makeup (NARS, Urban Decay, Makeup Forever), and I found that after trying several finishing powders, this still remains my favorite. It might not be as lasting, but I love the way it interacts with my skin. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this powder.  I prefer the one with a pinkish hue to this one cause it can make you look a little ghostly. This one is great to get rid of any shine without looking too powdery. I don&#x27;t use the brush it comes with because you seem to waste more that way.</li>
            <li> this product is interesting and good product. good factory. this product help for complete anything. is important have this product</li>
            <li> I love this product.I live in Texas and it is way to hot in the summer for liquid make up.This goes on beautiful! And it&lt;br /&gt;does not break out my skin.</li>
            <li> I like this Finish because it is really good for when you are travelling, The two on one is great.</li>
            <li> lOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT! IT&#x27;S LITE AND SILKY, MAKES MY FACE FEEL LIKE A BABY&#x27;S BOTTOM~</li>
            <li> Translucent powder should have no pigment and this one has a lovely orange hue. Yuck.</li>
            <li> This works okay, but the brush it comes with is not good at all the bristles come off on my face every time.  I like it with my own brush though you still need to be careful it is messy!</li>
            <li> This was just too light on my skin...which is hard to do because I am white as paper.  I do like it for an under eye, acne, and eyeshadow highlight.  And there is a lot of product for the price so it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought the L&#x27;Oreal Mineral Finish thinking it would help make my makeup application look a little more refined.  The product itself is quality in my opinion but it does leave a slightly shiny look to the skin that could be mistaken for oil.  I do not use it for daytime but if I am going out somewhere in the evening I can wear it because the lighting does not cause the sheen to be noticable.</li>
            <li> its ok. i actually would like it better if the brush wasnt attached. i feel like i loose a lot of powered when i remove the brush.....even if i dont use this brush, its still stuck to the underneath of the brush and falls off.</li>
            <li> I have a somewhat oily face -- this gives me a polished look without appearing inhuman. I really like this powder, but it does have a tendency to get everywhere (is it just me?)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the brush.</li>
            <li> fr gtr tuytgtrhy qert rty ewr t qer f tgs wg trytwg 5 qa t  w t  343 5 y74t w t</li>
            <li> I like how this looks and the color blends well with my skin. However, the application process takes so long and I end up losing some of the powder. There&#x27;s nowhere to pour it into except the clear plastic lid. But that doesn&#x27;t screw onto the jar (only over the brush) so if you try to tap out some powder you&#x27;ll either lose half on the counter or lose some into this clear lid. Since the lid doesn&#x27;t line up, some will fall out and the lid is so deep that any left inside you can&#x27;t reach with the brush. So this whole process of using a litte powder, than applying and then trying to get more powder takes alot to apply to my whole face.</li>
