            <li>AND WE LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>THE LAB IS REALLY CUTE,</li>
            <li>Each grave has its own light.  </li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>They just love it</li>
            <li>AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve been warned :)</li>
            <li>The Lab itself is adorable-</li>
            <li>We have gotten so many comments on it, including a friend who asked if I would mind if she copied my purchase for her yard -</li>
            <li>The price was okay for the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>Arrived in complete and great shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the dog, but the light keeps falling off.  </li>
            <li>Would have been better without the light.</li>
            <li>It was shipped very quickly and arrived without any problem.</li>
            <li>Paint comes off feet of dog easily</li>
            <li>I really thought this lab statue was very cute.</li>
            <li>She has a beautiful back yard</li>
            <li>The light is a nice bright white light.</li>
            <li>Perfect replica of a black lab.</li>
            <li>This solar light was everything that I was hoping it would be.  </li>
            <li>Nicely detailed too.</li>
            <li>At night, he brings the light inside for a night lite, hanging it on the dog.</li>
            <li>and I dried it out as best I could.</li>
            <li>Light no longer works.</li>
            <li>I needed a thoughtful gift for my daughter and her fiance for Xmas.</li>
            <li>This product is made well, packed so professionly, and well worth the price, in fact more.</li>
            <li>A light in the garden to point the way.</li>
            <li>The lantern on this item collects water and as a result rusts the light.  </li>
            <li>The glue had come undone on the lantern causing it to fall apart where the light piece is inside the lantern.</li>
            <li>Components in light not even mounted in housing.</li>
            <li>Cute dog, but the lantern pulled the hook right out of the statue.</li>
            <li>Solar light worked right out of the box!  </li>
            <li>This lovely statue looks exactly like it did in the photo on line.  </li>
            <li>I do have to say though that after sending pictures to the seller and a detailed email explaining my dissatisfaction I did receive a full refund.</li>
            <li>Paint came off to quickly , the light quit working ,</li>
            <li>Hi, the handicraft on this item was very detailed and it really is hand painted.  </li>
            <li>I have it on top of brick pillar, my Lab looked at it like it was real.</li>
            <li>It was a good choice for a gift to a dog lover and my only regret</li>
            <li>She says she like it, so thats good enough for me</li>
            <li>It was a gift and the recipient was ecstatic and enjoys it VERY much!</li>
            <li>Plus the light really works well.</li>
            <li>The solar light is very bright,lights up our front porch door.</li>
            <li>The top screws completely rusted away to a point I would have had to drill them out.</li>
            <li>I loved it soooo much that I ordered the second one.  </li>
            <li>just the right size.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This garden light is truly a realistic design with regard to the dog.  </li>
            <li>This is such a cute item, and it is very pretty at night.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product to use as a memorial for my beloved 14 yr old lab that recently passed.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a gift for a friend who has a black Labrador Retriever and he absolutely loved it!&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>The dog with the lantern that lights up at dusk looks very nice by my small pond.</li>
            <li>The one metal post that holds the top and bottom of the lantern was not the right size making my lantern crooked severely.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>After receiving a Dalmatian (wrong item shipped) - the replacement was wonderful.</li>
            <li>(since the solar light never worked for me I ended up putting this on a covered porch so it wasn&#x27;t ever directly exposed to the elements).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My grandma and I seen one of these at  tractor supply and it was a lot higher there</li>
            <li>I thought it would be bigger, but it is cute.</li>
            <li>Looks like the picture exactly.  </li>
            <li>When I originally bought it I had issues with the solar lamp only working upon arrival and then could not get the lamp to light up at all no matter how much sun it got.</li>
            <li>This is adorable my lab puppy thought it was real and sniffed it three different times.</li>
            <li>Its a nice looking ornament which i am interested in black labradors i have always had and liked black dogs all my life</li>
            <li>Great present for any black lab or garden lover.</li>
            <li>Better than expected.  </li>
            <li>During the day, he sets the light outside to charge.</li>
            <li>IT THINKS ITS REAL.  </li>
            <li>Possible to get light replacement.</li>
            <li>IT WAS REAL AND STARTED BARKING AT THE LAB.</li>
            <li>it looks so real my dog barks at it.</li>
            <li>They was very prompt about refunding my money so I can&#x27;t complain there.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Expected a bit more...</li>
            <li>Packed very well too.</li>
            <li>very shaded.</li>
            <li>Still works but not as bright as the other lantern on the second lab.</li>
            <li>Very well constructed, and the solar light is much brighter than expected.</li>
            <li>Eh, no big deal, I threw out the solar lamp and just bought a cute blue jar to hang in its mouth that I could put a candle</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>The look on the lab&#x27;s face is adorable and the other features are so true of our black lab.  </li>
            <li>I have seen better quality comming from my local dollar general and they only want $5-10 for there garden statues ( no they aren&#x27;t solar though).</li>
            <li>I purchased the item as a gift and the recipient was very surprised at the originality and usefulness.</li>
            <li>I tried to hot glue it back into place, but that didn&#x27;t work either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as the statue go, I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>point is, for the price, this is an overpriced decoration that never really functioned as it should from the beginning, and now more defects have finally shown themselves years later.</li>
            <li>Though the dog&#x27;s mouth is exaggerated to the point of being unsightly, this is a cute garden fixture especially with the addition of the solar light.</li>
            <li>It was priced so reasonably compared to many other comparable things online, that I figured I had little to lose.  </li>
            <li>I thought the dog would be a little bigger, Its rained about 2 times and there moisture built up in the lantern already, the light part seems to do ok for no more sunlight</li>
            <li>Not sure of the lantern light because my yard does not get 6 to 8 hours of sunlight.</li>
            <li>If one expects it to be \\&quot;actual size,\\&quot; one will be disappointed, but it is pretty darn cute ;-)  </li>
            <li>It really does look like my friend&#x27;s former black lab.  </li>

            <li> (since the solar light never worked for me I ended up putting this on a covered porch so it wasn&#x27;t ever directly exposed to the elements).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My grandma and I seen one of these at  tractor supply and it was a lot higher there</li>
            <li> I thought it would be bigger, but it is cute.</li>
            <li> Looks like the picture exactly.  </li>
            <li> When I originally bought it I had issues with the solar lamp only working upon arrival and then could not get the lamp to light up at all no matter how much sun it got.</li>
            <li> This is adorable my lab puppy thought it was real and sniffed it three different times.</li>
            <li> Its a nice looking ornament which i am interested in black labradors i have always had and liked black dogs all my life</li>
            <li> Great present for any black lab or garden lover.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.  </li>
            <li> During the day, he sets the light outside to charge.</li>
            <li> IT THINKS ITS REAL.  </li>
            <li> Possible to get light replacement.</li>
            <li> IT WAS REAL AND STARTED BARKING AT THE LAB.</li>
            <li> it looks so real my dog barks at it.</li>
            <li> They was very prompt about refunding my money so I can&#x27;t complain there.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Expected a bit more...</li>
            <li> Packed very well too.</li>
            <li> very shaded.</li>
            <li> Still works but not as bright as the other lantern on the second lab.</li>
            <li> Very well constructed, and the solar light is much brighter than expected.</li>
            <li> Eh, no big deal, I threw out the solar lamp and just bought a cute blue jar to hang in its mouth that I could put a candle</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> The look on the lab&#x27;s face is adorable and the other features are so true of our black lab.  </li>
            <li> I have seen better quality comming from my local dollar general and they only want $5-10 for there garden statues ( no they aren&#x27;t solar though).</li>
            <li> I purchased the item as a gift and the recipient was very surprised at the originality and usefulness.</li>
            <li> I tried to hot glue it back into place, but that didn&#x27;t work either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as the statue go, I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> point is, for the price, this is an overpriced decoration that never really functioned as it should from the beginning, and now more defects have finally shown themselves years later.</li>
            <li> Though the dog&#x27;s mouth is exaggerated to the point of being unsightly, this is a cute garden fixture especially with the addition of the solar light.</li>
            <li> It was priced so reasonably compared to many other comparable things online, that I figured I had little to lose.  </li>
            <li> I thought the dog would be a little bigger, Its rained about 2 times and there moisture built up in the lantern already, the light part seems to do ok for no more sunlight</li>
            <li> Not sure of the lantern light because my yard does not get 6 to 8 hours of sunlight.</li>
            <li> If one expects it to be \\&quot;actual size,\\&quot; one will be disappointed, but it is pretty darn cute ;-)  </li>
            <li> It really does look like my friend&#x27;s former black lab.  </li>
            <li> This is a highly recommended item to all black lab fans.</li>
            <li> The light does tend to blur out the dog if there aren&#x27;t any other lights around it, but I don&#x27;t see that as a negative.  </li>
            <li> Bought it for Dad (retired)  who recently lost his black lab to old age, he seems to like it.</li>
            <li> I super glued the legs back on and we will see if it works or not (lol).</li>
            <li> Just as expected, but smaller than the one I have outside.</li>
            <li> Initially I just thought well I guess it is a few years old</li>
            <li> The solar light lantern&#x27;s battery failed.</li>
            <li> He is smaller than I expected, but I like him..</li>
            <li> My friend brought the dog/light into the house and it stayed lit all night long.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to sit by the fireplace in my &amp;#34;man cave&amp;#34;, so it is just right for me, but it would be too small scale for outdoors, say at an  entrance door...too small.</li>
            <li> the lantern failed right away and just now getting around to trying to see if there is option, though I do see others had similar problem.  </li>
            <li> However with that said, I know its not like having the real thing, but my wife wanted it to go with her black rabbits, black squirrels, black bear and etc.</li>
            <li> I thought the dog would be a little larger!</li>
            <li> Before ordering, I read the reviews and a few people said it was smaller than they expected.  </li>
            <li> It was a gift for my in-laws that recently put down their black lab.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality, both lanterns sent not working, a waste of money, seller wants me to retract my review but second lantern didnt work either and first one was broken when received.</li>
            <li> This black lab stayed outside all winter during the harsh weather.  </li>
            <li> OUR OTHER DOG BARKS</li>
            <li> They did refund my extra shipping money though when I complained.</li>
            <li> Gave it to a friend because her lab  had to be put down.</li>
            <li> However, I felt the photo is a bit misleading as the actual item is very, very small.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for someone who just lost her black lab.  </li>
            <li> Had it less than 2 weeks and the lantern stopped working.  </li>
            <li> We have two yellows and a black in the pet garden.  </li>
            <li> They had just lost their black lab and were feeling the void.</li>
            <li> She has a black lab</li>
            <li> and it hit a little below my knee.  </li>
            <li> He has had it a few months now with no issues.</li>
            <li> It arrived with the back leg broken as well</li>
            <li> As well we was missing one nut for the lantern posts (there should be 3).</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars at this time, ONLY because I thought the packaging was poorly done and was unable to do a complete inspection of product for damage.  </li>
            <li> So the entire time I&#x27;ve owned this lemon it was broken and had been repaired before I received it.</li>
            <li> I was not happy that she had to deal with the return since it was a present.</li>
            <li> old unit failed.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t stand behind your products, stop serving the public and mostly STOP letting AMAZON do your dirty work!!  </li>
            <li> but I think someone mentioned the dog is sorta ugly and what&#x27;s with the white dots in the middle of it&#x27;s eyes?</li>
            <li> It is small and we haven&#x27;t figured out how to get the solar lamp to work</li>
            <li> Upon arrival, I realized that It was not only broken but had defects as well as very poor quality.</li>
            <li> The material of the statue is too thin where the to hold the weight of the hook and the lantern.</li>
            <li> He did not light up every night, but I didn&#x27;t expect it in the cold weather.  </li>
            <li> and I notice that this lab has tumbled over and 2 legs are broken off.</li>
            <li> pick up the dog with its two broken legs and that&#x27;s when I see it.</li>
            <li> The lantern was broken when she opened it.</li>
            <li> So sad.</li>
            <li> I was unable to service the battery.</li>
            <li> The dog looks sad, undernoruished and very, very thin.  </li>
            <li> Very difficult o replace .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Too bad.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Better than expected.  Made well, very detailed,  Used to set in a decorative garden wagon, perfect size for what I needed.  Solar light worked right out of the box!  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and in great condition..  I was very impressed with the details on the sculpture.  Works great and looks wonderful along the garden.</li>
            <li> Nice product for the price. It was a gift for my in-laws that recently put down their black lab. It is small and we haven&#x27;t figured out how to get the solar lamp to work but it&#x27;s nice for the garden. Shipping did take forever during Christmas. I paid for expedited and it came 4 days after it said. They did refund my extra shipping money though when I complained.</li>
            <li> Just as expected, but smaller than the one I have outside. Check out the heigh before you buy. I bought this to sit by the fireplace in my &amp;#34;man cave&amp;#34;, so it is just right for me, but it would be too small scale for outdoors, say at an  entrance door...too small.</li>
            <li> This solar light was everything that I was hoping it would be.  Nice size and finish.  The light is a nice bright white light.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to use as a memorial for my beloved 14 yr old lab that recently passed. It is a nice size, and it is a fitting tribute to him, as he was a bright light in my life for so very many years. This item was shipped quickly, and arrived in perfect working condition.</li>
            <li> I purchased the item as a gift and the recipient was very surprised at the originality and usefulness. It was shipped very quickly and arrived without any problem.</li>
            <li> Looks great, life like. I have it on top of brick pillar, my Lab looked at it like it was real. The latern works great. Update review I lowered my review  to three stars, I&#x27;ve had these for about 8 months, after about 4 months one of solar lanterns quite working, I called the seller and they told me that there&#x27;s only a 30 day warenty. Know both of the solar lanterns don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Very well constructed, and the solar light is much brighter than expected. Nicely detailed too. Great present for any black lab or garden lover. Arrived in complete and great shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all the &amp;#34;arrived broken&amp;#34; reviews: It&#x27;s not always the manufacturer&#x27;s fault. Amazon makes it very easy and painless to return or refund damaged items.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews I saw almost made me not purchase this for my son but he indicated it was of good quality and looks very nice.  Good size and very adorable!</li>
            <li> Bought it for Dad (retired)  who recently lost his black lab to old age, he seems to like it. During the day, he sets the light outside to charge. At night, he brings the light inside for a night lite, hanging it on the dog. He has had it a few months now with no issues.</li>
            <li> Hi, the handicraft on this item was very detailed and it really is hand painted.  However, I felt the photo is a bit misleading as the actual item is very, very small.  The dog looks sad, undernoruished and very, very thin.  Will be sure to let you know how it works.....</li>
            <li> This lovely statue looks exactly like it did in the photo on line.  It met all my expectations.  Plus the light really works well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for someone who just lost her black lab.  She has a beautiful back yard and I felt like this would look great in one of her gardens and it&#x27;d remind her of her beloved dog.  Before ordering, I read the reviews and a few people said it was smaller than they expected.  For the price, I felt like it was a good size.  I&#x27;m 5&#x27;8&#x27;&#x27; and it hit a little below my knee.  She loved it and I felt like it was the perfect gift.</li>
            <li> I thought the dog would be a little larger!</li>
            <li> Very poor quality, both lanterns sent not working, a waste of money, seller wants me to retract my review but second lantern didnt work either and first one was broken when received.</li>
            <li> Water got into one and I dried it out as best I could. Still works but not as bright as the other lantern on the second lab.</li>
            <li> Cute dog, but the lantern pulled the hook right out of the statue. this might be a design issue.  The material of the statue is too thin where the to hold the weight of the hook and the lantern. I pulled out, and took some of the statue&#x27;s material with it. I tried to hot glue it back into place, but that didn&#x27;t work either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad.  Its very cute otherwise.</li>
            <li> THIS WE ORDERED AS A MEMORIAL TO OUR FALLEN LAB TO CANCER AND WE LOVE IT.  LOOKS GREAT OUR OTHER DOG BARKS AT IT THINKS ITS REAL.  WORKS GREAT ALSO THE LIGHT IS VERY BRIGHT.</li>
            <li> I bought him just before a big rain. Light no longer works. Possible to get light replacement. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> ANY WHO IS DOING UP THIR BACK YARD  MY YORKIE THOUGHT  IT WAS REAL AND STARTED BARKING AT THE LAB. THE LAB IS REALLY CUTE,LIKE IT ALOT</li>
            <li> This black lab stayed outside all winter during the harsh weather.  He did not light up every night, but I didn&#x27;t expect it in the cold weather.  He is smaller than I expected, but I like him..</li>
            <li> Love the dog but the Lantern is a piece of Junk!!  Had it less than 2 weeks and the lantern stopped working.  Contacted Garden Sunlight who makes this merchandise and I was told they didn&#x27;t keep them in stock. Ha! If you don&#x27;t stand behind your products, stop serving the public and mostly STOP letting AMAZON do your dirty work!!  Will NOT buy products from Garden Sunlight again!!!</li>
            <li> We have two yellows and a black in the pet garden.  Each grave has its own light.  They bring me comfort and the statues&lt;br /&gt;are just the right size.&lt;br /&gt;I hope they stand up to the weather.</li>
            <li> I thought the dog would be a little bigger, Its rained about 2 times and there moisture built up in the lantern already, the light part seems to do ok for no more sunlight then it gets.</li>
            <li> The dog with the lantern that lights up at dusk looks very nice by my small pond.</li>
            <li> This is adorable my lab puppy thought it was real and sniffed it three different times. It lights up bright every night</li>
            <li> This garden light is truly a realistic design with regard to the dog.  It really does look like my friend&#x27;s former black lab.  I gave it to her as a gift and she just loves it.</li>
            <li> Paint came off to quickly , the light quit working ,</li>
            <li> It is a very cute statue and the lantern is a added bonus.</li>
            <li> I needed a thoughtful gift for my daughter and her fiance for Xmas. They had just lost their black lab and were feeling the void. So sad. This gift was perfect. I wrote a poem to go with the gift, and it was just what was needed. This product is made well, packed so professionly, and well worth the price, in fact more. A light in the garden to point the way.</li>
            <li> The lantern on this item collects water and as a result rusts the light.  I have had this item in the garden for two months and now it no longer functions as a solar light.&lt;br /&gt;Would appreciate a  replacement lantern and provide this feedback for others as fyi.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I love this it looks so real my dog barks at it.</li>
            <li> Gift for my son and family. They just love it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom for her birthday and she absolutely loves it! It is not very big so if you want something larger this is not for you it but it looks adorable sitting on the porch!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for a friend who has a black Labrador Retriever and he absolutely loved it!&lt;br /&gt;We put the light out in the yard to charge it and that evening it lit up perfectly.  My friend brought the dog/light into the house and it stayed lit all night long.  It was a good choice for a gift to a dog lover and my only regret is that it isn&#x27;t larger.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really thought this lab statue was very cute. Upon arrival, I realized that It was not only broken but had defects as well as very poor quality. It arrived with the back leg broken as well the lantern was just saddening. The glue had come undone on the lantern causing it to fall apart where the light piece is inside the lantern. The one metal post that holds the top and bottom of the lantern was not the right size making my lantern crooked severely. As well we was missing one nut for the lantern posts (there should be 3). I have seen better quality comming from my local dollar general and they only want $5-10 for there garden statues ( no they aren&#x27;t solar though). I do have to say though that after sending pictures to the seller and a detailed email explaining my dissatisfaction I did receive a full refund. They was very prompt about refunding my money so I can&#x27;t complain there. As far as the statue go, I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Its a nice looking ornament which i am interested in black labradors i have always had and liked black dogs all my life</li>
            <li> I got this for a Christmas gift and my friend just loves it. She has a black lab so it fit perfectly for her.</li>
            <li> This is a birthday/christmas gift so I will not know how well it works until I receive feedback from the one I sent it too.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars at this time, ONLY because I thought the packaging was poorly done and was unable to do a complete inspection of product for damage.  Otherwise, if the person who receives this likes it, I would not mind getting one for myself too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my deck out back and it was nice.  I wish it had been bigger but otherwise it was great.</li>
            <li> Just what was needed to honor a lost lab.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GIFT FOR MY NEPHEW AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT AND I KNOW HE WILL TOO!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my sister and she loved it!</li>
            <li> After receiving a Dalmatian (wrong item shipped) - the replacement was wonderful. It was a gift and the recipient was ecstatic and enjoys it VERY much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this product for almost 4 years now. When I originally bought it I had issues with the solar lamp only working upon arrival and then could not get the lamp to light up at all no matter how much sun it got. Eh, no big deal, I threw out the solar lamp and just bought a cute blue jar to hang in its mouth that I could put a candle in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I wake up today and I go outside to get the mail and I notice that this lab has tumbled over and 2 legs are broken off. Initially I just thought well I guess it is a few years old maybe the weather just finally got to it (since the solar light never worked for me I ended up putting this on a covered porch so it wasn&#x27;t ever directly exposed to the elements).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pick up the dog with its two broken legs and that&#x27;s when I see it. The one leg is stuffed with newspaper that has Chinese writing on it. So the entire time I&#x27;ve owned this lemon it was broken and had been repaired before I received it. I guess I didn&#x27;t give the legs a thorough inspection upon arrival because I didn&#x27;t know that that was necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My point is, for the price, this is an overpriced decoration that never really functioned as it should from the beginning, and now more defects have finally shown themselves years later. I super glued the legs back on and we will see if it works or not (lol). You&#x27;ve been warned :)</li>
            <li> Great solar light for any walkway or porch would buy another one for a gift for any dog lover , love it!</li>
            <li> My grandma and I seen one of these at  tractor supply and it was a lot higher there so I looked for it on here found it for a wonderful price and we love it! its so cute and everyone always looks at it and talks about how cute it is!</li>
            <li> Made a great gift for a lab lover!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my hubby for his birthday.  It was priced so reasonably compared to many other comparable things online, that I figured I had little to lose.  It shipped promptly, and arrived in good shape.  He loved it!  It works beautifully, too.  If one expects it to be \\&quot;actual size,\\&quot; one will be disappointed, but it is pretty darn cute ;-)  My only regret is that it is obviously a *male* Lab, and I bought it \\&quot;in homage\\&quot; to my hubby&#x27;s female Lab....</li>
            <li> Beautiful !! Looks life like.  I gave it to my sister as a gift , and she lives it.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful statue !Perfect replica of a black lab.The solar light is very bright,lights up our front porch door. Beautiful I love it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t: bark, bite, shed, need a vet, need food, go poo in the yard and etc., so in some ways its the best dog to have. However with that said, I know its not like having the real thing, but my wife wanted it to go with her black rabbits, black squirrels, black bear and etc. statues that she has in our garden. She says she like it, so thats good enough for me, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sister so I had it shipped to her house. The lantern was broken when she opened it. I was not happy that she had to deal with the return since it was a present.</li>
            <li> Love the dog, but the light keeps falling off.  Can never get it to stay. Would have been better without the light.</li>
            <li> Really good value, BUT 1 yr. old unit failed. The solar light lantern&#x27;s battery failed. I then noticed about 2\\&quot; of standing water inside the lens. I was unable to service the battery. The top screws completely rusted away to a point I would have had to drill them out. My suggestion is buy for the dog. Expect 1 yr. out of battery. Very difficult o replace . Components in light not even mounted in housing. 30 g wire. Paint comes off feet of dog easily</li>
            <li> Though the dog&#x27;s mouth is exaggerated to the point of being unsightly, this is a cute garden fixture especially with the addition of the solar light.</li>
            <li> This is such a cute item, and it is very pretty at night.  I loved it soooo much that I ordered the second one.  This is a highly recommended item to all black lab fans.</li>
            <li> I bought this to go in my memorial garden where the ashes of all my Rainbow babies rest. It resembles two dogs I&#x27;ve had over the years but I think someone mentioned the dog is sorta ugly and what&#x27;s with the white dots in the middle of it&#x27;s eyes? But the solar lantern works well and is very bright.</li>
            <li> How can I get the lantern replaced?  I bought it as a Fathers Day gift and the lantern failed right away and just now getting around to trying to see if there is option, though I do see others had similar problem.  The Lab itself is adorable- hope we can get this replacement piece.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is MY VERY FAVORITE of all the things I&#x27;ve bought to decorate our yard!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The look on the lab&#x27;s face is adorable and the other features are so true of our black lab.  The light does tend to blur out the dog if there aren&#x27;t any other lights around it, but I don&#x27;t see that as a negative.  We have gotten so many comments on it, including a friend who asked if I would mind if she copied my purchase for her yard - the more the merrier!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The dog looked great but the quality of the light and the way it attached to the dogs mouth was not the highest. The price was okay for the quality of the product. Expected a bit more...</li>
            <li> I thought it would be bigger, but it is cute. Gave it to a friend because her lab  had to be put down.</li>
            <li> Very cute good quality</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.  Looks like the picture exactly.  Packed very well too. Would recommend it highly. Not sure of the lantern light because my yard does not get 6 to 8 hours of sunlight. very shaded.</li>
