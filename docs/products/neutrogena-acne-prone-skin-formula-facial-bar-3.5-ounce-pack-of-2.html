            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>Well, this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, if you use this for a face soap its great.</li>
            <li>it is very effective at cleaning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and have been very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I was always a &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; face wash kind of girl, but this bar soap lathers up beautifully in your hands.</li>
            <li>Good price for the amount I received.</li>
            <li>washes so good, the face needs it.</li>
            <li>Good product and good price.  </li>
            <li>Good for one&#x27;s skin, not allergenic and lathers and foams well.</li>
            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>At that point, I was using some Col. Conk shaving soap, but upon reading that transparent glycerin soap is really good for your skin, I thought I&#x27;d try to find some.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it washes cleanly away and doesn&#x27;t make me worry about having clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lather is very light and works great for taking all the oils off your face.</li>
            <li>Im so in love!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product !</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, excellent product.  </li>
            <li>But one of the things i loved the most is that it moisturized my skin without leaving it oily.</li>
            <li>I have always enjoyed the quality of Neutrogena&#x27;s products and find they are still  as good as ever.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice to have it handy.</li>
            <li>It lathers up quite nicely as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Neutrogena products are the best, leaves skin smooth and with a clean feel.</li>
            <li>i got the unscented kind, which has a very strong glycerin scent.</li>
            <li>The original has a very strong smell to it that I didn&#x27;t like, but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it is the absolute best soap I&#x27;ve found for fragrance allergies</li>
            <li>Consequently, I am thrilled and relieved to find out that I will now be able to order it online with Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best at what it does, and keeps my acne-prone dry skin happy and clean.</li>
            <li>It is fragrance free and washes off cleanly, which is great if you want to have no residue on your hands.</li>
            <li>it feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li>Keeping it in a soap dish by a sink doesn&#x27;t work the best either, though it clearly states on the package that it will have a tendency to melt because the formula is designed to rinse off easily.</li>
            <li>Make sure you buy the fragrance-free bars.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Neutrogena Facial Cleansing Bar has worked the best of the three for me as a body bar.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>I shop Amazon often and love it.  </li>
            <li>After years of trying different products this has always been the best for me.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to use every day.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Fragrance free!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok, better off buying the one for acne prevention.</li>
            <li>and  I&#x27;m just in love with it!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I am beyond pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>i had been using this soap for many years</li>
            <li>I have used this soap on my face for over 20 yrs and still love it.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I have been using Neutrogena products for more than 30 years and love them.</li>
            <li>We used to shop at Walmart for this soap, as it was the cheapest price we could find here in So Cal, not any more...</li>
            <li>eI love Neutrogena products, I will continue buying it.</li>
            <li>That was many years ago.  </li>
            <li>Amazon sells many of these.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m mostly talking about YOU, Dove).</li>
            <li>It also always feels refreshing and as though all oil and dirt have been removed from my face.</li>
            <li>Try it, you will love it, too.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for many years, but wasn&#x27;t able to get  the &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; here any more</li>
            <li>The best facial cleanser around.</li>
            <li>If you use it for shaving soap, its even better.</li>
            <li>This is an okay face soap.</li>
            <li>I have a teenager who gets the occasional breakout, but when she uses this, her skin improves very quickly and looks great!</li>
            <li>and it gets my face very clean.</li>
            <li>This is great for oily or normal skin, I have used it for years.  </li>
            <li>it was nice to be able to buy 3 bars at a great price and that will last me for a couple years!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a pretty good track record.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive acne-prone skin, and it works great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed to spend about $6 more to qualify for Free Shipping and decided to go with this Neutrogena soap face wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and PLSSSSSSS NEUTROGENA make it completely fragrance free again!!!</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Original Formula was the soap my dermatologist father washed his hands with between patient appointments, with as many as thirty patients a day.  </li>
            <li>, I have tried other products almost everyone you can think of and this is the best fit</li>
            <li>Works great, does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I am not the biggest fan of how easy the soap &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; and it definitely isn&#x27;t fit to be kept in the shower.</li>
            <li>The product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the Neutrogena is just fabulous, and you can&#x27;t beat this price fo 3 bars.  </li>
            <li>Looking just at the fragrance free version:  </li>
            <li>i have been using this soap for almost two years and ifound out that this is the onlt soap that helps my skin looks shinny and pinples free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these soap bars for years with great results for my facial clarity.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My back and chest are prone to breakouts and this does a great job in preventing that.</li>
            <li>I like that it is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>actual shaving is great too...</li>
            <li>My pores are FINALLY clean and free of build-ups.</li>
            <li>I also love that its very gentle on my skin leaves</li>
            <li>From personal experience this works great for those with oily skin and mild acne.</li>
            <li>I also like that my face feels clean after washing with this.</li>
            <li>has nothing to do with being clean at all</li>
            <li>This is a great soap to use to reduce the effects of dry skin.</li>
            <li>It is the most pure soap I believe you can buy.  </li>
            <li>soap left my face feeling refreshed and clean for a good while.</li>
            <li>If you have a specific problem or special needs skin, ask your dermatologist first, but this has always been a great choice for me and my family.</li>
            <li>Used to use EB5 facial soap, till they stopped making it, this works just as good and cheaper too.  </li>
            <li>I wash my face with this every night and it leaves a cool soothing feeling after I rinse it off</li>
            <li>Not a bad face soap.</li>
            <li>Great clean feeling and makes my pores tight.</li>
            <li>Right off the bat, I need to say that this bar of soap really is fragrance free!</li>
            <li>This is the only soap I can use that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and at a pretty good price!</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that it is fragrance free since fragrances cause allergy issues.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-for those of you who really want a soap that is fragrance free</li>
            <li>I still use Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser as a facial cleanser, but the Neutrogena Facial Cleansing Bar is wonderful as a body bar.</li>
            <li>Needs some sort of fresh aroma.  </li>
            <li>It just seemed to control oil/ occasional adult acne better than this kind.</li>
            <li>I still find it the best choice, as long as I can let it dry on a soap saver.  </li>
            <li>What else can I say about this other than it has been a beauty staple for many, many years for millions of women around the world.</li>
            <li>Well, this is it right here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to shave my face without major tugging, pulling, irritation and ingrown hairs...</li>
            <li>I havent seen my skin this clean and fresh looking since high school.</li>
            <li>The Neutrogena fragrance free facial bar is perfect for my face and other body parts that my be having sensitive skin issues.  </li>
            <li>Sheets are great except they had a small hole in them that we didn&#x27;t notice until after we washed them.</li>
            <li>Very gentle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this soap on my face since the 1980s and have found it very gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Neutrogena Fragrance Free Transparent Facial Bar, Original Formula for 16 years.  </li>
            <li>It also refines my pores and just leaves my skin feeling clean, soft, and fresh, but never stripped.</li>
            <li>Hard to find in drug stores, a great product.  </li>
            <li>Most unscented formulas still have some smell (usually as gross as any fragrance) but this soap actually smells good enough to eat!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;t hard to say more about soap:-)</li>
            <li>It is gentle on my skin, leaves me smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It is not always easy to find in local stores.</li>
            <li>A certain department store, with a bullseye logo, sells three, 3.5 oz.</li>
            <li>If you are also in the same boat, then you&#x27;ll also need to find some type of fragrance free moisturizer otherwise it would defeat the whole purpose of this face wash if the fragrance thing is one of the biggest reasons for you purchasing this product in the first place.</li>
            <li>we have used this product for 25 years, and since we go thru so much</li>
            <li>Dove caused me to break out, over time, and Cetiphil Gentle Cleansing Bar has a masking agent for the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This soap works well and is not irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li>My acne is controlled&lt;br /&gt;and scars are fading thanks to this bar and my Obagi.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li>As soon as I found the real deal the impostor went in the trash.</li>
            <li>When I recently relocated from Australia to the UK, I expected to be able to buy it here and was devastated when it didn&#x27;t seem to be available in this country.  </li>
            <li>I have really oily skin</li>
            <li>but I really like it and will continue to use it for my face</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very non allergic and gentle.</li>
            <li>ps i have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>I have had acne for years and this keeps my skin clean and does not dry.</li>
            <li>There are far better soaps at the local drug store.</li>
            <li>My facial skin felt so clean yet still somewhat hydrated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basic, it&#x27;s easy on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>We will continue to use this product so long as it is available.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena is my favourite - soft, almost fragrancefree, neutral - exactly what i want in soaps.</li>
            <li>Just in case they discontinue anytime down the line, i&#x27;ll be well prepared:)</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Facial Cleansing Bar is absolutely fantastic for those with skin that is extremely sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li>As a teenager and yound adult, I experienced frustrating boughts of acne.  </li>
            <li>But overall I am in love with this facial cleansing bar !</li>
            <li>The soap is so good, people have actually been killed over the control of the formula to make it.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s fragrance free and is normal sized - a lot of the bar soaps are over-sized and tough to hold.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I use this soap for my face and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It does melt pretty quickly so if you do use it, make sure to place it in a soap dish that allows the bar to air dry, otherwise it will not last very long.</li>
            <li>(fragrance free - the scent in the other irritates my skin) and also changed to a strict diet of whole foods that my acne cleared permanently.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer the bars to the soft soap.</li>
            <li>Finally a facial soap that is worth buying.</li>
            <li>so I love not having itchy and dried out skin.</li>
            <li>I have very, very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>so I had to apply more moisturizer than usual.  </li>
            <li>At first use, the soap is rock solid.</li>
            <li>As far as other Neutrogena face soaps are concerned, I certainly preferred the regular (not fragrance free) version.</li>
            <li>It is also relatively ingredient friendly, with less chemicals than many other bar</li>
            <li>Very gentle, non irritating, good basic facial soap.</li>
            <li>Speaking from an individual with super oily/ problematic/ sensitive skin: I stumbled across this product at the local supercenter and for $2.00 each, I couldnt resist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years on my face and it has helped keep my complexion clear.  </li>
            <li>it has helped clear up my face.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and use this soap bar morning and evening to scrub my face.  </li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin that can also be sensitive.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft without a residue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, I am a chronic migraine sufferer, and am extremely sensitive to fragrances as they are a migraine trigger for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this soap for years as I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>There is a big difference between &amp;#34;Original Formula Fragrance Free&amp;#34; and just &amp;#34;Original Formula,&amp;#34; both options were listed under the same overall link (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005BGE1TE) with different amounts per package (3 vs 8).  </li>
            <li>This soap is effective but smells like poorly rendered beef tallow and chemicals.</li>
            <li>After using this Neutrogena soap for the first time, I noticed my skin was dry</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve tried products in the past that claims to be fragrance free but still leaves my face with some sort of chemical smell.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge]] and saw improvement.</li>
            <li>but i much prefer the acne prone version which doesnt dry me out.</li>
            <li>It stays foamy for a very long time so you can do your whole face at once and not have to worry about reapplying the soap all the time because this stuff does not dry</li>
            <li>I have tried several soaps including Cetaphil and Dove for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m back to old faithful...</li>
            <li>Edmond Fromont, a Belgian chemist invented a method for making a soap that would completely rinse off from the skin and not leave any residue, unlike regular soaps.  </li>
            <li>After using it for the first time, my current pimples were less red and irritated.</li>
            <li>But, really guys, it&#x27;s half the price at Walmart.</li>
            <li>When using a shaving brush, it whips up effortlessly into a super thick and slippery foam.</li>
            <li>This is just a good of a product and much less expensive.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> At that point, I was using some Col. Conk shaving soap, but upon reading that transparent glycerin soap is really good for your skin, I thought I&#x27;d try to find some.</li>
            <li> The best part is that it washes cleanly away and doesn&#x27;t make me worry about having clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lather is very light and works great for taking all the oils off your face.</li>
            <li> Im so in love!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product !</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, excellent product.  </li>
            <li> But one of the things i loved the most is that it moisturized my skin without leaving it oily.</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed the quality of Neutrogena&#x27;s products and find they are still  as good as ever.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice to have it handy.</li>
            <li> It lathers up quite nicely as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Neutrogena products are the best, leaves skin smooth and with a clean feel.</li>
            <li> i got the unscented kind, which has a very strong glycerin scent.</li>
            <li> The original has a very strong smell to it that I didn&#x27;t like, but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is the absolute best soap I&#x27;ve found for fragrance allergies</li>
            <li> Consequently, I am thrilled and relieved to find out that I will now be able to order it online with Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best at what it does, and keeps my acne-prone dry skin happy and clean.</li>
            <li> It is fragrance free and washes off cleanly, which is great if you want to have no residue on your hands.</li>
            <li> it feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li> Keeping it in a soap dish by a sink doesn&#x27;t work the best either, though it clearly states on the package that it will have a tendency to melt because the formula is designed to rinse off easily.</li>
            <li> Make sure you buy the fragrance-free bars.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Neutrogena Facial Cleansing Bar has worked the best of the three for me as a body bar.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I shop Amazon often and love it.  </li>
            <li> After years of trying different products this has always been the best for me.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to use every day.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Fragrance free!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, better off buying the one for acne prevention.</li>
            <li> and  I&#x27;m just in love with it!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I am beyond pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> i had been using this soap for many years</li>
            <li> I have used this soap on my face for over 20 yrs and still love it.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I have been using Neutrogena products for more than 30 years and love them.</li>
            <li> We used to shop at Walmart for this soap, as it was the cheapest price we could find here in So Cal, not any more...</li>
            <li> eI love Neutrogena products, I will continue buying it.</li>
            <li> That was many years ago.  </li>
            <li> Amazon sells many of these.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m mostly talking about YOU, Dove).</li>
            <li> It also always feels refreshing and as though all oil and dirt have been removed from my face.</li>
            <li> Try it, you will love it, too.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for many years, but wasn&#x27;t able to get  the &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; here any more</li>
            <li> The best facial cleanser around.</li>
            <li> If you use it for shaving soap, its even better.</li>
            <li> This is an okay face soap.</li>
            <li> I have a teenager who gets the occasional breakout, but when she uses this, her skin improves very quickly and looks great!</li>
            <li> and it gets my face very clean.</li>
            <li> This is great for oily or normal skin, I have used it for years.  </li>
            <li> it was nice to be able to buy 3 bars at a great price and that will last me for a couple years!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a pretty good track record.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive acne-prone skin, and it works great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed to spend about $6 more to qualify for Free Shipping and decided to go with this Neutrogena soap face wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and PLSSSSSSS NEUTROGENA make it completely fragrance free again!!!</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Original Formula was the soap my dermatologist father washed his hands with between patient appointments, with as many as thirty patients a day.  </li>
            <li> , I have tried other products almost everyone you can think of and this is the best fit</li>
            <li> Works great, does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I am not the biggest fan of how easy the soap &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; and it definitely isn&#x27;t fit to be kept in the shower.</li>
            <li> The product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the Neutrogena is just fabulous, and you can&#x27;t beat this price fo 3 bars.  </li>
            <li> Looking just at the fragrance free version:  </li>
            <li> i have been using this soap for almost two years and ifound out that this is the onlt soap that helps my skin looks shinny and pinples free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these soap bars for years with great results for my facial clarity.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My back and chest are prone to breakouts and this does a great job in preventing that.</li>
            <li> I like that it is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> actual shaving is great too...</li>
            <li> My pores are FINALLY clean and free of build-ups.</li>
            <li> I also love that its very gentle on my skin leaves</li>
            <li> From personal experience this works great for those with oily skin and mild acne.</li>
            <li> I also like that my face feels clean after washing with this.</li>
            <li> has nothing to do with being clean at all</li>
            <li> This is a great soap to use to reduce the effects of dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is the most pure soap I believe you can buy.  </li>
            <li> soap left my face feeling refreshed and clean for a good while.</li>
            <li> If you have a specific problem or special needs skin, ask your dermatologist first, but this has always been a great choice for me and my family.</li>
            <li> Used to use EB5 facial soap, till they stopped making it, this works just as good and cheaper too.  </li>
            <li> I wash my face with this every night and it leaves a cool soothing feeling after I rinse it off</li>
            <li> Not a bad face soap.</li>
            <li> Great clean feeling and makes my pores tight.</li>
            <li> Right off the bat, I need to say that this bar of soap really is fragrance free!</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I can use that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and at a pretty good price!</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that it is fragrance free since fragrances cause allergy issues.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-for those of you who really want a soap that is fragrance free</li>
            <li> I still use Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser as a facial cleanser, but the Neutrogena Facial Cleansing Bar is wonderful as a body bar.</li>
            <li> Needs some sort of fresh aroma.  </li>
            <li> It just seemed to control oil/ occasional adult acne better than this kind.</li>
            <li> I still find it the best choice, as long as I can let it dry on a soap saver.  </li>
            <li> What else can I say about this other than it has been a beauty staple for many, many years for millions of women around the world.</li>
            <li> Well, this is it right here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to shave my face without major tugging, pulling, irritation and ingrown hairs...</li>
            <li> I havent seen my skin this clean and fresh looking since high school.</li>
            <li> The Neutrogena fragrance free facial bar is perfect for my face and other body parts that my be having sensitive skin issues.  </li>
            <li> Sheets are great except they had a small hole in them that we didn&#x27;t notice until after we washed them.</li>
            <li> Very gentle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap on my face since the 1980s and have found it very gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Neutrogena Fragrance Free Transparent Facial Bar, Original Formula for 16 years.  </li>
            <li> It also refines my pores and just leaves my skin feeling clean, soft, and fresh, but never stripped.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in drug stores, a great product.  </li>
            <li> Most unscented formulas still have some smell (usually as gross as any fragrance) but this soap actually smells good enough to eat!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;t hard to say more about soap:-)</li>
            <li> It is gentle on my skin, leaves me smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It is not always easy to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> A certain department store, with a bullseye logo, sells three, 3.5 oz.</li>
            <li> If you are also in the same boat, then you&#x27;ll also need to find some type of fragrance free moisturizer otherwise it would defeat the whole purpose of this face wash if the fragrance thing is one of the biggest reasons for you purchasing this product in the first place.</li>
            <li> we have used this product for 25 years, and since we go thru so much</li>
            <li> Dove caused me to break out, over time, and Cetiphil Gentle Cleansing Bar has a masking agent for the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This soap works well and is not irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li> My acne is controlled&lt;br /&gt;and scars are fading thanks to this bar and my Obagi.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li> As soon as I found the real deal the impostor went in the trash.</li>
            <li> When I recently relocated from Australia to the UK, I expected to be able to buy it here and was devastated when it didn&#x27;t seem to be available in this country.  </li>
            <li> I have really oily skin</li>
            <li> but I really like it and will continue to use it for my face</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Very non allergic and gentle.</li>
            <li> ps i have very oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have had acne for years and this keeps my skin clean and does not dry.</li>
            <li> There are far better soaps at the local drug store.</li>
            <li> My facial skin felt so clean yet still somewhat hydrated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basic, it&#x27;s easy on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> We will continue to use this product so long as it is available.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is my favourite - soft, almost fragrancefree, neutral - exactly what i want in soaps.</li>
            <li> Just in case they discontinue anytime down the line, i&#x27;ll be well prepared:)</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Facial Cleansing Bar is absolutely fantastic for those with skin that is extremely sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li> As a teenager and yound adult, I experienced frustrating boughts of acne.  </li>
            <li> But overall I am in love with this facial cleansing bar !</li>
            <li> The soap is so good, people have actually been killed over the control of the formula to make it.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s fragrance free and is normal sized - a lot of the bar soaps are over-sized and tough to hold.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this soap for my face and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It does melt pretty quickly so if you do use it, make sure to place it in a soap dish that allows the bar to air dry, otherwise it will not last very long.</li>
            <li> (fragrance free - the scent in the other irritates my skin) and also changed to a strict diet of whole foods that my acne cleared permanently.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer the bars to the soft soap.</li>
            <li> Finally a facial soap that is worth buying.</li>
            <li> so I love not having itchy and dried out skin.</li>
            <li> I have very, very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> so I had to apply more moisturizer than usual.  </li>
            <li> At first use, the soap is rock solid.</li>
            <li> As far as other Neutrogena face soaps are concerned, I certainly preferred the regular (not fragrance free) version.</li>
            <li> It is also relatively ingredient friendly, with less chemicals than many other bar</li>
            <li> Very gentle, non irritating, good basic facial soap.</li>
            <li> Speaking from an individual with super oily/ problematic/ sensitive skin: I stumbled across this product at the local supercenter and for $2.00 each, I couldnt resist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years on my face and it has helped keep my complexion clear.  </li>
            <li> it has helped clear up my face.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and use this soap bar morning and evening to scrub my face.  </li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin that can also be sensitive.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft without a residue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, I am a chronic migraine sufferer, and am extremely sensitive to fragrances as they are a migraine trigger for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for years as I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> There is a big difference between &amp;#34;Original Formula Fragrance Free&amp;#34; and just &amp;#34;Original Formula,&amp;#34; both options were listed under the same overall link (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005BGE1TE) with different amounts per package (3 vs 8).  </li>
            <li> This soap is effective but smells like poorly rendered beef tallow and chemicals.</li>
            <li> After using this Neutrogena soap for the first time, I noticed my skin was dry</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve tried products in the past that claims to be fragrance free but still leaves my face with some sort of chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge]] and saw improvement.</li>
            <li> but i much prefer the acne prone version which doesnt dry me out.</li>
            <li> It stays foamy for a very long time so you can do your whole face at once and not have to worry about reapplying the soap all the time because this stuff does not dry</li>
            <li> I have tried several soaps including Cetaphil and Dove for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m back to old faithful...</li>
            <li> Edmond Fromont, a Belgian chemist invented a method for making a soap that would completely rinse off from the skin and not leave any residue, unlike regular soaps.  </li>
            <li> After using it for the first time, my current pimples were less red and irritated.</li>
            <li> But, really guys, it&#x27;s half the price at Walmart.</li>
            <li> When using a shaving brush, it whips up effortlessly into a super thick and slippery foam.</li>
            <li> This is just a good of a product and much less expensive.  </li>
            <li> This is one of those few products that have been around forever and is no-frills, simple, but contains high quality ingredients your skin loves and benefits from, such as glycerin.</li>
            <li> the razor glides over the skin and through the thickest of whiskers (I have a very very dense beard with thick whiskers) without tugging or pulling.</li>
            <li> About 5 years ago, I tried Neutrogena products for the first time (a moisturizer that was advertised by Gabriel Union), and I had a negative reaction.  </li>
            <li> so they do not last long</li>
            <li> I discontinued using it and switched to Cetaphil bar soap (which isn&#x27;t entirely fragrance-free, but it doesn&#x27;t activate my allergies and it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my skin dry).</li>
            <li> This face bar totally dries up my face almost immediately after patting dry.</li>
            <li> Long lasting as long as it stays out of water.</li>
            <li> The soap does not cut down on the oil completely but it does dry my skin out</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily African American skin</li>
            <li> However, after initially liking this soap, I noticed that my skin felt very dry.</li>
            <li> and now my skin is tight red and blotchy and covered in tiny red bumps.</li>
            <li> I tried everything from rubbing my skin with crushed apricot pits to drugs such as tetracycline and Cleocine-T.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to figure out the problem.</li>
            <li> Long Handled Safety Razor]]</li>
            <li> I initially thought that this one little bar of soap will last me for a very long time if used twice daily</li>
            <li> Personally, I just don&#x27;t see enough benefit with this soap to deal with the mess.</li>
            <li> claim!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, not every product works well for everyone, but I certainly recommend that anyone with serious skin sensitivities give it a try.</li>
            <li> does not last as much as other soap bars</li>
            <li> and i will never replace it for other facial soap.</li>
            <li> I have tried other fancier products, but I always come back to this.</li>
            <li> why i ever left this soap to try a boatload of other ones is beyond me.</li>
            <li> However, the original formula scent is cloying strong, disgustingly so.   </li>
            <li> but once you wash off and pat dry, I guarantee you that you will be hard pressed to find any smell at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap bar is of decent size</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry skin out.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m not sure what chemical is in their products that disagree with my skin.  </li>
            <li> Less and less noticeable marks on my facial skin.</li>
            <li> After about a week, my skin had a slight burning sensation and it was so dry in some areas that my skin started to peel.  </li>
            <li> I tried switching to other face cleansing options and my face would not stay cleared up.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands and I&#x27;ve had the issue that my face gets oil.</li>
            <li> This soap has some changed done to it in the past recent months.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t like me to use any other cleanser.</li>
            <li> Lloyd Cotsen grew their company that rapidly grew very profitable; however, Belgian associates of Fromont felt that they had been cheated and should control the secret formula sent hitman after Cotsen, and sadly killed his family instead.  </li>
            <li> The scent that the bar has is not amazing but definitely not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I saw results in a few</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the Belgian villian apparently committed suicide before he could be questioned by police.  </li>
            <li> There have been times when I&#x27;ve been unable to find it, and had to get something * similar *</li>
            <li> /&gt;-bars are small</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about using it after it has melted.</li>
            <li> The soap is like a hard brick and not how a usual \\&quot;shower\\&quot; soap feels.</li>
            <li> Hard to beat the price.</li>
            <li> My skin had a bad reaction to this, if you have sensitive acne-prone skin</li>
            <li> i dont hate this, but i dont really use it either.</li>
            <li> However, as the weeks go by, it will slowly melt and become \\&quot;mushy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This reaction was bad enough that I discontinued use.  </li>
            <li> and every evening without fail,</li>
            <li> But here comes the bad news.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very sad and terrible story.  </li>
            <li> Their is scent now and smells like lemon or something nasty.</li>
            <li> I HATE IT!!!!!!!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> we have used this product for 25 years, and since we go thru so much we order alot at one time. We will continue to use this product so long as it is available. Cleans face without drying out skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and use this soap bar morning and evening to scrub my face.  Makes my face feel great.</li>
            <li> Not a bad face soap. The lather is very light and works great for taking all the oils off your face. The scent that the bar has is not amazing but definitely not a big deal. Hard to beat the price.</li>
            <li> This is the best face soap I have ever used. I have acne prone skin that can also be sensitive. This helps in all departments. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Facial Cleansing Bar is absolutely fantastic for those with skin that is extremely sensitive to fragrance. I have tried several soaps including Cetaphil and Dove for sensitive skin. Dove caused me to break out, over time, and Cetiphil Gentle Cleansing Bar has a masking agent for the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Facial Cleansing Bar has worked the best of the three for me as a body bar. It leaves my skin soft without a residue. I still use Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser as a facial cleanser, but the Neutrogena Facial Cleansing Bar is wonderful as a body bar. It is also relatively ingredient friendly, with less chemicals than many other bar soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I am a chronic migraine sufferer, and am extremely sensitive to fragrances as they are a migraine trigger for me. This product lives up to its \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; claim!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, not every product works well for everyone, but I certainly recommend that anyone with serious skin sensitivities give it a try.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, excellent product.  I prefer the brand name and these are the best prices I&#x27;ve found here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> The product is fantastic.  A certain department store, with a bullseye logo, sells three, 3.5 oz. bars for $3.94.  That&#x27;s $1.31 per bar.  They are in the cosmetics department.  I shop Amazon often and love it.  They provide a great service to us.  I don&#x27;t assume they are perfect when it comes to finding best price.</li>
            <li> Quality product delivered promptly. It is fragrance free and washes off cleanly, which is great if you want to have no residue on your hands.</li>
            <li> After years of trying different products this has always been the best for me. From personal experience this works great for those with oily skin and mild acne. Just make sure to use every day.</li>
            <li> Works great, does not dry out my skin. Used to use EB5 facial soap, till they stopped making it, this works just as good and cheaper too.  Great product, been a user for about 4 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years!  I have very sensitive acne-prone skin, and it works great.  I love that it&#x27;s fragrance free and is normal sized - a lot of the bar soaps are over-sized and tough to hold.</li>
            <li> Speaking from an individual with super oily/ problematic/ sensitive skin: I stumbled across this product at the local supercenter and for $2.00 each, I couldnt resist. \\&quot;Fragrance free! No dyes! NO Detergents! No hardeners! Enriched with Glycerin!\\&quot; I had to give this a try. After using it for the first time, my current pimples were less red and irritated. My facial skin felt so clean yet still somewhat hydrated. By the next day, the pimples had dramatically subsided. The color of the pimples were beginning to fade. Less and less noticeable marks on my facial skin. My pores are FINALLY clean and free of build-ups. I havent seen my skin this clean and fresh looking since high school. OMG!!! Im so in love! Im going back to the supercenter to grab 5, 6, or maybe even 10 since its $2.00 each. Just in case they discontinue anytime down the line, i&#x27;ll be well prepared:)</li>
            <li> I had been using this soap for years.  I also use Mary Kay.  The quality of the Neutrogena is just fabulous, and you can&#x27;t beat this price fo 3 bars.  I will continue to use the Neutrogena permanently now instead of the Mary Kay soap bar.  This is just a good of a product and much less expensive.  The bonus is that the scent if very nice!!  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this soap to wash my face twice a day. This soap works well and is not irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, better off buying the one for acne prevention.</li>
            <li> I suffer from acne and have oily skin. I do use Obagi&#x27;s 5% Benzoyl Peroxide Therapeutic&lt;br /&gt;Lotion to treat and prevent breakouts, but I use this bar to cleanse my skin. I wash every&lt;br /&gt;morning and every evening without fail, and it gets my face very clean. My acne is controlled&lt;br /&gt;and scars are fading thanks to this bar and my Obagi.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years on my face and it has helped keep my complexion clear.  I tried switching to other face cleansing options and my face would not stay cleared up.  So, I&#x27;m back to old faithful... my Neutrogena facial bar.  I also like that my face feels clean after washing with this.</li>
            <li> I have very, very sensitive skin.  The Neutrogena fragrance free facial bar is perfect for my face and other body parts that my be having sensitive skin issues.  I really like the fact that it is fragrance free since fragrances cause allergy issues.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful soap for those with skin problems and allergies  It is the most pure soap I believe you can buy.  Good price for the amount I received.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is the absolute best soap I&#x27;ve found for fragrance allergies and I do buy it on Amazon if my local brick and mortar stores run out.  But, really guys, it&#x27;s half the price at Walmart.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I can use that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and at a pretty good price!</li>
            <li> As a teenager and yound adult, I experienced frustrating boughts of acne.  I tried everything from rubbing my skin with crushed apricot pits to drugs such as tetracycline and Cleocine-T.  It wasn&#x27;t until I tried Neutrogenia (fragrance free - the scent in the other irritates my skin) and also changed to a strict diet of whole foods that my acne cleared permanently.  It&#x27;s a great product.  I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to figure out the problem.</li>
            <li> I use this soap for my face and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> as always an excellent product</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying this soap again!!!I bought this as an amazon verified product and  I&#x27;m just in love with it!!&lt;br /&gt;This soap left my face feeling refreshed and clean for a good while. But one of the things i loved the most is that it moisturized my skin without leaving it oily. I have tried other brands and I&#x27;ve had the issue that my face gets oil. I also love that its very gentle on my skin leaves it feeling very smooth. I am beyond pleased with this product. Finally a facial soap that is worth buying.</li>
            <li> does not last as much as other soap bars</li>
            <li> washes so good, the face needs it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for years as I have sensitive skin.  Great price and good quality!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product ! I wash my face with this every night and it leaves a cool soothing feeling after I rinse it off and it def helps with acne . I bought two of these from Walmart for this price though. So I totally recommend going to Walmart for this.  But overall I am in love with this facial cleansing bar !</li>
            <li> EDIT:  There is a big difference between &amp;#34;Original Formula Fragrance Free&amp;#34; and just &amp;#34;Original Formula,&amp;#34; both options were listed under the same overall link (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005BGE1TE) with different amounts per package (3 vs 8).  However, the original formula scent is cloying strong, disgustingly so.   --  Looking just at the fragrance free version:  This is the best soap ever.  The soap is so good, people have actually been killed over the control of the formula to make it.  Edmond Fromont, a Belgian chemist invented a method for making a soap that would completely rinse off from the skin and not leave any residue, unlike regular soaps.  US businessman Emanuel Stolaroff licensed the formula and his son-in-law Lloyd Cotsen grew their company that rapidly grew very profitable; however, Belgian associates of Fromont felt that they had been cheated and should control the secret formula sent hitman after Cotsen, and sadly killed his family instead.  Unfortunately, the Belgian villian apparently committed suicide before he could be questioned by police.  It&#x27;s a very sad and terrible story.  However, it&#x27;s a great soap.</li>
            <li> Needs some sort of fresh aroma.  Very disappointing for the price. There are far better soaps at the local drug store.</li>
            <li> I like that it comes automatically with subscription, wife has used it for years, now I don&#x27;t have to worry about her running out.</li>
            <li> i had been using this soap for many years and i will never replace it for other facial soap. It&#x27;s gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li> Very gentle so I love not having itchy and dried out skin.</li>
            <li> Sheets are great except they had a small hole in them that we didn&#x27;t notice until after we washed them.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap on my face for over 20 yrs and still love it. it was nice to be able to buy 3 bars at a great price and that will last me for a couple years! I have always enjoyed the quality of Neutrogena&#x27;s products and find they are still  as good as ever.</li>
            <li> This soap has some changed done to it in the past recent months. Their is scent now and smells like lemon or something nasty. I HATE IT!!!!!!! I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and PLSSSSSSS NEUTROGENA make it completely fragrance free again!!!</li>
            <li> I saw results in a few</li>
            <li> I have been using this non-soap on my face for 15 years. I have tried other fancier products, but I always come back to this. It&#x27;s the best at what it does, and keeps my acne-prone dry skin happy and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and have been very happy with it.  The only face soap I use.</li>
            <li> My skin had a bad reaction to this, if you have sensitive acne-prone skin do no buy! I had maybe one or two spots when I used this and now my skin is tight red and blotchy and covered in tiny red bumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a very long time. Very gentle, non irritating, good basic facial soap. If you have a specific problem or special needs skin, ask your dermatologist first, but this has always been a great choice for me and my family. It does melt pretty quickly so if you do use it, make sure to place it in a soap dish that allows the bar to air dry, otherwise it will not last very long. I have a teenager who gets the occasional breakout, but when she uses this, her skin improves very quickly and looks great! Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I have been using Neutrogena products for more than 30 years and love them. Cleans without drying. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Good product and good price.  Does not cause breakouts or is too over drying for my acne prone skin.  Long lasting as long as it stays out of water.</li>
            <li> We used to shop at Walmart for this soap, as it was the cheapest price we could find here in So Cal, not any more... Great price.</li>
            <li> This soap is effective but smells like poorly rendered beef tallow and chemicals.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t like me to use any other cleanser. It&#x27;s basic, it&#x27;s easy on sensitive skin. It&#x27;s never caused a breakout in 20 years. That&#x27;s a pretty good track record. There have been times when I&#x27;ve been unable to find it, and had to get something * similar * but my skin knew it wasn&#x27;t Neutrogena. As soon as I found the real deal the impostor went in the trash.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is my favourite - soft, almost fragrancefree, neutral - exactly what i want in soaps.I&#x27;t hard to say more about soap:-)</li>
            <li> i have been using this soap for almost two years and ifound out that this is the onlt soap that helps my skin looks shinny and pinples free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap on my face since the 1980s and have found it very gentle on my skin.  When I recently relocated from Australia to the UK, I expected to be able to buy it here and was devastated when it didn&#x27;t seem to be available in this country.  Consequently, I am thrilled and relieved to find out that I will now be able to order it online with Amazon.</li>
            <li> why i ever left this soap to try a boatload of other ones is beyond me. i am back and will never buy another face soap again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these soap bars for years with great results for my facial clarity.&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommend. I much prefer the bars to the soft soap.</li>
            <li> eI love Neutrogena products, I will continue buying it. plus this is a great promo, a lot cheaper that the price I pay here in Mexico.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Original Formula was the soap my dermatologist father washed his hands with between patient appointments, with as many as thirty patients a day.  His hands looked great!  His use of it sold me on it.  That was many years ago.  I still find it the best choice, as long as I can let it dry on a soap saver.  Amazon sells many of these.</li>
            <li> A lot of companies advertise their soap as \\&quot;fragrance-free\\&quot; but they&#x27;re lying (I&#x27;m mostly talking about YOU, Dove). Neutrogena is telling the truth. However, after initially liking this soap, I noticed that my skin felt very dry. I discontinued using it and switched to Cetaphil bar soap (which isn&#x27;t entirely fragrance-free, but it doesn&#x27;t activate my allergies and it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my skin dry).</li>
            <li> This is a great soap for problem skin.  My husband uses it all the time and it&#x27;s pricier at the stores.  I get this shipped every six months and it&#x27;s nice to have it handy.</li>
            <li> Only soap I use that doesn&#x27;t make me break out and it is very effective at cleaning.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena products are the best, leaves skin smooth and with a clean feel.</li>
            <li> This helps keep my acne at bay. It also always feels refreshing and as though all oil and dirt have been removed from my face. It doesn&#x27;t dry skin out.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in drug stores, a great product.  Good for one&#x27;s skin, not allergenic and lathers and foams well.</li>
            <li> What else can I say about this other than it has been a beauty staple for many, many years for millions of women around the world. This is one of those few products that have been around forever and is no-frills, simple, but contains high quality ingredients your skin loves and benefits from, such as glycerin. My roommate, who has been using this product religiously for about 20 years, turned me onto this about 8 months ago, and I can&#x27;t believe how well it removes dirt, makeup and oil. It also refines my pores and just leaves my skin feeling clean, soft, and fresh, but never stripped. I was always a &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; face wash kind of girl, but this bar soap lathers up beautifully in your hands. Try it, you will love it, too.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin so I saw this soap mentioned on Dr. Oz and I decided to try it. The soap does not cut down on the oil completely but it does dry my skin out but I really like it and will continue to use it for my face, I have tried other products almost everyone you can think of and this is the best fit I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-for those of you who really want a soap that is fragrance free this is it&lt;br /&gt;-really cleans the face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-bars are small so they do not last long</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Great clean feeling and makes my pores tight. I would recommend this a soap to anyone. Thanks</li>
            <li> This soap is the best unscented formula for the money. Most unscented formulas still have some smell (usually as gross as any fragrance) but this soap actually smells good enough to eat!!!  LOL</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and will continue to do so. Very non allergic and gentle. I even take it on vacation and when I travel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for many years, but wasn&#x27;t able to get  the &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; here any more</li>
            <li> always good products ..!</li>
            <li> i dont hate this, but i dont really use it either. it dries my face. i got the unscented kind, which has a very strong glycerin scent. it did not break my out but i much prefer the acne prone version which doesnt dry me out. ps i have very oily skin.</li>
            <li> The best facial cleanser around.</li>
            <li> I use this as an all over body soap. My back and chest are prone to breakouts and this does a great job in preventing that. I like that it is fragrance free. The original has a very strong smell to it that I didn&#x27;t like, but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> Good price and I didn&#x27;t have to leave the house. The price was even lower than at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily African American skin so I have been exploring different products including everything from soaps, moisturizers, peels, and toners to control the oil.  After using this Neutrogena soap for the first time, I noticed my skin was dry so I had to apply more moisturizer than usual.  After about a week, my skin had a slight burning sensation and it was so dry in some areas that my skin started to peel.  This reaction was bad enough that I discontinued use.  About 5 years ago, I tried Neutrogena products for the first time (a moisturizer that was advertised by Gabriel Union), and I had a negative reaction.  So, with both experiences at two totally different stages in my life, I have tried Neutrogena and it is not for me.  I do not have sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m not sure what chemical is in their products that disagree with my skin.  I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I just got some of this soap from the local supermarket to try out for shaving. I&#x27;ve never been able to shave my face without major tugging, pulling, irritation and ingrown hairs... with, against or across the grain always yielded the same result. I recently switched to using a safety razor [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]] with [[ASIN:B001G5FOLI 10 Feather Razor Blades NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge]] and saw improvement. At that point, I was using some Col. Conk shaving soap, but upon reading that transparent glycerin soap is really good for your skin, I thought I&#x27;d try to find some. Well, this stuff is great. When using a shaving brush, it whips up effortlessly into a super thick and slippery foam. It stays foamy for a very long time so you can do your whole face at once and not have to worry about reapplying the soap all the time because this stuff does not dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual shaving is great too... the razor glides over the skin and through the thickest of whiskers (I have a very very dense beard with thick whiskers) without tugging or pulling. The best part is that it washes cleanly away and doesn&#x27;t make me worry about having clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, if you use this for a face soap its great. If you use it for shaving soap, its even better.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I&#x27;m knocking one star off. After a while, this soap tends to actually melt. At first use, the soap is rock solid. However, as the weeks go by, it will slowly melt and become \\&quot;mushy\\&quot;. I initially thought that this one little bar of soap will last me for a very long time if used twice daily but I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about using it after it has melted. The bar will still be in one piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed to spend about $6 more to qualify for Free Shipping and decided to go with this Neutrogena soap face wash. Right off the bat, I need to say that this bar of soap really is fragrance free! I know I&#x27;m stating the obvious but I&#x27;ve tried products in the past that claims to be fragrance free but still leaves my face with some sort of chemical smell. With this product, there is just a tiny wee bit of smell when you are applying it to your face but once you wash off and pat dry, I guarantee you that you will be hard pressed to find any smell at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap bar is of decent size and I can tell that it will last me quite a while. The soap is like a hard brick and not how a usual \\&quot;shower\\&quot; soap feels. It lathers up quite nicely as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know the saying of being \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot;? Well, this is it right here. When washing off the soap with my fingers, I can actually hear it making squeaky noises when rubbing! Of course, this could be just me and the noise has nothing to do with being clean at all but I definitely do feel the part. But here comes the bad news. This face bar totally dries up my face almost immediately after patting dry. Therefore, I need to apply some type of moisturizer. If you are also in the same boat, then you&#x27;ll also need to find some type of fragrance free moisturizer otherwise it would defeat the whole purpose of this face wash if the fragrance thing is one of the biggest reasons for you purchasing this product in the first place.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Neutrogena Fragrance Free Transparent Facial Bar, Original Formula for 16 years.  It is gentle on my skin, leaves me smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap to use to reduce the effects of dry skin. It is not always easy to find in local stores. We use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and it is wonderful. It does not say it is for acnebut it has helped clear up my face. I have had acne for years and this keeps my skin clean and does not dry.</li>
            <li> This is an okay face soap. As far as other Neutrogena face soaps are concerned, I certainly preferred the regular (not fragrance free) version. It just seemed to control oil/ occasional adult acne better than this kind. I am not the biggest fan of how easy the soap &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; and it definitely isn&#x27;t fit to be kept in the shower. Keeping it in a soap dish by a sink doesn&#x27;t work the best either, though it clearly states on the package that it will have a tendency to melt because the formula is designed to rinse off easily. Personally, I just don&#x27;t see enough benefit with this soap to deal with the mess.</li>
