            <li> I&#x27;ve used other kukui nut oil before but this one surpasses any other. The best oil that spreads better and doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes</li>
            <li> I like the way Kukui oil feels on my skin. I can already see a difference in my skin since I started using this.</li>
            <li> I am well aware of this product oil,  great for people with diabetes care of the feet.  I just wanted a great deal on price and found it.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I like it. It is all natural and it makes my skin look and feel nice.  I would recommend it to someone else.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have suffered from dry skin my whole life, especially during the winter.  I put this on after my shower and it has helped tremendously.  I also use it on my face a few times a week.</li>
            <li> Used this on vacation in Florida after sunbathing...my skin is silky soft..just dab some all over your body then rub in.</li>
            <li> 100% pure is true, has a slight earthy smell. Fast absorbing , universal, high quality, great product, well worth the purchase. Upon searching the internet and back , you won&#x27;t find a better price for the grade quality of this produce. Let me save you some time , just click the add to cart button!</li>
            <li> No sun burn this summer for me and I don&#x27;t smell of the white stuff</li>
            <li> Great product!  I&#x27;m using in place of lotion because I&#x27;m allergic to many of them. This absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily. It&#x27;s even light enough to use on your face. It had helped with shaving bumps after shaving too!</li>
            <li> I use this for face and body. It is great for dry skin, moisturizers well. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Amazingly this oil dried my skin out 10 times worse that what it was. I had to stop using it bc my skin started looking like alligator skin. I wish I could get my money back.</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil for many uses but I use mainly after sun and to keep my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Seems to be the same quantity and quality as more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Everyone should try this in the sun. Helps the skin as well as protects from sunburn. Great product I would buy it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this a few times, always loved it but never wrote a review about it before. I discovered Kukui Nut Oil on a trip to Hawaii many years ago. I haven&#x27;t stopped using it since. I&#x27;ve seen it packaged with other oils in other products, but nothing beats the real stuff, on it&#x27;s own. The last time it came something had happened in the post and the cap had broken (very unusual). I contacted the seller who immediately replaced it with a new one. 5 stars for the product AND for the customer service.</li>
            <li> Repeat customer.  Same as previous review.  Fast absorption.  Leaves skin soft.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> great fuel for my lamp</li>
