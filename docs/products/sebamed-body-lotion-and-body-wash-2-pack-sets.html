            <li> I  first  purchased  Seba Med in Germany last year on vacation.It was very cheap there but our Guide really praised it . I wish now i had bought a suitcase full of it. It was fantastic. the seba med I purchased from amazon did not smell the same or feel the same as the product i purchased in Bombay Germany., but it is O.K. just not the same.so i give it a 3. can we not get the same product in Amecia?</li>
            <li> A beauty product, that actually works.</li>
            <li> Receive lots of compliments on my skin, (btw I am in my 70s)</li>
            <li> Good quality, I ordered it again.</li>
            <li> Very good lotions! the one for the eyes as well as the one for face.</li>
            <li> This is great for smoothing around the eye wrinkles. U have t ouse it every day to see the results.</li>
            <li> love this product!  see a difference in skin tone and texture.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I love the way it moisturizes my face and eyelids is not greasy.</li>
            <li> will be buying this  for a long time the price is very good and I love it must use this</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with some retinal cream and it seems to help lines around eyes and mouth.  I haven&#x27;t really used the product in the jar yet.</li>
            <li> I own far too many various expensive facial products that are deemed miracles!  I was hooked on the face oils for a while, but starting getting cystic acne and wondered if the oil was causing it or hormones.  I switched to this cream and have been very pleased so far.  It blends in well without shine, although initially it seems like it&#x27;s not absorbing and I questioned if I was over applying it.  However, it soaks in within less than a minute like your skin is just soaking it up.  No greasy residue or shine.  It&#x27;s too early to say if there&#x27;s noticeable improvement in my skin, but my skin does seem to like and appreciate these products and I&#x27;m not having any irritation or breakouts which is nice.  Seems like a great product add to my arsenal of beauty products!</li>
            <li> Face feels very moisturized after putting this cream on. Love this line.</li>
            <li> I used to use sensitive skin eye creams that still irritated my eyes and didn&#x27;t do much to reduce my wrinkles.  Since using Q10 Age Defense eye cream my under eye wrinkles have reduced significantly and my eyes are no longer as irritated.  I am on my third tube and I am very happy!!!</li>
            <li> Love this night cream.  Not greasy, made in Germany.</li>
            <li> Very great product and not too expensive.</li>
            <li> I love the SebaMed line, for the products I purchased here, it is the best price I seen online.&lt;br /&gt;Best value so far</li>
            <li> Save your money.  Used both products since March and do not see any improvement.  Get same result with less expensive skin cream.</li>
            <li> This is a great face and eye cream</li>
            <li> Loved this cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;used this cream under my eyes and every night on my face and neck  , I think it improved my skin , my daughter , said my skin looked really good and soft, she asked if I had had something done ?&lt;br /&gt;I will order this cream again .&lt;br /&gt;My neck skin improved .</li>
