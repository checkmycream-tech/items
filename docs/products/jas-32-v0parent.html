            <li>All I can say is that it worked great for him; the dandruff issue literally went away once he started using this shampoo.  </li>

            <li>I love Jason products and this is another great one!</li>
            <li>I loved this product.</li>
            <li>Jason brand seems to be good.</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair so nice so happy.</li>
            <li>It also takes a lot of the shampoo to work up a good lather.</li>
            <li>I have to use a lot of it to get a good lather in my hair.  </li>
            <li>good choice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was rather fed up with my dandruff, and wanted a good shampoo to deal with it.</li>
            <li>Thus, I hope my rating of three stars is fair.</li>
            <li>The ingredients looked good</li>
            <li>Smells good too.</li>
            <li>after hearing good things about this, I am amazed by how it exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for anyone who is looking for a healthy gluten free shampoo!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells good and gives your scalp that nice tingling sensation.</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels really healthy and has a very nice shine.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more when he runs out!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I could not get my comb more than 2 inches through my hair!</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t terribly impressed with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>but it has certainly made my scalp happy!</li>
            <li>But the amazing upside is... that it stops my scalp</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Extremely effective.</li>
            <li>Then, I looked up on the internet and discovered that she might have some kind of fungal problem.  </li>
            <li>(so you can tell you&#x27;ve gotten everywhere!), and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>However, after 2 months of use I can honestly say that it has done nothing for my scalp to reduce itchiness or flaking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying this would be the case for everyone (‘to each his own’)</li>
            <li>It smells like rosemary(: which I liked.</li>
            <li>this product worked and that is all that can be said i have had dandruf for 40 years and no product has done much to help this one worked the best</li>
            <li>the smell i think is really nice</li>
            <li>and my hair is nice and full/bouncy after blow drying.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice too</li>
            <li>Not the best lather, but my hair is clean and my scalp is flake free.</li>
            <li>It has a strong, but good herbal smell.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, which does a good job on my hair and scalp and also has a very pleasing clean scent.</li>
            <li>for- years ago when I was a kid, my mother bought a very strong tea tree shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The mild scent is also pleasant, kind of like eucalyptus.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a silver bullet for my problem, but it has been the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>It got my hair clean, lathered well, and smelled pleasant.</li>
            <li>Easy!</li>
            <li>It smells great, lathers and cleans well, and is very cost effective.</li>
            <li>thanks for the good product and the good delivery.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a better more effective product.</li>
            <li>I used to LOVE this</li>
            <li>If this happened to me, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll happen to others.  </li>
            <li>This is my son&#x27;s favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Diet also has something to do with it, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>After some research, I found this product which was recommended as the top dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>Plus, I love the refreshing tingle of tea tree</li>
            <li>It also seems to make my scalp even more itchy.  </li>
            <li>He is pleased with the shampoo.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>My hair dresser has even commented on how healthy my scalp is.</li>
            <li>I have used industrial strength automotive cleaning products that have a better fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Nature&#x27;s Gate or Paul Mitchell are both 1,000 times better.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite tea tree shampoo.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly every day</li>
            <li>, I massage once more</li>
            <li>Stopped my itchy scalp :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many remedies.</li>
            <li>I dont love the consistency of it.</li>
            <li>The smell is okay</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to using this product some more, along with the complimenting condition (rumor has it that the conditioner works wonders).</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to using this product some more, along with the complimenting condition (rumor has it that the conditioner works wonders).</li>
            <li>sure I like it.</li>
            <li>I will continue using it for another week just to be sure</li>
            <li>and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the conditioner is why my hair was shiny after using it and shampoo.</li>
            <li>This item works better than most for dandruff and psoriasis flaking.</li>
            <li>B001EWEP68 Tea Tree Conditioner]], and that product works wonderfully with even a regular shampoo!</li>
            <li>This product was just okay.</li>
            <li>Undiluted tea tree oil combined with castor oil is much better for my scalp issues.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>The more garbage you see in shampoo</li>
            <li>We have tried many things for his dandruff and are still looking for a product that works.</li>
            <li>So glad I did.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo..did the trick</li>
            <li>there is more then one cause of dandruff</li>
            <li>I feel confident after continued use</li>
            <li>As a student from the states studying abroad, I don&#x27;t have as many options to fix my severe dandruff.</li>
            <li>I was perhaps better off not even ordering this product from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try the dandruff line to see if that works better.</li>
            <li>and i think I will be glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>You have to make sure to treat your scalp with the shampoo and conditioner- not just your hair.  </li>
            <li>but I decided to give it one more try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok product.</li>
            <li>I like the Paul Mitchell Tea product better.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work any better then</li>
            <li>I thought it might be refreshing</li>
            <li>&#x27;poo just to be able to comb my hair.</li>
            <li>It is a nice light shampoo, smells pretty good even though there is tea tree oil in it, but it does not work as advertised.  </li>
            <li>and it seems to get my hair nice and clean without frizz.</li>
            <li>Ok so it was good for the first 3days until I got so itchy</li>
            <li>this will clean it nicely.</li>
            <li>It works get my hair feels very clean after I use it.</li>
            <li>I do encourage everyone to explore there options first and find that organic shampoo you need to keep your scalp looking good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Just ordered the aloe vera conditioner, Worth a shot!!</li>
            <li>I have a dry, itchy scalp, and this Jason shampoo is absolutely wonderful!  </li>
            <li>Okay, I have been using this shampoo for about a month 2 times a week, so i believe I am in a pretty good place to write a somewhat accurate review.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Makes your hair and scalp feel clean!  </li>
            <li>Jason Natural Shampoo works great.  </li>
            <li>This is great shampoo, it leaves your hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I really like one that provides a good tingle as another reviewer said...</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t tingle whatsoever or feel like there is much tea tree in it, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking that good.</li>
            <li>Good shampoo for the whole family</li>
            <li>Have tried other products but like this the best.</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo with a nice scent that is not overwhelming that leaves the hair feeling rather nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shampoo with a very mild detergent in it, so</li>
            <li>me just say, I honestly felt like I was being dipped for fleas the first time I used this product.</li>
            <li>As a shampoo it was fine.</li>
            <li>The shampoo smells good &amp; leaves hair very soft</li>
            <li>This is by far the best natural shampoo I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair smooth and it keeps me from scratching at it.</li>
            <li>I have only used it for a couple of weeks and it has helped me a great deal.</li>
            <li>I will go back to using the Body Shop&#x27;s Ginger Scalp Care which has worked well for me and smells great.  </li>
            <li>It smells kind of mediciny (because of the tea tree oil) and very liquidy</li>
            <li>The only reason I rated it four stars is because it doesn&#x27;t smell great.  </li>
            <li>This product was advertised as sulfate free but it is not.  </li>
            <li>My daughter was so happy and couldn&#x27;t thank me enough.  </li>
            <li>It has worked at keeping my kids bug free</li>
            <li>I use this about once or twice a week in place of my regular shampoo, and it leaves my scalp feeling great for days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than the nonanti-Residue shampoo, but still not that useful.</li>
            <li>I came across this product while looking for an organic, paraben/sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>leaves the hair smooth</li>
            <li>&quot; (sodium lauryl sulfates) free</li>
            <li>Even though it states that the shampoo is SLS free, there is still plenty of sodium and sulfate that somehow didn&#x27;t make the ingredients list, including: Sodium Chloride, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Coco-Sulfate, Sodium Laurylglucosides, Sodium PCA, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Benzoate.  </li>
            <li>Youll enjoy this.</li>
            <li>Fantastic</li>
            <li>And her hair looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a gluten free shampoo and stumbled upon this.</li>
            <li>free&#x27; hotel shampoos just leave a scummy residue in my hair.</li>
            <li>but you really have to do your research to understand what kind you have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Jason shampoo for about three weeks, and I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised how good my scalp feels.</li>
            <li>I have smelled cat and dog shampoo that smells better than this, returned it right away, was leaking in the box too.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use a deep conditioner after using this I do have really long hair maybe someone with shorter hair will have better results I would buy this again though it&#x27;s the best dandruff shampoo I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I have recommended it to several people wiht and without scalp issues and everyone loves the clean feeling and great smell.</li>
            <li>my dandruff situation has improved and the smell is unique and i enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I have never had my hair feel so clean and silky smooth as it does now.  </li>
            <li>lol i have a pretty sensitive sense of smell</li>
            <li>Tea tree always has a certain zing feeling on you skin and scalp but this product is very mild!</li>
            <li>and i found this to be very pleasant if you expect a heavily perfumed scent</li>
            <li>After the first time I used it, I noticed a huge difference in head itchiness and within a week I could scratch my head and NOTHING would come off!</li>
            <li>I just picked up my first bottle of this shampoo in the store, and couldn&#x27;t wait to buy more on Amazon.</li>
            <li>He noticed that his dandruff has improved significantly.</li>
            <li>I checked my order to make sure it was exactly that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>the smell is really nice completely stopped my itchy scalp in two uses worth every penny :)</li>
            <li>After using Jason&#x27;s for just 2 days I feel a difference in manageability, shine, softness and not to mention clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>but it gets your hair feeling squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s CLEAN of flakes.  </li>
            <li>But this is pretty good for a normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>and by seeing so many positive reviews, thought of trying this product.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>lol, the second time it gets more normal.</li>
            <li>I find it works better if you mix a bit of pure tea-tree oil with it before shampooing.</li>
            <li>One othe thing is that I have fine hair and have to use a good conditioner after as it seems to dry my hair a bit.</li>
            <li>Allow mixture to cool before applying to scalp.</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair shiny and full of volume.</li>
            <li>The price was more reasonable than the medicated shampoos offered by retailers.</li>
            <li>My husband and I thought she wasn&#x27;t washing her hair good enough and had really been on her about doing a better job.  </li>
            <li>I had better results just putting straight tea tree oil on my scalp.</li>
            <li>this statement is true.</li>
            <li>So 3 stars seems to be fair based on personal experience.</li>
            <li>I love smell and my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch as much</li>
            <li>These are the full ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Jason</li>
            <li>This and the conditioner had helped with the itching and flakes tremendously</li>
            <li>But after a few days using the Tea Tree shampoo and conditioner, I was able to get a good, workable lather.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to get a shampoo that&#x27;s both mild</li>
            <li>It was mild just as I wanted.</li>
            <li>I received quickly, but the tea tree does not work as well as it did when I used it years ago.  </li>
            <li>Healthy, shiny, vibrant.</li>
            <li>It lathers up quickly and helps with the itching in my scalp.</li>
            <li>sure how this treatment shampoo will work for people with more traditional \\&quot;dandruff\\&quot; problems</li>
            <li>and i got a high pressure shower head to make sure i was fully rinsing my hair all to no avail</li>
            <li>It smells absolutely divine - it does take all of the greasy feelings (and oils) out of your hair, it feels amazingly clean!</li>
            <li>I did some research, and this shampoo showed up more than just a few times on various websites as the best dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>The Tea Tree Oil shampoo started controlling the snow storm on the very first day.</li>
            <li>It feels and smells great, and I noticed I had less itch, but I still get flakes.</li>
            <li>But I have been dealing with dandruff for YEARS now, and this has been so far pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li>RUB IT WELL into even the deepest parts of my hair and onto my scalp and LEAVE IT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE in my hair while bathing for the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although it does leave my hair a bit dry, you just need to use a good conditioner</li>
            <li>just got a product, scent is good, but after use shampoo , my hair feels kinda dry .</li>
            <li>At first I tried to ignore my problem, but then when my dandruff began to show up EVERYWHERE (my clothes, my pillow, even in my bathroom sink-yuck!), that is when I knew I had to address my problem.</li>
            <li>After the FIRST time using Jason shampoo (along with the root to tip conditioner- trust me, get this too), my scalp was HEALED!  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t felt this good in so long!!  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and I tried it right away.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews, and doing some online research of my own, I ordered the Jason&#x27;s Natural Tea Tree Shampoo and couldn&#x27;t wait to see results.</li>
            <li>This is very low-lathering, which is fine with me.</li>
            <li>I have also substituted warm virgin olive oil for those two oils, and mixed 1/2 C. of the reserved oatmeal water with 6 Tbs.</li>
            <li>I wrote this review in the hope people who have problems with dandruff may find some useful information in my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a more natural shampoo that fights dandruff</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive, so makes it worth the time, but I&#x27;m going to move to nizoral to find out if there is something else out there that may</li>
            <li>This is a Quality Product and worth the money.</li>
            <li>so consider it a success.</li>
            <li>This smells refreshing and is natural.</li>
            <li>I bought this in hopes that it would be a more natural way to deal with dandruff</li>
            <li>Not even worth my time returning.</li>
            <li>The only real con about this is that as you wash it out, your hair turns into a rat&#x27;s nest, so you need to follow with a good conditioner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may be because of my exceptional dry scalp, but I would not recommend this product based on my experience.</li>
            <li>its worth the try</li>
            <li>I know that a cheaper bottle of shampoo with or without conditioner coupled with an actually medicative treatment for dandruff has worked significantly better for me than this bottle ever did.</li>
            <li>This product may not be right for everyone, but I took a chance and it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>This Shampoo seems to be the right one for me.  </li>
            <li>I came across this product and I ordered it right away.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo smelled and felt right.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t ever seem to really get my hair clean.</li>
            <li>i recently moved from a cool climate Pennsylvania to Florida and with the heat started sweating more which made my flakes flare up</li>
            <li>It has made a huge difference in scalp dryness and also makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>This is in fact true however I am not eligible to speak with to much on this issue as yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE #1</li>
            <li>This is in fact true however I am not eligible to speak with to much on this issue as yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE #1</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been great - no more itching and flaking.</li>
            <li>&quot; The shampoo felt good in the shower until I started itching from the scalp down.</li>
            <li>I work with young children and have avoided catching lice so far.</li>
            <li>I love that it is an organic shampoo without all the harsh chemicals most seborrhea shampoos have.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend to anyone that has dandruff, dry scalp, itching, or is just looking for a great shampoo to treat their hair right.</li>
            <li>Really helps my itchy scalp!</li>
            <li>My Dandruff was literally gone after the first use.  </li>
            <li>Another Jason product, the dandruff relief one, is helping somewhat, but it also only has slightly more potency when it comes to tea tree</li>
            <li>EXACTLY like pesticide.</li>
            <li>Using just a regular shampoo and adding tea tree oil worked so much better.</li>
            <li>Really depends on your preference!</li>
            <li>Umm another thing, it doesn&#x27;t lather a lot, so I get tempted to use a lot of product which might be what is causing the itchiness, so just be aware that it will do its magic even if you feel it doesnt make enough bubbles</li>
            <li>26th, 2015 is the first day that I&#x27;ve used this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Admittedly, Head and Shoulders worked well the first couple of times.</li>
            <li>The only problem is, every time I use this, I&#x27;m sure to have a bad-hair day.</li>
            <li>I was aware of the healing properties of tea tree oil</li>
            <li>It does relieve my sore head better than regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>I bounce around my shampoo routine with different shampoos for psorais because it seams to work better, (for me).I do like dermarest, and Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo as well.</li>
            <li>I researched online for an anti dandruff shampoo, and the top rated shampoos like head and shoulders and selsen blue</li>
            <li>Regardless, the ingredients work and product is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Its very inexpensive and worth a shot.</li>
            <li>I have pretty severe dandruff.</li>
            <li>It works exactly as I wanted it to.  </li>
            <li>This was the first shampoo I tried with that in mind.  </li>
            <li>I want to  see how it improve ;)</li>
            <li>First day, I noticed some hair loss</li>
            <li>The second day I used I noticed even more hair loss</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try again and purchased the Tea Tree Oil shampoo, which was recommended to me in the first place.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair that day and it felt funny like it wouldn&#x27;t wash out.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it it took 4 shampoos to get any lather.  </li>
            <li>so she could alternate this product when not being able to use Ciclopirox.</li>
            <li>Once she is done with her treatment I will do Jason shampoo only and give more updates to see if this shampoo keeps the yeast infection away.</li>
            <li>The shampoo smells good but the published advertisement is not accurate.</li>
            <li>it has a very natural clean smell to me</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and it&#x27;s replaced all my other dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li>so I mix it with a nice fragrance shampoo like pomegranate, berry, etc or fragrant shower gel with a ratio of 1:2 or 1:3 of jason shampoo to other shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know I could have a normal head!!</li>
            <li>Used the rest to wash my lingerie&lt;br /&gt;Jason please go back to the original formula!</li>
            <li>Good way to make money, too bad it&#x27;s also a good way to lose customers.</li>
            <li>So I really do recommend you buying more than one dandruff shampoo and alternate after maybe a month or every two weeks?</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner and will continue to use it as long as I can!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is nice enough, cleans well, leaves my hair soft and it came fast.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my dry hair and dandruff ridden hair love it and</li>
            <li>My hair has been super soft and shiny, even silky, and has tons of volume.</li>
            <li>Maybe this stuff isn&#x27;t strong enough, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get a good lather with the shampoo right away, probably due to my hair condition from my prior anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>but if your looking for a Tea Tree specific shampoo (like most people who buy this) I would go with Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special shampoo, which does actually make your scalp fungus burn.</li>
            <li>It does seem to control dandruff to a large extent.  </li>
            <li>I have not found this to be any sort of real scalp therapy that works.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I used to use neutragena T gel but found it had too much chemicals in it for my taste</li>
            <li>I really wanted this shampoo to work.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really help dandruff/dry scalp.</li>
            <li>This has done nothing but make my hair very oil</li>
            <li>I think Jason&#x27;s been smoking too much whacky tobaccy.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>and it uses a lot and doesn&#x27;t suds up very well.</li>
            <li>Clears it up really well.  </li>
            <li>Of course I don&#x27;t have much to show (or tell) about it as yet.</li>
            <li>This was a much improvement</li>
            <li>This was a much improvement</li>
            <li>If you are unfamiliar with sulfate-free shampoos, just realize you have to really work to foam it up.</li>
            <li>I have for real scalp fungus &amp; this shampoo</li>
            <li>None could control the itch in any reasonable degree.  </li>
            <li>Just wet the hair, apply product and rub in, and add a splash more water to increase the lather effect.</li>
            <li>I really did.</li>
            <li>Gentle and helps winter itch scalp.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any real change, you can take it or leave it really.</li>
            <li>This stuff works fast and doesnt irrigate my scalp.</li>
            <li>Bought this shampoo because my hair was suffering from sun and too much time in the pool.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had really itchy scalp and dandruff for about 1 1/2 years.</li>
            <li>I really like this brand</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>The consistency seems a bit off, the shampoo is very watery and it did not ever seem to lather like shampoo is supposed to.</li>
            <li>But after using it now for a week straight</li>
            <li>My everyday shampoo, natural, smells good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure its because my hair isn&#x27;t as oily so its causing less oil on my face.</li>
            <li>On the first wash there was significant improvement if not complete.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never reacted this way to other dandruff shampoos and I&#x27;ve tried many.  </li>
            <li>After the first time, the smell was completely gone!  </li>
            <li>He likes it better than some of the other brands as it does not burn his scalp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried for my problem scalp.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t experienced any dramatic changes.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t experienced any dramatic changes.</li>
            <li>Another thing is that even though my scalp was dry, I had baby fine straight oily hair.</li>
            <li>It takes 3 times as much to clean my hair - a handful isn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li>hair is like 3 feet long, and prone to getting oily, and gross if not washed every day, and this shampoo works wonders in keeping my hair clean, shiny, soft, and healthy, while not drying out my scalp.</li>
            <li>The product is great, but the the plastic bottle, which comes wrapped tightly in an outer package, had a loose cap causing a leak into the outer package during shipment.  </li>
            <li>No it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as a conventional shampoo, but thats ok.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make a huge foamy lather, so if you can deal with a small amount of lather,  it&#x27;s absolutely worth it!</li>
            <li>My hair is waist length baby fine hair which had gotten so dry that I was splitting on every end.</li>
            <li>This shampoo worked the first time - stopped the flakes completely.</li>
            <li>This shampoo came highly recommended and I really wanted to use something gentler and more natural than the other over-the-counter dandruff shampoos.  </li>
            <li>this particular brand of tea tree shampoo?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked for a while, but my suggestion is to find another shampoo and a decent conditioner too so that your scalp won&#x27;t get used to one shampoo/conditioner and become immune to its effects.</li>
            <li>I understand sometimes a particular shampoo cannot help some people but can do wonders for others.</li>
            <li>do not know whether it&#x27;s the milder-than-usual detergent or the tea tree oil or something else that does it, but I don&#x27;t particularly care.</li>
            <li>I recently tried free and clear shampoo without any results.  </li>
            <li>so I did some research about remedies and this particular item popped up.  </li>
            <li>The main point for me was this; The description, just below the price reads:</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly after trying so many others and even more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>Love the Tea Tree Shampoo its gently, effectively eliminates excessive dead cells and dandruff to gradually normalize the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Found some website where this Jason tea tree shampoo was highly rated</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>If you have stubborn scalp issues, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>the price is a tad high for the amount given</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you want silky shinny hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that this was the right choice - bought because it was natural but think that it was meant more as a scalp therapy.  </li>
            <li>Very light and delicate - much like the shampoo!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did a little research and took a chance.</li>
            <li>on that 1 random occasion, when i actually spaced out on packing it, heading to Freddy&#x27;s for more was the top priority! &#x27;</li>
            <li>Due to it being strong to where it rids of dandruff..it also dries your scalp so you will need some type of grease/conditioner</li>
            <li>It seems to keep my scalp calm and is the only thing I use.</li>
            <li>I tried a few more times to stomach it, but just can&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li>Life isn&#x27;t fun with dandruff, and there&#x27;s too many false treatments (vinegar, really?  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth if only to get rid of the dandruff problem.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff because it doesn&#x27;t have that harsh T-gel smell.</li>
            <li>I simply associated this with the average puberty phase of life and used the popular Head and Shoulders Shampoo/Conditioner to alleviate the problem.</li>
            <li>Until my second wash all I can say is, it&#x27;s definitely worth the shot.</li>
            <li>Until my second wash all I can say is, it&#x27;s definitely worth the shot.</li>
            <li>By the second use with this shampoo, making sure to spend several minutes massaging it into my scalp, all the itching is nearly gone.</li>
            <li>My scalp felt even more irritated, and minutes after drying my hair, it became excessively itchy and absolutely unbearable.</li>
            <li>I have tried various products with nominal success.</li>
            <li>I made sure to lather it up a lot and let it sit on my scalp for a few minutes while I showered and then rinse out.  </li>
            <li>but I just thought it was normal.</li>
            <li>I decided to try something new this time and my dandruff improved noticeably within a week.</li>
            <li>I live overseas now, so I tried switching to this which I can find at the commissary.  </li>
            <li>New formula:</li>
            <li>I think it has a nice subtle smell too it.</li>
            <li>Jason Natural Tea Tree alone might be enough if you have mild dandruff, but for my severe case I have to use Jason Natural Tea Tree with Nizoral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather, it SUPER drying, and leaves hair feeling brittle and scalp feeling dry and itchy.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for dandruff but its gentle enough</li>
            <li>the thing is that it actually works compared to the harsh chemical stuff i have been using that was in effective.</li>
            <li>The shampoo works well, but at least with my hair, it helps with the dandruff and the itch, but it&#x27;s not anything super special</li>
            <li>I found the scent to be very natural and restoring.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather too well the first time, but if you rinse and repeat, it will lather up well the second time.</li>
            <li>I am still using this product after two months but am not sure that I will buy more when the bottle runs out.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I used only a quarter-sized amount of the shampoo twice, and I still had my dandruff.</li>
            <li>get that it&#x27;s all natural, but it still has to function as a shampoo people!</li>
            <li>Once I switched to Neutrogena T sol, my hair feels better and no more pain.</li>
            <li>My only advice is to try the cheaper shampoo first before moving up to ones that cost 15 or 30 dollars a bottle.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too alarmed, since I figured it was only my first time using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It might have been better than not using it at all, but I&#x27;m not completely sure of that.</li>
            <li>bought this last summer because it was so hot</li>
            <li>I heard good things about tea tree shampoos in general but this one just sucks!</li>
            <li>It was nice and tingly on my scalp, but I have long hair and the ends felt coarse and dry.  </li>
            <li>Smells like pine tar but not overly strong and once my hair dried the smell vanished.</li>
            <li>Third I had the same results, after that I just decided to stop using for the fear that I might loose more hair than normal occasions.</li>
            <li>The only positive is the scent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>THe next time I used the shampoo, I used more than half a dollar-sized amount, nothing.</li>
            <li>(so I can use at least 3 times weekly) as well as good for my dry scalp problem.</li>
            <li>Has lasted for a long time and very gentle on scalp.</li>
            <li>No more oil, just clean hair!</li>
            <li>This shampoo works as a cleanser, but it doesn&#x27;t smell good, leaves my hair feeling dry with a very slight filminess that will likely build up over time.</li>
            <li>This product makes your hair feel super clean and extra soft, even the very ends of my hair that were usually a little rough.</li>
            <li>And for those saying it made their hair greasy, didn&#x27;t lather, etc-- clearly operator error.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s water clear, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried nearly every shampoo product from Denorex to Neutrogena T-gel and none of them</li>
            <li>Maybe my skin is just sensitive to the tea tree oil</li>
            <li>He likes how it leaves his hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It is natural with no harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I will use it occasionally to purify my scalp with tea tree oil, but I will not use it very often.</li>
            <li>It is also all natural which I why I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I miss soft manageable hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural herbal shampoo that would keep lice away from my hair and wanted to try this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I used to have a flaky itchy hair scalp but not since using it, nor have I had any lice and my hair is soft and fuller.  </li>
            <li>So seems it is all natural stuff..</li>
            <li>Speaking with my derm friend, he recommended I also look at [[ASIN:B0000535UA JASON Natural Cosmetics Shampoo, Tea Tree Oil Hair &amp; Scalp Therapy - 17.5 fl</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve managed to switch to a cocktail of both shampoos, using Jason Natural Tea Tree the majority of the week.</li>
            <li>I was searching for a natural remedy to cure my situation, not just mask it.  </li>
            <li>Old lady smell.</li>
            <li>and i can see the results my hair is so soft that i can&#x27;t believe</li>
            <li>but it shows it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>hair is smooth and does not feel dead.</li>
            <li>Even though it doesn&#x27;t stink of tar, it smells like old books.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair soft, adds volume and shinier.</li>
            <li>Gentle to use daily</li>
            <li>And I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;- is not harsh at all&lt;br</li>
            <li>But seeing as this shampoo is fairly reasonably priced, I don&#x27;t care enough.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Which, in this case, is JASON Natural Cosmetics Tea Tree Oil</li>
            <li>however, it completely stripped my hair.</li>
            <li>Head&amp;Shoulders was so so, T-Gel may as well have been a placebo, and even the actual Jason Dandruff line was good, but not GREAT like this.</li>
            <li>The smell is ok - not amazing.</li>
            <li>I had a healthy scalp for my whole life, but developed a dry and flaky scalp after having some health issues the past 2 years,</li>
            <li>I was suffering from itchy dry scalp and dermatitis over the winter resulting in some pretty epic dandruff.</li>
            <li>The only reason I give it 3 stars, is only because it prolongs the appearance of dandruff, which other shampoos have not been able to do for me.</li>
            <li>Did exactly what I needed it to-got rid of my dry itchy scalp, also have softer feeling hair.</li>
            <li>pretty bad u can only wear so many light colored shirts to avoid them showing up</li>
            <li>She says it makes her hair even softer and the shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell bad either, just a nice clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I typically use Burt&#x27;s Bees shampoo and love what it does for my hair, but not for my scalp (dry and itchy).</li>
            <li>I only wash my hair twice a week, and by day three my scalp would be particularly itchy with lots of flaking, even though I don&#x27;t use any product on my scalp or in my hair.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad with a little conditioner.</li>
            <li>It is a little more expensive than what you buy at Target, but it is worth it!!</li>
            <li>I thought itchy scalp was just something I had to live with until I tried a shampoo from Pytho that actually controlled the itching.  </li>
            <li>Really helps if you have a dry scalp and have dandruffs.  </li>
            <li>I have dry scalp and after much research, thought I would give this a try.</li>
            <li>But, it did absolutely nothing to reduce my dry scalp problem.</li>
            <li>When I do use it, maybe once or twice per week, it cleans my scalp very well, but doesn&#x27;t over dry my scalp.  </li>
            <li>So far the only natural shampoos that haven&#x27;t done that are the Desert Essence ones.</li>
            <li>I knew my root was the latter thanks to feedback from my stylist and the fact it comes only in the winter.</li>
            <li>It really takes out all of that other left behind stuff and gives a fresh clean feel to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this shampoo to anyone looking for an all natural alternative to the major brands.</li>
            <li>It actually makes your hair brighter and healthier looking, I was surprised  </li>
            <li>I ordered what is pictured on Amazon, Jason Natural Cosmetics Shampoo, Tea Tree Oil Hair and Scalp Therapy  with the bear on the blue bottle.</li>
            <li>19 year old male</li>
            <li>However, I found it&#x27;s quite a bit more expensive on Amazon then the one I finally found at Whole Foods Stores.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure what happened here, but I noticed that after using this product my dandruff was even worse.</li>
            <li>It does seem thin and watery if you are accustomed shampoos with fillers trust me though this is much better for your hair.</li>
            <li>My teen has dry scalp issues and this stuff really helps.</li>
            <li>Hair feels very oily the next day, and after wash is very dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li>On its own remember this is a natural product and does not contain the chemicals that common shampoos usually leave tons of build up on your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried many other products after this, even changing my lifestyle habits, going to the dermatologist and common natural remedies such as the Apple Cider Vinegar method.</li>
            <li>Finally, a shampoo that really does what it needs to!&lt;br /&gt;Purchased this by recommendation of a hairstylist friend to combat dandruff, especially in this dry area.</li>
            <li>(I am 45 year old male who never had acne as a teen!!).</li>
            <li>I save this for when I don&#x27;t have any social engagements on my calendar.</li>
            <li>I want to give this product a 5-star review, because so many people seem to like it, but as far as tea tree shampoos go, this one fails to provide what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena seem to perform better, while Jason performed worse than regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I will say that the first time I used this shampoo, my scalp felt like it was burning a little (I guess it was killing off the fungus in there).  </li>
            <li>I was at first elated, but then I went about my day and less than 12 hours later</li>
            <li>I read many of the reviews before purchasing, and was hoping to get a more natural shampoo that would help with my dandruff, but the shampoo barely lathered and then left my hair feeling completely disgusting.  </li>
            <li>I have to conclude it is pretty harsh if my skin reacts this way to it.  </li>
            <li>have VERY dry, itchy and flaky scalp, I used this shampoo and the very first time I saw it got rid of all the flakes that many other shampoos were unable to.</li>
            <li>My 9 year old has bouts with dry skin/dandruff.</li>
            <li>I still have an itchy scalp with a few hot spots that this shampoo did nothing for after a week of daily use.  </li>
            <li>Just works alright, smells funny, didnt really help or make my scalp worse.  </li>
            <li>some of them worked for a little while, but ultimately it only got worse until finally my mom researched into something more along the natural, organic line, and came across this.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Jason brand seems to be good.</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair so nice so happy.</li>
            <li> It also takes a lot of the shampoo to work up a good lather.</li>
            <li> I have to use a lot of it to get a good lather in my hair.  </li>
            <li> good choice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was rather fed up with my dandruff, and wanted a good shampoo to deal with it.</li>
            <li> Thus, I hope my rating of three stars is fair.</li>
            <li> The ingredients looked good</li>
            <li> Smells good too.</li>
            <li> after hearing good things about this, I am amazed by how it exceeded my expectations.  </li>

            <li> My hair looks and feels really healthy and has a very nice shine.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more when he runs out!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I could not get my comb more than 2 inches through my hair!</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t terribly impressed with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> but it has certainly made my scalp happy!</li>
            <li> But the amazing upside is... that it stops my scalp</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Extremely effective.</li>
            <li> Then, I looked up on the internet and discovered that she might have some kind of fungal problem.  </li>
            <li> (so you can tell you&#x27;ve gotten everywhere!), and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> However, after 2 months of use I can honestly say that it has done nothing for my scalp to reduce itchiness or flaking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying this would be the case for everyone (‘to each his own’)</li>
            <li> It smells like rosemary(: which I liked.</li>
            <li> this product worked and that is all that can be said i have had dandruf for 40 years and no product has done much to help this one worked the best</li>
            <li> the smell i think is really nice</li>
            <li> and my hair is nice and full/bouncy after blow drying.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice too</li>
            <li> Not the best lather, but my hair is clean and my scalp is flake free.</li>
            <li> It has a strong, but good herbal smell.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, which does a good job on my hair and scalp and also has a very pleasing clean scent.</li>
            <li> for- years ago when I was a kid, my mother bought a very strong tea tree shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The mild scent is also pleasant, kind of like eucalyptus.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a silver bullet for my problem, but it has been the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> It got my hair clean, lathered well, and smelled pleasant.</li>
            <li> Easy!</li>
            <li> It smells great, lathers and cleans well, and is very cost effective.</li>
            <li> thanks for the good product and the good delivery.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a better more effective product.</li>
            <li> I used to LOVE this</li>
            <li> If this happened to me, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll happen to others.  </li>
            <li> This is my son&#x27;s favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Diet also has something to do with it, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> After some research, I found this product which was recommended as the top dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> Plus, I love the refreshing tingle of tea tree</li>
            <li> It also seems to make my scalp even more itchy.  </li>
            <li> He is pleased with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> and I love the scent.  </li>
            <li> My hair dresser has even commented on how healthy my scalp is.</li>
            <li> I have used industrial strength automotive cleaning products that have a better fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Nature&#x27;s Gate or Paul Mitchell are both 1,000 times better.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tea tree shampoo.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly every day</li>
            <li> , I massage once more</li>
            <li> Stopped my itchy scalp :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many remedies.</li>
            <li> I dont love the consistency of it.</li>
            <li> The smell is okay</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to using this product some more, along with the complimenting condition (rumor has it that the conditioner works wonders).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to using this product some more, along with the complimenting condition (rumor has it that the conditioner works wonders).</li>
            <li> sure I like it.</li>
            <li> I will continue using it for another week just to be sure</li>
            <li> and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the conditioner is why my hair was shiny after using it and shampoo.</li>
            <li> This item works better than most for dandruff and psoriasis flaking.</li>
            <li> B001EWEP68 Tea Tree Conditioner]], and that product works wonderfully with even a regular shampoo!</li>
            <li> This product was just okay.</li>
            <li> Undiluted tea tree oil combined with castor oil is much better for my scalp issues.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> The more garbage you see in shampoo</li>
            <li> We have tried many things for his dandruff and are still looking for a product that works.</li>
            <li> So glad I did.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo..did the trick</li>
            <li> there is more then one cause of dandruff</li>
            <li> I feel confident after continued use</li>
            <li> As a student from the states studying abroad, I don&#x27;t have as many options to fix my severe dandruff.</li>
            <li> I was perhaps better off not even ordering this product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try the dandruff line to see if that works better.</li>
            <li> and i think I will be glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> You have to make sure to treat your scalp with the shampoo and conditioner- not just your hair.  </li>
            <li> but I decided to give it one more try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok product.</li>
            <li> I like the Paul Mitchell Tea product better.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work any better then</li>
            <li> I thought it might be refreshing</li>
            <li> &#x27;poo just to be able to comb my hair.</li>
            <li> It is a nice light shampoo, smells pretty good even though there is tea tree oil in it, but it does not work as advertised.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to get my hair nice and clean without frizz.</li>
            <li> Ok so it was good for the first 3days until I got so itchy</li>
            <li> this will clean it nicely.</li>
            <li> It works get my hair feels very clean after I use it.</li>
            <li> I do encourage everyone to explore there options first and find that organic shampoo you need to keep your scalp looking good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just ordered the aloe vera conditioner, Worth a shot!!</li>
            <li> I have a dry, itchy scalp, and this Jason shampoo is absolutely wonderful!  </li>
            <li> Okay, I have been using this shampoo for about a month 2 times a week, so i believe I am in a pretty good place to write a somewhat accurate review.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Makes your hair and scalp feel clean!  </li>
            <li> Jason Natural Shampoo works great.  </li>
            <li> This is great shampoo, it leaves your hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I really like one that provides a good tingle as another reviewer said...</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t tingle whatsoever or feel like there is much tea tree in it, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking that good.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo for the whole family</li>
            <li> Have tried other products but like this the best.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo with a nice scent that is not overwhelming that leaves the hair feeling rather nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shampoo with a very mild detergent in it, so</li>
            <li> me just say, I honestly felt like I was being dipped for fleas the first time I used this product.</li>
            <li> As a shampoo it was fine.</li>
            <li> The shampoo smells good &amp; leaves hair very soft</li>
            <li> This is by far the best natural shampoo I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair smooth and it keeps me from scratching at it.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a couple of weeks and it has helped me a great deal.</li>
            <li> I will go back to using the Body Shop&#x27;s Ginger Scalp Care which has worked well for me and smells great.  </li>
            <li> It smells kind of mediciny (because of the tea tree oil) and very liquidy</li>
            <li> The only reason I rated it four stars is because it doesn&#x27;t smell great.  </li>
            <li> This product was advertised as sulfate free but it is not.  </li>
            <li> My daughter was so happy and couldn&#x27;t thank me enough.  </li>
            <li> It has worked at keeping my kids bug free</li>
            <li> I use this about once or twice a week in place of my regular shampoo, and it leaves my scalp feeling great for days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than the nonanti-Residue shampoo, but still not that useful.</li>
            <li> I came across this product while looking for an organic, paraben/sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> leaves the hair smooth</li>
            <li> &quot; (sodium lauryl sulfates) free</li>
            <li> Even though it states that the shampoo is SLS free, there is still plenty of sodium and sulfate that somehow didn&#x27;t make the ingredients list, including: Sodium Chloride, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Coco-Sulfate, Sodium Laurylglucosides, Sodium PCA, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Benzoate.  </li>
            <li> Youll enjoy this.</li>
            <li> Fantastic</li>
            <li> And her hair looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a gluten free shampoo and stumbled upon this.</li>
            <li> free&#x27; hotel shampoos just leave a scummy residue in my hair.</li>
            <li> but you really have to do your research to understand what kind you have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Jason shampoo for about three weeks, and I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised how good my scalp feels.</li>
            <li> I have smelled cat and dog shampoo that smells better than this, returned it right away, was leaking in the box too.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use a deep conditioner after using this I do have really long hair maybe someone with shorter hair will have better results I would buy this again though it&#x27;s the best dandruff shampoo I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have recommended it to several people wiht and without scalp issues and everyone loves the clean feeling and great smell.</li>
            <li> my dandruff situation has improved and the smell is unique and i enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I have never had my hair feel so clean and silky smooth as it does now.  </li>
            <li> lol i have a pretty sensitive sense of smell</li>
            <li> Tea tree always has a certain zing feeling on you skin and scalp but this product is very mild!</li>
            <li> and i found this to be very pleasant if you expect a heavily perfumed scent</li>
            <li> After the first time I used it, I noticed a huge difference in head itchiness and within a week I could scratch my head and NOTHING would come off!</li>
            <li> I just picked up my first bottle of this shampoo in the store, and couldn&#x27;t wait to buy more on Amazon.</li>
            <li> He noticed that his dandruff has improved significantly.</li>
            <li> I checked my order to make sure it was exactly that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> the smell is really nice completely stopped my itchy scalp in two uses worth every penny :)</li>
            <li> After using Jason&#x27;s for just 2 days I feel a difference in manageability, shine, softness and not to mention clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> but it gets your hair feeling squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s CLEAN of flakes.  </li>
            <li> But this is pretty good for a normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> and by seeing so many positive reviews, thought of trying this product.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> lol, the second time it gets more normal.</li>
            <li> I find it works better if you mix a bit of pure tea-tree oil with it before shampooing.</li>
            <li> One othe thing is that I have fine hair and have to use a good conditioner after as it seems to dry my hair a bit.</li>
            <li> Allow mixture to cool before applying to scalp.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair shiny and full of volume.</li>
            <li> The price was more reasonable than the medicated shampoos offered by retailers.</li>
            <li> My husband and I thought she wasn&#x27;t washing her hair good enough and had really been on her about doing a better job.  </li>
            <li> I had better results just putting straight tea tree oil on my scalp.</li>
            <li> this statement is true.</li>
            <li> So 3 stars seems to be fair based on personal experience.</li>
            <li> I love smell and my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch as much</li>
            <li> These are the full ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Jason</li>
            <li> This and the conditioner had helped with the itching and flakes tremendously</li>
            <li> But after a few days using the Tea Tree shampoo and conditioner, I was able to get a good, workable lather.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to get a shampoo that&#x27;s both mild</li>
            <li> It was mild just as I wanted.</li>
            <li> I received quickly, but the tea tree does not work as well as it did when I used it years ago.  </li>
            <li> Healthy, shiny, vibrant.</li>
            <li> It lathers up quickly and helps with the itching in my scalp.</li>
            <li> sure how this treatment shampoo will work for people with more traditional \\&quot;dandruff\\&quot; problems</li>
            <li> and i got a high pressure shower head to make sure i was fully rinsing my hair all to no avail</li>
            <li> It smells absolutely divine - it does take all of the greasy feelings (and oils) out of your hair, it feels amazingly clean!</li>
            <li> I did some research, and this shampoo showed up more than just a few times on various websites as the best dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> The Tea Tree Oil shampoo started controlling the snow storm on the very first day.</li>
            <li> It feels and smells great, and I noticed I had less itch, but I still get flakes.</li>
            <li> But I have been dealing with dandruff for YEARS now, and this has been so far pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li> RUB IT WELL into even the deepest parts of my hair and onto my scalp and LEAVE IT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE in my hair while bathing for the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although it does leave my hair a bit dry, you just need to use a good conditioner</li>
            <li> just got a product, scent is good, but after use shampoo , my hair feels kinda dry .</li>
            <li> At first I tried to ignore my problem, but then when my dandruff began to show up EVERYWHERE (my clothes, my pillow, even in my bathroom sink-yuck!), that is when I knew I had to address my problem.</li>
            <li> After the FIRST time using Jason shampoo (along with the root to tip conditioner- trust me, get this too), my scalp was HEALED!  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t felt this good in so long!!  </li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and I tried it right away.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews, and doing some online research of my own, I ordered the Jason&#x27;s Natural Tea Tree Shampoo and couldn&#x27;t wait to see results.</li>
            <li> This is very low-lathering, which is fine with me.</li>
            <li> I have also substituted warm virgin olive oil for those two oils, and mixed 1/2 C. of the reserved oatmeal water with 6 Tbs.</li>
            <li> I wrote this review in the hope people who have problems with dandruff may find some useful information in my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a more natural shampoo that fights dandruff</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive, so makes it worth the time, but I&#x27;m going to move to nizoral to find out if there is something else out there that may</li>
            <li> This is a Quality Product and worth the money.</li>
            <li> so consider it a success.</li>
            <li> This smells refreshing and is natural.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes that it would be a more natural way to deal with dandruff</li>
            <li> Not even worth my time returning.</li>
            <li> The only real con about this is that as you wash it out, your hair turns into a rat&#x27;s nest, so you need to follow with a good conditioner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may be because of my exceptional dry scalp, but I would not recommend this product based on my experience.</li>
            <li> its worth the try</li>
            <li> I know that a cheaper bottle of shampoo with or without conditioner coupled with an actually medicative treatment for dandruff has worked significantly better for me than this bottle ever did.</li>
            <li> This product may not be right for everyone, but I took a chance and it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> This Shampoo seems to be the right one for me.  </li>
            <li> I came across this product and I ordered it right away.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo smelled and felt right.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t ever seem to really get my hair clean.</li>
            <li> i recently moved from a cool climate Pennsylvania to Florida and with the heat started sweating more which made my flakes flare up</li>
            <li> It has made a huge difference in scalp dryness and also makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> This is in fact true however I am not eligible to speak with to much on this issue as yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE #1</li>
            <li> This is in fact true however I am not eligible to speak with to much on this issue as yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE #1</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been great - no more itching and flaking.</li>
            <li> &quot; The shampoo felt good in the shower until I started itching from the scalp down.</li>
            <li> I work with young children and have avoided catching lice so far.</li>
            <li> I love that it is an organic shampoo without all the harsh chemicals most seborrhea shampoos have.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend to anyone that has dandruff, dry scalp, itching, or is just looking for a great shampoo to treat their hair right.</li>
            <li> Really helps my itchy scalp!</li>
            <li> My Dandruff was literally gone after the first use.  </li>
            <li> Another Jason product, the dandruff relief one, is helping somewhat, but it also only has slightly more potency when it comes to tea tree</li>
            <li> EXACTLY like pesticide.</li>
            <li> Using just a regular shampoo and adding tea tree oil worked so much better.</li>
            <li> Really depends on your preference!</li>
            <li> Umm another thing, it doesn&#x27;t lather a lot, so I get tempted to use a lot of product which might be what is causing the itchiness, so just be aware that it will do its magic even if you feel it doesnt make enough bubbles</li>
            <li> 26th, 2015 is the first day that I&#x27;ve used this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, Head and Shoulders worked well the first couple of times.</li>
            <li> The only problem is, every time I use this, I&#x27;m sure to have a bad-hair day.</li>
            <li> I was aware of the healing properties of tea tree oil</li>
            <li> It does relieve my sore head better than regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> I bounce around my shampoo routine with different shampoos for psorais because it seams to work better, (for me).I do like dermarest, and Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo as well.</li>
            <li> I researched online for an anti dandruff shampoo, and the top rated shampoos like head and shoulders and selsen blue</li>
            <li> Regardless, the ingredients work and product is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Its very inexpensive and worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I have pretty severe dandruff.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as I wanted it to.  </li>
            <li> This was the first shampoo I tried with that in mind.  </li>
            <li> I want to  see how it improve ;)</li>
            <li> First day, I noticed some hair loss</li>
            <li> The second day I used I noticed even more hair loss</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try again and purchased the Tea Tree Oil shampoo, which was recommended to me in the first place.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair that day and it felt funny like it wouldn&#x27;t wash out.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it it took 4 shampoos to get any lather.  </li>
            <li> so she could alternate this product when not being able to use Ciclopirox.</li>
            <li> Once she is done with her treatment I will do Jason shampoo only and give more updates to see if this shampoo keeps the yeast infection away.</li>
            <li> The shampoo smells good but the published advertisement is not accurate.</li>
            <li> it has a very natural clean smell to me</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and it&#x27;s replaced all my other dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li> so I mix it with a nice fragrance shampoo like pomegranate, berry, etc or fragrant shower gel with a ratio of 1:2 or 1:3 of jason shampoo to other shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know I could have a normal head!!</li>
            <li> Used the rest to wash my lingerie&lt;br /&gt;Jason please go back to the original formula!</li>
            <li> Good way to make money, too bad it&#x27;s also a good way to lose customers.</li>
            <li> So I really do recommend you buying more than one dandruff shampoo and alternate after maybe a month or every two weeks?</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner and will continue to use it as long as I can!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is nice enough, cleans well, leaves my hair soft and it came fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dry hair and dandruff ridden hair love it and</li>
            <li> My hair has been super soft and shiny, even silky, and has tons of volume.</li>
            <li> Maybe this stuff isn&#x27;t strong enough, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get a good lather with the shampoo right away, probably due to my hair condition from my prior anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> but if your looking for a Tea Tree specific shampoo (like most people who buy this) I would go with Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special shampoo, which does actually make your scalp fungus burn.</li>
            <li> It does seem to control dandruff to a large extent.  </li>
            <li> I have not found this to be any sort of real scalp therapy that works.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I used to use neutragena T gel but found it had too much chemicals in it for my taste</li>
            <li> I really wanted this shampoo to work.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really help dandruff/dry scalp.</li>
            <li> This has done nothing but make my hair very oil</li>
            <li> I think Jason&#x27;s been smoking too much whacky tobaccy.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and it uses a lot and doesn&#x27;t suds up very well.</li>
            <li> Clears it up really well.  </li>
            <li> Of course I don&#x27;t have much to show (or tell) about it as yet.</li>
            <li> This was a much improvement</li>
            <li> This was a much improvement</li>
            <li> If you are unfamiliar with sulfate-free shampoos, just realize you have to really work to foam it up.</li>
            <li> I have for real scalp fungus &amp; this shampoo</li>
            <li> None could control the itch in any reasonable degree.  </li>
            <li> Just wet the hair, apply product and rub in, and add a splash more water to increase the lather effect.</li>
            <li> I really did.</li>
            <li> Gentle and helps winter itch scalp.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any real change, you can take it or leave it really.</li>
            <li> This stuff works fast and doesnt irrigate my scalp.</li>
            <li> Bought this shampoo because my hair was suffering from sun and too much time in the pool.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had really itchy scalp and dandruff for about 1 1/2 years.</li>
            <li> I really like this brand</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> The consistency seems a bit off, the shampoo is very watery and it did not ever seem to lather like shampoo is supposed to.</li>
            <li> But after using it now for a week straight</li>
            <li> My everyday shampoo, natural, smells good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure its because my hair isn&#x27;t as oily so its causing less oil on my face.</li>
            <li> On the first wash there was significant improvement if not complete.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never reacted this way to other dandruff shampoos and I&#x27;ve tried many.  </li>
            <li> After the first time, the smell was completely gone!  </li>
            <li> He likes it better than some of the other brands as it does not burn his scalp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried for my problem scalp.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t experienced any dramatic changes.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t experienced any dramatic changes.</li>
            <li> Another thing is that even though my scalp was dry, I had baby fine straight oily hair.</li>
            <li> It takes 3 times as much to clean my hair - a handful isn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li> hair is like 3 feet long, and prone to getting oily, and gross if not washed every day, and this shampoo works wonders in keeping my hair clean, shiny, soft, and healthy, while not drying out my scalp.</li>
            <li> The product is great, but the the plastic bottle, which comes wrapped tightly in an outer package, had a loose cap causing a leak into the outer package during shipment.  </li>
            <li> No it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as a conventional shampoo, but thats ok.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make a huge foamy lather, so if you can deal with a small amount of lather,  it&#x27;s absolutely worth it!</li>
            <li> My hair is waist length baby fine hair which had gotten so dry that I was splitting on every end.</li>
            <li> This shampoo worked the first time - stopped the flakes completely.</li>
            <li> This shampoo came highly recommended and I really wanted to use something gentler and more natural than the other over-the-counter dandruff shampoos.  </li>
            <li> this particular brand of tea tree shampoo?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked for a while, but my suggestion is to find another shampoo and a decent conditioner too so that your scalp won&#x27;t get used to one shampoo/conditioner and become immune to its effects.</li>
            <li> I understand sometimes a particular shampoo cannot help some people but can do wonders for others.</li>
            <li> do not know whether it&#x27;s the milder-than-usual detergent or the tea tree oil or something else that does it, but I don&#x27;t particularly care.</li>
            <li> I recently tried free and clear shampoo without any results.  </li>
            <li> so I did some research about remedies and this particular item popped up.  </li>
            <li> The main point for me was this; The description, just below the price reads:</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly after trying so many others and even more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Love the Tea Tree Shampoo its gently, effectively eliminates excessive dead cells and dandruff to gradually normalize the scalp.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Found some website where this Jason tea tree shampoo was highly rated</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> If you have stubborn scalp issues, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> the price is a tad high for the amount given</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you want silky shinny hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this was the right choice - bought because it was natural but think that it was meant more as a scalp therapy.  </li>
            <li> Very light and delicate - much like the shampoo!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did a little research and took a chance.</li>
            <li> on that 1 random occasion, when i actually spaced out on packing it, heading to Freddy&#x27;s for more was the top priority! &#x27;</li>
            <li> Due to it being strong to where it rids of dandruff..it also dries your scalp so you will need some type of grease/conditioner</li>
            <li> It seems to keep my scalp calm and is the only thing I use.</li>
            <li> I tried a few more times to stomach it, but just can&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> Life isn&#x27;t fun with dandruff, and there&#x27;s too many false treatments (vinegar, really?  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth if only to get rid of the dandruff problem.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff because it doesn&#x27;t have that harsh T-gel smell.</li>
            <li> I simply associated this with the average puberty phase of life and used the popular Head and Shoulders Shampoo/Conditioner to alleviate the problem.</li>
            <li> Until my second wash all I can say is, it&#x27;s definitely worth the shot.</li>
            <li> Until my second wash all I can say is, it&#x27;s definitely worth the shot.</li>
            <li> By the second use with this shampoo, making sure to spend several minutes massaging it into my scalp, all the itching is nearly gone.</li>
            <li> My scalp felt even more irritated, and minutes after drying my hair, it became excessively itchy and absolutely unbearable.</li>
            <li> I have tried various products with nominal success.</li>
            <li> I made sure to lather it up a lot and let it sit on my scalp for a few minutes while I showered and then rinse out.  </li>
            <li> but I just thought it was normal.</li>
            <li> I decided to try something new this time and my dandruff improved noticeably within a week.</li>
            <li> I live overseas now, so I tried switching to this which I can find at the commissary.  </li>
            <li> New formula:</li>
            <li> I think it has a nice subtle smell too it.</li>
            <li> Jason Natural Tea Tree alone might be enough if you have mild dandruff, but for my severe case I have to use Jason Natural Tea Tree with Nizoral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather, it SUPER drying, and leaves hair feeling brittle and scalp feeling dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for dandruff but its gentle enough</li>
            <li> the thing is that it actually works compared to the harsh chemical stuff i have been using that was in effective.</li>
            <li> The shampoo works well, but at least with my hair, it helps with the dandruff and the itch, but it&#x27;s not anything super special</li>
            <li> I found the scent to be very natural and restoring.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather too well the first time, but if you rinse and repeat, it will lather up well the second time.</li>
            <li> I am still using this product after two months but am not sure that I will buy more when the bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I used only a quarter-sized amount of the shampoo twice, and I still had my dandruff.</li>
            <li> get that it&#x27;s all natural, but it still has to function as a shampoo people!</li>
            <li> Once I switched to Neutrogena T sol, my hair feels better and no more pain.</li>
            <li> My only advice is to try the cheaper shampoo first before moving up to ones that cost 15 or 30 dollars a bottle.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too alarmed, since I figured it was only my first time using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It might have been better than not using it at all, but I&#x27;m not completely sure of that.</li>
            <li> bought this last summer because it was so hot</li>
            <li> I heard good things about tea tree shampoos in general but this one just sucks!</li>
            <li> It was nice and tingly on my scalp, but I have long hair and the ends felt coarse and dry.  </li>
            <li> Smells like pine tar but not overly strong and once my hair dried the smell vanished.</li>
            <li> Third I had the same results, after that I just decided to stop using for the fear that I might loose more hair than normal occasions.</li>
            <li> The only positive is the scent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> THe next time I used the shampoo, I used more than half a dollar-sized amount, nothing.</li>
            <li> (so I can use at least 3 times weekly) as well as good for my dry scalp problem.</li>
            <li> Has lasted for a long time and very gentle on scalp.</li>
            <li> No more oil, just clean hair!</li>
            <li> This shampoo works as a cleanser, but it doesn&#x27;t smell good, leaves my hair feeling dry with a very slight filminess that will likely build up over time.</li>
            <li> This product makes your hair feel super clean and extra soft, even the very ends of my hair that were usually a little rough.</li>
            <li> And for those saying it made their hair greasy, didn&#x27;t lather, etc-- clearly operator error.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s water clear, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried nearly every shampoo product from Denorex to Neutrogena T-gel and none of them</li>
            <li> Maybe my skin is just sensitive to the tea tree oil</li>
            <li> He likes how it leaves his hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It is natural with no harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I will use it occasionally to purify my scalp with tea tree oil, but I will not use it very often.</li>
            <li> It is also all natural which I why I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I miss soft manageable hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural herbal shampoo that would keep lice away from my hair and wanted to try this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I used to have a flaky itchy hair scalp but not since using it, nor have I had any lice and my hair is soft and fuller.  </li>
            <li> So seems it is all natural stuff..</li>
            <li> Speaking with my derm friend, he recommended I also look at [[ASIN:B0000535UA JASON Natural Cosmetics Shampoo, Tea Tree Oil Hair &amp; Scalp Therapy - 17.5 fl</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve managed to switch to a cocktail of both shampoos, using Jason Natural Tea Tree the majority of the week.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a natural remedy to cure my situation, not just mask it.  </li>
            <li> Old lady smell.</li>
            <li> and i can see the results my hair is so soft that i can&#x27;t believe</li>
            <li> but it shows it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> hair is smooth and does not feel dead.</li>
            <li> Even though it doesn&#x27;t stink of tar, it smells like old books.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft, adds volume and shinier.</li>
            <li> Gentle to use daily</li>
            <li> And I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;- is not harsh at all&lt;br</li>
            <li> But seeing as this shampoo is fairly reasonably priced, I don&#x27;t care enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Which, in this case, is JASON Natural Cosmetics Tea Tree Oil</li>
            <li> however, it completely stripped my hair.</li>
            <li> Head&amp;Shoulders was so so, T-Gel may as well have been a placebo, and even the actual Jason Dandruff line was good, but not GREAT like this.</li>
            <li> The smell is ok - not amazing.</li>
            <li> I had a healthy scalp for my whole life, but developed a dry and flaky scalp after having some health issues the past 2 years,</li>
            <li> I was suffering from itchy dry scalp and dermatitis over the winter resulting in some pretty epic dandruff.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give it 3 stars, is only because it prolongs the appearance of dandruff, which other shampoos have not been able to do for me.</li>
            <li> Did exactly what I needed it to-got rid of my dry itchy scalp, also have softer feeling hair.</li>
            <li> pretty bad u can only wear so many light colored shirts to avoid them showing up</li>
            <li> She says it makes her hair even softer and the shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell bad either, just a nice clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I typically use Burt&#x27;s Bees shampoo and love what it does for my hair, but not for my scalp (dry and itchy).</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair twice a week, and by day three my scalp would be particularly itchy with lots of flaking, even though I don&#x27;t use any product on my scalp or in my hair.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad with a little conditioner.</li>
            <li> It is a little more expensive than what you buy at Target, but it is worth it!!</li>
            <li> I thought itchy scalp was just something I had to live with until I tried a shampoo from Pytho that actually controlled the itching.  </li>
            <li> Really helps if you have a dry scalp and have dandruffs.  </li>
            <li> I have dry scalp and after much research, thought I would give this a try.</li>
            <li> But, it did absolutely nothing to reduce my dry scalp problem.</li>
            <li> When I do use it, maybe once or twice per week, it cleans my scalp very well, but doesn&#x27;t over dry my scalp.  </li>
            <li> So far the only natural shampoos that haven&#x27;t done that are the Desert Essence ones.</li>
            <li> I knew my root was the latter thanks to feedback from my stylist and the fact it comes only in the winter.</li>
            <li> It really takes out all of that other left behind stuff and gives a fresh clean feel to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this shampoo to anyone looking for an all natural alternative to the major brands.</li>
            <li> It actually makes your hair brighter and healthier looking, I was surprised  </li>
            <li> I ordered what is pictured on Amazon, Jason Natural Cosmetics Shampoo, Tea Tree Oil Hair and Scalp Therapy  with the bear on the blue bottle.</li>
            <li> 19 year old male</li>
            <li> However, I found it&#x27;s quite a bit more expensive on Amazon then the one I finally found at Whole Foods Stores.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure what happened here, but I noticed that after using this product my dandruff was even worse.</li>
            <li> It does seem thin and watery if you are accustomed shampoos with fillers trust me though this is much better for your hair.</li>
            <li> My teen has dry scalp issues and this stuff really helps.</li>
            <li> Hair feels very oily the next day, and after wash is very dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> On its own remember this is a natural product and does not contain the chemicals that common shampoos usually leave tons of build up on your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried many other products after this, even changing my lifestyle habits, going to the dermatologist and common natural remedies such as the Apple Cider Vinegar method.</li>
            <li> Finally, a shampoo that really does what it needs to!&lt;br /&gt;Purchased this by recommendation of a hairstylist friend to combat dandruff, especially in this dry area.</li>
            <li> (I am 45 year old male who never had acne as a teen!!).</li>
            <li> I save this for when I don&#x27;t have any social engagements on my calendar.</li>
            <li> I want to give this product a 5-star review, because so many people seem to like it, but as far as tea tree shampoos go, this one fails to provide what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena seem to perform better, while Jason performed worse than regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I will say that the first time I used this shampoo, my scalp felt like it was burning a little (I guess it was killing off the fungus in there).  </li>
            <li> I was at first elated, but then I went about my day and less than 12 hours later</li>
            <li> I read many of the reviews before purchasing, and was hoping to get a more natural shampoo that would help with my dandruff, but the shampoo barely lathered and then left my hair feeling completely disgusting.  </li>
            <li> I have to conclude it is pretty harsh if my skin reacts this way to it.  </li>
            <li> have VERY dry, itchy and flaky scalp, I used this shampoo and the very first time I saw it got rid of all the flakes that many other shampoos were unable to.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old has bouts with dry skin/dandruff.</li>
            <li> I still have an itchy scalp with a few hot spots that this shampoo did nothing for after a week of daily use.  </li>
            <li> Just works alright, smells funny, didnt really help or make my scalp worse.  </li>
            <li> some of them worked for a little while, but ultimately it only got worse until finally my mom researched into something more along the natural, organic line, and came across this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The slight tea tree scent is fabulous, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Advertised as scalp therapy and generally respected, I found that for me at least this shampoo did nothing positive for my hair.</li>
            <li> And it does lather, but not as much as &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; mass produced shampoo brands because it lacks all the empty filler ingredients that cause those other products to foam up.</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo for the first time night before last and am wearing my brushed black jacket, a previous no-no</li>
            <li> I tend to suffer from dry skin a lot, especially in the winter when the heat indoors comes on and ambient humidity is low.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first wash (I washed my hair twice, letting the shampoo sit on my head for at least 5 minutes before rinsing and rewashing)</li>
            <li> Seems to last a fairly long time.</li>
            <li> After trying other dandruff shampoo&#x27;s such as Head and Shoulders, Celsum Blue etc, Tea Tree oil was the next test.  </li>
            <li> I am now using homeopathic remedies on my itchy, dry scalp such as applying this:  </li>
            <li> It does not lather without putting a handful on my head and comes up very short of normalizing a dry, itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> but the idea of many natural products possessing an ugly odor needs to be put to rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sadly, I can tell I am going to go through the conditioner VERY quickly since it&#x27;s root-to-tip, so buy</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;d like to say I&#x27;ve been a victim of ‘chronic dry scalp’ (not an actual medical term).</li>
            <li> when i hit my teens is when my dandruff started up not bad at first but over the years it has gotten worse and worse especially when im under a lot of stress</li>
            <li> After using one full bottle, I saw dramatic improvement.</li>
            <li> As a result, my hair was left very dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to tell just how much you&#x27;re using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dandruff problems for a long time.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try Jason&#x27;s shampoo because I have had a long term problem with a scaly scalp.  </li>
            <li> was so long...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time sufferer of dandruff.  </li>
            <li> I used H&amp;S in the past, but I wanted something new.</li>
            <li> plain, old fashioned oatmeal in 6 cups boiling water for an hour.</li>
            <li> This shampoo did nothing for my severe dandruff that plain old head and shoulders couldn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> 6.7 fl oz)]]My hair looks fine, but by the end of the day I have an entire layer of residue on my scalp and it itches like crazy.</li>
            <li> However, it isn&#x27;t recommended you use the shampoo daily or every other day.</li>
            <li> Never buying that other blue gunk again when I can use Jason.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has been 2wks since I&#x27;ve last used the product (I&#x27;m due for a hair treatment, so I&#x27;ll be using the Jason&#x27;s Conditioner alongside the Shampoo)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has been 2wks since I&#x27;ve last used the product (I&#x27;m due for a hair treatment, so I&#x27;ll be using the Jason&#x27;s Conditioner alongside the Shampoo)</li>
            <li> It is highly disappointing, especially on the occasions I&#x27;ve used the shampoo and my dandruff returns with full force FOUR hours later.  </li>
            <li> Fail - Original formula:</li>
            <li> You can use this once a week to relieve dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I still have to comb out tangles and my hair feels dry.</li>
            <li> I have a dry, oily scalp.  </li>
            <li> I struggled for years with dry, flaky, scaly scalp.</li>
            <li> Helps with dry scalp</li>
            <li> I even use it in my hair when my scalp gets dry and prone to dandruff.  </li>
            <li> I am drawn to a tea tree oil type of shampoo for the smell and tingling, plus I was having issues with dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> Years ago a hairdresser told me not to use it that it will just dry out my scalp.</li>
            <li> Maybe the Jason shampoo was meant for dry hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so your scalp wont be so dry.</li>
            <li> Shampoo for Dry Hair and Flaking Scalp with Almond, Lavender and ant a shampoo</li>
            <li> I have dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I read somewhere that tea tree oil might be the solution for my ever dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> Tea tree oil treats dry scalp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since beginning use of this shampoo and conditioner system (about 2 months ago) my scalp has ceased being dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> It helps with dry scalp and doesn&#x27;t smell like you have dumped medicine on your head.</li>
            <li> Plus I was having personal issues using such harsh synthetic anti-fungal ingredients on my head.</li>
            <li> I definitely needed conditioner after, but when I dried my hair I could only see a few flakes (major improvement)</li>
            <li> Thanks to this product I have less dandruff during the winter and very little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to wash my hair every single day even when I didn&#x27;t work out</li>
            <li> I have been using it for around three months now and have not had a single problem since.  </li>
            <li> I was hopeful to get away from other products (Paul Mitchell, CREW, Designer) that contained many artificial contents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten LOTS of compliments about my \\&quot;beautiful\\&quot; hair which I never comb or brush because i&#x27;m too busy &amp; lazy to fix my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s completely gotten rid of my dandruff</li>
            <li> Spent a long time using head and shoulders, thinking that if this doesn&#x27;t work why should anything else?  </li>
            <li> I typically like Jason products, however, this shampoo left my hair extremely dry.</li>
            <li> I even strapped myself down and resisted scratching for two weeks despite the irritation from regular use of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> careful, though, the drawback is that it DOES sting and burn (because of the tea tree oil) when you leave it on very long.  </li>
            <li> it def takes care of my dry scalp, plus no dandruff!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, but Amazon is selling it for less than my local stores had it for anyway!</li>
            <li> tried Garnier Dandraff shampoo, Neutrogena T-Gel, Jason scalp therapy, and even some African black shampoo.  </li>
            <li> If the shampoo were outrageously expensive, I might try to find out exactly what ingredient does the trick and shop around for a cheaper shampoo with the same miraculous property.</li>
            <li> Shampoos like Head and Shoulders leave the rest of my hair feeling very dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I also need to add that after washing my hair, my hands are very dry and scaling.  </li>
            <li> has helped with the itch, as long as I use it every other shampooing.</li>
            <li> So bad that we went looking for better shampoo just for him.  </li>
            <li> just be careful.  </li>
            <li> All the dandruff shampoos left it greasy and limp.</li>
            <li> I decided to try, but it&#x27;s not working for me as I expected.</li>
            <li> , the scent of this shampoo is not very</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of products and spent a lot of money on things to help with my psoriasis and my eczema on my scalp.</li>
            <li> and I have used them 3 times weekly last few weeks.</li>
            <li> It reduced my itchiness, but not much.</li>
            <li> Still has some unpronouncable curious chemicals in it though.</li>
            <li> Wet hair and lather, massage onto scalp.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin (Herbal Essence gives me massive hives) and I was worried about this irritating my scalp as well.</li>
            <li> After using it, I rub a small amount of Giovanni leave-in conditioner into my short hair, and blow it dry.  </li>
            <li> By the next day my hair would be greasy and limp, unlike with other products.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old son had pretty bad dandruff issues.  </li>
            <li> Her scalp was less dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li> Dandruff is such a difficult thing to live with.</li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> Not sure why I decided to try something different.</li>
            <li> I might try other shampoos too since I don&#x27;t want his scalp getting used to it/accustomed to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Due to Lyme disease and MS, I&#x27;ve been on anti-biotics for over a year.</li>
            <li> Have used other products of theirs.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t/didn&#x27;t have an extreme case of oily scalp/hair or dandruff.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo when I feel like the other shampoos I&#x27;m using leave a residue.  </li>
            <li> I am looking out for other products now.</li>
            <li> Doesnt tingle like other brands.</li>
            <li> Other problems call for going with the solution you</li>
            <li> I am not sure of the cause of the smell but saw that others had tried this shampoo for the same readon, and it worked for them</li>
            <li> Kinda made my hair dry out a little but</li>
            <li> It does not leave my hair soft or shiny, and to top it off, the scent is terrible.</li>
            <li> It leaves my scalp less itchy and irritated than any other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Then again, Nizoral has been the only shampoo to work for me, but since it is SO hard to come by</li>
            <li> My only complaint is how drying it is on my hair even after I condition it</li>
            <li> I think this product is not worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I eventually came across this one and took a shot in the dark.</li>
            <li> Besides, whenever I try a different shampoo, I usually find that it does make my scalp itch after a couple of uses, and then I&#x27;m left with an entire bottle of useless shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> According to him Jason Natural has approximately 1%, although I haven&#x27;t read that on the bottle.</li>
            <li> And my scalp dryness and dandruff has come down</li>
            <li> If you have had a perm, keratin treatments or color treatments done to your hair, these ingredients will break them down, and the $200+ treatment you paid for is down the drain.  </li>
            <li> I never use any other!</li>
            <li> (only took a few days!!)</li>
            <li> i can not highly recommend this enough if you are like i was and tired of fighting the flake war</li>
            <li> This works well over the other shampoo but difference is really narrow.</li>
            <li> After washing my hair with this shampoo, I expected my dry scalp to at least improve a little</li>
            <li> The price here on amazon is half of what they sell in the stores.     </li>
            <li> I have less flakes</li>
            <li> There are much less flakes</li>
            <li> Would give half a star if i could.</li>
            <li> Less itch, less dandruff</li>
            <li> have now used the product over 10 times since I received it, but my dandruff is never gone for longer than half a day.</li>
            <li> It seems to less tea tree oil in this one than Nature&#x27;s gate.</li>
            <li> My head is less oily, less dandruff, and less pimples.  </li>
            <li> Less Dandruff, less pimples,</li>
            <li> less oil&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Now for the down side, I have long, dyed, thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> If I can&#x27;t even feel a little tingle, there&#x27;s no WAY it&#x27;s helping my dandruff.  </li>
            <li> I still have a couple little itchy spots and I haven&#x27;t attempted to skip a day of washing just yet,</li>
            <li> However, it is a little on the &amp;#34;runny&amp;#34; side for shampoo and may leave a little &amp;#34;dustiness&amp;#34; to your hair.  </li>
            <li> Based on what I saw before purchasing I expected the smell to be very potent and ‘nasty’ to say the least.</li>
            <li> it had help for a little bit</li>
            <li> and it worked no better for me than any other shampoo for dandruff.  </li>
            <li> Scalp has a little acene problems.</li>
            <li> One day, I was randomly messaging my scalp when I felt a bunch of little lumps, on further investigation I found out that they were scabs from scratching my itchy dry head so often, also making it look like it was snowing.</li>
            <li> Only way it holds it back is by washing with ld cold water in the morning</li>
            <li> I also like how few ingredients are in this shampoo.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It actually left the scalp even worse with a lot of build up.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> One or two days missing it, and you start all over again with snowfall around the head.  </li>
            <li> I got was Jason&#x27;s  treatment shampoo---also with tea tree---in a green bottle</li>
            <li> To get free shipping from drug store.com, I bought 4 (like an Idiot).</li>
            <li> My itching got worse after 2 bottles and after the thrid I was develpoing white heads leading to painfull acne in the hair line around my neck</li>
            <li> I even went to a dermatologist for my trouble</li>
            <li> Waste of $.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> BUT..it definitely dried my scalp out.</li>
            <li> like to address a few things i have seen mentioned</li>
            <li> that i saw someone mention im guessing they were heavy smokers or something</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with an itchy scalp</li>
            <li> I even added 100% concentrated tea tree oil in my shampoo and a few drops on my scalp before washing with this shampoo, all with no results.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo a few months ago</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t used it every day because I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday.  </li>
            <li> I use this a few times a month to help cleanse and condition my hair/scalp from build of styling products and blow drying.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> but I was confused on the bottle since it came with another label different from what was shown a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product as it has not really helped my itchy (non-dandruff), dry scalp from sensitive skin, being diabetic and over-coloring.  </li>
            <li> I have some dandruff and tryed using other shampoos with no luck, just dull lifeless hair.</li>
            <li> Her scalp was itchy due to sweating and her hair is so thick.</li>
            <li> It cleans hair, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my dandruff at all, made for rather unpleasant feeling hair later in the day, and at the same time smells like chemicals or dog shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had pretty bad dandruff for years.  </li>
            <li> My daughter had a pretty bad case of craddle cap.  </li>
            <li> cause it has been itching a little lately..</li>
            <li> Too bad, I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li> I needed to be able to brush my hair without horrible tangles</li>
            <li> Since the products at salons are usually overpriced, i thought of giving a try at amazon..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it just makes my hair attract dust, if it&#x27;s shampoo residue.  </li>
            <li> only reason that I haven&#x27;t given this five stars is because it&#x27;s a bit expensive for my budget.</li>
            <li> Well - Compared to the usual chemical based shampoos</li>
            <li> Contains too small amount of Tea Tree Oil to have any effect on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> The reason I gave it 3 stars is that I am not sure it is working for me.</li>
            <li> no more dandruff, itching or excessive oil production.</li>
            <li> so I usually break out in hives - but no problems with this.</li>
            <li> No flakes that fall, but my head is covered with it and usually itchy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Not sure I like the scent</li>
            <li> so there is no magic cure all for it</li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter has had a really bad smell coming from her scalp for a few months.  </li>
            <li> And the flaking has at least halved, if not more.</li>
            <li> This works just as well as Selsun Blue name brand and other generic equivalents that have a nasty chemical-like smell.</li>
            <li> and I was getting tired of it because the dandruff would concentrate around my half line.</li>
            <li> negative reaction to one product from Jason also does not mean that their other products are bad!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it is hard for a vendor to match what is ordered to what comes in the mail.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations, but was sadly disappointed.</li>
            <li> As a teacher who is around several children daily I needed protection from those nasty little things nobody likes to talk about.</li>
            <li> Leave in hair at least 10 minutes before washing out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely disappointing, especially when you&#x27;re paying $10 a bottle.    </li>
            <li> Plus, you would think it would at least tingle a bit, with it smelling like Raid and all, but</li>
            <li> derm friend said any shampoo with at least 1% tea tree concentration should help control seborrhea dermatitis.</li>
            <li> This shampoo just simply made my head itch like crazy.</li>
            <li> I complained and got a refund</li>
            <li> at least 7days after</li>
            <li> at least 10days after the wash.</li>
            <li> at least 7days after</li>
            <li> at least 10days after the wash.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended a regimen with expensive salon products that actually made it worse.</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders really sucks compared to the Jason brand.</li>
            <li> I have had dandruff issues as of late, and thought I would give this stuff a try</li>
            <li> washed a 2nd time and rinsed like crazy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Use at least three times each week.</li>
            <li> after using other dandruff shampoos and rinsing like crazy about as soon as my hair dried</li>
            <li> I have slightly oily hair, and a dry scalp, and I can&#x27;t say I have ever itched as badly as after using this product.  </li>
            <li> Then I tried a bunch of other random shampoos to no avail.  </li>
            <li> ( i mean for one day), just to give a break and mix things up.  </li>
            <li> Bottle seemed like it was open because it was all soapy and messy when I got it out of the package :(</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo to get away from all the bad stuff that is put into the major brand shampoos.  </li>
            <li> but the experience has left a bad feeling with me.  </li>
            <li> My hair has been relaxed for over a decade and it was in my teen years that I started experiencing ugly flaking.</li>
            <li> Not good for my hair type.</li>
            <li> Even after using gobs and gobs of conditioner, my hair is still dry and VERY difficult to brush.</li>
            <li> The worst part was that after a few days my scalp became extremely itchy and dried out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry but this product which is not as all natural as it claims (see other reviews, or the ingredients list) is just awful.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this did nothing for my scalp and hardly even works as a shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have had it horrible the last few months and found this product.</li>
            <li> My scalp itch and dandruff got 10x worse when using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with Amazon and will never buy another Jason&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely decreased it.</li>
            <li> So not happy two ways, but not going to pay postage to return it.</li>
            <li> I think my scalp dryness got worse...</li>
            <li> the worse it is for you IMHO.</li>
            <li> I thin</li>
            <li> but if you are using medicated shampoos already you probably have smelled worse.</li>
            <li> My dandruff seemed to get worse with it.</li>
            <li> brand makes false claims in that they claim to be \\&quot;SLS\\</li>
            <li> not so much a dramatic change.&lt;br</li>
            <li> not so much a dramatic change.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I gave in to the temptation and scratched away, leaving snow behind.</li>
            <li> and I bought it, despite how expensive it was.</li>
            <li> Though not a perfect cure-all, I would recommend this over Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> Most of them smelled terrible, cost a fortune and did terrible things to my hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately that shampoo was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m, unfortunately, wary of Jason products now.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the supposed anti-dandruff effects does not work on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though unlikely, please note that your mileage may vary, and this product might not be the one for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Give this shampoo a try, and if you meet my unfortunate event, then please do give that conditioner a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed since this was not a cheap purchase.</li>
            <li> Once December hits every year my head itches like crazy.</li>
            <li> I had been having terrible trouble with my scalp.  </li>
            <li> It usually takes my hair a week (5days) to surprise me with a nasty surplus of dandruff; this was not the case.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> THEY CHANGED THE FORMULA!  I used to LOVE this and I bought it, despite how expensive it was. Too bad it was so drying and nothing like it was before (cleansing and yet so moisturizing). I knew why when I looked at the ingredients. They had changed. Still charging the same price but using cheaper ingredients. Good way to make money, too bad it&#x27;s also a good way to lose customers.</li>
            <li> Really helps my itchy scalp!</li>
            <li> This and the conditioner had helped with the itching and flakes tremendously</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried nearly every shampoo product from Denorex to Neutrogena T-gel and none of them have helped my dandruff go away. I decided to try something new this time and my dandruff improved noticeably within a week. This stuff is amazing and it&#x27;s replaced all my other dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li> my husband won&#x27;t use anything else</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo to help me with my dandruff since I heard that tea tree oil can help. Well I didn&#x27;t see any difference after using this. Maybe this stuff isn&#x27;t strong enough, I don&#x27;t know. But this is pretty good for a normal shampoo. The price here on amazon is half of what they sell in the stores.     I also like how few ingredients are in this shampoo. Before buying I read that some people didn&#x27;t like the smell. I think it has a nice subtle smell too it. I&#x27;ll probably buy it again.    It doesn&#x27;t lather too well the first time, but if you rinse and repeat, it will lather up well the second time.</li>
            <li> I will say that the first time I used this shampoo, my scalp felt like it was burning a little (I guess it was killing off the fungus in there).  It does seem to control dandruff to a large extent.  I won&#x27;t say that any shampoo can get rid of dandruff 100% as that is impossible.  And different people have different causes of dandruff, so this product may not work for everybody.  There is the ingredient sodium benzoate in there.. just be careful.  If you&#x27;re like me and sometimes use vitamin C showers to conteract the chlorine in there, then vitamin C can interact with the sodium benzoate to form benzene - a carcinogen.  Sozdium benzoate also has anti-fungal and anti-bacterial properties like tree oil.</li>
            <li> For me, this product does the opposite of what it says.  My scalp itch and dandruff got 10x worse when using this shampoo.  I stuck with it for 2 weeks thinking that maybe the itch was just my scalp getting used to the shampoo but I had to give up when my scalp itch became unbearable and dandruff got much worse than just using a cheap off the shelf dandruff shampoo.  Maybe my skin is just sensitive to the tea tree oil or I&#x27;m allergic to it, I don&#x27;t know: so maybe it works for others but I had to rate it for me personally.  If this happened to me, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll happen to others.  I have to conclude it is pretty harsh if my skin reacts this way to it.  I&#x27;ve never reacted this way to other dandruff shampoos and I&#x27;ve tried many.  Be careful!</li>
            <li> I ran out of Thursday Plantation tea tree/sulphur shampoo. I live overseas now, so I tried switching to this which I can find at the commissary.  [[ASIN:B000DINFSI Thursday Plantation Tea Tree Deep Scalp Cleansing Shampoo (6.7 fl oz)]]My hair looks fine, but by the end of the day I have an entire layer of residue on my scalp and it itches like crazy. I&#x27;m tempted to throw it away.</li>
            <li> so so so helped my extended family alleviate the troubles of lice, the bugs do not like the tea tree smell</li>
            <li> I have smelled cat and dog shampoo that smells better than this, returned it right away, was leaking in the box too.</li>
            <li> This is my son&#x27;s favorite shampoo.  He&#x27;s been using it for 8 years.  He likes how it leaves his hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Shampoo works great. Real good wonders for your hair. The shampoo does everything it says its going to do 5 five stars all around.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this product after reading some reviews about the shampoo burning. I have extremely sensitive skin (Herbal Essence gives me massive hives) and I was worried about this irritating my scalp as well. Once December hits every year my head itches like crazy. Shampoos like Head and Shoulders leave the rest of my hair feeling very dry and brittle. My hair feels and smells great!</li>
            <li> I have a drier, itchy scalp and need Tea Tree Shampoo to aleviate this condition. I was hopeful to get away from other products (Paul Mitchell, CREW, Designer) that contained many artificial contents. Jason&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work as well for me as some of these others I mentioned.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this by saying I have never reviewed a product online before.  I was so impressed with the Jason Tea Tree Shampoo that I had to share my experience.  I have had pretty bad dandruff for years.  I tried Head &amp; Shoulders and Selson and neither worked.  Then I tried a bunch of other random shampoos to no avail.  I read some reviews on the Jason Tea Tree Shampoo and tried it.  My Dandruff was literally gone after the first use.  I have used it for 3 days and have NO dandruff.  I can not believe how well this product works.  I HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product as it has not really helped my itchy (non-dandruff), dry scalp from sensitive skin, being diabetic and over-coloring.  I have not found this to be any sort of real scalp therapy that works.  It is a nice light shampoo, smells pretty good even though there is tea tree oil in it, but it does not work as advertised.  I am now using homeopathic remedies on my itchy, dry scalp such as applying this:  Simmer 12 tbsp. plain, old fashioned oatmeal in 6 cups boiling water for an hour. Strain oatmeal, reserving the cooking water to which you then add 5 drops rosemary and 5 drops lavender oil. I have also substituted warm virgin olive oil for those two oils, and mixed 1/2 C. of the reserved oatmeal water with 6 Tbs. apple cider vinegar.  Allow mixture to cool before applying to scalp. Leave in hair at least 10 minutes before washing out. You can use this once a week to relieve dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I just picked up my first bottle of this shampoo in the store, and couldn&#x27;t wait to buy more on Amazon. I had a healthy scalp for my whole life, but developed a dry and flaky scalp after having some health issues the past 2 years, don&#x27;t know if the 2 are related. I tried everything, all of the over the counter dandruff shampoos. Nothing worked. This shampoo was going to be the last thing I tried before looking into a prescription, and after only one shampooing I could see the difference! Another thing is that even though my scalp was dry, I had baby fine straight oily hair. All the dandruff shampoos left it greasy and limp. This shampoo leaves my hair shiny and full of volume. I don&#x27;t know how it would work for those of you with curly hair, but it is the best shampoo for me!  As a side note, reading one of the reviews someone mentioned that it could deter head lice. I work with young children and have avoided catching lice so far. Does any know if this could actually prevent the spread of head lice? Thanks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome! I love it. It keeps my hair smooth and it keeps me from scratching at it. Not to mention no white flakes! It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo.  There is no buildup and it def takes care of my dry scalp, plus no dandruff!  It is natural with no harmful chemicals.  I love this shampoo.  My husband and I both use it.  My hair looks and feels really healthy and has a very nice shine.  Diet also has something to do with it, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works as a cleanser, but it doesn&#x27;t smell good, leaves my hair feeling dry with a very slight filminess that will likely build up over time. I will use it occasionally to purify my scalp with tea tree oil, but I will not use it very often.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be great. It makes my hair and scalp feel very good.  It is also all natural which I why I purchased it. No lauryl sulfates!</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping that the tea tree would help stop the dandruff and stop the flaking on my scalp...it didn&#x27;t.  It also left my hair tangled after washing.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shampoos for dandruff and itchy scalp. I have only used it for a couple of weeks and it has helped me a great deal. I recommend it highly after trying so many others and even more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I want to give this product a 5-star review, because so many people seem to like it, but as far as tea tree shampoos go, this one fails to provide what I wanted.  I really like one that provides a good tingle as another reviewer said... and it just falls extremely short on that.  If I can&#x27;t even feel a little tingle, there&#x27;s no WAY it&#x27;s helping my dandruff.  That&#x27;s what I got it for- years ago when I was a kid, my mother bought a very strong tea tree shampoo.  JUST tea tree.  Now it seems no matter where I look I just can&#x27;t find a shampoo with that same potency.  It&#x27;s extremely disappointing, especially when you&#x27;re paying $10 a bottle.    Another Jason product, the dandruff relief one, is helping somewhat, but it also only has slightly more potency when it comes to tea tree and so... the search goes on.    Sigh.</li>
            <li> I am going to start out by saying that this product did work miracles on my scalp. One day, I was randomly messaging my scalp when I felt a bunch of little lumps, on further investigation I found out that they were scabs from scratching my itchy dry head so often, also making it look like it was snowing. I used head and shoulders and pert plus dandruff shampoos but they did not help, my head still itched and flaked. After some research, I found this product which was recommended as the top dandruff shampoo. After the first time I used it, I noticed a huge difference in head itchiness and within a week I could scratch my head and NOTHING would come off! Yipee! Now for the down side, I have long, dyed, thick, wavy hair and this product dries my hair out so badly that it feels like straw. Even after using gobs and gobs of conditioner, my hair is still dry and VERY difficult to brush. I am still using this product after two months but am not sure that I will buy more when the bottle runs out. I miss soft manageable hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have decided that I will not buy this product again. I needed to be able to brush my hair without horrible tangles and I could not do it while using this. Too bad, I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li> I had bad itchy scalp until I started using Jason Tea Tree Shampoo! I never use any other! The best!</li>
            <li> I have a dry, itchy scalp, and this Jason shampoo is absolutely wonderful!  After using it, I rub a small amount of Giovanni leave-in conditioner into my short hair, and blow it dry.  Easy!</li>
            <li> Primera aplicaci&amp;oacute;n - Compr&amp;eacute; este champ&amp;uacute; por problemas de resequedad en mi cuero cabelludo, solo lo he usado una vez y ha mejorado notablemente la resequedad, creo que la mejor&amp;iacute;a se notar&amp;aacute; mucho m&amp;aacute;s despu&amp;eacute;s de varias aplicaciones, solo puedo decir que ha resultado como esperaba. Lo recomiendo</li>
            <li> I typically use Burt&#x27;s Bees shampoo and love what it does for my hair, but not for my scalp (dry and itchy). I purchased this shampoo to use on occasion to prevent the itchy scalp it seems to cause. Plus, I love the refreshing tingle of tea tree shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say, I honestly felt like I was being dipped for fleas the first time I used this product. It has a horrible chemical odor...EXACTLY like pesticide. I tried a few more times to stomach it, but just can&#x27;t do it. Plus, you would think it would at least tingle a bit, with it smelling like Raid and all, but nope; NADA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you are looking for a shampoo that is organic with no SLS...READ THE LABEL! This product is not what it is marketed to be.</li>
            <li> Bottle seemed like it was open because it was all soapy and messy when I got it out of the package :(</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product to eliminate my dandruff. The first time I used it, I used only a quarter-sized amount of the shampoo twice, and I still had my dandruff. THe next time I used the shampoo, I used more than half a dollar-sized amount, nothing. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells terrible.  It also seems to make my scalp even more itchy.  I will go back to using the Body Shop&#x27;s Ginger Scalp Care which has worked well for me and smells great.  Not sure why I decided to try something different.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural herbal shampoo that would keep lice away from my hair and wanted to try this shampoo.  I used to have a flaky itchy hair scalp but not since using it, nor have I had any lice and my hair is soft and fuller.  I&#x27;ve gotten LOTS of compliments about my \\&quot;beautiful\\&quot; hair which I never comb or brush because i&#x27;m too busy &amp; lazy to fix my hair.  It smells kind of mediciny (because of the tea tree oil) and very liquidy so I mix it with a nice fragrance shampoo like pomegranate, berry, etc or fragrant shower gel with a ratio of 1:2 or 1:3 of jason shampoo to other shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RUB IT WELL into even the deepest parts of my hair and onto my scalp and LEAVE IT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE in my hair while bathing for the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful, though, the drawback is that it DOES sting and burn (because of the tea tree oil) when you leave it on very long.  Oh well.....no pain, no gain!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product even if it does sting.</li>
            <li> Works well to gradually relieve itch and flaking. The mild scent is also pleasant, kind of like eucalyptus. Though not a perfect cure-all, I would recommend this over Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> My everyday shampoo, natural, smells good</li>
            <li> I loved this product. It gives hair body and shine, with no build up.  As a teacher who is around several children daily I needed protection from those nasty little things nobody likes to talk about. HEAD LICE.  The only reason I rated it four stars is because it doesn&#x27;t smell great.  But I can deal with it.</li>
            <li> Really helps if you have a dry scalp and have dandruffs.  The folks at my salon used to always recommend tea tree shampoos.  Since the products at salons are usually overpriced, i thought of giving a try at amazon.. Jason brand seems to be good. It has a strong, but good herbal smell. So seems it is all natural stuff.. And my scalp dryness and dandruff has come down</li>
            <li> I am a big proponent of tea tree oil since I have suffered from a skin condition I developed in the military.  The problem is that  many of the products that claim to contain tea tree oil are too expensive or they are ineffective.  I have used the shampoo for several weeks and I haven&#x27;t seen any flaking.  The price was more reasonable than the medicated shampoos offered by retailers. I will definitely re-order. Extremely effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dandruff problems for a long time. For two years I&#x27;ve had flaking skin, red scaling and an itchy scalp. Dandruff is such a difficult thing to live with. It is embarrassing and a hassle to take care of. I wrote this review in the hope people who have problems with dandruff may find some useful information in my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became friends with a dermatology student at UNC-CH School of Medicine. He spoke with me extensively about my dandruff problems and recommended [[ASIN:B0000Y3CRY Nizoral A-D Shampoo - 4 oz]]. This worked wonders for me, eliminated my scalp problems. However, it isn&#x27;t recommended you use the shampoo daily or every other day. Plus I was having personal issues using such harsh synthetic anti-fungal ingredients on my head. Speaking with my derm friend, he recommended I also look at [[ASIN:B0000535UA JASON Natural Cosmetics Shampoo, Tea Tree Oil Hair &amp; Scalp Therapy - 17.5 fl oz]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why this particular brand of tea tree shampoo?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My derm friend said any shampoo with at least 1% tea tree concentration should help control seborrhea dermatitis. He said not all tea tree shampoos are the same, some contain negligible amounts of tea tree oil. According to him Jason Natural has approximately 1%, although I haven&#x27;t read that on the bottle. He also instructed me to leave it on for about 3-5 minutes. Shorter than three minutes minimizes absorption into the skin and reduces beneficial effects of the tea tree oil. I&#x27;ve managed to switch to a cocktail of both shampoos, using Jason Natural Tea Tree the majority of the week. I&#x27;m happy this shampoo controls my dandruff and doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of unnatural/harsh products. Jason Natural Tea Tree alone might be enough if you have mild dandruff, but for my severe case I have to use Jason Natural Tea Tree with Nizoral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this was helpful.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for cleaning the scalp and if you have dandruff problems it works wonders. My only complaint is how drying it is on my hair even after I condition it I still have to comb out tangles and my hair feels dry. Make sure you use a deep conditioner after using this I do have really long hair maybe someone with shorter hair will have better results I would buy this again though it&#x27;s the best dandruff shampoo I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This shampoo did not work for dandruff at all. It actually left the scalp even worse with a lot of build up. Using just a regular shampoo and adding tea tree oil worked so much better.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this product I have less dandruff during the winter and very little if any during the summer.  I used to use neutragena T gel but found it had too much chemicals in it for my taste so I found Jason and have been happy to admit it does work for me. It maynot work for everybody. I do encourage everyone to explore there options first and find that organic shampoo you need to keep your scalp looking good.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for my boyfriend because he has itchy dandruff. He noticed that his dandruff has improved significantly. He is pleased with the shampoo. I will be buying more when he runs out! :) I might try other shampoos too since I don&#x27;t want his scalp getting used to it/accustomed to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The shampoo does work, but the problem is his head has gotten used to the shampoo and does not work as well anymore. So I really do recommend you buying more than one dandruff shampoo and alternate after maybe a month or every two weeks? Really depends on your preference! Hope everyone becomes dandruff free! :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a more natural shampoo that fights dandruff and I finally found it.  Jason Natural Shampoo works great.  I have less flakes and I love the scent.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this shampoo to work.  I have a dry, oily scalp.  I used this shampoo for several days in hopes it would \\&quot;normalize\\&quot; my scalp.  As a result, my hair was left very dry and frizzy.  The worst part was that after a few days my scalp became extremely itchy and dried out.  Brushing my hair produced massive amounts of dandruff.  I actually started using the shampoo on my feet to cure my athletes feet.  I guess the shampoo has anti-fungal properties.  I would suggest using Joico Daily Care Treatment Shampoo instead.  It isn&#x27;t a silver bullet for my problem, but it has been the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  Flakes flying everywhere.  Only way it holds it back is by washing with ld cold water in the morning (oh, did I say that the #1 ingredient is water?), and then again when you get home from work, and do this every day.  Life isn&#x27;t fun with dandruff, and there&#x27;s too many false treatments (vinegar, really?  Ha, now way),  It&#x27;s inexpensive, so makes it worth the time, but I&#x27;m going to move to nizoral to find out if there is something else out there that may work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These non detergent (SLS) aren&#x27;t going to cure it, just keep it at bay with the so called &amp;#34;Tea Tree&amp;#34;.  One or two days missing it, and you start all over again with snowfall around the head.  The best treatment was at a spa with a scalp treatment, and swimming in the salty water of the carribean on vacation.</li>
            <li> Due to Lyme disease and MS, I&#x27;ve been on anti-biotics for over a year. It&#x27;s causing my scalp to get horribly flaky. This shampoo worked the first time - stopped the flakes completely. Smells like pine tar but not overly strong and once my hair dried the smell vanished. Nice to get another great product from Jason!</li>
            <li> I have been using Tea Tree Oil shampoo for about 3 years and my dandruff is cured.    It actually makes your hair brighter and healthier looking, I was surprised  I noticed being a Guy who used any shampoo before.    This is a Quality Product and worth the money.</li>
            <li> No, I would not recommend this product. I wish I had never purchased it. After washing my hair with this shampoo, I expected my dry scalp to at least improve a little but that&#x27;s not what happened. This shampoo just simply made my head itch like crazy.</li>
            <li> This product was advertised as sulfate free but it is not.  Laurel sulfate is listed on the product ingredients.  I am allergic to sulfates a and had a horrible allergic reaction that resulted in a visit to my doctor.  I complained and got a refund but the experience has left a bad feeling with me.  Not happy with Amazon and will never buy another Jason&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> It is not a miraculous fix to my problem, but I can see that it is helping.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple shampoos for seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp. Most of them smelled terrible, cost a fortune and did terrible things to my hair. This shampoo has been the best thing for my scalp I have tried in 20 years of struggling with scalp problems. It smells great, lathers and cleans well, and is very cost effective. My hair dresser has even commented on how healthy my scalp is. I love that it is an organic shampoo without all the harsh chemicals most seborrhea shampoos have. I have recommended it to several people wiht and without scalp issues and everyone loves the clean feeling and great smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why anyone would want to use this product. I have used industrial strength automotive cleaning products that have a better fragrance. Absolutely disgusting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having problems with flaky hair for a while and nothing worked until I tried this. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s completely gotten rid of my dandruff but it&#x27;s definitely decreased it. Plus it made my hair softer and shinier. I&#x27;m not so fond of the smell but it&#x27;s not bad with a little conditioner. I think it&#x27;s a bit pricy but it&#x27;s worth if only to get rid of the dandruff problem.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with folliculitis of the scalp a couple years ago because I didn&#x27;t wash my hair often enough directly following workouts.  The sweat bacteria infected my hair follicles and it won&#x27;t go away.  I&#x27;ve had to wash my hair every single day even when I didn&#x27;t work out and it was still a problem.  I was searching for a natural remedy to cure my situation, not just mask it.  I have used this shampoo now for 2 weeks and I haven&#x27;t felt this good in so long!!  I still have a couple little itchy spots and I haven&#x27;t attempted to skip a day of washing just yet, but I don&#x27;t sit at my desk at work all day scratching my head anymore!  It has been a tough 2 years and a lot of people online say the folliculitis never goes away once you get it, but I think I have found my miracle!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect shampoo for my daughter. I will buy nothing else for her! I would recommend this product to any and eveyone.</li>
            <li> Okay, I have been using this shampoo for about a month 2 times a week, so i believe I am in a pretty good place to write a somewhat accurate review.&lt;br /&gt;I have VERY dry, itchy and flaky scalp, I used this shampoo and the very first time I saw it got rid of all the flakes that many other shampoos were unable to. Now, it seems like my scalp is somehow creating resistance to the product cause it has been itching a little lately.. So I might have to use it like 3 times a week or something.. Umm another thing, it doesn&#x27;t lather a lot, so I get tempted to use a lot of product which might be what is causing the itchiness, so just be aware that it will do its magic even if you feel it doesnt make enough bubbles lol, the second time it gets more normal. So yeah, I recommend</li>
            <li> Firsty I&#x27;d like to say pay no attention to the people rating the product low! Use the product as recommended at its the best! Tea tree always has a certain zing feeling on you skin and scalp but this product is very mild! You&#x27;ll be impressed!</li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter has had a really bad smell coming from her scalp for a few months.  My husband and I thought she wasn&#x27;t washing her hair good enough and had really been on her about doing a better job.  But after washing it twice myself, I realized something else was going on.  We tried three different shampoos and none of it mattered.  Then, I looked up on the internet and discovered that she might have some kind of fungal problem.  So I ordered this shampoo after reading a recommendation for it.  My daughter has now used it three times.  After the first time, the smell was completely gone!  My daughter was so happy and couldn&#x27;t thank me enough.  She says it makes her hair even softer and the shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell bad either, just a nice clean fragrance.  So happy that we found this product!</li>
            <li> Have used other products of theirs.  Like the gentleness and the smell does not bug my kids.  It has worked at keeping my kids bug free so consider it a success.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really help dandruff/dry scalp. Old lady smell.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old son had pretty bad dandruff issues.  So bad that we went looking for better shampoo just for him.  He had been using the Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo in our shower but that didn&#x27;t help any.  Found some website where this Jason tea tree shampoo was highly rated so we bought it to give it a shot.  All I can say is that it worked great for him; the dandruff issue literally went away once he started using this shampoo.  I&#x27;m sold on it now.</li>
            <li> It takes a while for this shampoo to lather, but it does lather. For the time I was using it, it helped improve my dandruff and my oily scalp, but mind you I don&#x27;t/didn&#x27;t have an extreme case of oily scalp/hair or dandruff. It worked for a while, but my suggestion is to find another shampoo and a decent conditioner too so that your scalp won&#x27;t get used to one shampoo/conditioner and become immune to its effects.</li>
            <li> I had an itchy scalp condition and tried this, as well as the tea tree conditioner. It seems to keep my scalp calm and is the only thing I use. Have tried other products but like this the best. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this product. it leaves my hair so nice so happy. I started to use it the last week and i can see the results my hair is so soft that i can&#x27;t believe.. best product</li>
            <li> This is by far the best natural shampoo I&#x27;ve used. I have some dandruff and tryed using other shampoos with no luck, just dull lifeless hair. After using Jason&#x27;s for just 2 days I feel a difference in manageability, shine, softness and not to mention clean and fresh! There are much less flakes and I feel like I won&#x27;t have to wash my hair as often as I did before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just ordered the aloe vera conditioner, Worth a shot!!</li>
            <li> Finally, a shampoo that really does what it needs to!&lt;br /&gt;Purchased this by recommendation of a hairstylist friend to combat dandruff, especially in this dry area. Day 1, the flakes were gone! It smells absolutely divine - it does take all of the greasy feelings (and oils) out of your hair, it feels amazingly clean! Definitely recommend to anyone that has dandruff, dry scalp, itching, or is just looking for a great shampoo to treat their hair right. This is it!</li>
            <li> I used this for a couple of days. Now my head is flaky and itchy. My scalp psoriasis has come back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this shampoo in Mom&#x27;s grocery stores, but they are almost always cheaper online.  It has a gentler formula than let&#x27;s say selsun blue.  It also has a &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; smell.  It does not smell like tea or mint.  However, it is a little on the &amp;#34;runny&amp;#34; side for shampoo and may leave a little &amp;#34;dustiness&amp;#34; to your hair.  I&#x27;m not sure if it just makes my hair attract dust, if it&#x27;s shampoo residue.  It&#x27;s not noticeable unless you examine your hair under a microscope - which i do.</li>
            <li> this is an excellent shampoo!  Makes your hair and scalp feel clean!  Works well with an extra dash of tea tree oil added to it.  Seems to last a fairly long time.</li>
            <li> I think this product is not worth the price in my opinion. I would recommend Organix Australian Tea Tree Oil Shampoo over this any day.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t tingle whatsoever or feel like there is much tea tree in it, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking that good. Won&#x27; buy again. Nature&#x27;s Gate or Paul Mitchell are both 1,000 times better.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tea tree shampoo. I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, but Amazon is selling it for less than my local stores had it for anyway! Bummed that it&#x27;s an add-on item, so I had to wait until I needed something else to order it.</li>
            <li> This has done nothing but make my hair very oil and it doesn&#x27;t leave a very nice after smell.  My hair smells oily too!  It also takes a lot of the shampoo to work up a good lather.</li>
            <li> This got rid of my dandruff within 2 weeks, and my scalp still improved after three and four weeks after starting this shampooing regimen. I use it mostly every day and I massage it in, let it set for a bit, and wash it out after 2-3 minutes. Sometimes I can feel it tingle, I massage once more and it cleans well without drying my hair out. This works just as well as Selsun Blue name brand and other generic equivalents that have a nasty chemical-like smell. This smells refreshing and is natural. Never buying that other blue gunk again when I can use Jason.</li>
            <li> I have a very oily scalp, and since I went vegan a few years ago, this has been the only shampoo I&#x27;ve found that actually takes care of the problem. There are number of positives: it&#x27;s vegan (no animal testing or products), it tingles on your scalp (so you can tell you&#x27;ve gotten everywhere!), and it smells nice. I use this about once or twice a week in place of my regular shampoo, and it leaves my scalp feeling great for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason that I haven&#x27;t given this five stars is because it&#x27;s a bit expensive for my budget.</li>
            <li> Stopped my itchy scalp :-) The smell is nice enough, cleans well, leaves my hair soft and it came fast. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I ordered what is pictured on Amazon, Jason Natural Cosmetics Shampoo, Tea Tree Oil Hair and Scalp Therapy  with the bear on the blue bottle. I checked my order to make sure it was exactly that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I got was Jason&#x27;s  treatment shampoo---also with tea tree---in a green bottle and though it says on the front label that there is no SLS, in the list of ingredients it says sodium lauryl sulfoacetate, third ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So not happy two ways, but not going to pay postage to return it. Would not buy from this vendor again. I don&#x27;t know why it is hard for a vendor to match what is ordered to what comes in the mail.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I’ve start using the shampoo and lotion about two weeks ago and I already see the improvement.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I herd a lot about this product on internet. I decided to try, but it&#x27;s not working for me as I expected.</li>
            <li> I think Jason&#x27;s been smoking too much whacky tobaccy.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff should never have made through product testing. It doesn&#x27;t lather, it SUPER drying, and leaves hair feeling brittle and scalp feeling dry and itchy. The only positive is the scent.&lt;br /&gt;I get that it&#x27;s all natural, but it still has to function as a shampoo people!</li>
            <li> I struggled for years with dry, flaky, scaly scalp. I&#x27;ve tried many remedies. None could sustain any improvement. However, I have now used 3 bottles of this Jason Tea Tree Oil shampoo. After using one full bottle, I saw dramatic improvement. It does take some time, but I now swear by this product. If you have stubborn scalp issues, I highly recommend this product. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells fantastic. I dont love the consistency of it. I find it runny and it uses a lot and doesn&#x27;t suds up very well.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is just awful. It takes 3 times as much to clean my hair - a handful isn&#x27;t enough. It does not leave my hair soft or shiny, and to top it off, the scent is terrible. It smells like dog flea shampoo.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my grandson. He likes it better than some of the other brands as it does not burn his scalp. This is the second bottle I have purchased and we continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo. Helps with dry scalp</li>
            <li> I have to use a lot of it to get a good lather in my hair.  The smell is okay and it seems to get my hair nice and clean without frizz.</li>
            <li> I was suffering from itchy dry scalp and dermatitis over the winter resulting in some pretty epic dandruff. This shampoo came highly recommended and I really wanted to use something gentler and more natural than the other over-the-counter dandruff shampoos.  As a shampoo it was fine. It got my hair clean, lathered well, and smelled pleasant. However, after 2 months of use I can honestly say that it has done nothing for my scalp to reduce itchiness or flaking. I had better results just putting straight tea tree oil on my scalp.</li>
            <li> My teen has dry scalp issues and this stuff really helps.</li>
            <li> My daughter had a pretty bad case of craddle cap.  She also has eczema.  Her doctor recommend this shampoo and it cleared up her cradle cap over a couple of weeks.  I use it 3xs a week and it started working the 1st week.  Her scalp was less dry and flaky.  I even use it in my hair when my scalp gets dry and prone to dandruff.  Clears it up really well.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff because it doesn&#x27;t have that harsh T-gel smell. I find it works better if you mix a bit of pure tea-tree oil with it before shampooing.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this shampoo on Amazon. However, I did buy it because is it supposed to reduce scalp itching and dandruff. To get free shipping from drug store.com, I bought 4 (like an Idiot). My itching got worse after 2 bottles and after the thrid I was develpoing white heads leading to painfull acne in the hair line around my neck (I am 45 year old male who never had acne as a teen!!). Once I switched to Neutrogena T sol, my hair feels better and no more pain. Very disappointing. Still have one unused bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure what happened here, but I noticed that after using this product my dandruff was even worse. I stopped using it after 2 times.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and wouldn&#x27;t do without it.  My scalp no longer itches.  I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this did nothing for my scalp and hardly even works as a shampoo. It does not lather without putting a handful on my head and comes up very short of normalizing a dry, itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> Not the best lather, but my hair is clean and my scalp is flake free. I think I might try the conditioner next</li>
            <li> • African-American Female&lt;br /&gt;• Medium Length Hair&lt;br /&gt;• Relaxed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 26th, 2015 is the first day that I&#x27;ve used this shampoo. Of course I don&#x27;t have much to show (or tell) about it as yet. However, I&#x27;d like to say I&#x27;ve been a victim of ‘chronic dry scalp’ (not an actual medical term). My hair has been relaxed for over a decade and it was in my teen years that I started experiencing ugly flaking. I simply associated this with the average puberty phase of life and used the popular Head and Shoulders Shampoo/Conditioner to alleviate the problem. Admittedly, Head and Shoulders worked well the first couple of times. After about, 5 uses of that product it just ceased to solve the problem. I tried many other products after this, even changing my lifestyle habits, going to the dermatologist and common natural remedies such as the Apple Cider Vinegar method. Many of which didn&#x27;t work or merely worked for a short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across this product in my local health shop and before buying I took some photos and did some background checks online. Judging from what I saw online, the Pros outweigh the cons and I knew there was only one way to find out if this shampoo was &amp;#34;The One&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Common Online Comments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Bad Smell - I think online many people take advantage of the opportunity to exaggerated on different issues. Based on what I saw before purchasing I expected the smell to be very potent and ‘nasty’ to say the least. However this was not the case. I found the scent to be very natural and restoring. I&#x27;m not saying this would be the case for everyone (‘to each his own’) but the idea of many natural products possessing an ugly odor needs to be put to rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Doesn&#x27;t Lather Well - Compared to the usual chemical based shampoos this statement is true. On its own remember this is a natural product and does not contain the chemicals that common shampoos usually leave tons of build up on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Tea Tree Treatment might not be for all! This is in fact true however I am not eligible to speak with to much on this issue as yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE #1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been 2wks since I&#x27;ve last used the product (I&#x27;m due for a hair treatment, so I&#x27;ll be using the Jason&#x27;s Conditioner alongside the Shampoo) but I haven&#x27;t experienced any dramatic changes. HOWEVER, I did noticed a reduction in the nasty ‘flakes’. It usually takes my hair a week (5days) to surprise me with a nasty surplus of dandruff; this was not the case. My hair began to itch at least 7days after and I only began to experience flaking at least 10days after the wash. This was a much improvement but like I said not so much a dramatic change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERDICT:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to using this product some more, along with the complimenting condition (rumor has it that the conditioner works wonders). Until my second wash all I can say is, it&#x27;s definitely worth the shot. If need be I&#x27;ll update this comment.r hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Tea Tree Treatment might not be for all!

            <li> I bought these shampoo and conditione for my granddaughter. Her scalp was itchy due to sweating and her hair is so thick. Only this shampoo and conditioner is the ones she is using now. She lives them.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes that it would be a more natural way to deal with dandruff but it didn&#x27;t ever seem to really get my hair clean. By the next day my hair would be greasy and limp, unlike with other products.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for - this is not Paul Mitchell quality shampoo.  I would not recommend this product</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing! I have converted numerous friends to Jason products after they&#x27;ve used this shampoo as well. Love it! If you are unfamiliar with sulfate-free shampoos, just realize you have to really work to foam it up.</li>
            <li> I saw immediate results!  After one application, my dandruff was noticeably under control. I didn&#x27;t get a good lather with the shampoo right away, probably due to my hair condition from my prior anti-dandruff shampoo. But after a few days using the Tea Tree shampoo and conditioner, I was able to get a good, workable lather.  This product may not be right for everyone, but I took a chance and it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for dandruff but its gentle enough so I can use it every day. I like the smell too.</li>
            <li> The product is great, but the the plastic bottle, which comes wrapped tightly in an outer package, had a loose cap causing a leak into the outer package during shipment.  This is the second time this has happened (two out of two).</li>
            <li> I have been using Jason products for years but, I will not order this shampoo again. It smells chemically.</li>
            <li> I have been having dandruff problem for couple of years and I was getting tired of it because the dandruff would concentrate around my half line. I have tried all the over the counter dandruff shampoo and none of them work for me. I even went to a dermatologist for my trouble it had help for a little bit but some how it came back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was talking to a different doctor and he recommended tea tree oil and look in to it. That propped me in looking a shampoo with tea tree. So i bought a bottle and been using it for about 2 maybe 3 weeks now and my dandruff is under control. I&#x27;m happy with the result of it and where those OTC products didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo for the whole family and it is used especially when the lice scare hits the schools!  Like Jason products.</li>
            <li> Great product, helps with my scalp irritation!!</li>
            <li> This is very low-lathering, which is fine with me. I do think it&#x27;s relieving my itchy scalp a bit -- no miracle cure, but it seems to help. The only problem is, every time I use this, I&#x27;m sure to have a bad-hair day. I save this for when I don&#x27;t have any social engagements on my calendar.</li>
            <li> Not enough bubbles but it shows it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> This Shampoo seems to be the right one for me.  No it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as a conventional shampoo, but thats ok.  It leaves my scalp less itchy and irritated than any other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  The one thing I do that I find helps is to use a different shampoo every two weeks or so( i mean for one day), just to give a break and mix things up.  My scalp responds well when I go back to this brand.</li>
            <li> I works like a charm!!! I bought it for someone who doesn&#x27;t believe in this joins of products and hadn&#x27;t have dandruff since!!!</li>
            <li> Jason is the best. !!!!! thanks for the good product and the good delivery.</li>
            <li> I did not like this shampoo by Jason at all.  I am drawn to a tea tree oil type of shampoo for the smell and tingling, plus I was having issues with dry scalp.  I came across this product and I ordered it right away.  I was disappointed. I was hoping for a better more effective product.</li>
            <li> Contains too small amount of Tea Tree Oil to have any effect on my scalp.  I read in another review a guy saying he could feel the fungus burn when this shampoo was on his scalp.  I have for real scalp fungus &amp; this shampoo did nothing to help.  The shampoo smells good &amp; leaves hair very soft but if your looking for a Tea Tree specific shampoo (like most people who buy this) I would go with Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special shampoo, which does actually make your scalp fungus burn.</li>
            <li> I typically like Jason products, however, this shampoo left my hair extremely dry. It was nice and tingly on my scalp, but I have long hair and the ends felt coarse and dry.  I ended up using Jason on my scalp and working another shampoo &amp; conditioner on the ends.  Perhaps someone with short hair would not have this problem. For this reason, I&#x27;ll be switching to another product.</li>
            <li> permanently messed up my hair after one use. don&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> Love! Great for cradle cap too</li>
            <li> I purchased Jason Tea Tree Shampoo after my wife began using Jason Minerals &amp; Tea Tree Muscle Pain Therapy.  I was aware of the healing properties of tea tree oil so I decided to try Jason&#x27;s shampoo because I have had a long term problem with a scaly scalp.  I have been using Jason&#x27;s shampoo since June and I believe I am seeing some improvement in my condition.  I have also purchased Jason Tea Tree Conditioner (off the shelf) to see if that will help.</li>
            <li> I have dry scalp and after much research, thought I would give this a try. I so badly wanted this to work, bug nog sure I like it. Years ago a hairdresser told me not to use it that it will just dry out my scalp. After reading all the reviews, I decided to try and don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s working for me. It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks since I started using as recommended and have not seen any improvement. One othe thing is that I have fine hair and have to use a good conditioner after as it seems to dry my hair a bit. The reason I gave it 3 stars is that I am not sure it is working for me. So 3 stars seems to be fair based on personal experience.</li>
            <li> Ok so it was good for the first 3days until I got so itchy it was so bad for a week , until I just stoped using it. O well just have to look for something else. It smells like rosemary(: which I liked. I have no idea why it didn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
            <li> no more dandruff, itching or excessive oil production. hair is smooth and does not feel dead.</li>
            <li> great price for this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried for my problem scalp. Even though it doesn&#x27;t stink of tar, it smells like old books. It does relieve my sore head better than regular shampoo. I bounce around my shampoo routine with different shampoos for psorais because it seams to work better, (for me).I do like dermarest, and Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo as well.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair and a scalp that gets itchy a day after washing.  I thought itchy scalp was just something I had to live with until I tried a shampoo from Pytho that actually controlled the itching.  Unfortunately that shampoo was discontinued.  From then on I had went on a search for a shampoo that can tackle my itchy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Garnier Dandraff shampoo, Neutrogena T-Gel, Jason scalp therapy, and even some African black shampoo.  None could control the itch in any reasonable degree.  Neutrogena seem to perform better, while Jason performed worse than regular shampoo.  Maybe the Jason shampoo was meant for dry hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally tried this one called \\&quot;Head &amp; Shoulders Clinical Strength Anti Dandruff Shampoo\\&quot; and finally I&#x27;m back to having no itchy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, different shampoo works for different folks.  My only advice is to try the cheaper shampoo first before moving up to ones that cost 15 or 30 dollars a bottle.</li>
            <li> I researched online for an anti dandruff shampoo, and the top rated shampoos like head and shoulders and selsen blue i have already tried. I eventually came across this one and took a shot in the dark. my dandruff situation has improved and the smell is unique and i enjoy it. good choice. 19 year old male</li>
            <li> I love this product!!  I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it and I was not disappointed.  It arrived quickly and I tried it right away.  I love smell and my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch as much (only took a few days!!)</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo when I feel like the other shampoos I&#x27;m using leave a residue.  It really takes out all of that other left behind stuff and gives a fresh clean feel to my hair.  Smells great too.</li>
            <li> Love it! This product makes your hair feel super clean and extra soft, even the very ends of my hair that were usually a little rough. It doesn&#x27;t make a huge foamy lather, so if you can deal with a small amount of lather,  it&#x27;s absolutely worth it!</li>
            <li> This shampoo did nothing for my severe dandruff that plain old head and shoulders couldn&#x27;t do. I had high expectations, but was sadly disappointed. Then again, Nizoral has been the only shampoo to work for me, but since it is SO hard to come by I have to keep my options open.</li>
            <li> Love the Tea Tree Shampoo its gently, effectively eliminates excessive dead cells and dandruff to gradually normalize the scalp.  Leaves your hair soft, adds volume and shinier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than the nonanti-Residue shampoo, but still not that useful. I will have residue a day after I wash my hair. In addition, I still feel tickle. Plus I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> The shampoo works well, but at least with my hair, it helps with the dandruff and the itch, but it&#x27;s not anything super special</li>
            <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis, as well as allergies to sulfates &amp; frangrances in shampoos &amp; body washes.  I tried this on a whim since Jason is \\&quot;natural.\\&quot; The shampoo felt good in the shower until I started itching from the scalp down. Thank God for my itch relief Curel lotion. I itched all over for 1.5 days! I&#x27;m, unfortunately, wary of Jason products now.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this shampoo did NOT work for me! I went ahead and bought 2 bottles since it had a load of great reviews. I still have an itchy scalp with a few hot spots that this shampoo did nothing for after a week of daily use.  I will continue using it for another week just to be sure but I&#x27;m thinking this isn&#x27;t what it is cracked up to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the scent of this shampoo is not very pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed since this was not a cheap purchase.</li>
            <li> great for my kids. Gentle to use daily and I love the smell. No arguments from the kiddos either. yes.</li>
            <li> Since I bought the Tea Tree shampoo, I had to get the conditioner to go along with it.  I&#x27;m sure the conditioner is why my hair was shiny after using it and shampoo.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dry hair and dandruff ridden hair love it and the smell is really nice completely stopped my itchy scalp in two uses worth every penny :)</li>
            <li> This item works better than most for dandruff and psoriasis flaking. I have had it horrible the last few months and found this product. It has made a huge difference in scalp dryness and also makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> I came across this product while looking for an organic, paraben/sulfate free shampoo. Have used this product only three times and can&#x27;t believe the difference it&#x27;s made with my itchy and flaky scalp. I only wash my hair twice a week, and by day three my scalp would be particularly itchy with lots of flaking, even though I don&#x27;t use any product on my scalp or in my hair. By the second use with this shampoo, making sure to spend several minutes massaging it into my scalp, all the itching is nearly gone. And the flaking has at least halved, if not more. I didn&#x27;t know I could have a normal head!! I&#x27;m glad I did a little research and took a chance. I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> this is the best product that i have ever used to combate dandruff. the thing is that it actually works compared to the harsh chemical stuff i have been using that was in effective. great buy.</li>
            <li> Great price, promot delivery.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a godsend. I had been having terrible trouble with my scalp.  My hairdresser recommended a regimen with expensive salon products that actually made it worse. So I did some research and found this. It&#x27;s been great - no more itching and flaking. And I have extremely sensitive skin so I usually break out in hives - but no problems with this. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has removed 100% of the dandruff on our family&#x27;s heads. Head&amp;Shoulders was so so, T-Gel may as well have been a placebo, and even the actual Jason Dandruff line was good, but not GREAT like this. And for those saying it made their hair greasy, didn&#x27;t lather, etc-- clearly operator error. Anything will make your hair greasy if it isn&#x27;t rinsed properly. And it does lather, but not as much as &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; mass produced shampoo brands because it lacks all the empty filler ingredients that cause those other products to foam up. Just wet the hair, apply product and rub in, and add a splash more water to increase the lather effect. Regardless, the ingredients work and product is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does not work! I think my scalp dryness got worse...Do not buy this item....The shampoo smells good but the published advertisement is not accurate. Do not get sucked in to this product.</li>
            <li> I always use Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Shampoo. I saw this and it is organic, so I thought I would try it. I don&#x27;t think it works as well. It doesn&#x27;t make your scalp tingle at all either. I think it doesn&#x27;t have enough tea tree oil in it. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again but it works alright.</li>
            <li> Works great for dandruff</li>
            <li> I read many of the reviews before purchasing, and was hoping to get a more natural shampoo that would help with my dandruff, but the shampoo barely lathered and then left my hair feeling completely disgusting.  I only used it 3 or 4 times before I gave up.</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of products and spent a lot of money on things to help with my psoriasis and my eczema on my scalp. This stuff cleared my scalp in one wash! obviously it wont do that for everyone but if you are hesitant just get it. Its very inexpensive and worth a shot. thank you amazon and the seller!!</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo with a nice scent that is not overwhelming that leaves the hair feeling rather nice. Unfortunately, the supposed anti-dandruff effects does not work on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was rather fed up with my dandruff, and wanted a good shampoo to deal with it. I used H&amp;S in the past, but I wanted something new. I did some research, and this shampoo showed up more than just a few times on various websites as the best dandruff shampoo. So I ordered this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my dismay, this product had the opposite effect on me. My scalp felt even more irritated, and minutes after drying my hair, it became excessively itchy and absolutely unbearable. Needless to say, I gave in to the temptation and scratched away, leaving snow behind. I tried to like this product. I really did. I even strapped myself down and resisted scratching for two weeks despite the irritation from regular use of this shampoo. The itchiness never went away, and before I knew it, the shampoo was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, my reaction is only personal, and I cannot reject the constant rave of this product and deem it a dud product. Thus, I hope my rating of three stars is fair. Though unlikely, please note that your mileage may vary, and this product might not be the one for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My negative reaction to one product from Jason also does not mean that their other products are bad! Jason also makes a [[ASIN:B001EWEP68 Tea Tree Conditioner]], and that product works wonderfully with even a regular shampoo! Give this shampoo a try, and if you meet my unfortunate event, then please do give that conditioner a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;- smells fragrant&lt;br /&gt;- leaves the hair smooth&lt;br /&gt;- is not harsh at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;- the price is a tad high for the amount given&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mediocre:&lt;br /&gt;- it simply did not work for me</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a shampoo that&#x27;s both mild (so I can use at least 3 times weekly) as well as good for my dry scalp problem. I got both Jason&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil Shampoo and Conditioner and I have used them 3 times weekly last few weeks. The shampoo smelled and felt right. It was mild just as I wanted. But, it did absolutely nothing to reduce my dry scalp problem. I am looking out for other products now. I understand sometimes a particular shampoo cannot help some people but can do wonders for others. I still got to find my miracle cure.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has been a big plus for my hair and scalp!  I will recommend this to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Would give half a star if i could. Very disappointed in this product. Cant see anyone who would buy again. You need to use alot. Doesnt lather. Smells like pet shampoo. Worst tea tree shampoo. Doesnt tingle like other brands. Waste of $. Not even worth my time returning. Dont wanna deal with it.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair and gets scratch bit if I skip washing my hair for a day. This works well over the other shampoo but difference is really narrow.</li>
            <li> I tend to suffer from dry skin a lot, especially in the winter when the heat indoors comes on and ambient humidity is low. This makes my skin itchy all over. The place where I get the worst itch, usually, is the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one point I started to use this shampoo whenever I stayed over at the apartment of my boyfriend at the time. It&#x27;s a shampoo with a very mild detergent in it, so if your hair is even moderately greasy, you have to basically wash it twice in a row. But the amazing upside is... that it stops my scalp itching!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know whether it&#x27;s the milder-than-usual detergent or the tea tree oil or something else that does it, but I don&#x27;t particularly care. If the shampoo were outrageously expensive, I might try to find out exactly what ingredient does the trick and shop around for a cheaper shampoo with the same miraculous property. But seeing as this shampoo is fairly reasonably priced, I don&#x27;t care enough. Besides, whenever I try a different shampoo, I usually find that it does make my scalp itch after a couple of uses, and then I&#x27;m left with an entire bottle of useless shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some problems call for further experimentation. Other problems call for going with the solution you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which, in this case, is JASON Natural Cosmetics Tea Tree Oil shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, when they changed the packaging, they kept the same text on the bottle that claims the shampoo is &amp;#34;antifungicidal&amp;#34;. Whatever.</li>
            <li> this has helped with breakouts on my face. I&#x27;m pretty sure its because my hair isn&#x27;t as oily so its causing less oil on my face. Whatever the reason, I like the shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t smell the best but it gets your hair feeling squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff daily for three weeks and it worked no better for me than any other shampoo for dandruff.  It smells bad, sort of like that pine coal tar shampoo. Hair feels very oily the next day, and after wash is very dry and brittle.  Has done nothing for scalp acne either.  I also need to add that after washing my hair, my hands are very dry and scaling.  What is this doing to my scalp?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand makes false claims in that they claim to be \\&quot;SLS\\&quot; (sodium lauryl sulfates) free, however the third ingredient listed is an SLS!</li>
            <li> this product worked and that is all that can be said i have had dandruf for 40 years and no product has done much to help this one worked the best</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the product information page. Even though it states that the shampoo is SLS free, there is still plenty of sodium and sulfate that somehow didn&#x27;t make the ingredients list, including: Sodium Chloride, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Coco-Sulfate, Sodium Laurylglucosides, Sodium PCA, Sodium Sulfate, Sodium Benzoate.  If you have had a perm, keratin treatments or color treatments done to your hair, these ingredients will break them down, and the $200+ treatment you paid for is down the drain.  Don&#x27;t believe me?  Ask your hair stylist.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo to get away from all the bad stuff that is put into the major brand shampoos.  I was also looking for something that would help my scalp not itch.  Let me tell you that this shampoo has done wonders for my hair and scalp.  I have never had my hair feel so clean and silky smooth as it does now.  I would definitely recommend this shampoo to anyone looking for an all natural alternative to the major brands.</li>
            <li> We buy this all the time.  Problem is some places no longer carry ti.  I purchased on line however when I could not find it.  However, I found it&#x27;s quite a bit more expensive on Amazon then the one I finally found at Whole Foods Stores.  But the product is great.  Gentle and helps winter itch scalp.</li>
            <li> I think this is working. I have pretty severe dandruff. No flakes that fall, but my head is covered with it and usually itchy.&lt;br /&gt;This has helped with the itch, as long as I use it every other shampooing. I also use the conditioner when I use a different shampoo</li>
            <li> This product was just okay. It reduced my itchiness, but not much. Undiluted tea tree oil combined with castor oil is much better for my scalp issues.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any real change, you can take it or leave it really. The only real con about this is that as you wash it out, your hair turns into a rat&#x27;s nest, so you need to follow with a good conditioner. I&#x27;m using the Aloe and Henna shampoos by Jason, and it&#x27;s the same thing, a rat&#x27;s nest. So far the only natural shampoos that haven&#x27;t done that are the Desert Essence ones.</li>
            <li> Great product...my husband loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It works get my hair feels very clean after I use it.</li>
            <li> The list of ingredients took me 15 minutes to read it was so long...That being said, use something that truly is organic. The more garbage you see in shampoo the worse it is for you IMHO. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This stuff works fast and doesnt irrigate my scalp. I use it along side head &amp; shoulders. Youll enjoy this. Fantastic</li>
            <li> I received quickly, but the tea tree does not work as well as it did when I used it years ago.  Perhaps, the company has changed their formula or maybe my hair has changed!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for my teenage son.  We have tried many things for his dandruff and are still looking for a product that works.</li>
            <li> This shampoo did help with my itchy flaky scalp some...however, it completely stripped my hair. Not sure if I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> After trying other dandruff shampoo&#x27;s such as Head and Shoulders, Celsum Blue etc, Tea Tree oil was the next test.  The ingredients looked good so I was optimistic.&lt;br /&gt;After looking for it in the local Walgreen&#x27;s in the shampoo isle, it was finally located in the skin care products and priced as such.&lt;br /&gt;Alas, after using this shampoo for a month, carefully following the instructions on the bottle, it is still snowing daily.</li>
            <li> Bought this shampoo because my hair was suffering from sun and too much time in the pool.  I&#x27;m not sure that this was the right choice - bought because it was natural but think that it was meant more as a scalp therapy.  Not sure I like the scent but that&#x27;s a very personal thing.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied! My 9 year old has bouts with dry skin/dandruff. I have tried various products with nominal success. Read the reviews on Jason Tea Tree Shampoo and decided to give it a try. So glad I did. Worked faster than anything I&#x27;ve tried before. And her hair looks fantastic. Healthy, shiny, vibrant. I bought Jason Biotene Conditioner also and it&#x27;s fantastic. I&#x27;m going to order the Biotene shampoo for maintenance use. Highly recommend the product. Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me. After 3 weeks using it daily, I still have the same problems. The 2 stars go to the shampoo itself.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo..did the trick BUT..it definitely dried my scalp out. Due to it being strong to where it rids of dandruff..it also dries your scalp so you will need some type of grease/conditioner so your scalp wont be so dry.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a gluten free shampoo and stumbled upon this. Perfect for anyone who is looking for a healthy gluten free shampoo!</li>
            <li> for years i used to have terribly itchy, dandruffy scalp. i tried everything from Suave, to Johnson &amp; Johnson, Head and Shoulders etc. some of them worked for a little while, but ultimately it only got worse until finally my mom researched into something more along the natural, organic line, and came across this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my hair is like 3 feet long, and prone to getting oily, and gross if not washed every day, and this shampoo works wonders in keeping my hair clean, shiny, soft, and healthy, while not drying out my scalp. i have never had a problem with dandruff since switching to Jason. &#x3D;D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;any time i go on vacation, it always comes with me. &#x3D;D on that 1 random occasion, when i actually spaced out on packing it, heading to Freddy&#x27;s for more was the top priority! &#x27;free&#x27; hotel shampoos just leave a scummy residue in my hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is not well made. It smells bad. also it dries your hair. it can only be use three times a week. if you want a shampoo that will keep your hair well balance click this.Shampoo for Dry Hair and Flaking Scalp with Almond, Lavender and ant a shampoo</li>
            <li> I bought this product a while ago, and I was so happy with the outcome. After a couple weeks of using it my scalp was no longer itchy (at all) and the flakes went away. It also has a very nice scent. Although it does leave my hair a bit dry, you just need to use a good conditioner and you&#x27;re all set. I ran out and I had some head &amp; shoulders stored so I used that. Head &amp; Shoulders really sucks compared to the Jason brand. Once my Head &amp; Shoulders is all gone I am going to go back to Jason and stick with it! It works so great.</li>
            <li> No more oil, just clean hair!</li>
            <li> It works exactly as I wanted it to.  It lathers up quickly and helps with the itching in my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have dry scalp. and by seeing so many positive reviews, thought of trying this product.&lt;br /&gt;Its almost 2 month now, and I can not see any difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be because of my exceptional dry scalp, but I would not recommend this product based on my experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had really itchy scalp and dandruff for about 1 1/2 years. Tried all the dandruff shampoos. T gel worked well for a while but still had the itch. I&#x27;ve been using this Jason shampoo for about three weeks, and I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised how good my scalp feels. YAY! Smells good too.</li>
            <li> when i hit my teens is when my dandruff started up not bad at first but over the years it has gotten worse and worse especially when im under a lot of stress i recently moved from a cool climate Pennsylvania to Florida and with the heat started sweating more which made my flakes flare up pretty bad u can only wear so many light colored shirts to avoid them showing up lol i have tried head and shoulders and selsun blue multiple formulas different ways and i got a high pressure shower head to make sure i was fully rinsing my hair all to no avail so i looked up shampoos that people have found relief with and this one was listed so i gave it a try&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;id like to address a few things i have seen mentioned&lt;br /&gt;firstly there is more then one cause of dandruff so there is no magic cure all for it so it is ignorant to get on here and use 50 exclamation points how it doesnt work!!!!... it DIDNT WORK FOR YOU please people make reviews personalized unless you have others opinions to back it up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;secondly the smell i think is really nice it has a very natural clean smell to me it does not smell like some sort of pesticide or w/e that i saw someone mention im guessing they were heavy smokers or something lol i have a pretty sensitive sense of smell and i found this to be very pleasant if you expect a heavily perfumed scent then i suggest you get that from your conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;even after using other dandruff shampoos and rinsing like crazy about as soon as my hair dried id start having flakes again and i do not have that with this shampoo at all i can not highly recommend this enough if you are like i was and tired of fighting the flake war lol its worth the try</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time sufferer of dandruff.  Spent a long time using head and shoulders, thinking that if this doesn&#x27;t work why should anything else?  I recently tried free and clear shampoo without any results.  I read somewhere that tea tree oil might be the solution for my ever dry scalp.  This was the first shampoo I tried with that in mind.  On the first wash there was significant improvement if not complete.  Less itch, less dandruff and it makes me very happy.  I am very pleased with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I can tell a difference after using this shampoo one time!  I made sure to lather it up a lot and let it sit on my scalp for a few minutes while I showered and then rinse out.  I definitely needed conditioner after, but when I dried my hair I could only see a few flakes (major improvement) and my hair is nice and full/bouncy after blow drying.  I feel confident after continued use I will see no flakes!  I really like this brand, I have used the volumizing conditioner before and it worked wonders as well. It is a little more expensive than what you buy at Target, but it is worth it!!</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with an itchy scalp so I did some research about remedies and this particular item popped up.  I have been using it for around three months now and have not had a single problem since.  I would recommend this product to anyone. I actually just bought a bottle for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> As a student from the states studying abroad, I don&#x27;t have as many options to fix my severe dandruff. At first I tried to ignore my problem, but then when my dandruff began to show up EVERYWHERE (my clothes, my pillow, even in my bathroom sink-yuck!), that is when I knew I had to address my problem. After reading all the positive reviews, and doing some online research of my own, I ordered the Jason&#x27;s Natural Tea Tree Shampoo and couldn&#x27;t wait to see results. This is what I ended up experiencing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first wash (I washed my hair twice, letting the shampoo sit on my head for at least 5 minutes before rinsing and rewashing), I found my dandruff was initially gone.I was at first elated, but then I went about my day and less than 12 hours later, I found my head itching and dandruff all over my clothes again. I wasn&#x27;t too alarmed, since I figured it was only my first time using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now used the product over 10 times since I received it, but my dandruff is never gone for longer than half a day. It is highly disappointing, especially on the occasions I&#x27;ve used the shampoo and my dandruff returns with full force FOUR hours later.  What gives? I even added 100% concentrated tea tree oil in my shampoo and a few drops on my scalp before washing with this shampoo, all with no results. I was perhaps better off not even ordering this product from Amazon. The only reason I give it 3 stars, is only because it prolongs the appearance of dandruff, which other shampoos have not been able to do for me. If anyone can give me suggestions for this I would appreciate it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, which does a good job on my hair and scalp and also has a very pleasing clean scent.</li>
            <li> Works well for our son&#x27;s craddle cap. Smells nice too</li>
            <li> I might as well be using Selsun blue. Not good for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo for about a week. It feels and smells great, and I noticed I had less itch, but I still get flakes. I&#x27;m going to try the dandruff line to see if that works better.</li>
            <li> Lots of people experience itchy, flaky scalp but you really have to do your research to understand what kind you have. Traditional dandruff shampoos are intended for people with itchy scalps. Tea tree oil treats dry scalp. I knew my root was the latter thanks to feedback from my stylist and the fact it comes only in the winter. And Jason&#x27;s tea tree oil shampoo has worked WONDERS for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since beginning use of this shampoo and conditioner system (about 2 months ago) my scalp has ceased being dry and flaky. It also does not produce excess oil in response to dryness so I can also go longer between shampoos! My hair has been super soft and shiny, even silky, and has tons of volume. I love this shampoo and conditioner and will continue to use it as long as I can!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how this treatment shampoo will work for people with more traditional \\&quot;dandruff\\&quot; problems but it has certainly made my scalp happy!</li>
            <li> Has lasted for a long time and very gentle on scalp. Still has some unpronouncable curious chemicals in it though.</li>
            <li> Just works alright, smells funny, didnt really help or make my scalp worse.  Kinda made my hair dry out a little but not that bad.</li>
            <li> just got a product, scent is good, but after use shampoo , my hair feels kinda dry . I thin i  need supplement like hair cream or conditional. Scalp has a little acene problems. I want to  see how it improve ;)</li>
            <li> The Shampoo arrived yesterday and tried this morning.  It was very nice and i think I will be glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> after hearing good things about this, I am amazed by how it exceeded my expectations.  I have struggled for years with dandruff, using numerous prescriptions and every shampoo out there.  I used this shampoo for the first time night before last and am wearing my brushed black jacket, a previous no-no and it&#x27;s CLEAN of flakes.  If you you have tried everything, try this.  It really works.</li>
            <li> I have been using head &amp; shoulders for 1-2 years now, and can always feel flakes by the end of the day.  After the FIRST time using Jason shampoo (along with the root to tip conditioner- trust me, get this too), my scalp was HEALED!  You have to make sure to treat your scalp with the shampoo and conditioner- not just your hair.  Otherwise, obviously, it doesn&#x27;t work.  But I have been dealing with dandruff for YEARS now, and this has been so far pretty amazing.  Sadly, I can tell I am going to go through the conditioner VERY quickly since it&#x27;s root-to-tip, so buy several.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, 5 stars!!!  If you have dandruff and you&#x27;re wondering what else is out there, I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> My 8-year-old has a musty hair smell that I couldn&#x27;t eradicate with regular shampoo.  I am not sure of the cause of the smell but saw that others had tried this shampoo for the same readon, and it worked for them so I tried it.  It does a good job on my daughter&#x27;s hair as well!</li>
            <li> Synopsis: It cleans hair, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my dandruff at all, made for rather unpleasant feeling hair later in the day, and at the same time smells like chemicals or dog shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advertised as scalp therapy and generally respected, I found that for me at least this shampoo did nothing positive for my hair. It might have been better than not using it at all, but I&#x27;m not completely sure of that. I know that a cheaper bottle of shampoo with or without conditioner coupled with an actually medicative treatment for dandruff has worked significantly better for me than this bottle ever did. I would not purchase again, nor recommend the product to others. It&#x27;s advertising seems to be misleading.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo a few months ago but I never got time to write the review. After reading all the comments about how great this shampoo and doing my research on it I decided to give it a try. First day, I noticed some hair loss but I just thought it was normal. The second day I used I noticed even more hair loss but I decided to give it one more try. Third I had the same results, after that I just decided to stop using for the fear that I might loose more hair than normal occasions. I want to give it another try but just by using it 2-3 a week but I don&#x27;t know if I want to risk it. I don&#x27;t think it smelled bad but I was confused on the bottle since it came with another label different from what was shown a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I love Jason products and this is another great one! I don&#x27;t used it every day because I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday.  When I do use it, maybe once or twice per week, it cleans my scalp very well, but doesn&#x27;t over dry my scalp.  It&#x27;s summer and It&#x27;s sweaty outside, so my head gets sweaty...this will clean it nicely.</li>
            <li> Been using this every time I wash my hair for a month now. I still feel the itch. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working. It seems to less tea tree oil in this one than Nature&#x27;s gate. The smell is ok - not amazing. Very light and delicate - much like the shampoo! I won&#x27;t buy this again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok product. I like the Paul Mitchell Tea product better. It&#x27;s smells good and gives your scalp that nice tingling sensation. This neither smells like it nor gives you that tingling sensation. It&#x27;s seems like just a regular shampoo</li>
            <li> I have had dandruff issues as of late, and thought I would give this stuff a try but it did not work for me. The consistency seems a bit off, the shampoo is very watery and it did not ever seem to lather like shampoo is supposed to.</li>
            <li> Did exactly what I needed it to-got rid of my dry itchy scalp, also have softer feeling hair. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I mistakenly bought Jason Dandruff shampoo and was very disappointed in it. It didn&#x27;t work any better then T-Gel. I thought I&#x27;d try again and purchased the Tea Tree Oil shampoo, which was recommended to me in the first place. The Tea Tree Oil shampoo started controlling the snow storm on the very first day.</li>
            <li> This is great shampoo, it leaves your hair soft and silky. The slight tea tree scent is fabulous, a little goes a long way. It does seem thin and watery if you are accustomed shampoos with fillers trust me though this is much better for your hair. I use this a few times a month to help cleanse and condition my hair/scalp from build of styling products and blow drying. It helps with dry scalp and doesn&#x27;t smell like you have dumped medicine on your head. Highly recommend if you want silky shinny hair.</li>
            <li> While it was acceptable as a shampoo I had none of the &amp;#34;scalp Therapy&amp;#34; effects advertised. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> New formula: Fail - Original formula: Win&lt;br /&gt;I bought this last summer because it was so hot I thought it might be refreshing and if it didn&#x27;t work as a shampoo I could use it as a body wash. My hair is waist length baby fine hair which had gotten so dry that I was splitting on every end. This &#x27;poo made my hair so hydrated that I stopped using conditioner all together. Day after day my hair became softer and silkier. My hair was swinging like in the comercials. no exageration.&lt;br /&gt;So I went to buy literaly every bottle on the shelf. That day they only had 3. I was luck. Jason changed the formula. I washed my hair that day and it felt funny like it wouldn&#x27;t wash out. washed a 2nd time and rinsed like crazy. results. I could not get my comb more than 2 inches through my hair! I had to rewash with adifferent &#x27;poo just to be able to comb my hair. Used the rest to wash my lingerie&lt;br /&gt;Jason please go back to the original formula!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry but this product which is not as all natural as it claims (see other reviews, or the ingredients list) is just awful.  The first time I used it it took 4 shampoos to get any lather.  The second and third (consecutive days) took three.  It&#x27;s water clear, so it&#x27;s hard to tell just how much you&#x27;re using. I have slightly oily hair, and a dry scalp, and I can&#x27;t say I have ever itched as badly as after using this product.  The scent is tolerable at best.  I do not recommend this product, and truly regret purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was returned. The main point for me was this; The description, just below the price reads: \\&quot;NO Sodium Lauryl/Laureth Sulfate\\&quot; yet sodium lauryl sulfoacetate is the third ingredient. These are the full ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Jason Normalizing Treatment Shampoo Tea Tree Directions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use at least three times each week. Wet hair and lather, massage onto scalp. Rinse and repeat if desired. For best results, follow with Jason Tea Tree Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Aqua (water), cocamidopropyl betaine, sodium lauryl sulfoacetate, melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) leaf oil*, triticum vulgare (wheat) germ oil, algae extract, anthemus nobilis flower extract*, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) flower extract*, citrus grandis (grapefruit) seed extract, salvia officinalis (sage) leaf extract, urtica dioica (nettle) extract*, citric aicd, guar hydroxypropyltrinomium chloride, glycerin, hydrolyzed wheat protein, lauryl glucoside, lecithin, pantheonol, sodium chlroide, sodium sulfate, stearyl citrate, tocopheryl acetate, retinyl palmitate, alcohol*, benzyl alcohol, potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, benzyl benzoate, benzyl salicylate, hexyl cinnamal, hydroxyisohexyl 3-cyclohexene carboxaldehyde, hydroxycitronellal, fragrance (parfum)&lt;br /&gt;*Certified Organic Ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;Warnings</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t terribly impressed with this shampoo.  But after using it now for a week straight I think I can actually tell a difference.  My head is less oily, less dandruff, and less pimples.  I shave my head so that could be a difference for some of those that say it doesn&#x27;t work for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Less Dandruff, less pimples, less oil&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  The sent takes some getting use to but if you are using medicated shampoos already you probably have smelled worse.</li>
            <li> My daughter was diagnosed with yeast infection on her scalp. Her scalp would be red and flaky and even with some bleeding from scratching. I took her to the dermatoligist and he prescribed Ciclopirox. This is a medicated shampoo to treat the fungus but she can only use it 3 times a week. We bough Jason Tea Tree oil shampoo so she could alternate this product when not being able to use Ciclopirox. I truly think this product has helped as made the difference. In the days before she used Jason shampoo she was using T-Gel, and you could see the flakes and dandruff still, nos that she is comning both shampoos, there is no difference. Once she is done with her treatment I will do Jason shampoo only and give more updates to see if this shampoo keeps the yeast infection away.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is just a waste of money. Didn&#x27;t work at all! My dandruff seemed to get worse with it. I heard good things about tea tree shampoos in general but this one just sucks! Don&#x27;t waste your money. Buy the Jason Dandruff Relief 2 In 1 Shampoo and Conditoner... That one works wonders!</li>
