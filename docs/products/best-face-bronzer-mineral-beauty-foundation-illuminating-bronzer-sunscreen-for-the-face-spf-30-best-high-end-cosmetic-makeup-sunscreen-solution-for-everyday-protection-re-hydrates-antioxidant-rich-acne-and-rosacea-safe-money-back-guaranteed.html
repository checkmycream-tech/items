            <li>In summary, I notice this product is becoming my go-to product</li>

            <li>It blended well and made me look like I had a light tan.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and is lightweight.  </li>
            <li>The bronzer doesn&#x27;t seem to do this, but rather keeps my skin looking dewy fresh, which is a refreshing delight.</li>

            <li>NB --always apply to clean skin.</li>
            <li>I have such fair skin that is very sensitive, and I love this product!</li>

            <li>I really have enjoyed this product and will continue to purchase.  </li>

            <li>It feels extremely nourishing on my skin, it&#x27;s a great face lotion.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t change this formula, you have a loyal customer in me.</li>
            <li>We live in CA and love to travel to sunny locations.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, lite texture (I don&#x27;t like most face creams in this humidity) &amp; keeps my pretty smooth face from becoming a hard, wrinkly walnut looking hag!</li>
            <li>At first, it appeared to be too dark for my complexion, but has become a perfect summer tan color after frequent use.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a healthy glow and the color is so natural.  </li>
            <li>Overall I liked the results this gave me.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and helps me look normal</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that would give me a nice looking tan and not one that makes me long like a pumpkin</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, looks natural, all while the SPF protects your face.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and gives a subtle hint of color to my fair skin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!  </li>
            <li>I have received many compliments regarding my facial skin since I have been wearing this product.  </li>
            <li>So pleased to see this back in stock!  </li>
            <li>Nearly everyday I receive a compliment about my good color.</li>
            <li>It lifts my dull skin and adds the perfect amount of color without the orange aftereffect of a regular face bronzer.</li>
            <li>Love how smoothly it goes on without feeling heavy or sticky.  </li>
            <li>Being fair skinned and having several positive skin cancer results, I&#x27;m always searching for a product that &amp;#34;is the one.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m grateful to have found this product and will be a long term customer!</li>
            <li>this whole thing is a learning curve for me.</li>
            <li>I really like.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>It provides just the right amount of tint and is so natural looking.  </li>
            <li>even more I highly recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin not only does it not irritate</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and it tends to feel a little oily after a few hours, but as with any sunscreen you want to clean it off and reapply after a few hours* anyways.&lt;br /&gt;*i apply it in the mornings, at lunch and around happy hour time &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>I have been buying high end, dermatologist-recommended sunscreens for years.  </li>
            <li>It is not thick or clogging of the pores.</li>
            <li>So, after having this product for a few weeks, I&#x27;ve fallen in love with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it every day after my normal face regime.</li>
            <li>After using this daily for a year and a half, I still love it as much as I did in 2015.</li>
            <li>The tint is subtle but gives skin a nice glow.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin  </li>
            <li>The first day that I actually used it my friends were telling me that I had a glow.  </li>
            <li>neither it&#x27;s in my old tone with no odor</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have used over the counter broker creams that are similar and much cheaper.</li>
            <li>It gives me natural bronzed glow that lasts me all day.</li>
            <li>seriously this totally transforms your skin to a dull radiant Sun Goddess and its good for your skin too!!!</li>
            <li>A first for having sunscreen and bronzer in one that did not make you feel sticky AND did not leave a sour after application smell.</li>
            <li>The color is a little darker than I expected, but if you blend well, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>but moisturizing for my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I also live in a desert climate, so the air here tends to be extremely drying, which the product seems to compensates for.</li>

            <li> Goes on smoothly and gives a subtle hint of color to my fair skin.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!  </li>
            <li> I have received many compliments regarding my facial skin since I have been wearing this product.  </li>
            <li> So pleased to see this back in stock!  </li>
            <li> Nearly everyday I receive a compliment about my good color.</li>
            <li> It lifts my dull skin and adds the perfect amount of color without the orange aftereffect of a regular face bronzer.</li>
            <li> Love how smoothly it goes on without feeling heavy or sticky.  </li>
            <li> Being fair skinned and having several positive skin cancer results, I&#x27;m always searching for a product that &amp;#34;is the one.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m grateful to have found this product and will be a long term customer!</li>
            <li> this whole thing is a learning curve for me.</li>
            <li> I really like.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> It provides just the right amount of tint and is so natural looking.  </li>
            <li> even more I highly recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin not only does it not irritate</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and it tends to feel a little oily after a few hours, but as with any sunscreen you want to clean it off and reapply after a few hours* anyways.&lt;br /&gt;*i apply it in the mornings, at lunch and around happy hour time &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li> I have been buying high end, dermatologist-recommended sunscreens for years.  </li>
            <li> It is not thick or clogging of the pores.</li>
            <li> So, after having this product for a few weeks, I&#x27;ve fallen in love with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every day after my normal face regime.</li>
            <li> After using this daily for a year and a half, I still love it as much as I did in 2015.</li>
            <li> The tint is subtle but gives skin a nice glow.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin  </li>
            <li> The first day that I actually used it my friends were telling me that I had a glow.  </li>
            <li> neither it&#x27;s in my old tone with no odor</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have used over the counter broker creams that are similar and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> It gives me natural bronzed glow that lasts me all day.</li>
            <li> seriously this totally transforms your skin to a dull radiant Sun Goddess and its good for your skin too!!!</li>
            <li> A first for having sunscreen and bronzer in one that did not make you feel sticky AND did not leave a sour after application smell.</li>
            <li> The color is a little darker than I expected, but if you blend well, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> but moisturizing for my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I also live in a desert climate, so the air here tends to be extremely drying, which the product seems to compensates for.</li>
            <li> Makeup can sometimes make aging skin look older by settling in the lines and wrinkles (no matter how few one thinks there are) and amplifying them.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend using this product for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> One note, however, I have noticed that I have to be careful when wearing white that I don&#x27;t allow anything white to touch my face as the bronzer will rub off on the clothing.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and I appreciate no strong added scent (gives me migraines too).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little sticky at first, but it drys/abosorbs in a few minutes if you want to put blush on.  </li>
            <li> Also, when I go with the &amp;#34;scruff&amp;#34; look, this product evens out the color of my scruff and hides any grey areas.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for a vacation to have something other than regular sunscreen to use.  </li>
            <li> I currently am treating 5 skin cancers on face and neck and appreciate a product that gives me a little color with out requiring daily makeup.  </li>
            <li> At first, I was skeptical, especially with the moisturizing properties, but I realized in a few days that the bronzer had just enough moisturizer in it for my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday on my daily run to give me protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m just not ready to become one yet...</li>
            <li> -illuminates, bronzing sunscreen --which is actually quite hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I finally found a sunscreen that works for my delicate skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very active outdoor person and this is just the product I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> a little on the runny side - i think i would of been happier with a souffle coverage make up with sun screen</li>
            <li> I am a redhead that gets a little bit of tan.</li>
            <li> cons: pricing &amp; just a little bit of oiliness</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the greasy side.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> I will also wear this product all year round because I like the glow it gives my face.  </li>
            <li> feel it leaves on my skin without being too heavy.  </li>
            <li> Protects my face from the harsh sun here in Hawai&#x60;i.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to wear a heavy makeup foundation.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve never been one to use any type of cosmetic because it usually makes you look orange or gets all of your close</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews</li>
            <li> I used a small amount on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> so gives me a little coverage!!!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin  my dermatologist recommends a sunscreen but everything I used up to this point just irritated my skin even more I highly recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin not only does it not irritate it seems to help soothe i&#x27;ve never been one to use any type of cosmetic because it usually makes you look orange or gets all of your close this does neither it&#x27;s in my old tone with no odor I highly recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin already but just looking for a great sunscreen</li>
            <li> I have been buying high end, dermatologist-recommended sunscreens for years.  Between the moisturizing hyaluronic acid, the zinc oxide that keeps my aging-acne at bay, and the beautiful bronzing color I LOVE THIS SUNSCREEN.  I wish it came in a gallon size so I could put it all over and have a bronzed glow all over!!  Don&#x27;t change this formula, you have a loyal customer in me.</li>
            <li> The BEST Bronzer out there seriously this totally transforms your skin to a dull radiant Sun Goddess and its good for your skin too!!!, Im so thankful I found this product</li>
            <li> Makes you feel and look beautiful.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT. It gives a touch of color and coverage while providing SPF ... I bought it for a vacation to have something other than regular sunscreen to use.  I love it and will be purchasing again! Highly recommend!!  &amp;amp; the customer service is amazing as well!!!</li>
            <li> I have to say that I absolutely love this product.  The first day that I actually used it my friends were telling me that I had a glow.  I was tan.  Its goes on smoothly and has SPF which I love also.  I can&#x27;t say enough about it.  I was even trying to find more of their products to purchase.  I would recommend to give it a try.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I will definitely keep this stocked at my home.</li>
            <li> I like it. Only been using it a week, so haven&#x27;t seen results over time. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was for the price.</li>
            <li> a little on the runny side - i think i would of been happier with a souffle coverage make up with sun screen this whole thing is a learning curve for me.</li>
            <li> I really am impressed with this product.  It gives you a nice glow,  minimum coverage with sunscreen.  I use it everyday on my daily run to give me protection from the sun. I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I think this product deserves to get one.  I am easy to tan but this bronzer just gives me that glowing,  dewy skin I really like.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts. This product gives you a beautiful bronze glow and feels so good on my skin. Haven&#x27;t had any problems with my skin. Really happy I found this product!</li>
            <li> Terrific product.! Nearly everyday I receive a compliment about my good color.</li>
            <li> It Is not only a great sunscreen but also a great concealer. It gives your face a healthy glow. I spend a lot of time in the sun swimming. I have tried many sunscreens and they all burn my eyes whenever I sweat or swim, this one does not.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product for everyday wear. Easy to apply, looks natural, all while the SPF protects your face. Fabulous price point too! Would make a great gift!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it.  Bought it for a face bronzer; the fact it&#x27;s a moisturizer is just icing on the cake. Goes on smoothly and gives a subtle hint of color to my fair skin.  Definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have such fair skin that is very sensitive, and I love this product! It feels light and goes on even to give my face a tan looking glow, while giving me the protection I need. I&#x27;m a very active outdoor person and this is just the product I&#x27;ve been looking for. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is literally one of the best face lotions I&#x27;ve ever had. It lifts my dull skin and adds the perfect amount of color without the orange aftereffect of a regular face bronzer. It feels extremely nourishing on my skin, it&#x27;s a great face lotion. And, it makes me feel really beautiful! The illustrious effect is one that I haven&#x27;t often seen, even after working in the fashion industry. The dry winter air had taken slackened the pallor of my skin tone, but with spring coming, the need for illumination is great! And definitely satisfied with this product. Will definitely buy again. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and this product keeps me looking young and healthy throughout the winter.  I will also wear this product all year round because I like the glow it gives my face.  I have received many compliments regarding my facial skin since I have been wearing this product.  It applies easily with the fingers and washes off easily.  I really have enjoyed this product and will continue to purchase.  Also, when I go with the &amp;#34;scruff&amp;#34; look, this product evens out the color of my scruff and hides any grey areas.  Excellent Product!!</li>
            <li> Really love it. It is not thick or clogging of the pores.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. A first for having sunscreen and bronzer in one that did not make you feel sticky AND did not leave a sour after application smell. It does not leave discoloration on your hands. I like the design of the container and will be ordering Olala SunCare on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I finally found a sunscreen that works for my delicate skin. I love this! It&#x27;s an all in one. It protects my skin from the sun while giving me the perfect amount of color. I no longer need to wear foundation.</li>
            <li> Love it so much!! Goes on very smooth, super moisturizing, and makes my complexion look great!</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and I avoid tanning my face for fear of wrinkles. This went on really nice. It blended well and made me look like I had a light tan. I used a small amount on my face and neck. It wasn&#x27;t to greasy or streaky and it looks really good. Now my face matches the light tan on my arms! I will buy this again!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I am blonde and have fair skin and unfortunately love the sun.  I was leary of ordering this product because I never heard of the brand before, but so glad I took the chance.  It goes on smooth and is lightweight.  I use it in the place of my foundation.  It gives my skin a healthy glow and the color is so natural.  I plan on ordering this again.</li>
            <li> We, my husband (Mr Sandman in Kauai) and I have been called dominoes because he is SO TAN and me white from wearing sunblock, UPF clothing and trying to stay in the shade.  I currently am treating 5 skin cancers on face and neck and appreciate a product that gives me a little color with out requiring daily makeup.  It goes on easily and helps me look normal (I have to avoid all my medical tapes).  My skin is very sensitive and I appreciate no strong added scent (gives me migraines too).  We live in CA and love to travel to sunny locations.  Mahalo for a well made product for &amp;#34;palefaces&amp;#34;.  I look forward to wearing it everywhere after I heal. I can&#x27;t wait to ride my Mnt bike to Kalepa Ridge trail and swim to the Kalapaki Channel marker again. Holo Holo Cindy</li>
            <li> My best friend recommended I try this best bronzer and I&#x27;m really glad did! I bought 2 of the bronzers!</li>
            <li> So pleased to see this back in stock!  I purchased last month and it is, without doubt, THE best tinted sunscreen I have ever used.  It provides just the right amount of tint and is so natural looking.  Just love it.  I was worried when I couldn&#x27;t buy more - just ordered another two to have on hand.</li>
            <li> I like it but would have liked a tiny bit more broze color.  Its fine....i use it for day wear if i want a no makeup look moisturizer. Thought i could use it as bronzer highlight too.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!! Used it on vacation and it is perfect. 5++</li>
            <li> I am a redhead that gets a little bit of tan. But I have to keep sunscreen on my face when I&#x27;m out.  This leads to my face being lighter than the rest of my body, so this bronzer helps with that a lot. It&#x27;s a little sticky at first, but it drys/abosorbs in a few minutes if you want to put blush on.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> cons: pricing &amp; just a little bit of oiliness&lt;br /&gt;pros: just as it says -illuminates, bronzing sunscreen --which is actually quite hard to find.  I have combination skin and it tends to feel a little oily after a few hours, but as with any sunscreen you want to clean it off and reapply after a few hours* anyways.&lt;br /&gt;*i apply it in the mornings, at lunch and around happy hour time &#x3D;)  NB --always apply to clean skin.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product daily mainly as sun protection, but the bonus is that I&#x27;m using much less makeup.  At first, it appeared to be too dark for my complexion, but has become a perfect summer tan color after frequent use.  I also like the moisturizing feel it leaves on my skin without being too heavy.  Great product and good price!</li>
            <li> makes my face itch a bit</li>
            <li> I love this product! My skin actually looks younger with this product alone than it does with makeup, which is saying a lot since I am 56! I&#x27;ve even noticed myself choosing to wear this bronzer rather than makeup even on special occasions. I would have never believed this before I experienced it firsthand. At first, I was skeptical, especially with the moisturizing properties, but I realized in a few days that the bronzer had just enough moisturizer in it for my skin. I also live in a desert climate, so the air here tends to be extremely drying, which the product seems to compensates for. So, after having this product for a few weeks, I&#x27;ve fallen in love with it. Makeup can sometimes make aging skin look older by settling in the lines and wrinkles (no matter how few one thinks there are) and amplifying them. The bronzer doesn&#x27;t seem to do this, but rather keeps my skin looking dewy fresh, which is a refreshing delight. One note, however, I have noticed that I have to be careful when wearing white that I don&#x27;t allow anything white to touch my face as the bronzer will rub off on the clothing. Maybe if it has a chance to set up, this wouldn&#x27;t happen though. In summary, I notice this product is becoming my go-to product no matter where I&#x27;m going or what I&#x27;m doing. I&#x27;ve even started using it daily as my moisturizer. One more thing, I&#x27;ve noticed that it is removed easily in the evening with a microfiber face cloth and just water. UPDATE: After using this daily for a year and a half, I still love it as much as I did in 2015. I don&#x27;t go a day without it, and now at 58, I still get compliments on my skin. Thank you for this amazing product!</li>
            <li> Though nice texture, didn&#x27;t work for me as a bronzer.  Saw no difference after applying.  Probably best to use as a foundation but on my face, it did not &amp;#34;bronze&amp;#34; or enhance with tan look.</li>
            <li> Just started using...no issues...quick service</li>
            <li> Awesome product!! Protects my face from the harsh sun here in Hawai&#x60;i. It&#x27;s great for my sensitive acne prone skin. Love this and would definaltly recomend!!!</li>
            <li> I have found my new favorite suncare product!  Being fair skinned and having several positive skin cancer results, I&#x27;m always searching for a product that &amp;#34;is the one.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m grateful to have found this product and will be a long term customer!</li>
            <li> Good product but not the best. It&#x27;s a little on the greasy side. The color is a little darker than I expected, but if you blend well, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Best product for mature skin I&#x27;ve found .  Love how smoothly it goes on without feeling heavy or sticky.  Want to look tan without worrying about getting more  Wrinkles!  Recommended to all my friends  and their families!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a scooter rider, my only mode of transpo on this beautiful, but very sunshiny island of Kauai- not so skin friendly! This stuff is amazing, lite texture (I don&#x27;t like most face creams in this humidity) &amp; keeps my pretty smooth face from becoming a hard, wrinkly walnut looking hag! (Not that I have anything against wrinkly hags, most of them are quite sweet &amp; charming), I&#x27;m just not ready to become one yet... all in good time...&lt;br /&gt;I still achieve a nice, even, golden tone of tan, which is partly why we live here, innit?&lt;br /&gt;Use this lotion religiously, your skin will glow from within &amp; without!!!</li>
            <li> Found product to be of good quality, goes on flawlessly and looks natural.  Would highly recommend using this product for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> Overall I liked the results this gave me. I was looking for something that would give me a nice looking tan and not one that makes me long like a pumpkin haha. This did the trick it gave me a nice even tan and I love it! I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> One of the best face bronzer you could ever have. This thing is a beauty. I would recommend you to purchase this if you are having issues with your beauty, but nonetheless this is a keeper. I use this stuff one awhile and the affects are beautiful. The pristine effects that produces the outcome is marvelous and I have to say that is a real product. Keep the beauty in line of check and look marvelous!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth not shiny. The tint is subtle but gives skin a nice glow. Only three stars because I think is was a bit over priced. I have used over the counter broker creams that are similar and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it every day after my normal face regime. It is light and gives my face a beautiful glow. I love that it has sunscreen in it too! Not too greasy and doesn&#x27;t make me breakout! It also is a bronzer so gives me a little coverage!!! Awesome product and smells so good too!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for a month and I love it! It&#x27;s really light wait but moisturizing for my dry sensitive skin. It gives me natural bronzed glow that lasts me all day. I work out doors and it gives me the sun protection I need. I no longer have to wear a heavy makeup foundation.</li>
            <li> Love the feel, the smell, and it gives my skin an amazing glow.</li>
