    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This mousse is a wonderful product for her.</li>
            <li>It does smell good, though!</li>
            <li>/&gt;*you don&#x27;t actually win any money with this product</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am extremely happy with this product for my child.</li>
            <li>It has a great smell, is alcohol-free and is not sticky.  </li>
            <li>It smells really good, too.</li>
            <li>A reapplication would be needed to look good all day.</li>
            <li>It smelled good and did not make my hair stick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bulky and sticky, and the kids loved the smell.</li>
            <li>Which is good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this and have had good results.  </li>
            <li>This to me was a good thing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not 100% sure why kids need mousse, but if they do, this is a great option.</li>
            <li>Cherry Bop Mousse is a nice product that yields a fairly good result.</li>
            <li>This is a very light, pleasant scent--</li>
            <li>The girls love the smell!</li>
            <li>I liked this mousse</li>
            <li>We found the smell was nice and not over powering.</li>
            <li>This works better at hold than nothing but not as good as gel</li>
            <li>The smell was nice and not too overpowering</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant light smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells nice and the packaging is colorful and attractive to kids.</li>
            <li>My children&#x27;s hair looked much better this time around! :)</li>
            <li>This mousse does a nice job of taming the flyaways and keeping her hair more neat looking.  </li>
            <li>I found this product worked better on fine hair and did not do a good job taming curls.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is a very good hair care/styling product for kids and most any young girl-</li>
            <li>mousse is much better for us.</li>
            <li>unlike many kids&#x27; products, it&#x27;s not cloying.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: I was given a free bottle of this mousse to try in exchange for posting my honest review via The Amazon Vine program.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker and heavier than most mousses (unless the plural of mousse is mousse, like moose).</li>
            <li>It almost acts more like a pomade.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve found that this also helped in dispelling that static from her hair.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Love having a mousse on hand</li>
            <li>/&gt;So while this is a kids product I see myself using it more than my kids.  </li>
            <li>Maybe a better selection for ages 3 to 5...</li>
            <li>The mousse is easy to use, and comes out of the bottle with the easy pump that even preschoolers can do on their own.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s kid friendly!  </li>
            <li>It goes on best when their hair is wet.</li>
            <li>But I tend to think it&#x27;s a better fit for what I am wanting to achieve with my hair.</li>
            <li>Let him/her have some fun with \\&quot;his\\&quot; or \\&quot;her\\&quot; own hair care products.  </li>
            <li>This reasonably priced product is good for adults, too.</li>
            <li>This smells nice and is fun to use.  </li>
            <li>This is great, they love it, and it was far more worth</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and it is easily applied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough that I&#x27;m not worried about it making her hair look oily, and it smells wonderful- a light and clean</li>
            <li>The smell goes away relatively quickly and is very light after application.</li>
            <li>Though fine for a kid&#x27;s strands, you wouldn&#x27;t want to use it yourself unless you want to smell like you stopped at a carnival on the way to work.</li>
            <li>I tried this on my son&#x27;s hair and it was fine</li>
            <li>It keeps her curls in good shape and is very natural looking.</li>
            <li>Its a pleasant light smell though and not heavy like a perfume or cologne.</li>
            <li>Since they are in elementary school, they also love and appreciate anything made specifically with kids in mind and for that reason alone, they really enjoy this product from Suave.</li>
            <li>This was a fun great smelling product that was tried by both my daughter and I (42 year old Mom).  </li>
            <li>She loves the smell and I enjoy it too.  </li>
            <li>This mousse is cute, fun, and tames hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hold is light</li>
            <li>The cherry vanilla scent is light and pleasing.  </li>
            <li>The smell is sweet though a bit too strong.  </li>
            <li>It is very light, which works very well on her fine curls.</li>
            <li>My girls love to have their hair done and they want to look pretty.</li>
            <li>It works great with dry hair.</li>
            <li>I wanted to see if this product might create a slightly more natural product, since I have tried so many for adults.</li>
            <li>I found I had to use a lot to get it to have any kind of smoothing quality and without using a fair amount my granddaughter&#x27;s hair was not free of frizz.  </li>
            <li>importantly, this mousse smells like the fresh air parts of a casino (think hotel lobby, casino restaurants or the transition between one casino and another).</li>
            <li>so if your child is one like mine that is constantly running fingers through their hair this product will not be sufficiently strong to keep that perfectly styled look very long.</li>
            <li>It smells very pretty.</li>
            <li>I also really like the style of the pump and how easily it dispenses the product.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has very curly super fine hair.</li>
            <li>It does control frizz, as promised, and the smell is very nice- fresh and clean, and not too heavy.</li>
            <li>this mousse is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a nice product</li>
            <li>Overall, I liked this.</li>
            <li>The curls are wavy and more subtle than I would ideally like, but I have come to terms that my curls will never be as natural and bouncy as they were when I was a kid.</li>
            <li>, this mousse is good for other reasons.</li>
            <li>This mousse gave just the right amount of hold and body for us.  </li>
            <li>&quot; I put it in her hair right after her bath and then comb and scrunch it.</li>
            <li>Now, not only do you look smart, your wallet doesn&#x27;t look much thinner for having bought this, and your kids smells good too.</li>
            <li>My daughter has naturally wavy/curly hair that tends to get kind of wild.  </li>
            <li>The scent may be a bit unusual for an adult like myself, but otherwise it&#x27;s top notch.</li>
            <li>It dries nicely in her hair and as long as we don&#x27;t use too much it isn&#x27;t noticeable that there is product in her hair.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty inexpensive to start with</li>
            <li>It only takes a small amount applied to the hair to make it look its best and hair</li>
            <li>only issue the many multi-syllable ingredients contained in this mousse.</li>
            <li>But it is worth the mention that she can&#x27;t make her hair go all spikey mohawk when she wants to be a goof</li>
            <li>My wife tried this out first.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I must confess that I stole this from the kids.</li>
            <li>It had a traditional Mousse feel and continues to be a favorite in our house.</li>
            <li>I got this mousse for my daughter who has very curly but very soft and fine hair.</li>
            <li>I picked this up for my 7 year old so she could have her own Mousse, and because I liked the fact it doesn&#x27;t have as harsh of chemicals in it as my adult stuff she&#x27;s always liking to use or sneak as girls will do!</li>
            <li>So we&#x27;re settling on 3 pumps, and less on top!</li>
            <li>it comes out pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>Her hair is long and she also has alot of hair static.</li>
            <li>Either way it doesnt like very long (couple hours at most).</li>
            <li>This seems like the perfect balance for hair that you want to tame, but not weigh down like gel.</li>
            <li>I noted that it kind of left my curls and waves more \\&quot;separated\\&quot; into ringlets and I certainly had less frizz, but didn&#x27;t have nearly the \\&quot;crunchy-ness\\</li>
            <li>My daughter has very curly hair</li>
            <li>her curls hold their shape very well for the majority of the day.</li>
            <li>had to do some experimenting to figure out how much product to use and where to use it--</li>
            <li>My toe-headed child has straight as a board hair</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to hold very well since it&#x27;s geared toward children.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong, so a little goes a loooong way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides the kid- friendly factor and obvious kid appeal</li>
            <li>This is better than some other kid&#x27;s hair styling mousse my girls have tried, some of which makes their hair look like an oil</li>
            <li>Unlike many other products I have tried, it dries and looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I find most mousse products to create crunchy styles that often have a very wet appearance.</li>
            <li>This cherry vanilla smell is sweet but not overwhelming, the product goes on easily and not that much is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of my daughter&#x27;s has fine long hair and doesn&#x27;t curl well.  </li>
            <li>and parent- will find it better than average.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old has very fine but extremely curly hair.</li>
            <li>She said it gave her decent control and cleared up bedhead (she has no time to wash her hair in the morning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all, the product is fine, if you know to use very little and want the sweet scent ... but using adult mousse on the whole family could save you money and shelf space on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>(they&#x27;re of mixed origin so they have very curly hair; enviably gorgeous, but hard to comb curly).  </li>
            <li>It may work on other hair types, but not my daughters fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>she dislikes is that it doesn&#x27;t quite hold the same, hold as hard or as high, but it still does do a really good job</li>
            <li>So great for fine curls, but not good for thick hair.</li>
            <li>It does dispense very quickly and is therefore easy to waste, so you need to be careful when you use it.</li>
            <li>Then I tried doing 4 pumps in her hair (which is long and wavy) and the top of her hair got crunchy and flat.</li>
            <li>I got this new Suave Kids</li>
            <li>Her hair will look great for a few hours, and then it starts to fall and the curls get limp.</li>
            <li>Up till now I&#x27;ve sufficed with a teeny, tiny amount of leave in conditioner in her hair when the occasion calls for pretty hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the light hold it gives with very little applied.</li>
            <li>looks natural after applying.</li>
            <li>and I prefer her using this to adult products with harsher chemicals any day of the week.</li>
            <li>We used this on my 10 year old daughters hair to keep her hair smoothed.</li>
            <li>put the adult stuff on your child.  </li>
            <li>Cherry Vanilla Bop mousse for my 9 year old granddaughter, since she is ALWAYS wanting to steal my \\&quot;grown-up\\&quot; mousse.  </li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s alcohol free, I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is.  </li>
            <li>Like all Suave Kids products, this mousse smells heavenly and offers just the right amount for little ones.</li>
            <li>One has thick, wavy hair, and one has fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li>My girl has long wavyish hair (sometimes straight, sometimes wavy, almost always tangled), so I&#x27;m always on the look out for something that actually helps with grooming.</li>
            <li>It still left my hair looking somewhat natural although you could tell there was product in</li>
            <li>It offers something different than my \\&quot;adult\\&quot; mousse.  </li>
            <li>but I used it on my nieces hair (one has thick curly hair and the other straight baby fine hair).</li>
            <li>Glad that it&#x27;s alcohol free, but would appreciate less artificial ingredients in a kids product.</li>
            <li>I thoroughly put this on either wet or dry hair before putting hot curlers in.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It is pretty inexpensive to start with</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount applied to the hair to make it look its best and hair</li>
            <li> only issue the many multi-syllable ingredients contained in this mousse.</li>
            <li> But it is worth the mention that she can&#x27;t make her hair go all spikey mohawk when she wants to be a goof</li>
            <li> My wife tried this out first.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I must confess that I stole this from the kids.</li>
            <li> It had a traditional Mousse feel and continues to be a favorite in our house.</li>
            <li> I got this mousse for my daughter who has very curly but very soft and fine hair.</li>
            <li> I picked this up for my 7 year old so she could have her own Mousse, and because I liked the fact it doesn&#x27;t have as harsh of chemicals in it as my adult stuff she&#x27;s always liking to use or sneak as girls will do!</li>
            <li> So we&#x27;re settling on 3 pumps, and less on top!</li>
            <li> it comes out pretty fast.  </li>
            <li> Her hair is long and she also has alot of hair static.</li>
            <li> Either way it doesnt like very long (couple hours at most).</li>
            <li> This seems like the perfect balance for hair that you want to tame, but not weigh down like gel.</li>
            <li> I noted that it kind of left my curls and waves more \\&quot;separated\\&quot; into ringlets and I certainly had less frizz, but didn&#x27;t have nearly the \\&quot;crunchy-ness\\</li>
            <li> My daughter has very curly hair</li>
            <li> her curls hold their shape very well for the majority of the day.</li>
            <li> had to do some experimenting to figure out how much product to use and where to use it--</li>
            <li> My toe-headed child has straight as a board hair</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to hold very well since it&#x27;s geared toward children.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong, so a little goes a loooong way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides the kid- friendly factor and obvious kid appeal</li>
            <li> This is better than some other kid&#x27;s hair styling mousse my girls have tried, some of which makes their hair look like an oil</li>
            <li> Unlike many other products I have tried, it dries and looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I find most mousse products to create crunchy styles that often have a very wet appearance.</li>
            <li> This cherry vanilla smell is sweet but not overwhelming, the product goes on easily and not that much is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of my daughter&#x27;s has fine long hair and doesn&#x27;t curl well.  </li>
            <li> and parent- will find it better than average.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old has very fine but extremely curly hair.</li>
            <li> She said it gave her decent control and cleared up bedhead (she has no time to wash her hair in the morning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All in all, the product is fine, if you know to use very little and want the sweet scent ... but using adult mousse on the whole family could save you money and shelf space on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> (they&#x27;re of mixed origin so they have very curly hair; enviably gorgeous, but hard to comb curly).  </li>
            <li> It may work on other hair types, but not my daughters fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> she dislikes is that it doesn&#x27;t quite hold the same, hold as hard or as high, but it still does do a really good job</li>
            <li> So great for fine curls, but not good for thick hair.</li>
            <li> It does dispense very quickly and is therefore easy to waste, so you need to be careful when you use it.</li>
            <li> Then I tried doing 4 pumps in her hair (which is long and wavy) and the top of her hair got crunchy and flat.</li>
            <li> I got this new Suave Kids</li>
            <li> Her hair will look great for a few hours, and then it starts to fall and the curls get limp.</li>
            <li> Up till now I&#x27;ve sufficed with a teeny, tiny amount of leave in conditioner in her hair when the occasion calls for pretty hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the light hold it gives with very little applied.</li>
            <li> looks natural after applying.</li>
            <li> and I prefer her using this to adult products with harsher chemicals any day of the week.</li>
            <li> We used this on my 10 year old daughters hair to keep her hair smoothed.</li>
            <li> put the adult stuff on your child.  </li>
            <li> Cherry Vanilla Bop mousse for my 9 year old granddaughter, since she is ALWAYS wanting to steal my \\&quot;grown-up\\&quot; mousse.  </li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s alcohol free, I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is.  </li>
            <li> Like all Suave Kids products, this mousse smells heavenly and offers just the right amount for little ones.</li>
            <li> One has thick, wavy hair, and one has fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li> My girl has long wavyish hair (sometimes straight, sometimes wavy, almost always tangled), so I&#x27;m always on the look out for something that actually helps with grooming.</li>
            <li> It still left my hair looking somewhat natural although you could tell there was product in</li>
            <li> It offers something different than my \\&quot;adult\\&quot; mousse.  </li>
            <li> but I used it on my nieces hair (one has thick curly hair and the other straight baby fine hair).</li>
            <li> Glad that it&#x27;s alcohol free, but would appreciate less artificial ingredients in a kids product.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly put this on either wet or dry hair before putting hot curlers in.  </li>
            <li> and it is hard to find kid friendly styling products that aren&#x27;t super expensive.</li>
            <li> She was a bit disappointed but loved the pump bottle and the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to move on to some \\&quot;adult\\&quot; hair mousse or curl cremes because a few others that I&#x27;ve tried so far do last all day.</li>
            <li> Does well with adult hair, too, but ultimately its \\&quot;just right\\&quot; for little girls to tame their curls (without feeling you are pushing them into adult grooming routines before their time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t have such a hard effect on her hair, like my products do, and she still has her baby soft, thin blonde hair, it washes out easy and smells like a little girls hair should, not over her age even though she&#x27;s trying to be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is no residue left in our straight, thin, and normally flat hair.  </li>
            <li> My little girl had been eyeing this mousse at Target during our last two trips and I finally gave in and bought a bottle as a reward.</li>
            <li> It does fade once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> My kids love to play with their hair, but I don&#x27;t want to waste my really expensive product on them.  </li>
            <li> As long as I keep the product toward the bottom of my hair, it doesn&#x27;t create an overly greasy or wet appearance appearance.</li>
            <li> My youngest has wispy, loose curls which products don&#x27;t work well in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a minor difference in any case, but does seem to cut back on the frizz a little.</li>
            <li> Less crunchy than regular mousse.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t crunchy or wet looking like some mousse, but it still stiffened curls and pulled them straighter rather than adding definition.  </li>
            <li> Their baths are taken at night, and there&#x27;s really no point in putting it on then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We actually took it with us when we made pictures a few days ago.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to sting their scalp or eyes (though I was careful not to get it in their eyes), and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure why kids need a separate product for their hair; does regular mousse have an age limit?</li>
            <li> It was a big mess!!</li>
            <li> My boys have wild hair that is very hard to manage.</li>
            <li> only complaint:</li>
            <li> and i like being reminded of doubling down on a 7/4 hand and getting a 10!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and she tends to get lots of flyaways in the front whether her hair is up or down.  </li>
            <li> This product does nothing for my curls and disappears into my eldest daughter&#x27;s tight, frizzy, voluminous curls as though it had never been applied.</li>
            <li> Both myself and my little girl like this Suave mousse for kids.  </li>
            <li> The cherry vanilla scent is the selling point, I think, and adults may find it a little cloying.</li>
            <li> They are all too heavy in her hair.</li>
            <li> We tried this mousse in hopes that it would help tame her curls and give them a little shape, and it did just that.  </li>
            <li> It is really hard to wash off of my hands after and my hands feel sticky for a while.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t sticky or hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Suave gel, and while we like it, it&#x27;s proved a little difficult for our schedules.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is so thin that ponytails often fall apart.  </li>
            <li> I found this product to be of average quality--not necessarily bad but nothing to write home about.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave a weird residue when she goes to sleep with it</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Both of them always end up with crazy hair in their pictures, though.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this mousse is pretty cool. my daughter likes to use it herself, it keeps her hair from getting too frizzy in humid weather and it doesn&#x27;t leave a weird residue when she goes to sleep with it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;more importantly, this mousse smells like the fresh air parts of a casino (think hotel lobby, casino restaurants or the transition between one casino and another). this is a big deal for me, because i like casinos and i like being reminded of doubling down on a 7/4 hand and getting a 10!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;*works well&lt;br /&gt;*no residue&lt;br /&gt;*smells like gambling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;*you don&#x27;t actually win any money with this product</li>
            <li> My daughter has very curly hair and she tends to get lots of flyaways in the front whether her hair is up or down.  This mousse does a nice job of taming the flyaways and keeping her hair more neat looking.  She loves the smell and I enjoy it too.  It dries nicely in her hair and as long as we don&#x27;t use too much it isn&#x27;t noticeable that there is product in her hair.  The one thing I don&#x27;t like about it is how sticky it is.  It is really hard to wash off of my hands after and my hands feel sticky for a while.  Overall it is a nice product and it is hard to find kid friendly styling products that aren&#x27;t super expensive.</li>
            <li> This cherry vanilla smell is sweet but not overwhelming, the product goes on easily and not that much is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Suave commercials of yesteryear always had the \\&quot;don&#x27;t you look smart?\\&quot; byline. Now, not only do you look smart, your wallet doesn&#x27;t look much thinner for having bought this, and your kids smells good too. Win-win.</li>
            <li> All of us have various types of curls and we all need different products. My youngest has wispy, loose curls which products don&#x27;t work well in. They are all too heavy in her hair. Up till now I&#x27;ve sufficed with a teeny, tiny amount of leave in conditioner in her hair when the occasion calls for pretty hair. But she always ends up with a wispy, untamed, frizzy look. This product eliminates that. It is very light, which works very well on her fine curls. her curls hold their shape very well for the majority of the day. It isn&#x27;t sticky or hard. I use 1 pump per day. It is pretty inexpensive to start with and I see the bottle lasting quite a while. My daughter also loves the smell. This product does nothing for my curls and disappears into my eldest daughter&#x27;s tight, frizzy, voluminous curls as though it had never been applied. No joke. So great for fine curls, but not good for thick hair.</li>
            <li> My girls love to have their hair done and they want to look pretty. Since they are in elementary school, they also love and appreciate anything made specifically with kids in mind and for that reason alone, they really enjoy this product from Suave. It is made for kids and it helps to keep hair from frizzing and make it look its best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the kid- friendly factor and obvious kid appeal, this mousse is good for other reasons. It does control frizz, as promised, and the smell is very nice- fresh and clean, and not too heavy. It only takes a small amount applied to the hair to make it look its best and hair looks natural after applying. This is better than some other kid&#x27;s hair styling mousse my girls have tried, some of which makes their hair look like an oil slick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave seems to have hit the mark with this product. It does dispense very quickly and is therefore easy to waste, so you need to be careful when you use it. Otherwise, it is a very good hair care/styling product for kids and most any young girl- and parent- will find it better than average.</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t care for this.  It isn&#x27;t crunchy or wet looking like some mousse, but it still stiffened curls and pulled them straighter rather than adding definition.  The smell is sweet though a bit too strong.  It does fade once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> My boys have wild hair that is very hard to manage. One has thick, wavy hair, and one has fine, curly hair. Both of them always end up with crazy hair in their pictures, though. I&#x27;ve been using the Suave gel, and while we like it, it&#x27;s proved a little difficult for our schedules. It goes on best when their hair is wet. Their baths are taken at night, and there&#x27;s really no point in putting it on then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mousse is much better for us. It works great with dry hair. We actually took it with us when we made pictures a few days ago. My children&#x27;s hair looked much better this time around! :)</li>
            <li> My little girl had been eyeing this mousse at Target during our last two trips and I finally gave in and bought a bottle as a reward. Like all Suave Kids products, this mousse smells heavenly and offers just the right amount for little ones. My girl has long wavyish hair (sometimes straight, sometimes wavy, almost always tangled), so I&#x27;m always on the look out for something that actually helps with grooming. This mousse is cute, fun, and tames hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue the many multi-syllable ingredients contained in this mousse. Glad that it&#x27;s alcohol free, but would appreciate less artificial ingredients in a kids product. Overall, a decent amount for less than three bucks.</li>
            <li> This is a very light, pleasant scent-- unlike many kids&#x27; products, it&#x27;s not cloying. My bottle says \\&quot;Cherry Vanilla Soda,\\&quot; but they must have changed it to \\&quot;Cherry Vanilla Bop\\&quot; recently. I don&#x27;t think I would have identified that as the scent, but whatever it is, it&#x27;s both kid-friendly and grown-up friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to do some experimenting to figure out how much product to use and where to use it-- the bottle says to use 2 pumps, from roots to tips of hair. That wasn&#x27;t enough for us-- I tried it on my daughter and myself and it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything. Then I tried doing 4 pumps in her hair (which is long and wavy) and the top of her hair got crunchy and flat. So we&#x27;re settling on 3 pumps, and less on top! It&#x27;s a minor difference in any case, but does seem to cut back on the frizz a little.</li>
            <li> This cherry vanilla Bop mousse smells yummy, but not too overpowering.  The hold is light so if your child is one like mine that is constantly running fingers through their hair this product will not be sufficiently strong to keep that perfectly styled look very long.</li>
            <li> Both myself and my little girl like this Suave mousse for kids.  The cherry vanilla scent is light and pleasing.  There is no residue left in our straight, thin, and normally flat hair.  This mousse gave just the right amount of hold and body for us.  I also really like the style of the pump and how easily it dispenses the product.  I will be continuing to buy this mousse for both myself and my daughter.</li>
            <li> One of my daughter&#x27;s has fine long hair and doesn&#x27;t curl well.  I thoroughly put this on either wet or dry hair before putting hot curlers in.  I&#x27;m amazed at how well the curls hold while using this.  The girls love the smell!</li>
            <li> My kids love to play with their hair, but I don&#x27;t want to waste my really expensive product on them.  So, I went ahead and ordered the mousse from Suave that was built for kids.  This is great, they love it, and it was far more worth what they use it for to play with their hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very curly super fine hair. This just did not work at all to define the curls. After I put the mousse in it, some of the hair straightened out and some was curly. It was a big mess!! I was trying to avoid spraying things because she doesn&#x27;t like the spray, but this is not a solution. It may work on other hair types, but not my daughters fine curly hair. It does smell good, though!</li>
            <li> I picked this up for my 7 year old so she could have her own Mousse, and because I liked the fact it doesn&#x27;t have as harsh of chemicals in it as my adult stuff she&#x27;s always liking to use or sneak as girls will do! It smells really good, too. What I like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t have such a hard effect on her hair, like my products do, and she still has her baby soft, thin blonde hair, it washes out easy and smells like a little girls hair should, not over her age even though she&#x27;s trying to be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What she dislikes is that it doesn&#x27;t quite hold the same, hold as hard or as high, but it still does do a really good job and I prefer her using this to adult products with harsher chemicals any day of the week. But it is worth the mention that she can&#x27;t make her hair go all spikey mohawk when she wants to be a goof, she needs gel for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My 3 year old has very fine but extremely curly hair. This mousse is a wonderful product for her. I love the fact that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It doesn&#x27;t make her hair \\&quot;hard.\\&quot; I put it in her hair right after her bath and then comb and scrunch it. Unlike many other products I have tried, it dries and looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;2. It keeps the frizz away.&lt;br /&gt;3. Even if it gets misted again it still helps fight the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;4. It has a pleasant light smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am extremely happy with this product for my child. It keeps her curls in good shape and is very natural looking.</li>
            <li> I find most mousse products to create crunchy styles that often have a very wet appearance. I wanted to see if this product might create a slightly more natural product, since I have tried so many for adults. The Suave Kids Cherry Bop Mousse is a nice product that yields a fairly good result. As long as I keep the product toward the bottom of my hair, it doesn&#x27;t create an overly greasy or wet appearance appearance. The curls are wavy and more subtle than I would ideally like, but I have come to terms that my curls will never be as natural and bouncy as they were when I was a kid. Overall, I liked this. The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and it is easily applied.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be of average quality--not necessarily bad but nothing to write home about.  I found I had to use a lot to get it to have any kind of smoothing quality and without using a fair amount my granddaughter&#x27;s hair was not free of frizz.  It smells nice and the packaging is colorful and attractive to kids.</li>
            <li> My daughter has naturally wavy/curly hair that tends to get kind of wild.  We tried this mousse in hopes that it would help tame her curls and give them a little shape, and it did just that.  It&#x27;s light enough that I&#x27;m not worried about it making her hair look oily, and it smells wonderful- a light and clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint: it comes out pretty fast.  One pump of the dispenser fills my palm with growing, foaming mousse.  That&#x27;s a lot for a child&#x27;s head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was given a free bottle of this mousse to try in exchange for posting my honest review via The Amazon Vine program.</li>
            <li> If your kids don&#x27;t have greasy hair, they just might after using this mousse. It&#x27;s thicker and heavier than most mousses (unless the plural of mousse is mousse, like moose). It almost acts more like a pomade. It&#x27;s very strong, so a little goes a loooong way. I&#x27;m not really sure why kids need a separate product for their hair; does regular mousse have an age limit? The cherry vanilla scent is the selling point, I think, and adults may find it a little cloying. Though fine for a kid&#x27;s strands, you wouldn&#x27;t want to use it yourself unless you want to smell like you stopped at a carnival on the way to work. All in all, the product is fine, if you know to use very little and want the sweet scent ... but using adult mousse on the whole family could save you money and shelf space on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I got this mousse for my daughter who has very curly but very soft and fine hair. The mousse is easy to use, and comes out of the bottle with the easy pump that even preschoolers can do on their own. It smells very pretty. However, the hold doesn&#x27;t last all day. Her hair will look great for a few hours, and then it starts to fall and the curls get limp. A reapplication would be needed to look good all day. I think I&#x27;m going to move on to some \\&quot;adult\\&quot; hair mousse or curl cremes because a few others that I&#x27;ve tried so far do last all day.</li>
            <li> We used this on my 10 year old daughters hair to keep her hair smoothed. Her hair is long and she also has alot of hair static. We&#x27;ve found that this also helped in dispelling that static from her hair. The smell is as advertised; some sort of vanilla/cherry mix. Its a pleasant light smell though and not heavy like a perfume or cologne. Either way it doesnt like very long (couple hours at most).</li>
            <li> I saw this and thought, \\&quot;Mousse for kids??\\&quot;  Then it dawned on me that my niece uses haircare products on her children all the time (they&#x27;re of mixed origin so they have very curly hair; enviably gorgeous, but hard to comb curly).  My toe-headed child has straight as a board hair but I thought, \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot;  This stuff smells so yummy you may want to eat it.  Don&#x27;t.  I didn&#x27;t expect it to hold very well since it&#x27;s geared toward children.  I was wrong.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is so thin that ponytails often fall apart.  Between this and some hairspray, Voila! I got them to work for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t put the adult stuff on your child.  Let him/her have some fun with \\&quot;his\\&quot; or \\&quot;her\\&quot; own hair care products.  I would suggest starting with this one.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I liked this mousse and I am not a child anymore. This reasonably priced product is good for adults, too. It smelled good and did not make my hair stick. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> My wife tried this out first.  She said it gave her decent control and cleared up bedhead (she has no time to wash her hair in the morning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kids like it because their hair is all over the place in the morning.  We can dampen their hair and then apply this to get rid of bed hair.  It&#x27;s not bulky and sticky, and the kids loved the smell.</li>
            <li> First of all, I must confess that I stole this from the kids. I really like the light hold it gives with very little applied. This seems like the perfect balance for hair that you want to tame, but not weigh down like gel. The smell goes away relatively quickly and is very light after application. So you don&#x27;t smell like vanilla all day. Which is good.</li>
            <li> This was a fun great smelling product that was tried by both my daughter and I (42 year old Mom).  We found the smell was nice and not over powering. It had a traditional Mousse feel and continues to be a favorite in our house.</li>
            <li> Love having a mousse on hand that&#x27;s kid friendly!  I had my neice in mind when I picked this up--she definitely got the family curls.  This smells nice and is fun to use.  Does well with adult hair, too, but ultimately its \\&quot;just right\\&quot; for little girls to tame their curls (without feeling you are pushing them into adult grooming routines before their time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this and have had good results.  This works as a styling gel. The scent may be a bit unusual for an adult like myself, but otherwise it&#x27;s top notch.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my son&#x27;s hair and it was fine but he still prefers gel.  He likes the firmer hold.  This works better at hold than nothing but not as good as gel obviously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d try it on my hair as I use mousse sometimes when I let my hair stay curly.  This definitely has a different feel than traditional mousse.  Less crunchy than regular mousse.  I noted that it kind of left my curls and waves more \\&quot;separated\\&quot; into ringlets and I certainly had less frizz, but didn&#x27;t have nearly the \\&quot;crunchy-ness\\&quot; that you can get with regular mousse.  This to me was a good thing.  It still left my hair looking somewhat natural although you could tell there was product in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while this is a kids product I see myself using it more than my kids.  It offers something different than my \\&quot;adult\\&quot; mousse.  Maybe that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s alcohol free, I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is.  But I tend to think it&#x27;s a better fit for what I am wanting to achieve with my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product. I&#x27;m not 100% sure why kids need mousse, but if they do, this is a great option. Doesn&#x27;t seem to sting their scalp or eyes (though I was careful not to get it in their eyes), and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I got this new Suave Kids Cherry Vanilla Bop mousse for my 9 year old granddaughter, since she is ALWAYS wanting to steal my \\&quot;grown-up\\&quot; mousse.  It has a great smell, is alcohol-free and is not sticky.  However, it is only a conditioning/moisturizing mousse and has no \\&quot;hold\\&quot; power.  She was a bit disappointed but loved the pump bottle and the fragrance. Maybe a better selection for ages 3 to 5...</li>
            <li> The consistency reminded me of a hand sanitizer. I guess it is the way the product is dispensed (hand pump versus airesol) . The smell was nice and not too overpowering but I used it on my nieces hair (one has thick curly hair and the other straight baby fine hair). I found this product worked better on fine hair and did not do a good job taming curls.</li>
