            <li>I&#x27;ve never been good at curling my hair ever and have tried it all.</li>

            <li>But that&#x27;s my own fault.</li>
            <li>I liked that it came with a glove because I was worried about burning my fingers</li>

            <li>ive wanted one of these for a while but wasnt sure if it would work on my hair</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it....</li>
            <li>and I love to us it</li>
            <li>, i love it, please trust me.</li>
            <li>I will practice more in hopes it will work the way it is supposed to</li>
            <li>Not terrible.</li>
            <li>I like more defined curls than I have.</li>
            <li>I love the wave/curls this gives.</li>
            <li>More precise curls with those</li>
            <li>Good quality product with fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Fun, fun toy!!!</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and it doesn&#x27;t create very good curls.  </li>
            <li>I had hoped to find a replacement for my Hot Tools wand that would hold onto my already curly hair better.</li>
            <li>I love this curling is very practical and comfortable</li>
            <li>Hard to get the hang of using it on yourself, but once you do it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Nice spiral curls that loosen over time into waves the second day.</li>
            <li>Worth it?</li>
            <li>I had to get my money&#x27;s worth somehow...</li>
            <li>It has different  heat setting which is great for those with fine hair who need less heat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier and more efficient to use a regular curling iron</li>
            <li>Love the big waves and curls</li>
            <li>only one girl out of about seven or eight we able to get it to work</li>
            <li>is a picture of the first time i did my hair using something like this.</li>
            <li>I was super excited when I received this item, it only took 2 days to reach my door step.</li>
            <li>The product has no fault &amp; gets hot haha, that&#x27;s all I can say.</li>
            <li>it is all hot and ready for me to do my hair.</li>
            <li>The high temperature isn&#x27;t as hot as my other iron I have, which is fine because I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast</li>
            <li>i let mine heat while i get ready for college in the moring and by the time im done getting dressed</li>
            <li>Product works very well.</li>
            <li>I prefer the straight ceramic wands for extensions.</li>
            <li>Highly unsatisfied!</li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t like much is the cord.  </li>
            <li>other than that i love the way my hair turns</li>
            <li>Tho when I first plugged it in the heat wasn&#x27;t near hot enough to even hold a curl.</li>
            <li>Curles hair quickly with minimal heat needed.</li>
            <li>Looks natural and shiny.</li>
            <li>Leaves a natural wavery.</li>
            <li>Glove is not tight knit and looks like heat will burn skin through</li>
            <li>My hair is long layered from shoulder to belly button so its good for all lengths because  you can put shorter sections where the barrel  is narrow and wide sections around the bubble.</li>
            <li>I could grasp the wand on high heat for example on how low the heat source is.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend using the included heating glove for younger girls since there is no clamp to hold the hair to the wand.</li>
            <li>Otherwise creates amazing curls that will last at least two days!</li>
            <li>it makes it hard to hold your hair and it makes for a better glove to wear outside than it does to do your hair</li>
            <li>This iron didn&#x27;t work well on my hair, I have fine but thick hair.</li>
            <li>Apparently I&#x27;m stuck with this though as returning it doesn&#x27;t seem to be an option.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use whether I section it by a little or a thick section,  </li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t mangle the plastic opening the thing, I would have returned it because I learned how to curl with my flat iron the day after I ordered this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my hair isn&#x27;t long enough</li>
            <li> and i tend to loose the peices</li>
            <li> &gt;  the only down side is the glove.</li>
            <li> Never really happens for me.</li>
            <li> I was shocked that it only took me ten minutes to do the first time.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, due to the variations in size in this wand, the curls are not well defined.</li>
            <li> It is not very pliable at all!</li>
            <li> Using this iron and bigger chunks has cut my hair curling time in half!!</li>
            <li> Not very friendly to use</li>
            <li> but her hair was really long and mine goes just past my shoulders</li>
            <li> Will mess with it when I have time</li>
            <li> But it is not worth the time or any heat damage to use this to define my already messy curls.</li>
            <li> so i took to youtube to do a little research before buying one for myself.</li>
            <li> It does take a little getting used to</li>
            <li> Not cute at all!</li>
            <li> after watching a few videos i was slightly skeptical because it seemed to not work on anybodys hair.</li>
            <li> Very hard to use, maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> So frustrating!</li>
            <li> It was too difficult to use.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s difficult when working with it.</li>
            <li> I watched you tube video tutorials, but still burn my fingers through the glove, my curls turn out awful</li>

            <li> i am still learning to use the curling wand I like the way it has different heat settings  It heats up fast I ll write more when I learn to use it better</li>
            <li> Love love love this. Perfect curling wand for me.</li>
            <li> Love it. Perfect beach curly. Curles hair quickly with minimal heat needed. Looks natural and shiny.</li>
            <li> This curling wand does take some getting used to, I would recommend taking smaller sections than what the instructions suggests. Otherwise creates amazing curls that will last at least two days!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t figure out how to use it..! But that&#x27;s my own fault. The product has no fault &amp; gets hot haha, that&#x27;s all I can say. If I didn&#x27;t mangle the plastic opening the thing, I would have returned it because I learned how to curl with my flat iron the day after I ordered this. Will mess with it when I have time, maybe watch YouTube.</li>

            <li> Great product all received as promised!! Fun, fun toy!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even power on. Glove is not tight knit and looks like heat will burn skin through</li>
            <li> My wand has already quit working.  It no longer heats up enough to curl the hair.  So frustrating!</li>
            <li> Worked wonders on my hair and made the curl/wave last for ages....but only got to use it once before it burned itself out and would no longer turn on. Such a bummer.</li>
            <li> Love the big waves and curls I can make with this wand! Prefer this style over the regular wands, I find the curls last longer on all types of hair!</li>
            <li> I know this is my fault, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to use it. I watched you tube video tutorials, but still burn my fingers through the glove, my curls turn out awful... wish I had bought a regular curling iron</li>
            <li> I love this curling is very practical and comfortable</li>
            <li> Very hard to use, maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> It was too difficult to use. I don&#x27;t know if my hair isn&#x27;t long enough or I&#x27;m just not coordinated?</li>
            <li> Best curling tool ever! Nice spiral curls that loosen over time into waves the second day. I&#x27;ve never been good at curling my hair ever and have tried it all. This bubble wand is effortless with no kinks. My hair is long layered from shoulder to belly button so its good for all lengths because  you can put shorter sections where the barrel  is narrow and wide sections around the bubble. I was shocked that it only took me ten minutes to do the first time. It has different  heat setting which is great for those with fine hair who need less heat. I liked that it came with a glove because I was worried about burning my fingers but it&#x27;s not necessary and it&#x27;s difficult when working with it.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and makes great, bubbling waves!</li>
            <li> Good quality product with fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I was super excited when I received this item, it only took 2 days to reach my door step. Tho when I first plugged it in the heat wasn&#x27;t near hot enough to even hold a curl. I could grasp the wand on high heat for example on how low the heat source is. I&#x27;m returning it for a &#x27;re fund and a different brand wand. Hope everyone else has better luck!</li>
            <li> ive wanted one of these for a while but wasnt sure if it would work on my hair so i took to youtube to do a little research before buying one for myself. after watching a few videos i was slightly skeptical because it seemed to not work on anybodys hair. only one girl out of about seven or eight we able to get it to work but her hair was really long and mine goes just past my shoulders so i didnt think it would work. I had to have it so i ought it anyway and I love it.  ifound that the problem the people had from the youtube videos had was that they didnt let it heat up. i let mine heat while i get ready for college in the moring and by the time im done getting dressed it is all hot and ready for me to do my hair. my bottom layer taks a while but only because its so short and i tend to loose the peices so i have to redo them. other than that i love the way my hair turns out.&lt;br /&gt;  the only down side is the glove. it makes it hard to hold your hair and it makes for a better glove to wear outside than it does to do your hair with.&lt;br /&gt;also when using this product i dont use hairspray only because it makes my hair look greasy!!! but the waves and curls (which ever i make that day) stay in from morning till night!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This is a picture of the first time i did my hair using something like this. I personally liked it and received many comments throughout the day!!!</li>
            <li> Product works very well.</li>
            <li> Bought this at Ulta. Affordable? Yes. Worth it? No. It didn&#x27;t work for my hair, it didn&#x27;t curl my human hair extensions the way I had hoped it would. I prefer the straight ceramic wands for extensions. More precise curls with those and they stay longer.</li>
            <li> Great product and price!!</li>
            <li> Hard to get the hang of using it on yourself, but once you do it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I love it....gift for my granddaughter</li>
            <li> Not very friendly to use</li>
            <li> Great xl bubble iron (dual voltage),I&#x27;m a make up artist from germany and I love to us it</li>
            <li> Love this! It took me one time to figure out how to properly use it (beauty stuff challenged). The high temperature isn&#x27;t as hot as my other iron I have, which is fine because I have fine hair. You can use bigger chunks of hair to reduce the actual time of curling. Using this iron and bigger chunks has cut my hair curling time in half!! Leaves a natural wavery. Love it!!</li>
            <li> My daighter-in-law loved getting this for Christmas!</li>
            <li> When it comes to my hair I have never been good with using anything on my hair no matter how easy someone else say it is or someone in a video makes it look so easy. Never really happens for me. This thing is perfect,  my problem solved. It&#x27;s so easy to use whether I section it by a little or a thick section,  I take like 5 minutes on my hair, i love it, please trust me. Ask me anything about this curler I&#x27;ll let you know. Beware it will burn your fingers lol, beauty is pain lol.</li>
            <li> When you finally figure out how to use this iron it makes the ugliest curls! Not cute at all! Highly unsatisfied! The shipping was great all though.</li>
            <li> Makes beautiful curls, and very easy for young teenagers to use. Would highly recommend using the included heating glove for younger girls since there is no clamp to hold the hair to the wand.</li>
            <li> This iron didn&#x27;t work well on my hair, I have fine but thick hair. I will practice more in hopes it will work the way it is supposed to</li>
            <li> This curling iron doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair....but it does work wonderfully as a butt plug. I had to get my money&#x27;s worth somehow...</li>
            <li> Not terrible. But not as good as I had hoped. I had hoped to find a replacement for my Hot Tools wand that would hold onto my already curly hair better. I like more defined curls than I have. Unfortunately, due to the variations in size in this wand, the curls are not well defined. Parts of a strip of hair will be wider than others and it tends to give the appearance of frizz. It does not fry my hair which is good. But it is not worth the time or any heat damage to use this to define my already messy curls.</li>
            <li> I love the wave/curls this gives. It does take a little getting used to but it&#x27;s very easy to get the hang of it. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this!  What I don&#x27;t like much is the cord.  It is not very pliable at all!</li>
