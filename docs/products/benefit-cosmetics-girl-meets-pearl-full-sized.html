    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>I know it is a men&#x27;s line, but trust me this is the best moisturizer)</li>
            <li>Benefit makes great highlighter products, and Girl Meets Pearl is no exception.</li>
            <li>Girl meets peal gives me great shimmery highlights when I use it on my cheekbones.</li>
            <li>I STILL think it&#x27;s really great.  </li>
            <li>It goes on very nicely and gives the face</li>
            <li>but  a touch of this gives a rested, bright look for the days I need a lift.</li>
            <li>This highlighter is absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li>some of the cheaper luminizers are just as good.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I am very much enjoying this product!</li>
            <li>so glad I did!</li>
            <li>Great highlighter (really gives a beautiful shimmer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>It looked amazing.</li>
            <li>Looks amazing when you contour with Dior Bronzer (another HG of mine).</li>
            <li>It looks nice, like you took a walk.  </li>
            <li>You just have to make sure you don&#x27;t put it on top of powder because it can get cakey!</li>
            <li>Now I was on stage for many years ( had my own 6 piece &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; band in Boston Ma)</li>
            <li>It has a nice feel and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>I would prefer something that&#x27;s more like a powder.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for daily make-up.</li>
            <li>I had a great dewy glow to my face that wasn&#x27;t too much.</li>
            <li>a lovely glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks fabulous!  </li>
            <li>Really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the feel this primer has on my skin.</li>
            <li>The thing I especially love about this product is not only its sheen and hue but also the longevity of wear.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product</li>
            <li>You will LOVE this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it, when you want to sparkle here&#x27;s what you need.</li>
            <li>I like the way it smells too, kind of sweet.  </li>
            <li>Gorgeous fine golden shimmer in a fruity/sweet scented gel.</li>
            <li>I might be more in love with this since I got it for free from sephora.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty new to highlighters and still trying to figure out which works best for me.</li>
            <li>I like that it isn&#x27;t sticky and glides on really easily</li>
            <li>Very light, goes on quickly and blends smoothly.</li>
            <li>within&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The Seller ( I think they were Savvy Shopperz) sent my &amp;#34;Girl meets pearl so quickly (to ENGLAND)</li>
            <li>Personally, I prefer a bit more color, so I use this primarily as a highlighter, in addition to another blush product.</li>
            <li>Sure, it is pricey, but I&#x27;d rather pay extra for a good product that won&#x27;t leave my skin in havoc vs. oily junk that will make me spend the extra funds on cleaners for.</li>
            <li>and I keep one in my kit for use on clients and in my drawer for my own personal use.</li>
            <li>I could definitely see using the Stila on stage (under stage lighting, BUT if you want a NATURAL Pinky-Pearl ( very nice with my J-Lo colored complexion) glow a &amp;#34;lit from within&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t particularly bother me, BUT I think a more clever packaging could work..</li>
            <li>very much recommend this product.</li>
            <li>At first I tried using this under my foundation.</li>
            <li>, you have to twist the bottom to get product out of a net like top.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t noticeable unless you are in direct light.</li>
            <li>You can get away with a slick of this on a rushed not so good morning.  </li>
            <li>it was almost too much shine.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much at all.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t replace a blush because it doesn&#x27;t add a whole lot of color.</li>
            <li>: I don&#x27;t really like the container</li>
            <li>too much comes out if I do it again.</li>
            <li>I really does work as a primer</li>
            <li>It has a subtle but warm golden glow.</li>
            <li>Still, if you want a subtle highlighter, this is definitely a good one.</li>
            <li>It is warmer in tone than High Beam (which is silvery in shimmer).</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to mix a little in with my tinted Moisturizer for a healthy &#x27;glow from</li>
            <li>I was shocked (and happy) !</li>
            <li>For me, high beam seems less natural and stands out more.</li>
            <li>This Girl Meets Pear gives skin a nice subtle glow.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews, I decided to put on my regular foundation, concealer and blush, and then put a little in the center of my forehead, cheeks and chin, and then put more on my cheekbones, followed by a light powder.  </li>
            <li>I want to highlight and still look natural.</li>
            <li>I am a Pro Makeup Artist and this is the go to product when you need to highlight or make a heavy foundation appear more sheer.</li>
            <li>For that reason, I really don&#x27;t see the difference between this and High Beam, which is another Benefit luminizer that works exactly the same way and costs $6 less than Girl Meets Pearl.</li>
            <li>I now use high beam strictly on the inner corners of my eyes, just because it&#x27;s so noticeable.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a little pricy, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>It does give mature skin a younger dewy look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft and not TOO obvious.  </li>
            <li>I am sure the pink color in this product shows up differently on different skin tones, but I have the fairest skin of just about anyone I know, so if I don&#x27;t notice a small pop of color when I apply it, chances are you won&#x27;t, either.</li>
            <li>Placed on after foundation/powder/blush - uses much less product, I just dab it on directly to my cheekbones and high points on my face and blend it in.       </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s build-able, it can be very subtle or you can make it more obvious, whatever you&#x27;re into.  </li>
            <li>, then I immediately apply the girl meets pearl on the high points of the face as mentioned above then apply the foundation on the rest of the face, carefully blending it in to where I applied the Girl Meets Pearl.</li>
            <li>I use this product on the high points of the face (center of forehead, bridge of nose, cupid&#x27;s bow of lips, just above the cheek bone and a tiny bit on the chin.</li>

            <li> Mixed with foundation - to get an overall, slightly dewy finish.</li>
            <li> It may be a little pricey, but if you use it like this it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Only a little is needed for application.</li>
            <li> I like pink blushes for my skin tone</li>
            <li> If I am using a heavy coverage foundation, I apply Girl Meets Pearl over the ENTIRE face.</li>
            <li> Instead of this product coming to me in the tube that you see in the picture, I got the product in a little tiny sample tube..  Not worth $10!</li>
            <li> (and I would much rather fake the walk.)</li>
            <li> This sheers out the foundation slightly but does not compromise the coverage of the foundation.</li>
            <li> The applicator is a little odd.  </li>
            <li> I agree that the way this is dispensed causes a lot of waste.</li>
            <li> so I usually use this in addition to a blush with a matte</li>
            <li> overall I think these are expensive products and</li>
            <li> Somewhat awkward packaging, comes in a twist/click plastic container that dispense a tiny bit of product with each click.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a SUBTLE highlighter to give my brow bone and cheek bones some &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so subtle</li>
            <li> If you use it alone, you&#x27;ll notice a very subtle shimmer on your skin, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s a liquid base.  </li>
            <li> (I hate hate sticky products).  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is not for me.  I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s a liquid base.  I would prefer something that&#x27;s more like a powder.</li>
            <li> I love this product! This is just what I have been looking for.  I mix it with my foundation to use it.  It gives me shimmery, but not too shiny looking.  It&#x27;s perfect for daily make-up.</li>
            <li> At first I tried using this under my foundation. I found I didn&#x27;t like it it was almost too much shine. So I tried again after putting on all my makeup I took dabs of it and put it in the corners of my eyes, dabs across my cheekbones (above my blush) a dab on my nose and forehead. It doesn&#x27;t take much at all. It looked amazing. I had a great dewy glow to my face that wasn&#x27;t too much. It may be a little pricey, but if you use it like this it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I like a shimmery look, and this can be used all over or just in specific areas. Very light, goes on quickly and blends smoothly. I&#x27;m a long way from being a teenager but  a touch of this gives a rested, bright look for the days I need a lift.</li>
            <li> I am very much enjoying this product! It goes on very nicely and gives the face a lovely glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I very much recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This Girl Meets Pear gives skin a nice subtle glow. Only a little is needed for application. I really like it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a SUBTLE highlighter to give my brow bone and cheek bones some &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; . I have Stila &amp;#34;all over shimmer which I wore out during the day and had 3 people say&amp;#34; do you realize you have glitter on your face&amp;#34; ? How embarrassing! Now I was on stage for many years ( had my own 6 piece &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; band in Boston Ma) -and I could definitely see using the Stila on stage (under stage lighting, BUT if you want a NATURAL Pinky-Pearl ( very nice with my J-Lo colored complexion) glow a &amp;#34;lit from within&amp;#34; look THIS PRODUCT IS FOR YOU! I could definitely see this working with almost EVERY skin color It&#x27;s so subtle I&#x27;m going to mix a little in with my tinted Moisturizer for a healthy &#x27;glow from within&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The Seller ( I think they were Savvy Shopperz) sent my &amp;#34;Girl meets pearl so quickly (to ENGLAND) I was shocked (and happy) !</li>
            <li> Benefit makes great highlighter products, and Girl Meets Pearl is no exception. This product doesn&#x27;t replace a blush because it doesn&#x27;t add a whole lot of color. If you use it alone, you&#x27;ll notice a very subtle shimmer on your skin, but that&#x27;s about it. Personally, I prefer a bit more color, so I use this primarily as a highlighter, in addition to another blush product. For that reason, I really don&#x27;t see the difference between this and High Beam, which is another Benefit luminizer that works exactly the same way and costs $6 less than Girl Meets Pearl. I am sure the pink color in this product shows up differently on different skin tones, but I have the fairest skin of just about anyone I know, so if I don&#x27;t notice a small pop of color when I apply it, chances are you won&#x27;t, either. Still, if you want a subtle highlighter, this is definitely a good one.</li>
            <li> I am 58 now and decided my skin needs some extra help.  I thought it was a little pricy, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.  After reading the reviews, I decided to put on my regular foundation, concealer and blush, and then put a little in the center of my forehead, cheeks and chin, and then put more on my cheekbones, followed by a light powder.  It looks fabulous!  Out of all the stuff I have bought on Amazon lately, this is the first time I decided to write a review to share my experience.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous fine golden shimmer in a fruity/sweet scented gel. Somewhat awkward packaging, comes in a twist/click plastic container that dispense a tiny bit of product with each click. I use it in one of two ways depending on what I&#x27;m trying to achieve.     1. Mixed with foundation - to get an overall, slightly dewy finish. Only drawback is I end up using quite a bit of product.   2. Placed on after foundation/powder/blush - uses much less product, I just dab it on directly to my cheekbones and high points on my face and blend it in.       This stuff makes me look younger and well rested. It&#x27;s great! It is warmer in tone than High Beam (which is silvery in shimmer). For me, high beam seems less natural and stands out more. I now use high beam strictly on the inner corners of my eyes, just because it&#x27;s so noticeable. Girl Meets Pearl can go anywhere I want to highlight and still look natural. If I could only pick one, I&#x27;d get Girl Meets Pearl in an instant.    Also, never had problems with this. Never broke me out. Really love this stuff. I initially debated whether I wanted to spend $30 on a gel highlighter... so glad I did!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty new to highlighters and still trying to figure out which works best for me. This highlighter is absolutely gorgeous. You can dab some on your cheekbones, Cupid&#x27;s bow (above your lip) anywhere you&#x27;d like to highlight. You just have to make sure you don&#x27;t put it on top of powder because it can get cakey!</li>
            <li> You can get away with a slick of this on a rushed not so good morning.  It has a nice feel and goes on easily.  It looks nice, like you took a walk.  (and I would much rather fake the walk.)</li>
            <li> Girl meets peal gives me great shimmery highlights when I use it on my cheekbones. However, I don&#x27;t think it can replace a blush for me. I like pink blushes for my skin tone so I usually use this in addition to a blush with a matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Great highlighter (really gives a beautiful shimmer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I don&#x27;t really like the container, you have to twist the bottom to get product out of a net like top. Sometimes I can&#x27;t get the product to come out with just one twist and too much comes out if I do it again. It is also a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to mix it with foundation and see if I can soften that. I agree that the way this is dispensed causes a lot of waste. overall I think these are expensive products and some of the cheaper luminizers are just as good.</li>
            <li> I like this product, however, I did not receive what I thought I was ordering..  Instead of this product coming to me in the tube that you see in the picture, I got the product in a little tiny sample tube..  Not worth $10!</li>
            <li> It does give mature skin a younger dewy look.</li>
            <li> I love the feel this primer has on my skin. When I don&#x27;t feel like slathering on foundation I simply run some of this onto my skin and it leaves me still feeling made-up, without all the junk on my face. Sure, it is pricey, but I&#x27;d rather pay extra for a good product that won&#x27;t leave my skin in havoc vs. oily junk that will make me spend the extra funds on cleaners for. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am a Pro Makeup Artist and this is the go to product when you need to highlight or make a heavy foundation appear more sheer. It has a subtle but warm golden glow. I use this product on the high points of the face (center of forehead, bridge of nose, cupid&#x27;s bow of lips, just above the cheek bone and a tiny bit on the chin. You can use this product with or without foundation. Looks amazing when you contour with Dior Bronzer (another HG of mine). The thing I especially love about this product is not only its sheen and hue but also the longevity of wear. I really does work as a primer and I can use it on ALL skin types, even the gals that have larger pores. When I am using it with foundation I use a mixed synthetic/pony hair foundation brush to apply moisturizer (Zirh Protect, yes I know it is a men&#x27;s line, but trust me this is the best moisturizer), then I immediately apply the girl meets pearl on the high points of the face as mentioned above then apply the foundation on the rest of the face, carefully blending it in to where I applied the Girl Meets Pearl. If I am using a heavy coverage foundation, I apply Girl Meets Pearl over the ENTIRE face. This sheers out the foundation slightly but does not compromise the coverage of the foundation. I absolutely love this product and I keep one in my kit for use on clients and in my drawer for my own personal use. The product lasts quite a while, especially if you apply it immediately after moisturizing, so the price is merited. You will LOVE this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27; [[ASIN:B0045SV8WC Benefit Cosmetics Benefit Girl Meets Pearl 12.0 Ml / 0.4 Fl Oz.]]</li>
            <li> I might be more in love with this since I got it for free from sephora.  I STILL think it&#x27;s really great.  It&#x27;s really soft and not TOO obvious.  I like that it isn&#x27;t sticky and glides on really easily (I hate hate sticky products).  It&#x27;s build-able, it can be very subtle or you can make it more obvious, whatever you&#x27;re into.  I like the way it smells too, kind of sweet.  The applicator is a little odd.  It doesn&#x27;t particularly bother me, BUT I think a more clever packaging could work..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, now what I&#x27;m not a total fan of is the sparkles in it.  Why does everything glow-y have to have sparkles?!  It isn&#x27;t noticeable unless you are in direct light.</li>
            <li> Love it, when you want to sparkle here&#x27;s what you need.</li>
