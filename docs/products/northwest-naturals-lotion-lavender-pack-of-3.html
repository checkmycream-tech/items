            <li>the lotion has good quality and is not oily/greasy however 2 out of 3 bottles the pump doesn&#x27;t work have to unscrew top, they should look into this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich and creamy, goes on well and feels really good on your skin.</li>
            <li>Lavender is one of my favorite scents, but it&#x27;s rare that you find a brand that smells really great to wear.</li>
            <li>However, I bought this as a hand lotion, so I am pretty happy with the scent.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>

            <li>Scent is a littleâ€‹ overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a lot more than 8oz per bottle.</li>
            <li>The lotion is great though if you dont need a whole bunch.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the lavender lotion.</li>

            <li>Love this lotion, smells great, leaves my skin feeling soft</li>
            <li>Initially I really didn&#x27;t care for this lotion because the lavender fragrance is very powerful, but after using it for a week I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li>For the price and the fact that it is pretty natural... it&#x27;s great!  </li>
            <li>Makes shin smooth as silk and the scent is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>the lavender smell is a bit strong for me.</li>
            <li>I probably would not buy again because it&#x27;s just too strong.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is fine, but none of the three pumps on the bottles work at all-  </li>
            <li>Love it great for dry skin and keeps bugs away in the summer time.</li>
            <li>Lotion is smooth on skin.</li>
            <li>Rich in oils, this product is far superior to lotions found in most chain stores &amp; so, well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and was excited to find a (true) lavender lotion.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is a clean, true lavender.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion so much.</li>
            <li>True Lavender scent.</li>
            <li>The smell is true lavender.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong, but I don&#x27;t mind it, and it&#x27;s not fake or cloying.</li>
            <li>This lotion penetrates quickly &amp; moisturizes well.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for some nice lotion with a great scent, then you can not go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li>I add rose geranium essential oil to it because I don&#x27;t like the lavender scent.  </li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>Very much.  </li>
            <li>This is the first order for me...</li>
            <li>Great for less sensitive parts of the skin.</li>
            <li>The smell is no natural and very smooth.</li>
            <li>With daily use, my hands are nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I like it, but the lavender is strong, so I only use on my hands.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is okay, smells good, wish it left skin a little softer though, overall I did like it, but don&#x27;t think it would work well on winter skin.</li>
            <li>It smells just like real lavender.</li>
            <li>So much for &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Very creamy lotion.</li>
            <li>It really moisturizes my skin but does not make it greasy.</li>
            <li>Has a different feel than other lotions which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>If you do buy the lotion and you don&#x27;t like the scent, you can always add your favorite essential oil to it to make it smell differently.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviewers that the scent is a bit strong.</li>
            <li>The aroma overwhelms for the first hour, but I really like that pick me up mid morning break.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent, and it&#x27;s gentle, but not gentle enough for skin with an eczema outbreak.</li>
            <li>I will probably try one of their different scents because like I said, you really can&#x27;t beat the lotion for the price!  </li>
            <li>Natural ingredients is a plus.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>I like the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I my job alot of hands in water and cleaners heals them up and makes them soft again.</li>
            <li>It is really nourishing for my dry hands.</li>
            <li>I just used the dropper that came with my essential oil and dropped it straight into the lotion bottle and shook it up until it was mixed, but that&#x27;s just me.  </li>
            <li>Oh, in case you didn&#x27;t already know... never put an essential oil undiluted straight on your skin because it can cause skin irritation and depending on the essential oil, it can also cause sun sensitivity.</li>
            <li>We ordered three and they have lasted longer than I expected because the lotion is nice and thick.</li>
            <li>All natural lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li>Not to strong, not to weak.</li>

            <li> 2 out of 3 bottles came with broken pumps, so I have to open it up and tip it in my hand to get the lotion out.  </li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with Barbasol shaving cream</li>
            <li> Does not contain artificial fragrances.  </li>
            <li> I would have given the lotion 5 stars, but the broken bottle pumps are annoying.</li>
            <li> Well, mine must have been a BAD BATCH.  </li>
            <li> HATE the bottles.  </li>
            <li> Horrible!!</li>

            <li> Love this lotion so much. True Lavender scent. But to thick for the pump.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is fine, but none of the three pumps on the bottles work at all-  quite a pain to try to shake the thick cream out in order to use it.</li>

            <li> This was part of a purchase of lavender gift for my mother. She just loved this lotion , and has ordered more for herself and as gifts.</li>
            <li> Lavender is one of my favorite scents, but it&#x27;s rare that you find a brand that smells really great to wear. Natural ingredients is a plus.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Has a nice viscosity. Doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy at all. This is my second 3 pack.</li>

            <li> Contains known cancer causing ingredients.  So much for &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I hesitate buying lotions because I don&#x27;t like the sticky, filmy feel, but this lotion isn&#x27;t like that. It smells great too. I would repurchase. Only con is I would like bigger bottles.</li>
            <li> This lotion is lovely to use but sometimes can be a bit greasy for my skin. The smell is strong, but I don&#x27;t mind it, and it&#x27;s not fake or cloying. We ordered three and they have lasted longer than I expected because the lotion is nice and thick.</li>

            <li> Lovely lotion; and keeps mosquitos away. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Amazing! The smell is true lavender. I&#x27;ve ordered twice now. Great product.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! The smell is no natural and very smooth. I shared this lotion with the girls at worked and they loved it. Not to strong, not to weak. Just right. This is the way Lavender support to smell. Thank you when I run low I will order again.</li>
            <li> Scent is a littleâ€‹ overwhelming.</li>
            <li> What was I thinking? Obviously I wasnt reading this properly. I was expecting a lot more than 8oz per bottle. I used a bottle per week with my growing pregnancy belly. The lotion is great though if you dont need a whole bunch.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the lavender lotion. Very much.  The ONLY issue I have. Is this last order had defective pumps, and had to improvise  Otherwise.  I find it soothing and has a wonderful scent!!!</li>
            <li> Super pleased with this lotion! All natural ingredients mean that as a person with sensitive skin, I can use on body or face without a bad reaction. I also think the price can&#x27;t be beat- you get three so this means you can have one for office and home and one for a friend to try.</li>
            <li> Where&#x27;s the lavender?  I read the reviews and was excited to find a (true) lavender lotion.  Well, mine must have been a BAD BATCH.  Not only is there no lavender oils, it just down right STINKS!  I was going to share the bottles with my sisters but NOT NOW.  Pee U.  Vicks vapor rub would smell better on my hands that this stuff.</li>
            <li> Beautiful smell and moisturizes skin for hours.</li>
            <li> I like the natural ingredients. the lavender smell is a bit strong for me. but the lotion texture is very nice.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness~~the fragrance is heavenly! Moisturizers beautifully! This is the first order for me...I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion with a genuine lavender scent. It&#x27;s rich and creamy, goes on well and feels really good on your skin. I am very satisfied with this lotion.</li>
            <li> Nice nice nice!  Great texture, heavenly smell and superb value.  Will definitely buy again.  If you love lavender, order this!</li>
            <li> I like it, but the lavender is strong, so I only use on my hands.  The aroma overwhelms for the first hour, but I really like that pick me up mid morning break.  Lotion is smooth on skin.</li>
            <li> Very nice lotion but lavender scent is very strong.  Even though it&#x27;s creamy and it feels good I probably would not buy again because it&#x27;s just too strong.</li>
            <li> Love it great for dry skin and keeps bugs away in the summer time. Thank you helps my hands and feet I my job alot of hands in water and cleaners heals them up and makes them soft again. Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> the lotion has good quality and is not oily/greasy however 2 out of 3 bottles the pump doesn&#x27;t work have to unscrew top, they should look into this</li>
            <li> All natural lavender essential oil. I had never heard of this company before and just stumbled upon it before the holidays. It comes in a package of three and there is NOTHING FAKE about this product.</li>
            <li> Very creamy lotion. Has a different feel than other lotions which is a good thing. Great smell and came in timely manner.</li>
            <li> Smelled great and worked great as shower gifts as part of a lavender gift set I made.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, and it&#x27;s gentle, but not gentle enough for skin with an eczema outbreak. Great for less sensitive parts of the skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion is okay, smells good, wish it left skin a little softer though, overall I did like it, but don&#x27;t think it would work well on winter skin.</li>
            <li> Smooth, creamy, healing and smells wonderful! It works great on my winter elbows. With daily use, my hands are nice and soft. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> Love it! The texture is thick and contains natural ingredients. It is really nourishing for my dry hands. I agree with the other reviewers that the scent is a bit strong. However, I bought this as a hand lotion, so I am pretty happy with the scent. Will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Initially I really didn&#x27;t care for this lotion because the lavender fragrance is very powerful, but after using it for a week I absolutely love it!! It really moisturizes my skin but does not make it greasy. I will order more.</li>
            <li> Has a very nice lavender scent and feels silky on hands.  Does not contain artificial fragrances.  Great for gift giving.</li>
            <li> Now, this IS lavender! The lotion just came and after trying some, I am already planing to buy more. It has the most wonderful scent. Feels wonderful on my skin. If you are looking for some nice lotion with a great scent, then you can not go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion, but I don&#x27;t love it.  For the price and the fact that it is pretty natural... it&#x27;s great!  I add rose geranium essential oil to it because I don&#x27;t like the lavender scent.  It&#x27;s off smelling and reminds me of Barbasol shaving cream.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with Barbasol shaving cream but I don&#x27;t want my lotion to smell that way.  It does a pretty good job of moisturizing my skin, I just don&#x27;t like the scent.  I will probably try one of their different scents because like I said, you really can&#x27;t beat the lotion for the price!  If you do buy the lotion and you don&#x27;t like the scent, you can always add your favorite essential oil to it to make it smell differently.  You can add 1% to probably up to 3% depending on the essential oil you like versus the amount of lotion.  I just used the dropper that came with my essential oil and dropped it straight into the lotion bottle and shook it up until it was mixed, but that&#x27;s just me.  Oh, in case you didn&#x27;t already know... never put an essential oil undiluted straight on your skin because it can cause skin irritation and depending on the essential oil, it can also cause sun sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Great scent on this super affordable lotion!  Makes shin smooth as silk and the scent is fantastic!  Have ordered twice and can&#x27;t wait for more!!!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife after to trip to Seattle. She loved all the lavender products. This is a great value and she considers this her go to lotion. She does have another that is for healing, but for moisturizing and scent, this is an excellent product and value. I suspect we will be giving these out at. Christmas.</li>
