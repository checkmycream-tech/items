            <li>Different but nice</li>

            <li> So my advice is: be extra careful when ordering fragrances.</li>
            <li> It lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> As expected seller Amzn came thru as always.</li>
            <li> , I bought it after reading some review from other buyers.</li>
            <li> I first started wearing this around my then girlfriend (now wife) and she went absolutely crazy over this stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a waste of money to buy.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few colognes I have found to produce a nicer fragrance after dancing all night.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t feel I can use it to work and for everyday use.</li>
            <li> The $100 bottle \\&quot;Wood\\&quot; was too expensive and not available at all stores.  </li>
            <li> Horrible smell &amp; pretty disgusting to boot.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I get a lot of compliments on the sent and its not too over powering, something I cant stand in cologne.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent perfume, is a little sweet but if you lake sweet perfumes so I in it you to try this and you can find good deals in amazon. Go for it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this fragrance via Amazon and I am almost sure I got a fake one. The scent lasts at most 1-2 hours and afterwards there is barely a trace of it in the skin.  So my advice is: be extra careful when ordering fragrances. Check the reputation of the vendor.</li>
            <li> Since Zino Davidoff was discontinued, I started looking for a replacement.  The $100 bottle \\&quot;Wood\\&quot; was too expensive and not available at all stores.  Then I found this great cologne that is not too strong for the office and stays close to the body.. doesn&#x27;t drift.  Best thing is you can order it online and find it at most airports.</li>
            <li> It smelled so good that a African grey rhino tracked me down and now we are engaged to be married.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better but this cologne is nice for a change of pace.  I tend to like the cleaner, fresher scents, this one has a bit of a spicy scent to it.  I have others that are a bit spicier that I really like but this one doesn&#x27;t rate up there with those.</li>
            <li> Got for my husband, and he smells great!! It&#x27;s not to strong, manly, and lasts. Goes nice on him against my cool water for women. Both . Are great scents, and a good price!</li>
            <li> Smells incredible and the service was awesome!  Will definitely recommend my family and friends. Again thank you for the fast service.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice and distinctive. But I personally still love the sweet sutile inviting aroma of Cool Water. When I&#x27;m wearing my  Cool Water, even I feel like hugging myself! LOL! Hot Water is very nice but not quite as distinctive as being cool, calm and collected!</li>
            <li> i love this perfume and am gonna buy one more</li>
            <li> As expected seller Amzn came thru as always. Different but nice</li>
            <li> Sweet scent. Worth a try if youre looking for something new.</li>
            <li> happens to be my favorite cologne, I love it</li>
            <li> My spouse bought this when he saw it overseas. I love to smell his colognes and this one definitely makes me want to get closer. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Horrible smell &amp; pretty disgusting to boot.&lt;br /&gt;It is a waste of money to buy.</li>
            <li> Yes it almost smell like  hair spay</li>
            <li> First off, this product smells extremely cheap at first. But give it a few minutes to work in with your body&#x27;s natural odors and it smells amazing. It has a nice warm spicy yet sweet smell to it. It&#x27;s perfect for going out in the evening whether it&#x27;s a formal event or just a date with that hot chick you been eyeing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While wearing this cologne, I&#x27;ve received many compliments from both women and men (asking so they could buy a bottle). I first started wearing this around my then girlfriend (now wife) and she went absolutely crazy over this stuff. She even sprayed her stuff so she could bring the smell home with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in a all, a nice cologne that&#x27;s not overpowering with a nice warm smell.</li>
            <li> GREAT DEAL!!!!!!FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li> excellent smell, I have smelled this cologne before in a store and I decide it to buy it cause is perfect</li>
            <li> The scent is not too strong and smells nice. It lasts quite a long time. Nearly throughout the day. I will order more.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, great job by the folks at Davidoff, but it only it lasted 1 hr 30 mts approx.</li>
            <li> Product works great, great item to purchase.  I really enjoy it.  Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I previously have worn Zino Davidoff for a number of years and was looking for a new cologne. I had no idea what this cologne smelled like and I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised, it&#x27;s got a great smell!  I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I have no problems with this cologne. It is great for the night/club scene. This is one of the few colognes I have found to produce a nicer fragrance after dancing all night. I give it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t feel I can use it to work and for everyday use. It would make me smell like I just came from a club and being up all night</li>
            <li> It smelled like hair spray. I didn&#x27;t appeal to me. Cool Water is great but this stuff left a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li> It smells strong going on, but does not last. It is not one of their better products. Reminds me of Red Hots, but not as flavorful.</li>
            <li> I love Cool Water cologne but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last longer than 20 minutes anymore.  Tried this on a wish and I love it.  Similar to Cool Water but with a little more spice and a deeper scent.  I work in car sales and run around all day to a sweat.  I no longer go home to my wife telling me I smell like a garage and shower before holding our baby! Lol I WILL continue to buy Hot Water!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this scent.  Lasts all day, and definitely gets complements.  You won&#x27;t regret this purchase....and if you do, just send it to me! . :)</li>
            <li> excellent product. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I love it so much and the smell is so great, I bought it after reading some review from other buyers.</li>
            <li> This is reviewed as one of the top perfumes in year 2012. I bought this based on that review and I liked it very well. If you want more info on this then you can find that on youtube where people have reviewed it and explained it&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
            <li> Smokey and clean.  Davidoff is a suberb company. Adult smells, classic scents and to the point descpitions provide a total package.</li>
            <li> I really bought it because of the name.  Thought it was interesting, now its good.</li>
