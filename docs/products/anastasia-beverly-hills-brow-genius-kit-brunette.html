            <li> It looks natural when on and it has major staying power.</li>
            <li> only cons are I wish the applicator in the gel was instead a mascara brush like the one on the other side of the angled brush</li>
            <li> Holy wow was this DARK, I have dark brown hair</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the angled brush is small &amp; I ended up purchasing a longer one from the same company.</li>
            <li> I end up just using the wand for a different eyebrow gel, because you actually have to mix this gel, so it&#x27;s not really great for an everyday sort of routine.</li>
            <li> keeps them flyaways down.</li>
            <li> old swears by A.B.H. and her brows are serious business!</li>
            <li> takes a little while to get used to</li>
            <li> The powder is just too messy and time consuming for me.</li>
            <li> so when I put this on it looked ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Can go from a really subtle look which I use for work or for a dramatic look if I go out.</li>

            <li> Holy wow was this DARK, I have dark brown hair but my eyebrows are lighter and not very thick so when I put this on it looked ridiculous. Also I don&#x27;t want to mix, clean up brushes and apply daily - the brow kit from Benefit is way easier to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> too much work...I love anastasia but this powder brow tint is too much work...the mixing...dont have time for this...Anastasia dip brow is excellent, and the brow wiz even better....but this is not for me!</li>
            <li> I was using this for my brows, till I found the Dip brow and started to use that one instead.</li>
            <li> The product itself is extremely effective. It looks natural when on and it has major staying power. I am notorious for sweat or the accidental rub ruining my eyebrows, but this kit passed the acid test. The only problem I have with this is that mixing a gel is not designed for an on-the-go girl. This is for special occasions or the dedicated diva.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I am so well pleased with the quality of this kit, I will try her powder. I believe powder will be more time effective for me.</li>
            <li> It works alright but is a really high maintenance kit. I end up just using the wand for a different eyebrow gel, because you actually have to mix this gel, so it&#x27;s not really great for an everyday sort of routine.</li>
            <li> In absolute love! I use it all the time. Can go from a really subtle look which I use for work or for a dramatic look if I go out. Just in love. Worth every cent! It does not make ur eyebrows look drawn in, it makes it look so Realistic!</li>
            <li> Loved it! Stays on all day!!!</li>
            <li> takes a little while to get used to</li>
            <li> I loved it...it was a very smooth application, color was perfect shade &amp; not too mention lasted all day no rubbing off!!!!</li>
            <li> what an awesome little kit! I don&#x27;t know where I would be without brow gel. it&#x27;s a staple in anyone&#x27;s makeup for bushier natural brows OR sleeker ones! keeps them flyaways down. powder is great and I love the double sided brush-super helpful. only cons are I wish the applicator in the gel was instead a mascara brush like the one on the other side of the angled brush so I don&#x27;t have to apply it then brush it.</li>
            <li> It was everything I knew it would be cheap and easy to apply definitely my favorite brow makeup easy to blend</li>
            <li> Love this product ! Only complaint is that the angled brush is small &amp; I ended up purchasing a longer one from the same company.</li>
            <li> Great value. The shade is perfect for me. The tool/brush is really nice. I haven&#x27;t quite used it with the gel, just the powder but it seems like with the gel you can get a more lasting application.</li>
            <li> My 20 yr. old swears by A.B.H. and her brows are serious business!</li>
            <li> If used correctly (sparingly) this looks very natural even on guys.  Lasts until you wash off and doesn&#x27;t smear or run.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with my Anastasia pencil instead, it&#x27;s better. The powder is just too messy and time consuming for me.</li>
            <li> Received mines today. Gave it a test run  and yaaaassss  it is awesome. It does dry up quick as it says in the direction it comes with and it truly is waterproof. Love  it! Try wiping my brows now. Lol</li>
