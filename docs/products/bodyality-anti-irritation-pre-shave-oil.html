            <li>I was very impressed with the product!</li>
            <li>Best for me was to put on one application,</li>
            <li>and your face feels great after shaving.</li>
            <li>Great shave, will continue use.</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s great too.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband, if you have ever been with a man with a beard, you will understand what I am about to say lol..</li>
            <li>Absolutely great service...and</li>
            <li>My skin feels great, whereas before I felt like I needed to shave again when 4 or 5 o&#x27;clock rolled around each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic value!!!</li>
            <li>Nice uncented oil!  </li>
            <li>lol  Good woman.</li>
            <li>I had very successful lathers using my shave brush on top of this</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I can genuinely say that it is AWESOME!</li>
            <li>It is true, this is anti irritation at its best.</li>
            <li>For 2 oz, the price is very good and well worth it.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product .</li>
            <li>About an hour after it had arrived, I received an email from Bodyality asking if I liked the oil.  </li>
            <li>so I could give MY honest opinion when I write my review.</li>
            <li>I think this is probably because I no longer have a half-beard by 3pm, and I have also implemented an effective moisturizer into my post-shave routine.  </li>
            <li>Puts a nice layer on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I found on touch ups, after 2 or 3 passes, I just splashed some warm water on my face and the razor glided with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>I received this product for a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>Love this oil - makes my safety razor shave very very smooth!</li>
            <li>Going from L&#x27;OCCITANE to this was an easy transition!</li>
            <li>I have tried many and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Great product, first class customer support.  </li>
            <li>This pre shave oil is Fantastic!</li>
            <li>our bottle arrived cracked at the bottom but the plastic was still on the top.</li>
            <li>We are extremely satisfied with the pre shave oil as well as the customer service.</li>
            <li>Definitely satisfied will purchase again</li>
            <li>It enhances the shaving experience and makes short work of the shaving process that we have to contend with each day and it is a wonderful adjunct to the shaving cream .</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Of all the pre shave oils I&#x27;ve tried, this has to be my favorite.</li>
            <li>you know you bought safely</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I also let the oil sit for a minute or more before applying shaving gel.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your face nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>He says that after you shave, you&#x27;ll be able to see and feel that the oil is still on your skin.</li>
            <li>I have used it many times now</li>
            <li>Its ok nothing fancy</li>
            <li>Stubble Butter turned out to be a great product to make shaving quick, comfortable and easy.  </li>
            <li>Nate pointed out that it takes about a week for your skin to become more conditioned to hold moisture for more comfortable</li>
            <li>This stubble butter is great for softening up the skin and preventing the irritation that develops when shaving sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great product for those who shave often or have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Using quick and short strokes often provides me with the best shave.</li>
            <li>oil is scentless and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t have a problem with that and says it&#x27;s easy to wash off, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Man this stuff really works nice for a clean smooth shave!</li>
            <li>As long as you are able to look and feel your best, you won&#x27;t care so much when you lose your dog/wife/house/car/job etc.</li>
            <li>There are three primary aspects that a pre-shave oil--or any pre-shave for that matter--must have to be worthwhile:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fortunately, this oil did not impede the speed of the blade on my skin.</li>
            <li>My legs are silky smooth and feel so moisturized.</li>
            <li>smooth and close shave</li>
            <li>Uses it on her legs - her legs are silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Fantastic company to deal with.  </li>
            <li>the the closest most comfortable shave I can achieve is using a safety razor with this oil right before I shave, Proraso shave cream, boar brush, and you will be amazed how close but comfortable a shave you can get.</li>
            <li>this Pre-Shave Oil, I am getting a clean smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>the beginning I was not sure if this Oil would work, but, it works amazingly!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t not work, but for the cost, I couldn&#x27;t distinguish any noticeable difference over just using a good shave cream with proper prep.</li>
            <li>and this has really helped me get a better shave.  </li>
            <li>Update - turns out my wife decided she&#x27;d try it ( as well as my Cool Water)</li>
            <li>The 2 oz bottle is a great size because a little oil goes a long way and it fit nicely in my travel bag and medicine cabinet!</li>
            <li>It super charges the shaving experience, with the end result being a closer shave with no irritation that I just wasn&#x27;t getting before.</li>
            <li>I got a closer shave, softer skin, less irritation, it is truly unscented, feels great on my face...</li>
            <li>First time shave with straight razor and no nicks or cuts thanks to this stuff!!!!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product to make shaving more effective and less of a hassle.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this oil to shave my head and neck for a few weeks now, and I am really happy with how it works.</li>
            <li>I may even find myself shaving more frequently.</li>
            <li>Godda say this is really worth it.  </li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t work you know right away.  </li>
            <li>Hands down the best pre shave oil I have used to date for facial and body hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am taking baby steps away from using the typical cartridge razor/shaving gel combo towards using a safety razor with a good brush, oil and cream.  </li>
            <li>There are some situations in which the &#x27;old way&#x27; of doing something is actually better than the &#x27;modern way&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>At first, properties 1 &amp; 2 were there, but I still suffered from irritation and ingrown hairs on my neck.</li>
            <li>This has always been an issue for me, which is why I switched to DE shaving in the first place.</li>
            <li>shaves if I consistently used the oil.</li>
            <li>I look forward to putting this on before I shave, and that&#x27;s exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to feel like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experimented with many different shave methods over the years</li>
            <li>Ok, so not only does my husband love how this makes his skin feel, (especially with our desert dryness)</li>
            <li>Upon opening I found that it has a small stopper in the neck so as not to let to much out at a time -great idea.so</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fabulous smell and a damp hot towel makes you feel like a king!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one gets is just right, so you don&#x27;t need that much</li>
            <li>THen splash with some warm, not hot, water and you&#x27;re off to the races.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is great stuff if you have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t like heavy fragrances</li>
            <li>I determined that this was because I was not getting a close enough shave, so I set out to find products that would allow me to get a closer, more comfortable shave and possibly reduce some of the skin irritation that I experience.  </li>
            <li>We live in a hyper-accelerated culture where we have been conditioned to want everything as quickly and cheaply and simply as possible.  </li>
            <li>My facial hair tends to grow very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Plus, they were smart in putting in anti irritant oils and taking out oils that can eventually cause irritation (lavender and sandalwood).</li>
            <li>This pre-shave oil is very high quality.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The blade really does just glide thru the shave...</li>
            <li>I found this to absolutely be true.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doing business with him has been an absolute pleasure.</li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance and has left my head really smooth after my shave.  </li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>He seems to really like this one, it helps him get a closer shave than if he dont use it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow, there isn&#x27;t much else</li>
            <li>This stuff really saves face (no pun intended) when you&#x27;re shaving.</li>
            <li>Really offers a smooth shave and your skin feels soft with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>I just want to quickly run the razor over my face and have no hair left.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to open up your pores properly before applying.  </li>
            <li>either way we contacted Bodyality and the owner (Nate) responded promptly and sent us a new bottle a long with a free gift for our troubles.</li>
            <li>I can say it is extremely high quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li>As the razor now glides over my skin more smoothly and there is less friction, I am able to take my time, especially in areas of my face that were previously hard to shave.  </li>
            <li>Great customer service by this company, look at their products and give them a try they stand behind them and gaurantee satisfaction!</li>
            <li>The switch has helped tremendously, but has not completely solved the problem.</li>
            <li>I think this will be a new staple in my home.</li>
            <li>and I always wind up scratching till its raw and even more sore than it was to begin with.</li>
            <li>We also BOTH have sensitive skin so were skeptics but no problems at all!</li>
            <li>Others work fine but feel a little watery (Pacific Shaving, Truefitt &amp; Hill).</li>
            <li>It really helps especially considering how sensitive my skin is.</li>
            <li>I purchased this oil and it has worked wonders on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My husband has sensitive skin and is always complaining about his razor causing burns on his face.</li>
            <li>I use this with DE Astra SP blades all I can say is wow...</li>
            <li>but this far exceeds them all.  </li>
            <li>Thus far, using this product has resulted in a noticeable difference in my shaves.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The oil is old and smells rancid which is not what you want to be rubbing into your face.</li>
            <li>I apply the oil in slow circles, being sure not to overlook any area that I intend to shave.  </li>
            <li>I only use 2 drops of this oil right before I shave and have not looked back.</li>
            <li>I am also a strong supporter of small businesses so will be buying this again when mine runs out.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving it a try, whether you have had success with oils in the past or not.</li>
            <li>Hard to find these days, I commend them and will be giving them some more of my $$ in the future.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive with a moderate beard.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, my original ordered arrived broken (thanks UPS).  </li>
            <li>This bottle should last a long time as u don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>As an added bonus it acts as a facial moisturizer and pre-shave for an electric razor which I use for occasional touch-up Not thick, so no grab</li>
            <li>I did a complete analysis of this product with 3 different razors, soap and cream for the company.  </li>
            <li>A must buy for anybody who has sensitive skin and shaves regularly or even occasionally .</li>
            <li>entire process takes a little bit of extra time, but it&#x27;s worth it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say the oil increases the speed of my blade, but it certainly does not slow it down like other oils I have</li>
            <li>Feels good on my skin and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> There are some situations in which the &#x27;old way&#x27; of doing something is actually better than the &#x27;modern way&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> At first, properties 1 &amp; 2 were there, but I still suffered from irritation and ingrown hairs on my neck.</li>
            <li> This has always been an issue for me, which is why I switched to DE shaving in the first place.</li>
            <li> shaves if I consistently used the oil.</li>
            <li> I look forward to putting this on before I shave, and that&#x27;s exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to feel like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experimented with many different shave methods over the years</li>
            <li> Ok, so not only does my husband love how this makes his skin feel, (especially with our desert dryness)</li>
            <li> Upon opening I found that it has a small stopper in the neck so as not to let to much out at a time -great idea.so</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fabulous smell and a damp hot towel makes you feel like a king!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one gets is just right, so you don&#x27;t need that much</li>
            <li> THen splash with some warm, not hot, water and you&#x27;re off to the races.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is great stuff if you have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t like heavy fragrances</li>
            <li> I determined that this was because I was not getting a close enough shave, so I set out to find products that would allow me to get a closer, more comfortable shave and possibly reduce some of the skin irritation that I experience.  </li>
            <li> We live in a hyper-accelerated culture where we have been conditioned to want everything as quickly and cheaply and simply as possible.  </li>
            <li> My facial hair tends to grow very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Plus, they were smart in putting in anti irritant oils and taking out oils that can eventually cause irritation (lavender and sandalwood).</li>
            <li> This pre-shave oil is very high quality.</li>
            <li> We highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The blade really does just glide thru the shave...</li>
            <li> I found this to absolutely be true.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doing business with him has been an absolute pleasure.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance and has left my head really smooth after my shave.  </li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> He seems to really like this one, it helps him get a closer shave than if he dont use it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, there isn&#x27;t much else</li>
            <li> This stuff really saves face (no pun intended) when you&#x27;re shaving.</li>
            <li> Really offers a smooth shave and your skin feels soft with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> I just want to quickly run the razor over my face and have no hair left.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to open up your pores properly before applying.  </li>
            <li> either way we contacted Bodyality and the owner (Nate) responded promptly and sent us a new bottle a long with a free gift for our troubles.</li>
            <li> I can say it is extremely high quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> As the razor now glides over my skin more smoothly and there is less friction, I am able to take my time, especially in areas of my face that were previously hard to shave.  </li>
            <li> Great customer service by this company, look at their products and give them a try they stand behind them and gaurantee satisfaction!</li>
            <li> The switch has helped tremendously, but has not completely solved the problem.</li>
            <li> I think this will be a new staple in my home.</li>
            <li> and I always wind up scratching till its raw and even more sore than it was to begin with.</li>
            <li> We also BOTH have sensitive skin so were skeptics but no problems at all!</li>
            <li> Others work fine but feel a little watery (Pacific Shaving, Truefitt &amp; Hill).</li>
            <li> It really helps especially considering how sensitive my skin is.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil and it has worked wonders on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My husband has sensitive skin and is always complaining about his razor causing burns on his face.</li>
            <li> I use this with DE Astra SP blades all I can say is wow...</li>
            <li> but this far exceeds them all.  </li>
            <li> Thus far, using this product has resulted in a noticeable difference in my shaves.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The oil is old and smells rancid which is not what you want to be rubbing into your face.</li>
            <li> I apply the oil in slow circles, being sure not to overlook any area that I intend to shave.  </li>
            <li> I only use 2 drops of this oil right before I shave and have not looked back.</li>
            <li> I am also a strong supporter of small businesses so will be buying this again when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving it a try, whether you have had success with oils in the past or not.</li>
            <li> Hard to find these days, I commend them and will be giving them some more of my $$ in the future.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive with a moderate beard.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my original ordered arrived broken (thanks UPS).  </li>
            <li> This bottle should last a long time as u don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> As an added bonus it acts as a facial moisturizer and pre-shave for an electric razor which I use for occasional touch-up Not thick, so no grab</li>
            <li> I did a complete analysis of this product with 3 different razors, soap and cream for the company.  </li>
            <li> A must buy for anybody who has sensitive skin and shaves regularly or even occasionally .</li>
            <li> entire process takes a little bit of extra time, but it&#x27;s worth it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say the oil increases the speed of my blade, but it certainly does not slow it down like other oils I have</li>
            <li> Feels good on my skin and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  </li>
            <li> This will be among my shaving stuff as long as they continue to make it.</li>
            <li> I bought this bottle in December 2014 and can barely start to see the level in the bottle go down.</li>
            <li> Also, the little red bumps I used to get on my head after shaving have starting not show up just after I shave in the show.  </li>
            <li> (I shave every other day) after applying are &amp;#34;raised&amp;#34;, and I have no need for a third swipe.</li>
            <li> The bottle isn&#x27;t very big, so I was worried, but it turns out you only need a few drops!</li>
            <li> At this point, my shaves definitely create less irritation.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t used shaving oil before, you will wonder why this essential part of your routine was missing for so long.  </li>
            <li> me, his skin definitely looks less irritated, so</li>
            <li> During shave, I used to get little dings and dents, especially under my chin.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> Just follow the instructions, you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> I think I could get the same thing with some plain jojoba oil and olive oil, save your $$</li>
            <li> When I responded that the bottle was broken, they had a new shipped and at my door less than 48 hrs later.  </li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed less irritation and razor burn, but it&#x27;s pretty darn expensive for such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> I believe it was either due to the weather or the post office but</li>
            <li> I can say that the producer and other reviewers have not already said.  </li>
            <li> These oils can be half the size and cost the same (if not more).</li>
            <li> I used to always use an electric razor because it wasn&#x27;t as hard on my skin, but this stuff has me going back.  </li>
            <li> After about a week and a half of using this oil as a pre-shave, I started seeing progress with irritation levels.</li>
            <li> I also have to apply less pressure to the razor than I did before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I broke down and bought him a few of these beard treatments.</li>
            <li> They all tend to do their job well as even a little oil of any type should help with a smoother shave.</li>
            <li> While this product is a little pricey for what it is</li>
            <li> A little does go along way with this which is good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had previously used Shave Secret, AOS, Pacific Shaving Co, and American Crew</li>
            <li> People have said that I look less tired or &#x27;younger&#x27; in the afternoons and evenings.  </li>
            <li> Just a few drops will do .</li>
            <li> I always have trouble with irritation after shaving.</li>
            <li> Alright, I&#x27;ve owned quite a few pre-shave oils</li>
            <li> Not positive, but this might be olive oil or at least it would be a viable substitute.</li>
            <li> Sometimes oil will slow down my blade.</li>
            <li> My 5 o&#x27;clock shadow usually begins to appear at lunch time.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and am a bit paranoid about cutting or irritating my skin</li>
            <li> and I can tell you that they were just too thick - clogs the razor and have to use tons of product.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted it so badly, he swapped out and took it back home with us!  </li>
            <li> Sorry to do this, I rarely write negative reviews but the product is terrible.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m looking at you, Shave Secret).</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t leave a weird residue on my face or gunk up my DE razor like others</li>
            <li> and now he doesnt get the awful red skin color after shaving either</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of fried chicken when I put it on some times but the smell goes away as you shave and leaves the smoothest feeling I have ever felt.</li>
            <li> I purchased this pre shave oil for myself, I get really bad razor burn on my legs and arm pits and haven&#x27;t found anything that worked to prevent that.  </li>
            <li> :  Hyper-accelerated culture &#x3D; bad for shaving.  </li>
            <li> go wrong with this oil!!!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Meh. It doesn&#x27;t not work, but for the cost, I couldn&#x27;t distinguish any noticeable difference over just using a good shave cream with proper prep.</li>
            <li> I purchased this pre shave oil for myself, I get really bad razor burn on my legs and arm pits and haven&#x27;t found anything that worked to prevent that.  I purchased this oil and it has worked wonders on my sensitive skin.  I am getting a closer shave without any irritation, bumps or burn.  I am really impressed and won&#x27;t even think of shaving without it now.</li>
            <li> My husband has sensitive skin and is always complaining about his razor causing burns on his face. This stubble butter is great for softening up the skin and preventing the irritation that develops when shaving sensitive skin. Good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband but I also use it on my legs. This pre shave oil is Fantastic! It works perfectly! The razor glides like butter and there is no oily residue after shaving. The Customer Service is INCREDIBLE! our bottle arrived cracked at the bottom but the plastic was still on the top. I believe it was either due to the weather or the post office but either way we contacted Bodyality and the owner (Nate) responded promptly and sent us a new bottle a long with a free gift for our troubles. We are extremely satisfied with the pre shave oil as well as the customer service. We highly recommend this product! Bodyality has made a customer for life.</li>
            <li> I use this with DE Astra SP blades all I can say is wow... The blade really does just glide thru the shave... Definitely satisfied will purchase again</li>
            <li> My husband loves this oil! The bottle isn&#x27;t very big, so I was worried, but it turns out you only need a few drops! His shave is closer, and his skin is softer now than ever before. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Awesome Product. During shave, I used to get little dings and dents, especially under my chin.&lt;br /&gt;With this Pre-Shave Oil, I am getting a clean smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;The entire process takes a little bit of extra time, but it&#x27;s worth it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning I was not sure if this Oil would work, but, it works amazingly!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product . Just a few drops will do . It enhances the shaving experience and makes short work of the shaving process that we have to contend with each day and it is a wonderful adjunct to the shaving cream . A must buy for anybody who has sensitive skin and shaves regularly or even occasionally .</li>
            <li> This pre-shave oil is very high quality. I have tried many and this is by far the best. There are three primary aspects that a pre-shave oil--or any pre-shave for that matter--must have to be worthwhile:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Slickness-- Pre-shave oil, in my opinion, does not need to increase the speed of the blade on my skin; rather, it simply has to not get in the way of the slickness of my shaving soap. Sometimes oil will slow down my blade. Fortunately, this oil did not impede the speed of the blade on my skin. Just FYI, I shave with a double edge safety razor. Using quick and short strokes often provides me with the best shave. Without slickness, the blade would get stuck in my facial hair. I wouldn&#x27;t say the oil increases the speed of my blade, but it certainly does not slow it down like other oils I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Latherability-- Some pre-shave oils impede the latherability of my shaving soaps, but I did not find that to be the case with the shave butter oil. I had very successful lathers using my shave brush on top of this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Anti-irritation-- Just as Nate described, the oil helped keep my skin from razor burn and ingrown hairs. At first, properties 1 &amp; 2 were there, but I still suffered from irritation and ingrown hairs on my neck. This has always been an issue for me, which is why I switched to DE shaving in the first place. The switch has helped tremendously, but has not completely solved the problem. After about a week and a half of using this oil as a pre-shave, I started seeing progress with irritation levels. At this point, my shaves definitely create less irritation. Nate pointed out that it takes about a week for your skin to become more conditioned to hold moisture for more comfortable shaves if I consistently used the oil. I found this to absolutely be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is scentless and easy to apply. I highly recommend giving it a try, whether you have had success with oils in the past or not. Nate has created this product out of a passion for shaving and a desire to provide his customers with an optimal shaving experience. Doing business with him has been an absolute pleasure.</li>
            <li> Nice uncented oil!  First time shave with straight razor and no nicks or cuts thanks to this stuff!!!!</li>
            <li> This will be among my shaving stuff as long as they continue to make it. Omg! What a difference. I got a closer shave, softer skin, less irritation, it is truly unscented, feels great on my face... I love it. Buy this and try it. If you want something scented, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> Of all the pre shave oils I&#x27;ve tried, this has to be my favorite. They all tend to do their job well as even a little oil of any type should help with a smoother shave. This one doesn&#x27;t leave a weird residue on my face or gunk up my DE razor like others have (I&#x27;m looking at you, Shave Secret). Others work fine but feel a little watery (Pacific Shaving, Truefitt &amp; Hill). This one gets is just right, so you don&#x27;t need that much and your face feels great after shaving. Plus, they were smart in putting in anti irritant oils and taking out oils that can eventually cause irritation (lavender and sandalwood). For 2 oz, the price is very good and well worth it. I look forward to putting this on before I shave, and that&#x27;s exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to feel like.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Had previously used Shave Secret, AOS, Pacific Shaving Co, and American Crew but this far exceeds them all.  Unfortunately, my original ordered arrived broken (thanks UPS).  About an hour after it had arrived, I received an email from Bodyality asking if I liked the oil.  When I responded that the bottle was broken, they had a new shipped and at my door less than 48 hrs later.  Great product, first class customer support.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Man this stuff really works nice for a clean smooth shave! Just follow the instructions, you only need a little bit. THen splash with some warm, not hot, water and you&#x27;re off to the races. Great shave, will continue use.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I always have trouble with irritation after shaving. I find my skin to feel itchy and I always wind up scratching till its raw and even more sore than it was to begin with. Using this pre-shave oil eliminates the irritation I have always struggled with. I may even find myself shaving more frequently.</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of fried chicken when I put it on some times but the smell goes away as you shave and leaves the smoothest feeling I have ever felt.</li>
            <li> Love this oil - makes my safety razor shave very very smooth!</li>
            <li> I bought this to bring as a gift to a Christmas party as a White Elephant gift.  My husband wanted it so badly, he swapped out and took it back home with us!  He has a heavy beard, and really likes this to make his shave smoother and easier.</li>
            <li> While this product is a little pricey for what it is I can say it is extremely high quality. I&#x27;ve experimented with many different shave methods over the years the the closest most comfortable shave I can achieve is using a safety razor with this oil right before I shave, Proraso shave cream, boar brush, and you will be amazed how close but comfortable a shave you can get. The blade effortlessly glides across my face and leaves ZERO irritation every time. I only use 2 drops of this oil right before I shave and have not looked back. I bought this bottle in December 2014 and can barely start to see the level in the bottle go down. I am also a strong supporter of small businesses so will be buying this again when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> Ok, so not only does my husband love how this makes his skin feel, (especially with our desert dryness) but I think it&#x27;s great too. I used some while shaving my legs so I could give MY honest opinion when I write my review. I can genuinely say that it is AWESOME! My legs are silky smooth and feel so moisturized. We also BOTH have sensitive skin so were skeptics but no problems at all! I think this will be a new staple in my home.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil to shave my head and neck for a few weeks now, and I am really happy with how it works. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance and has left my head really smooth after my shave.  I have sensitive skin and am a bit paranoid about cutting or irritating my skin and this has really helped me get a better shave.  Also, the little red bumps I used to get on my head after shaving have starting not show up just after I shave in the show.  It has got to be this stuff too because I haven&#x27;t changed my razor or lotion.  I use a Fusion razor just for reference.  I also have a beard so I think I am going to try the beard oil as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great stuff if you have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t like heavy fragrances</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, if you have ever been with a man with a beard, you will understand what I am about to say lol.. they are sissies. My husband complains about shaving around it, it itching, redness and burning.. haha. So I broke down and bought him a few of these beard treatments. He seems to really like this one, it helps him get a closer shave than if he dont use it and now he doesnt get the awful red skin color after shaving either</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to make shaving more effective and less of a hassle.  I just want to quickly run the razor over my face and have no hair left.  Stubble Butter turned out to be a great product to make shaving quick, comfortable and easy.  Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> My third product tested and the slickest of the bunch! Shaving cream is not necessary</li>
            <li> Arrived well wrapped with bubble wrap.Upon opening I found that it has a small stopper in the neck so as not to let to much out at a time -great idea.so I have used this product twice and what a difference it makes .So smooth and close shave I have ever had ,well done you cannt go wrong with this oil!!!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect pre-shave oil!</li>
            <li> Just received it and used it. Best smooooth and close shave in years. This bottle should last a long time as u don&#x27;t need much. As an added bonus it acts as a facial moisturizer and pre-shave for an electric razor which I use for occasional touch-up Not thick, so no grab</li>
            <li> Alright, I&#x27;ve owned quite a few pre-shave oils and I can tell you that they were just too thick - clogs the razor and have to use tons of product. Here, just add water, then reapply with the existing oil on your face. It is true, this is anti irritation at its best. I would also add that my whiskers, (I shave every other day) after applying are &amp;#34;raised&amp;#34;, and I have no need for a third swipe. I use a DE razor, and while my shave cream dries out the oil remains on the face so the blade still glides.  EDIT: Update - turns out my wife decided she&#x27;d try it ( as well as my Cool Water) Uses it on her legs - her legs are silky smooth. She confessed. lol  Good woman.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best pre shave oil I have used to date for facial and body hair.</li>
            <li> This pre-shave oil protects your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous smell and a damp hot towel makes you feel like a king!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came sealed so you know you bought safely</li>
            <li> Absolutely great service...and the product has worked for me!!!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product.  My facial hair tends to grow very quickly.  I am the type of person who could probably grow a near-full beard within 7 days if I didn&#x27;t shave.  My 5 o&#x27;clock shadow usually begins to appear at lunch time.  I determined that this was because I was not getting a close enough shave, so I set out to find products that would allow me to get a closer, more comfortable shave and possibly reduce some of the skin irritation that I experience.  Thus far, using this product has resulted in a noticeable difference in my shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am taking baby steps away from using the typical cartridge razor/shaving gel combo towards using a safety razor with a good brush, oil and cream.  Baby steps.  This pre-shave oil has resulted in smoother, longer lasting shaves.  People have said that I look less tired or &#x27;younger&#x27; in the afternoons and evenings.  I think this is probably because I no longer have a half-beard by 3pm, and I have also implemented an effective moisturizer into my post-shave routine.  My skin feels great, whereas before I felt like I needed to shave again when 4 or 5 o&#x27;clock rolled around each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, there isn&#x27;t much else I can say that the producer and other reviewers have not already said.  Be sure to open up your pores properly before applying.  I apply the oil in slow circles, being sure not to overlook any area that I intend to shave.  I also let the oil sit for a minute or more before applying shaving gel.  As the razor now glides over my skin more smoothly and there is less friction, I am able to take my time, especially in areas of my face that were previously hard to shave.  I also have to apply less pressure to the razor than I did before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you value self-improvement, you will value this product.  If you haven&#x27;t used shaving oil before, you will wonder why this essential part of your routine was missing for so long.  You may eventually find yourself waking up earlier to prepare your shaving ritual.  We live in a hyper-accelerated culture where we have been conditioned to want everything as quickly and cheaply and simply as possible.  There are some situations in which the &#x27;old way&#x27; of doing something is actually better than the &#x27;modern way&#x27;.  Shaving is one of these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR:  Hyper-accelerated culture &#x3D; bad for shaving.  Get back to the basics and learn to shave properly.  You&#x27;ll need a proper tool kit and pre-shave oil is one of the tools that should be in your tool kit.  As long as you are able to look and feel your best, you won&#x27;t care so much when you lose your dog/wife/house/car/job etc.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I used to always use an electric razor because it wasn&#x27;t as hard on my skin, but this stuff has me going back.  It super charges the shaving experience, with the end result being a closer shave with no irritation that I just wasn&#x27;t getting before.</li>
            <li> Great product for those who shave often or have sensitive skin. It leaves your face nice and smooth. The 2 oz bottle is a great size because a little oil goes a long way and it fit nicely in my travel bag and medicine cabinet! I was very impressed with the product!</li>
            <li> Sorry to do this, I rarely write negative reviews but the product is terrible. The oil is old and smells rancid which is not what you want to be rubbing into your face.</li>
            <li> Fantastic company to deal with.  This pre shave is lite and won&#x27;t clog up your razor.  Puts a nice layer on your skin.  I did a complete analysis of this product with 3 different razors, soap and cream for the company.  I paid for the product.  Best for me was to put on one application, wait 1 minute and put on another.  Really offers a smooth shave and your skin feels soft with no irritation.  I use Feather blades in my safety razor and Feather DX non folding razor.  If it doesn&#x27;t work you know right away.  I found on touch ups, after 2 or 3 passes, I just splashed some warm water on my face and the razor glided with no irritation.  Washes off with no problems.  Everyone&#x27;s beard and skin is different.  My skin is very sensitive with a moderate beard.</li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed less irritation and razor burn, but it&#x27;s pretty darn expensive for such a small bottle. Not positive, but this might be olive oil or at least it would be a viable substitute.</li>
            <li> expensive, you have to use more than they say on bottle, but does help with irritation</li>
            <li> I got this product for my husband. He initially said he didn&#x27;t feel like it was doing anything but after he was all done he said his skin felt softer. He says that after you shave, you&#x27;ll be able to see and feel that the oil is still on your skin. He didn&#x27;t have a problem with that and says it&#x27;s easy to wash off, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, his skin definitely looks less irritated, so yay! I&#x27;m tempted to use this on my legs...</li>
            <li> This stuff really saves face (no pun intended) when you&#x27;re shaving. It really helps especially considering how sensitive my skin is.</li>
            <li> Fantastic value!!! These oils can be half the size and cost the same (if not more). Going from L&#x27;OCCITANE to this was an easy transition!</li>
            <li> Godda say this is really worth it.  I use it before applying shave gel.  I have used it many times now and I don&#x27;t have any of the irratation and red bumps like I had before with shaving.  I will be keeping this in my routine.  Feels good on my skin and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  A little does go along way with this which is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**  I received this product for a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Its ok nothing fancy I think I could get the same thing with some plain jojoba oil and olive oil, save your $$, I didnt notice any extra slickness.    Update!!!    Great customer service by this company, look at their products and give them a try they stand behind them and gaurantee satisfaction! Hard to find these days, I commend them and will be giving them some more of my $$ in the future. So should you!</li>
