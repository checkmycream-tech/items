            <li>I love the feel of the serum.  </li>
            <li>Moved up from the Kiehl&#x27;s 10.5% (which I also love) but wanted a bit more Vit C.</li>
            <li>I have used this serum for many, many years, after it was recommended by a plastic surgeon.  </li>
            <li>I still have not the  wrinkles many of my friends do.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my skin feels better when using the Vitamin C Serum.  </li>
            <li>And I love C serums.....</li>
            <li>I ve tried many....</li>
            <li>Rated ok because it stung when I used it......</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but I absolutely love this serum</li>
            <li>As soon as I stopped it got better.</li>
            <li>and my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>Much better price than at my dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for two years and love it.</li>
            <li>The doctor who has lovely skin says she uses this product alone.  </li>
            <li>and it probably takes a doctor to tell you which strength is appropriate.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>There are lots of serums out there, but I just really love the Obagi.</li>
            <li>This optimizes and counters the good moisture and despite hot, humid weather, my skin has never looked clearer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Obaji products for years and Amazon has the best prices on their products and they are the same as paying full price through your Doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>Good product and fast delivery</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super impressed with the results in using this product for a short time.</li>
            <li>Other people have comments on my skin looking great since I started using this product!</li>
            <li>Now if loosing weight were as easy.</li>
            <li>Easy for my skin to absorb.</li>
            <li>An excellent product; research indicates that vitamin C combats free radicals associated with many of the signs of aging becoming apparent on our faces as we MATURE; easy to apply; this is not a product you use once</li>
            <li>Helps with the collagen and makes the skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>It has kept my skin unwrinkled and smooth into my elderly years.  </li>
            <li>It is oily, smells flowery, and does not absorb into the skin the way the genuine product does.</li>
            <li>Recommended by my aesthetician as a light anti-oxidant serum that will not clog pores.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Obagi C serum for years because it is simply fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Dont cheap out on this one.</li>
            <li>Product was in sealed bottle and very fresh.  </li>
            <li>Great for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Love Obagi products and can get it here so much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Im a true believer</li>
            <li>I stopped using it for awhile and just got some again and had the same reaction - loved what it does for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Overall good product and value.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll see great results before the bottle is empty!  </li>
            <li>Use quickly, though as it does have an expiration time.</li>
            <li>Notice the difference quickly.  </li>
            <li>Great product and at half the cost from what it sells with my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I use this serum regularly and I love it!</li>
            <li>Really helps smooth the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>Itâ€™s worth it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>although I have turn to other products, i&#x27;ve always turn back to obagi because the results I get are magnificent..</li>
            <li>Sure enough my Dr. said that this was not the original Obagi serum and that it seemed to be tampered with.</li>
            <li>I have used for a long time and my facial skin is very good.</li>
            <li>I have fair, sensitive skin prone to dryness, but with daily use of product that works, its a no-brainer.</li>
            <li>very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>THE FIRST TIME USED,</li>
            <li>Why pay more for the exact same products.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>I like the 15%, I had been using the 20% which I think would be better for younger skin.</li>
            <li>But this one sadly not for me.</li>
            <li>I have used it before and noticed a definite change for the better in my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is not the real stuff!</li>
            <li>and I like how I can pick a higher %.</li>
            <li>Using the serum first, when dry apply the Obagi Hydrate on top and then sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>A long time favorite recommended by my dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t do much for me so gave it to my daughter.  </li>
            <li>It looks like my skin has brightened much since I have been using it.</li>
            <li>If the product has really been changed that much, I would like to have some explanation</li>
            <li>They really do help to protect the skin and offer anti-aging advantages.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin but am concerned about over drying (age 47).  </li>
            <li>and it really makes a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I get complements galore on my beautiful skin and small pores, despite years of baking in the sun and squeezing white heads.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than any other Vit C product that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I noticed that it looked and smelled different from my original that I purchased</li>
            <li>New guidelines for reviews and Amazon keeps rejecting us reviewers truth when we state the product is not the same as the original.  </li>
            <li>Compared to the same product I have bought  from a dermatologist office, the one I bought through Amazon looks completely different in many ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I went ahead and purchased a brand new bottle at his office to look at and sure enough the color and smell was completely different.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this skin care product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive skin prone to break out.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for mature skin.</li>
            <li>Be aware there are various percentages</li>
            <li>It not only helps keep my skin healthy, but it gives a little &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I am 61 years old.</li>
            <li>I have been using the complete nu-derm system for over 3 years.  </li>
            <li>what products I use to keep my skin looking so young.</li>
            <li>I will be interested in seeing my long term results</li>
            <li>Skin is soft all day and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs easily tho and works just fine...just not suitable for me</li>
            <li>When you get a new bottle it should be clear, not yellow.  </li>
            <li>The last bottle I received might not be the real deal though, the serum smelled and felt the same however it is clear.  </li>
            <li>Had brown spots for a long time, used all kinds of promising creams and serums, Obagi was the only one that helped my skin clarity...period!!</li>
            <li>The serum usually has a light yellow tint to it....</li>
            <li>and I suggest others to only purchase this type of product from a licensed professional.</li>
            <li>My skin has it&#x27;s natural glow back!</li>
            <li>that only obagi has the right formula to help me with my dark spots..</li>
    </ol>

            <li> They really do help to protect the skin and offer anti-aging advantages.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin but am concerned about over drying (age 47).  </li>
            <li> and it really makes a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I get complements galore on my beautiful skin and small pores, despite years of baking in the sun and squeezing white heads.  </li>
            <li> I like it better than any other Vit C product that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I noticed that it looked and smelled different from my original that I purchased</li>
            <li> New guidelines for reviews and Amazon keeps rejecting us reviewers truth when we state the product is not the same as the original.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the same product I have bought  from a dermatologist office, the one I bought through Amazon looks completely different in many ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and purchased a brand new bottle at his office to look at and sure enough the color and smell was completely different.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this skin care product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive skin prone to break out.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for mature skin.</li>
            <li> Be aware there are various percentages</li>
            <li> It not only helps keep my skin healthy, but it gives a little &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I am 61 years old.</li>
            <li> I have been using the complete nu-derm system for over 3 years.  </li>
            <li> what products I use to keep my skin looking so young.</li>
            <li> I will be interested in seeing my long term results</li>
            <li> Skin is soft all day and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs easily tho and works just fine...just not suitable for me</li>
            <li> When you get a new bottle it should be clear, not yellow.  </li>
            <li> The last bottle I received might not be the real deal though, the serum smelled and felt the same however it is clear.  </li>
            <li> Had brown spots for a long time, used all kinds of promising creams and serums, Obagi was the only one that helped my skin clarity...period!!</li>
            <li> The serum usually has a light yellow tint to it....</li>
            <li> and I suggest others to only purchase this type of product from a licensed professional.</li>
            <li> My skin has it&#x27;s natural glow back!</li>
            <li> that only obagi has the right formula to help me with my dark spots..</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin may use every other day.  </li>
            <li> First because I don&#x27;t want to waste my money and second because it is not worth it to take the risk of putting something I don&#x27;t trust on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> I still have the last empty bottle and it says Exp 07/15.</li>
            <li> The serum seems different from what I have used before, less scent and color.</li>
            <li> This is my personal experience with the product; however, I am a registered nurse surrounded by a few dermatologists; visit one and ask them about Vitamin C and its benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The signs of aging cannot be completely irradiated, at least not yet, but can be slowed down.</li>
            <li> and I use this in the evening on face before other products.  </li>
            <li> one to be sold in physician&#x27;s offices and the other to be sold online?</li>
            <li> Just like from my skin center but cheaper!</li>
            <li> I use it as part of the regime but when I have little time use it alone.  </li>
            <li> No need for LOTS of gimmicky stuff...just practical applications that work.</li>
            <li> Not a huge obagi fan</li>
            <li> Very slight, if any, improvement to my skin.</li>
            <li> It takes a small amount</li>
            <li> This is NOT authentic Obagi Serum 15.</li>
            <li> This past summer I got a lot of sun damage</li>
            <li> So I used the product for a about a week before I noticed I was breaking out in a small rash</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The smoothness and less redness is noticeable!!!</li>
            <li> so guess I am disappointed as it did not make me look 30 years younger.</li>
            <li> and it is illegal to sell a prescription drug online without consulting a physician, that this product does not have expiration date which is not correct because I have bought it in the past</li>
            <li> Everyone asks what my secret is, and this is it!  </li>
            <li> Try it for yourself, you won&#x27;t be sorry!  </li>
            <li> but I was saving $20 on a fake product that could have had terrible consequences.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used for a long time and my facial skin is very good. I am 61 years old. It was recomended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Excellent Obagi product.  I have used this for years.  Helps with the collagen and makes the skin smooth.  I love the feel of the serum.  It takes a small amount and I use this in the evening on face before other products.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love Obagi products and this did not disappoint! Moved up from the Kiehl&#x27;s 10.5% (which I also love) but wanted a bit more Vit C.</li>
            <li> I have used this serum for many, many years, after it was recommended by a plastic surgeon.  It has kept my skin unwrinkled and smooth into my elderly years.  I still have not the  wrinkles many of my friends do.  I use 6-7 drops every morning after I was my face.  It has been a must in my skin care, daily.&lt;br /&gt;My grown daughters also use it.&lt;br /&gt;PLUS, stay out of the sun (with your face)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9-9-13</li>
            <li> Good product and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on a daily basis since purchase about 4 to 6 weeks ago. Very slight, if any, improvement to my skin. However, I am in my 70&#x27;s so was not expecting an instant miracle. Will continue daily use. I&#x27;m such an optimist!</li>
            <li> I have been using the complete nu-derm system for over 3 years.  I get complements galore on my beautiful skin and small pores, despite years of baking in the sun and squeezing white heads.  I can&#x27;t say enough about all the products.  Try it for yourself, you won&#x27;t be sorry!  I&#x27;m almost 68 and could pass for 10 years younger.  Now if loosing weight were as easy.</li>
            <li> My favorite Vitamin C serum, been using for years.</li>
            <li> I paid over 90 dollars for a similar product at cosmetic surgeons office. Great  product.</li>
            <li> I like this serum - seem to soak well into the skin and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, really works.</li>
            <li> Great feeling for the skin. Perfect for face and neck.</li>
            <li> The smelling is just amazing. My skin got really good and moisturized. O loved and approved it.  Itâ€™s worth it.</li>
            <li> BOUGHT THIS THREE TIMES AND NEVER NOTICED ANY DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN.  SOME TINGLE THE FIRST TIME USED, BUT THAT WORE OFF.  DON&#x27;T THINK I WILL PURCHASE ANY MORE.</li>
            <li> Great product and price.</li>
            <li> Good product, but a bit drying to my face.</li>
            <li> Just four drops of this added to a Hyaluronic Serum has changed the clarity of my skin drastically. The smoothness and less redness is noticeable!!!</li>
            <li> New guidelines for reviews and Amazon keeps rejecting us reviewers truth when we state the product is not the same as the original.  Let&#x27;s see if they allow this one to be posted as I have written it 3 times and they reject when I try to leave a warning.  Been using the 15% serum for years.  Absolutely love the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; product.  Leaves my skin dewy and refreshed.  It acts as a great barrier for the elements in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been purchasing from Amazon for years to save a bit of money, but recently the quality of product has not been the same.  It is oxidized when I receive the bottle.  When you get a new bottle it should be clear, not yellow.  If yellow it has been opened at tainted.  Please watch for this.</li>
            <li> Love Obagi products and can get it here so much cheaper.  Why pay more for the exact same products.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 years and have been extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using either Obagi or Skinceuticals serum 10, 15, 20 for well over a decade. This is NOT authentic Obagi Serum 15. It is oily, smells flowery, and does not absorb into the skin the way the genuine product does.</li>
            <li> The Obagi products sold here are not authorized to sell Obagi products. Go to the website and verify it yourself. http://obagi.com/patients/about-us/genuine-obagi</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look more moist and youthful.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!!! Great price for such a fantastic product!!!!</li>
            <li> Obagi products are great!  I&#x27;ve noticed my skin feels better when using the Vitamin C Serum.  Please keep selling, much better price here than at derm office!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a model and my skin is my number one priority...I have been using this Obama product two years now. I literally have people stop me on the street to tell me I am glowing and I know why. It&#x27;s this C serum!!!! Keeps skin smooth and clear. I wouldn&#x27;t trade this product for the world. The absolute best. I use it with the RxC face wash and the RxC day cream with no SPF. Thank you Dr. Obagi!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent face product!  Great for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great product and at half the cost from what it sells with my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Obaji products for years and Amazon has the best prices on their products and they are the same as paying full price through your Doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do much for me so gave it to my daughter.  She loves it and uses it daily.  Of course she is 30 years younger so guess I am disappointed as it did not make me look 30 years younger.</li>
            <li> I like the 15%, I had been using the 20% which I think would be better for younger skin. I get a lot of compliments and people&lt;br /&gt;ask what products I use to keep my skin looking so young.</li>
            <li> I have been using obagi products for years and have been very satisfied</li>
            <li> Creates younger, brighter skin.  Even got my husband to start using this daily.  Evens skin tone too.  I like it better than any other Vit C product that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 10 years. Everyone asks what my secret is, and this is it!  It not only helps keep my skin healthy, but it gives a little &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s the one facial product I cannot be without.</li>
            <li> Im a true believer that only obagi has the right formula to help me with my dark spots.. although I have turn to other products, i&#x27;ve always turn back to obagi because the results I get are magnificent..I luv obagi</li>
            <li> I like it because I alternate at nights with my Retinol prescription. I should be nourishing the skin (I hope)</li>
            <li> Had brown spots for a long time, used all kinds of promising creams and serums, Obagi was the only one that helped my skin clarity...period!!</li>
            <li> Compared to the same product I have bought  from a dermatologist office, the one I bought through Amazon looks completely different in many ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The bottle&#x27;s label is different, it does not contain hydroquinone 4%, it does not have an expiration date, it doesn&#x27;t have the same scent, consistency or color. I contacted the seller and they said they sell this product in their office, they are Obagi authorized seller (which is correct because I verified that from the Obagi&#x27;s website before purchasing it), that the product could not contain hydroquinone since it requires a prescription and it is illegal to sell a prescription drug online without consulting a physician, that this product does not have expiration date which is not correct because I have bought it in the past and they all have an expiration date. I still have the last empty bottle and it says Exp 07/15. The seller also said that I mistook the product. How could I have guessed that Obagi makes the same product with different characteristics? one to be sold in physician&#x27;s offices and the other to be sold online? I can not return the product because I already opened it but I learned my lesson. I will not buy something like this again online. First because I don&#x27;t want to waste my money and second because it is not worth it to take the risk of putting something I don&#x27;t trust on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did my part writing this review. You do yours deciding what is best for you.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I am  very happy with it. I will very likely order it  again. Will never be without it</li>
            <li> Great, great product. Use quickly, though as it does have an expiration time.</li>
            <li> Break me out a bit..... I&#x27;m very sensitive skin prone to break out.  So I always have to use dermatologicos creams.... And I love C serums..... I ve tried many.... But this one sadly not for me.</li>
            <li> Product arrived timely considering that my address is in Hawaii.  Product was in sealed bottle and very fresh.  It looks like my skin has brightened much since I have been using it.</li>
            <li> Rated ok because it stung when I used it......my skin never got used to it....I probably won&#x27;t buy it again. It absorbs easily tho and works just fine...just not suitable for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super impressed with the results in using this product for a short time. I will be interested in seeing my long term results</li>
            <li> An excellent product; research indicates that vitamin C combats free radicals associated with many of the signs of aging becoming apparent on our faces as we MATURE; easy to apply; this is not a product you use once and you are done; similar to sun screen, you must apply preferably every night; I am NOT a dermatologists, nor pretend to be. This is my personal experience with the product; however, I am a registered nurse surrounded by a few dermatologists; visit one and ask them about Vitamin C and its benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The signs of aging cannot be completely irradiated, at least not yet, but can be slowed down. And whatever you do, use sun protection; from skin cancer to wrinkles. Again, ask a dermatologists about the sun.</li>
            <li> I have used it before and noticed a definite change for the better in my skin.  I stopped using it for awhile and just got some again and had the same reaction - loved what it does for my skin.  I can&#x27;t help but think this is a great product for me and 15% seems to be just the right formula for me!</li>
            <li> The serum seems different from what I have used before, less scent and color.The consistency is also thinner. If the product has really been changed that much, I would like to have some explanation</li>
            <li> Love it. Works wonderful. Love how my skin feels using it!!</li>
            <li> I am 24 and I have a ton of freckles, I&#x27;m a big boater so I&#x27;m constantly in the sun during the summer months. This past summer I got a lot of sun damage so my facial plastic surgeon suggest I use this serum to disperse my melanocytes and a month later my skin is like night and day. I get compliments all the time and I have a even, radiant skin tone. I think I will begin the 20% once I finish this bottle! Not a huge obagi fan but I absolutely love this serum and I apply the sun shield SPF 50 matte on top of it! I may just make the switch after all!</li>
            <li> This is not the real stuff! I had the same experience as another buyer. It looked different than the one I bought from my dermatologist. My skin broke out as well. As soon as I stopped it got better. I will be taking this up with the seller</li>
            <li> This product is a must have.  I cannot live without this skin care product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year and it&#x27;s worth every penny.  I am 43 and my skin has never looked better.  I am constantly getting compliments and referring this product to family and friends.</li>
            <li> I started using Obagi products over a decade ago and only wish I had started sooner. They really do help to protect the skin and offer anti-aging advantages.  I often get complimented on my skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after I ran out of my Obagi Vitamin C that I purchased from my dermatologist. I noticed that it looked and smelled different from my original that I purchased but since I had nothing to compare it to at the time, I thought it was my imagination. So I used the product for a about a week before I noticed I was breaking out in a small rash and my skin did not feel the same. I finally went to my dermatologist and told him my problem and brought the bottle in to be looked at. Sure enough my Dr. said that this was not the original Obagi serum and that it seemed to be tampered with. I went ahead and purchased a brand new bottle at his office to look at and sure enough the color and smell was completely different. Who knows what I had been putting on my face for the last 2 weeks. I definitely learned my lesson and I suggest others to only purchase this type of product from a licensed professional. I might have thought I was saving $20 but I was saving $20 on a fake product that could have had terrible consequences. Thank god the rash went away and now my skin looks beautiful once again.</li>
            <li> There doesn&#x27;t need to be any hesitation when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Ive been using this for years and its a great product.</li>
            <li> I like it, but do not like how it smells when I put it on my face.</li>
            <li> I have used the Obagi products for many years with great results.  Using the serum first, when dry apply the Obagi Hydrate on top and then sunscreen.  Skin is soft all day and hydrated.  I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s and my skin has maintained a youthful appearance and no wrinkles. No need for LOTS of gimmicky stuff...just practical applications that work. Using GloMinerals powder foundation. I have fair, sensitive skin prone to dryness, but with daily use of product that works, its a no-brainer.</li>
            <li> Great price and very good product.  Just like from my skin center but cheaper! and I like how I can pick a higher %.</li>
            <li> Product is very nice. Brightness of skin is noticed with in a day or so.  Notice the difference quickly.  If you have sensitive skin may use every other day.  Overall good product and value. Thank you for carrying.</li>
            <li> A long time favorite recommended by my dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;I see the diffrence when I tried something else of equal price.</li>
            <li> Great protection for the skin</li>
            <li> excellent value for the price</li>
            <li> Recommended by my aesthetician as a light anti-oxidant serum that will not clog pores.  I have very oily skin but am concerned about over drying (age 47).  This optimizes and counters the good moisture and despite hot, humid weather, my skin has never looked clearer.  Much better price than at my dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Obagi C serum for years because it is simply fantastic.  As a matter of fact, every one on the planet should use this serum, it makes your skin radiant and just gorgeous.  The last bottle I received might not be the real deal though, the serum smelled and felt the same however it is clear.  The serum usually has a light yellow tint to it.... unless Obagi changed their formula?  Something is off...</li>
            <li> Best Vitamin C Serum on the market!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Really helps smooth the texture of my skin. It is a good product.</li>
            <li> This serum is awesome for my skin! My skin has it&#x27;s natural glow back! Give it a try &amp; you may like it too.</li>
            <li> A great product! I&#x27;ve been using this for two years and love it. I would highly recommend this for mature skin.</li>
            <li> This has not made any change to my skin. I&#x27;ve used it for over 3 weeks now, and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference to clarity, brown spots or anything else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Obagi products for years and am quite happy with the results.  The doctor who has lovely skin says she uses this product alone.  I use it as part of the regime but when I have little time use it alone.  Be aware there are various percentages and it probably takes a doctor to tell you which strength is appropriate.</li>
            <li> very fast shipping. I have bought this serum several times. It&#x27;s good as always. Easy for my skin to absorb.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll see great results before the bottle is empty!  I use it morning and evening for the sun damage benefits. Other people have comments on my skin looking great since I started using this product!</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  Have reordered it several times.  There are lots of serums out there, but I just really love the Obagi.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist. Feels wonderful on my skin, and absorbs quickly. One bottle lasts about six months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years and it really makes a difference in my skin.  I can tell the difference on my skin when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I use this serum regularly and I love it! But this serum doesnt feel and smell like the one I buy at my doctor&#x27;s office. Dont cheap out on this one.</li>
