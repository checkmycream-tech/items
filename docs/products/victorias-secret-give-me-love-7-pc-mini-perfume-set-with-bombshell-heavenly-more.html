            <li>Shipping was pretty quick as well.</li>
            <li>and I really like the fact that it has 7 different kind of scents all in one box.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be using them though I love each scent</li>

            <li> My wife loved the perfume. I gave it as a small extra gift for Christmas. She loves the option of a different scent every day. I love the way she smells every day. It has been 6 months and she still has plenty of each scent still to use.</li>
            <li> I liked the packaging it came in a cute VS box and I really like the fact that it has 7 different kind of scents all in one box. The bottles are just smaller than I anticipated I guess, they are just a tiny bigger than a sample bottle you would find in the mall. I will definitely be using them though I love each scent but I&#x27;m probably better off buying a large bottle for the same price as this entire set, it would probably last me a lot longer. Shipping was pretty quick as well.</li>
            <li> This is a great gift idea for any girl who really likes victoria&#x27;s secret, and in particular, their perfumes.  This is a nice sampler of the different perfumes they carry, each with a unique little bottle.</li>
            <li> Thumbs up my wife loves it !!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Victoria&#x27;s Secret Perfume.  Out of 7, there&#x27;s only 1 scent that I don&#x27;t care for,  but I only bought it because I wanted both a bottle of Bombshell and Sexy Little Things Noir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is where the 4 stars come in...It is advertised that the fourth bottle on the top row is Sexy Little Things Noir (the little black and white bottle) (which is the perfume that I wanted the most!!), however, when I opened up the package, there was no Sexy Little Things Noir, but I received was Noir Tease (which is pleasant, but not what I wanted!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The order was packaged nicely and shipped quickly!  My only qualm with the order was that I didn&#x27;t get what I wanted from the order to begin with.</li>
            <li> Would buy again and with the large selection this made the perfect gift!!! Neat package design and a great product. Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it. She wanted Victoria Secret perfume but didn&#x27;t say which one. This solved the problem and she likes them all.</li>
            <li> I just got my order in the mail. I love what I purchased and would purchase from these folks again. I got my order with 10 days of ordering and it came packaged very well where nothing could break!!</li>
            <li> now she smells good, just kidding.  But this is exactly what we thought it would be from Victoria&#x27;s Secret.  Good quality product.</li>
            <li> She will love them. She still carries the smallest one with her wherever she goes</li>
            <li> Item was sent as a gift to mother. Price was great and the item arrived earlier than expected. One of the fragrance bottles leaked out in gift box :(  Was disappointed...Most likely a manufacturer&#x27;s defect.</li>
            <li> My wife always had a hard time finding the right perfume after a while of wearing them and after the many trips into different stores on 5th avenue in NYC, I knew I had to get this. Originally, I expected the perfume set to be really tiny but it wasn&#x27;t, it was reasonable sized. Now, my wife finally found her smell after 3 years. It was Love is Heavenly. Only if I bought this 3 years ago......!</li>
            <li> Every year I give my mom these little perfume and she loves them</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my 23 year old daughter for her birthday. I had purchased one similar to it last year for Christmas, and she specifically asked for another. She loves the variety of scents, and loves the small size of each bottle. She commented that the bottles are easy to carry in her purse, and she loves to smell so nice all the time. The price was good, and it was nice to get a gift that she really loved!</li>
            <li> smell doesn&#x27;t last for long time ):</li>
            <li> Nice assortment for trial basis.</li>
            <li> This is as I expected. Really good!!</li>
