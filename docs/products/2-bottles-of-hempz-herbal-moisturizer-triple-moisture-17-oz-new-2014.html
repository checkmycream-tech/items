            <li>Great product, fast shipping</li>
            <li>Love the lotion, but all 4 of my bottles-the pump did not work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>So glad I bought one for myself.</li>

            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I love it too.  </li>
            <li>Love the fragrance and how it moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li>A product many in my household can use and love  </li>
            <li>This lotion is very moisturizing, and was a great deal for the price.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It smells heavenly and moisturizes better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the product.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s everything they say and more.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone looking for more radiant skin</li>
            <li>and I ordered more when the lotion was gone.</li>
            <li>i will but more when i run out.</li>
            <li>Smells so much better than the original Hempz, with about twice the moisturizing power!</li>
            <li>This lotion smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t seem to linger too long.</li>
            <li>I have tried the original lotion and love it.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you rub it in for awhile though, it seems to be absorbed into your skin better when it&#x27;s warmed up.</li>
            <li>Then I tried the age defying blend and wasnt as impressed with the formula or smell and was going to go back to the original when I found this special 2 bottles package.  </li>
            <li>This is an awesome deal, greet smell, nice texture, everyday lotion!!</li>
            <li>Our families best product ever, hands down</li>
            <li>Non greasy and silky smooth:) I&#x27;ve liked all their products that I have tried so far:)</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth and smells fabulous.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect for me because I have such sensitive skin and this lotion does not irritate my face and leave all parts of my body smooth.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell of this lotion and a nice change from the regular Hempz lotions.  </li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and it leaves my skin soft and moisturized without a oily film!</li>
            <li>Great lotion if you have very dry skin, I put it on once a day and keeps my skin moisturized all day</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel nice and soft</li>
            <li>I love most Hempz products,  and use them on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>My new favorite thing.  </li>
            <li>It smells fresh, it is not greasy, and makes your hands feel like silk.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li>Simply just love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m done with one bottle (and down to one bottle), I buy 2 more!</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really care for the scent of this one.</li>
            <li>Received order in a very timely fashion.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel like I have to moisturize as much as before.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>and this lotion keeps my skin smooth and silky all day long.  </li>
            <li>Wow shipping was fast!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a more unique fragrance that didn&#x27;t seem like a knock-off to Victoria&#x27;s Secret.  </li>
            <li>Nice thick lotion without being oily.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I have eczema, &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34;, and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The only (funny) drawback is that for some reason the animals are attracted to it and keep trying to lick it off.</li>
            <li>I now give them as gifts and so far everyone loves this product.</li>
            <li>Plus it is all natural</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they are just old or if hempz has changed its scent.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin (eczema) and this lotion never burns.  </li>
            <li>I really do not know what this other formula was or if they changed it, I just like it now will will order more.</li>

            <li> The only negative thing I have to say is that it smells almost identical to Victoria&#x27;s Secret - Love Spell fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I get lots of compliments and it keeps moisture in your skin for a long time.</li>
            <li> I use it all year long</li>
            <li> The scent of this is not the same as every single other bottle I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> and she recommended this lotion after my tans so my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> I am now using it after every shower, before I go to bed and in between for my dry hands.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry from showering 2 times a day.  </li>
            <li> I have found that tanning has helped with my skin in the past (as long as I have a tan lotion with lots of moisturizers) and so after stopping for 2 years I went back to tan last week.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I double-checked bottles, thought I had received the the green tea and Asian pear scent by accident, but had not.</li>
            <li> but it was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the herbal seems to have a sweet fruity smell to it, instead of a green, herbal smell.</li>
            <li> no more dry, itchy skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would recommend this to anyone with moderate to extremely bad dry skin, it leaves your skin feeling silky smooth all day long and you wont smell bad either.</li>

            <li> Great lotion. No itching smells great</li>
            <li> Lovely lotion. Unfortunately, the herbal seems to have a sweet fruity smell to it, instead of a green, herbal smell. Most people would probably like it, but I am not into fruity fragrances. I double-checked bottles, thought I had received the the green tea and Asian pear scent by accident, but had not.</li>
            <li> I like all the Hempz products I have tried. I now give them as gifts and so far everyone loves this product. It is makes my skin soft and this lotion has the best fragrance</li>
            <li> I love Hempz lotions but I don&#x27;t really care for the scent of this one.</li>
            <li> The best lotion ever!</li>
            <li> I only received one bottle instead of two.</li>
            <li> For some reason the smell is completely different.  Perhaps they changed ingredients /the formula but it was not what I expected.  Do not like the smell at all</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product! Love the smell!</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> great product thank you</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for 3 years, I love the feel of it on my skin, and it smells so good.</li>
            <li> Love the lotion, but all 4 of my bottles-the pump did not work. what is the problem?????</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  It is the best I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve tried  LOTS!  I have very dry skin and this lotion keeps my skin smooth and silky all day long.  I use it twice a day.  After my shower and before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> I have eczema, &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34;, and very sensitive skin. I have tried everything from body washes, soaps, numerous different lotions. My skin got so bad I was just rubbing petroleum jelly all over my body because that seemed to be the only thing that kept me from having flaky skin (I have really bad well water too which I&#x27;m sure does not help my situation). I have found that tanning has helped with my skin in the past (as long as I have a tan lotion with lots of moisturizers) and so after stopping for 2 years I went back to tan last week. I explained to the employee how bad my skin is and she recommended this lotion after my tans so my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out. After one use I was so amazed by the amazing moisture this product gave my skin I am now using it after every shower, before I go to bed and in between for my dry hands. My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this great in years!!! I even went and ordered the matching body wash from Ulta so I can include that into my routine. At $23 a bottle at my salon I will order my next bottle from here. Bottom line if you have really bad problem skin like me, don&#x27;t think just buy it. Plus it is all natural so you are doing an even better thing for you skin!!!!</li>
            <li> The lotion is very, very good! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Daughter for Christmas, it smells wonderful and it is a cream that works. So glad I bought one for myself.</li>
            <li> Great product and price.</li>
            <li> I love most Hempz products,  and use them on a daily basis. However,  I was very disappointed in this product. The smell of this product is a cross between rotten fruit and body odor. Texture of lotion is &amp;#34;whipped&amp;#34; which must equate to thin. Will not buy this fragrance again.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry from showering 2 times a day.  I apply this twice a day and it moistens well without making me greasy.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t pass up getting basically two for one! I was so stoked to find this deal! I use it all day every day. It smells so wonderful and feels so nice and airy when on, my skin loves it!</li>
            <li> Slightly different than the orginal .</li>
            <li> Received order in a very timely fashion. Love this product.</li>
            <li> What can I say about this lotion? It smells awesome &amp; it softens my skin. Make sure you rub it in for awhile though, it seems to be absorbed into your skin better when it&#x27;s warmed up.</li>
            <li> amazing lotion! 2 for the price of one!</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent and great all day moisturizer. I&#x27;ve used a lot of lotions in my 76 years and Hempz is my come back to.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this lotion and a nice change from the regular Hempz lotions.  Would buy and recommend to others.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t seem to linger too long. Makes my skin feel nice and soft and I don&#x27;t feel like I have to moisturize as much as before. The only bad thing was one of the pumps was defective, so that&#x27;s annoying.</li>
            <li> The best lotions I have come across.</li>
            <li> Great lotion if you have very dry skin, I put it on once a day and keeps my skin moisturized all day</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Ella Kolberg Not Matthew</li>
            <li> I love this product and buy it all the time.  I love the way it leaves my skin.</li>
            <li> Love...LOVE...Simply just love this lotion.  I have tried the original lotion and love it.  Then I tried the age defying blend and wasnt as impressed with the formula or smell and was going to go back to the original when I found this special 2 bottles package.  I am so happy I did!!!  This is one of the best lotions around and it makes me happy just to see the bottle sitting on my bathroom counter.  The formula is out of this world awesome and the scent is almost just as wonderful and all of this with ZERO Greasiness afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this to anyone with moderate to extremely bad dry skin, it leaves your skin feeling silky smooth all day long and you wont smell bad either.</li>
            <li> Love this! Smells like Victoria Secrets &amp;#34;love spell&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The scent of this is not the same as every single other bottle I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I don&#x27;t know if they are just old or if hempz has changed its scent. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I always buy this product.  When I&#x27;m done with one bottle (and down to one bottle), I buy 2 more!</li>
            <li> Smells sooooo good!  Great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> great product for a awesome price</li>
            <li> GOOD SMELL AND A GOOD MOISTURIZER.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion.  It&#x27;s silky and smells like a upscale spa.  My skin is so smooth and smells fabulous.  My new favorite thing.  A great value also.</li>
            <li> GREAT MOISTURIZING LOTION.</li>
            <li> Arrived timely.  Love the lotion</li>
            <li> Best smelling lotion!</li>
            <li> Makes skin moist, great product</li>
            <li> Great lotion...my wife loves the stuff...wish the bottles were bigger!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! !</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin (eczema) and this lotion never burns.  It moisturizes well and keeps my skin hydrated through the day.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this is the best product for soothing I have found. The scent is very nice also I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Our families best product ever, hands down</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Was perfect fort husbands skin conditions. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion ever! Smells amazing and is like a light body butter. Great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Paid $28 for one bottle at the salon!!!! This is an awesome deal, greet smell, nice texture, everyday lotion!! LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Heard about it through  my hairdresser who said they couldn&#x27;t get any for quite some time and&lt;br /&gt;gave it out for Christmas gifts.  I love it too.  Whipped body cr√®me great for the hands as well.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance and how it moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product and great value for the money. Found it worked immediately and lasted for days. Non greasy and silky smooth:) I&#x27;ve liked all their products that I have tried so far:)</li>
            <li> A product many in my household can use and love  there is NO gender preference.</li>
            <li> Great Lotion!! Best I have tried. The smell is amazing and it leaves my skin soft and moisturized without a oily film!</li>
            <li> This lotion is very moisturizing, and was a great deal for the price.  The only negative thing I have to say is that it smells almost identical to Victoria&#x27;s Secret - Love Spell fragrance.  I was hoping for a more unique fragrance that didn&#x27;t seem like a knock-off to Victoria&#x27;s Secret.  The quality of the product is quite nice, and I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I can&#x27;t live without it. It smells heavenly and moisturizes better than anything I&#x27;ve tried. The only (funny) drawback is that for some reason the animals are attracted to it and keep trying to lick it off. We can&#x27;t have that.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it! It&#x27;s so difficult to get men to use lotion. But this is the one for him.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the product.  Will buy again.  Received the product as promised.</li>
            <li> Best lotion money can buy it&#x27;s everything they say and more.</li>
            <li> Smells so much better than the original Hempz, with about twice the moisturizing power! Amazing stuff. Would recommend to anyone looking for more radiant skin</li>
            <li> Best smelling lotion! I get lots of compliments and it keeps moisture in your skin for a long time. Great for after sunning.</li>
            <li> My friend gave me some Hempz for Christmas and I ordered more when the lotion was gone. I like this lotion. It is perfect for me because I have such sensitive skin and this lotion does not irritate my face and leave all parts of my body smooth.  I really do not know what this other formula was or if they changed it, I just like it now will will order more.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used, I recommend it to everyone. It smells fresh, it is not greasy, and makes your hands feel like silk.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> Wow shipping was fast!  Product is great!  Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> My stars say it all!!!</li>
            <li> The best lotion I ever had!</li>
