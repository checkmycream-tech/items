    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I used the prescription eyelash growth and it was awesome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Lilash and babelash, both of which were awesome</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful product without any side effects.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li>Smartlash worked best on my sparse eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>So, for me, I think it works great &amp; will continue to use it, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!  </li>
            <li>VERY HAPPY with this product.  </li>
            <li>Great service!  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>

            <li>This is awesome</li>
            <li>This tube lasts for months and makes my lashes look great!</li>
            <li>of all the name brands I&#x27;ve tried, Lashipix worked the best for me followed by Jan Marini</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy to say that I have had excellent results.  </li>
            <li>, I got it everywhere, including in my eyes, which did not feel real good.  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Noticible difference. :D</li>
            <li>Excellent product that delivers on it&#x27;s promise.</li>
            <li>This worked wonderful for me</li>
            <li>my lashes were one of my best features -</li>
            <li>Excellent product.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for a bit thicker lashes, but I am very happy with the results I have received.</li>
            <li>I chose this product because it was suggested on Dr. Oz to be the best for it,</li>
            <li>I love them now!!!</li>
            <li>nice every day!!</li>
            <li>The price here was very good.</li>
            <li>Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li>I used Latisse for about three months, it worked, I loved it!  </li>
            <li>Good luck and happy lash hunting!  </li>
            <li>If that changes I will update, but for now, I am very pleased with the results of this product!</li>
            <li>The product is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be suspicious of all the great reviews on here, too.</li>
            <li>Lol</li>
            <li>Great product, have been using it for a year.</li>
            <li>But this product worked great for me.</li>
            <li>My lashes were diminishing and now I have great lashes again.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Great alternative to the prescription products.</li>
            <li>SO, if length is what you are looking for, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I have used Latisse before and had great results, but at $140 a tube, it just did not work within my budget.</li>
            <li>Great stuff</li>
            <li>If you want a 50% improvement on what you have then you will be happy.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this product, not a lifechanger, but I definately noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>Now using another product and its working very nicely.</li>
            <li>amazing results in 3 weeks!</li>
            <li>Worked amazing for me!</li>
            <li>this are the two best when I make my conditioner I always put more of those two</li>
            <li>Three full weeks completed and family members and perfect strangers are commenting on how great my eyes look.</li>
            <li>so I saw this product and the reviews looked good</li>
            <li>I bought this based on reading lots of good reviews.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes looked gorgeous after mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I bought Rapidlash and mistakenly posted my good review, thinking it was Smartlash</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about a month, it was bought for about $13 on a Groupon.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, my lashes look a bit fuller, but I wonder if the product has some sort of glue in it, because I have lost almost no eyelashes since using it, and that is fairly atypical.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>So good luck to anyone wanting to give this a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was hoping for good results because I have used Latisse</li>
            <li>RapidLash did not give as good a result as SmartLash.</li>
            <li>I also figured if it was advertised on the Doctor&#x27;s it had to be a good product.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a good product for me.</li>
            <li>I think a lot of the good reviews were written by someone trying to push the product.</li>
            <li>It took a good 3 months of use before I saw results.</li>
            <li>Then Dr. Oz said that this was a good product</li>
            <li>good at all, hope not to buy it</li>
            <li>Good luck to you</li>
            <li>, I can see my good results from rapidlash drop to nothing.</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon this product through a Groupon offer and loved it.</li>
            <li>I had read good reviews and saw it on the Doctors TV show, which is why I ordered it</li>
            <li>After one month, I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>very satisfied.</li>
            <li>i hope, but if this is the best result I get, it is still worth it.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product and will continue to use.</li>
            <li>They are very healthy and with a coat of mascara</li>
            <li>I have been using it twice a day as directed and am very satisfied with  SmartLash.</li>
            <li>The promotions made it sound like a great product at a good price.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love my lashes!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>So OK, I&#x27;m 69! -</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>It works pretty great!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>This one much better than the others!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited to ditch my mascara and have lashes that look awesome all on their own:)</li>
            <li>Amazing results.</li>
            <li>The results are amazing.</li>
            <li>Happy that quality is the same - perfect!</li>
            <li>Maybe Dermstore is doing some kind of promotion?  </li>
            <li>I liked it because it doesn&#x27;t irritates my eyes or burning when it gets into my eyes</li>
            <li>and I also don&#x27;t want to spend that kind of money.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say NO</li>
            <li>Honest review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather use Eyelash Enhancer AND NICE mascara...</li>
            <li>With many good reviews on Rapidlash, I am sure it works</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I am older, 66, but have very good skin and a youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li>My cousin used Latisse and that really worked, she had gorgeous lashes!</li>
            <li>Same great product as before at a great price.</li>
            <li>The first bottle seemed to work great, so I bought 3 more.  </li>
            <li>I love it and plan to buy it again.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>working ok .</li>
            <li>Latisse saved the day and I love it.</li>
            <li>Mascara looks amazing now, even with a cheap drugstore brand.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see paying more than $20/container.</li>
            <li>I just wish my lashes could look \\&quot;younger\\&quot;, too :)</li>
            <li>I enjoyed it for the time</li>
            <li>but when I searched in Amazon, Rapidlash got better number</li>
            <li>I am wondering if another brand would work better?  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why I keep seeing it all over the web for upwards of $70 or more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using Latisse for just under a year and my eyelashes were phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>I like the results from Latisse better, but at about 1/4 to 1/3 the price of Latisse, I&#x27;ll be using Smartlash instead.</li>
            <li>Have purchased this many times from The Derm Store and have been using this product for over two years.</li>
            <li>so I was satisfied.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>thing I found is to make sure the brush isn&#x27;t too saturated when applying.</li>
            <li>Like any product, I&#x27;m sure it varies with everyone.</li>
            <li>bothers me more than knowing it doesn&#x27;t work....is the fact that this company is falsifying reviews to con people into buying it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased but patience is required.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes (top and bottom) and my eyebrows had thinned.  </li>
            <li>I mentioned, I was totally satisfied with this product, stopped using it, and now have reordered because my lashes have reverted to their thinned state.</li>
            <li>BETTER NEWS here is, I saw online that someone used this on their eyebrows and they claimed it helped thicken them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and now it is filled in nicely.</li>
            <li>I tried it based on price -- I should have known better.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I know that women need more explanation than that.</li>
            <li>I was able to buy three on Amazon for the price of one when I looked elsewher.</li>
            <li>On top of that after purchase it arrived in no time.</li>
            <li>Love it, it does help my eyelashes grow.</li>
            <li>Often once a hair follicle is damaged it will not produce any more hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to admit I am pleased with the results after about 5-6 weeks of using it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad she did.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than a month and there is no change in my eye lashes.</li>
            <li>I am flabbergasted that so many people like this product.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite product</li>
            <li>Then I thought to check how many of the reviews were written by verified purchasers.</li>
            <li>so the more I wear mascara</li>
            <li>the more lashes I lose -</li>
            <li>if anyone knows of a better place - please post</li>
            <li>incase I decide to buy more.</li>
            <li>I noticed those who dislike it, have not given it more than 3 weeks to 2 months.</li>
            <li>After 5 weeks, I could not look in the mirror and see a difference until I put on mascara, and then I could see that the mascara had more and longer lashes to rest on.  </li>
            <li>Also my brows are better again \\&quot;strengthen\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>So its okay.  </li>
            <li>Rapid lash is way better ...</li>
            <li>but we are satisfied with our results.</li>
            <li>It seemed to be nothing more than water.</li>
            <li>absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I make sure to shake the bottle before each application.  </li>
            <li>I think it works better then</li>
            <li>I have 2 tubes and will finish them, but unless there&#x27;s a miracle, I won&#x27;t be buying more.  </li>
            <li>love this product I have used it  before</li>
            <li>I had more satisfying results with Rapid Lash but will give SmartLash more time to work.</li>
            <li>I think I got better results with Rimmel&#x27;s lash enhancer and their lash enhancer mascara.  </li>
            <li>I get better results applying mascara.</li>
            <li>Seems to be ok though.  </li>
            <li>and my lashes have filled in and are getting longer!  </li>
            <li>My brows are filling in too, after many decades of over plucking.</li>
            <li>One more thing...</li>
            <li>Therefore, others may not be able to see the differences unless I put mascara on to darken the color of my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am glad I stuck with it.  </li>
            <li>and I have more of them.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes with this product having so many great reviews.</li>
            <li>I used SmartLash when it first came out and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this now for a year &amp; have wonderful long lashes.</li>
            <li>I already had pretty good lashes to start but wanted &amp;#34;more&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The adage if it seems too good to be true is SO TRUE with this product.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have very full eyelashes to begin with</li>
            <li>She shipped promptly and followed up via email to make sure I had a positive experience...very nice touch...</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product!!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t interfere -</li>
            <li>It is easy and works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Application is easy and it is now part of my morning and nightly routine.</li>
            <li>and I saw results very quickly.  </li>
            <li>All I wanted was lashes that did not break as easily or pull out as easily when removing make-up</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t wash out easily.  </li>
            <li>so it would be easy to keep track.  </li>
            <li>and I like the fact that it is easy to apply, does not irritate my eyes</li>
            <li>Easy to use and non-irritating.</li>
            <li>, I guess that&#x27; why it&#x27;s easy for me to see the differences.</li>
            <li>; LOL but if you are like me, someone who over-plucked for too many years and would like to have their eyebrows thicker, this might work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not being paid by the manufacturer nor have I gotten any product for free (I only wish!).</li>
            <li>I do wonder if this product works better for people who once had full eyelashes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t spend the full retail amount for this product because it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>That seems to be a very important key to using the product successfully.  </li>
            <li>and/or my hair is not as fine.</li>
            <li>The shipping and everything was fine</li>
            <li>However, I have very fine eyelashes and the newly grown ones are very fine too.</li>
            <li>Love, love this smart lash growth serum!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10 days and already I notice a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>and I can see huge results.</li>
            <li>This product even filled out my over-plucked eyebrows.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the time and money if you want more  lashes.</li>
            <li>Plus this product ships free.  </li>
            <li>To my great delight, my lower lashes (toward the out edges of my eyes) had tiny lashes to which my mascara could attach.  </li>
            <li>you can however ask your primary care physician for a prescription to regrow your eyelashes &amp; eyebrows which has been approved by the F.D.A.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to run the risk involved in the prescription stuff (I have light eyes)</li>
            <li>Liked so much</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with the results on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I am not affiliated with any seller oranybody, Im just an honest person that likes to post reviews on products that do miracles and really work.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes have filled in and have gotten longer.</li>
            <li>After 1 week, that spot filled in and my lashes thickened.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>This item was sent out very quickly and with a sweet note to ensure it was what I wanted and was looking for.</li>
            <li>I checked Amazon to see if the original formula was available.</li>
            <li>I am so thankful that I have significant results.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t as consistent but did see my lashes became more conditioned and thicker after time.</li>
            <li>I was excited about this product...</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s so excited</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t notice that my lashes had gotten significantly longer than they were until I got a pair of bifocal sunglasses</li>
            <li>Hello, for the people that this didn&#x27;t work, there could be a possibility that you are not getting the original product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m bummed because it was really fun for the couple of weeks that it worked!</li>
            <li>I bought this product on special just to try it</li>
            <li>Smart Lash in my opinion was a better buy in results.</li>
            <li>Smart Lash is a safe alternative.</li>
            <li>price is right for me, too!  </li>
            <li>I really think any change for the better was imaginary.  </li>
            <li>But, a person could dye their lashes to get the full, fluttery, flush effect if they wished.</li>
            <li>Lashes are longer, but not as full as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>Also make sure your purchasing the real thing.</li>
            <li>(Full disclosure:</li>
            <li>Frankly, that was good enough for</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since Latisse isn&#x27;t used on bottom lashes, but SmartLash can, this was a way for me to determine if they really lengthened my lashes because I know it wasn&#x27;t affected by Latisse&#x27;s magic already.  </li>
            <li>it works when you stay true to application.....</li>
            <li>Will rate a true review once I start using.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was getting such a good deal I bought two.</li>
            <li>Smart Lash has brought back my eye lashes, works great.</li>
            <li>For this purchase, the other website only offered an &amp;#34;advanced&amp;#34; formula that didn&#x27;t get good reviews from people that originally had good results from this original formula.</li>
            <li>Trying it out on my eyebrows and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working as quickly</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m lucky if I can remember to use it once a day let alone twice.  </li>
            <li>but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, and since I lose my eyelashes, I depend on this product.  </li>
            <li>It does make MY lashes longer and thicker BECAUSE the product keeps my eyelashes from falling out so quickly.  </li>
            <li>It dries fairly quickly, and then you can put on your makeup without its interfering with the application.  </li>
            <li>I am used to quick results from Revitalash and Latisse-</li>
            <li>I have also been applying to my brows and they have shown tremendous results already.</li>
            <li>I bought three bottles of this (better price if you purchased more) and have been using it religiously twice a day.  </li>
            <li>(I figured one is as good as the next, right?)</li>
            <li>I was very interested in purchasing smartlash seeing how I use latisse</li>
            <li>I guess everybody has different reactions, but I&#x27;m very pleased with the product!!!saw some results in just a week...</li>
            <li>I had gorgeous long eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I have always had a very few eyelashes, and since I have started using this product I have noticed an INCREDIBLE change.</li>
            <li>Really works!!</li>
            <li>Have one tube left and would love to return it!  </li>
            <li>I stopped using the product after a few months and my eyelashes are strong, not falling off and still look gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I know- lucky, right?)  </li>
            <li>I bought this product from dermstore at first, 39.00 on special ( it is listed now for 125.00)..</li>
            <li>After six weeks of applying it, amazingly my eyebrows began to grow back in.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge improvement in the lashes but they definitely seem longer however I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE difference in my eyebrows!</li>
            <li>My doctor couldn&#x27;t believe how good they looked and wanted me to give a class at the cancer center.</li>
            <li>I am surprised at how many people like this product.</li>
            <li>I honestly noticed longer lashes within two weeks of using it only once a day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>price isn&#x27;t the greatest but the product, for me, has been worth it as I have been tired of trying to &amp;#34;fill in&amp;#34; my eyebrow shortcomings.</li>
            <li>have not had any problems with irritation and if is does somehow get into my eye (rare event) it doesn&#x27;t cause any problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this product is definitely worth a shot for eyebrows if you are younger and your hair isn&#x27;t super fine or light.</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands but they are not as good.</li>
            <li>My regular eyelashes are really long, full and beautiful.</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>My theory is that I sleep on my right side so the product may be getting rubbed off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and have always had great success.  </li>
            <li>Ask your doctor if you can get your hands on a sample of Lumigan (they will often give it to you for FREE), pending that you do not have high interocular pressure.</li>
            <li>Also, the more I read, the more I agree,  the other sites that show all positive reviews are a bunch of BS.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are pretty full and healthy and I wanted them just a bit longer but after 2 months of faithful twice a day daily use...nothin&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this more in hopes of filling in some bare spots in my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Good price at DermStore, but not worth spending your money or time.</li>
            <li>Or if you have dark eyes and want to spend the money, maybe the prescription lash enhancer is good for you.  </li>
            <li>they are long, with a nice curl...</li>
            <li>But not my eyelashes,lower lashes or eyebrows, so  I started back on the regimen of Latisse which was great for my upper lashes, but it is contraindicated for lower lashes.</li>
            <li>There is probably something better out there, but I don&#x27;t want to waste any more money looking.</li>
            <li>Actually, I&#x27;m reasonably happy, but will buy a more expensive brand when it runs out.  </li>
            <li>First of all I have used Latisse for a couple of years because I had a battle with cancer and with chemo</li>
            <li>The thing is you have to be consistent or</li>
            <li>I think it does actually make your lashes look better</li>
            <li>Will go back to Lilash though it is more pricey</li>
            <li>/&gt;Talking of side effects, I mistakenly ordered, the number one of this type, \\&quot;Rapid\\&quot;lash (4 stars from 1,046 customers) first.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about two months now and after the first six weeks I noticed a difference in my lashes.</li>
            <li>I am so impressed that I am getting the results I have been looking for without a prescription or any weird side affects.</li>
            <li>Thank You SmartLash!  ;)</li>
            <li>I first ordered from another company and then looked and found through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This eyelash enhancer really works!</li>
            <li>I wish I had more faith in it&#x27;s potential when I started because if I did, I would have taken a before and now,</li>
            <li>I have been using SmartLast for a couple of months and found it to work within the first seven days.  </li>
            <li>When I first started using this product I thought I had gotten ripped off because nothing was happening.  </li>
            <li>I am still using the first tube but it will be time soon to order.  </li>
            <li>be patient and just use it consistently</li>
            <li>that is EXACTLY the time-table.  </li>
            <li>I started with RapidLash and THOUGHT I saw a difference, but it wasn&#x27;t enough to make me sure it wasn&#x27;t just in my head.  </li>
            <li>I used Latisse with excellent results, but it&#x27;s expensive and a nuisance to apply with a separate, disposable brush for each eye and a squeeze bottle of Latisse solution.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice that they are fuller, but that&#x27;s okay, since I can actually see my lashes now.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t like the looks of the product at first.  </li>
            <li>I got it on Groupon for $25, wish I read reviews first before I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I only use it once a day and my lashes have never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product religiously for months on most nights and mornings.  </li>
            <li>I went from having a full set of beautiful long natural eyelashes to no lashes where my friends were constantly asking me what happened to your eyelashes or why don&#x27;t you wear falsies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll finish up the second tube, but I won&#x27;t purchase any more.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work even though I followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks most of my lashes were about the same length</li>
            <li>At first, I applied it right before applying my eye makeup when I was getting ready for work.</li>
            <li>Pretty easy to figure out that more is not better in this case!&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m loving this and am just about to buy my second bottle.</li>
            <li>My daughter got me a tube of Smartlash as a gift because I kept complaining that my eyelashes were becoming sparse and short, with a bald spot!  </li>
            <li>Have used prescription Latisse in the past with good results, but wanted to avoid the itchy eyelid swelling and redness it provoked.  </li>
            <li>There are not more of them, but they are looking good and I will continue to purchase this product.  </li>
            <li>Not really sure if it does anything, but a good conditioner.</li>
            <li>I decided to give Smart Lash a try at $30.00 a tube.  </li>
            <li>I used  smart lash for 3 months twice a day and got zero results.</li>
            <li>I have been using smart lash since Aug</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using smart lash for 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy Smart Lash.</li>
            <li>Got an email containing info on Smart Lash.  </li>
            <li>For me I did not noticed a difference with Smart Lash.  </li>
            <li>I tried Smart Lash on the promotion on \\&quot;The Doctors\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>I tried Smart Lash morning and evening as directed&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li>smart lash does not make them thicker or longer</li>
            <li>Just to be honest, I have been applying it more than directed, usually 3 or 4 times a day as opposed to the twice daily recommendation on the package.</li>
            <li>This Smart Lash really does work.</li>
            <li>little bit of fenugreek&lt;br /&gt;You can make your own with just castor and olive oil</li>
            <li>My lashes are much longer.  </li>
            <li>, I really extend my usage of Latisse.  </li>
            <li>Second (and most important), SmartLash has oil in it and the oil manages to seep into your eyes no matter how carefully or sparingly you try to apply it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes but it did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had very sparse eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this product to work.</li>
            <li>I really like the product and do not have any irritation from it.</li>
            <li>I have to say that yes, around the 30 day mark I was noticing my lashes were much fuller and longer...but not darker.</li>
            <li>I have not seen real results and it&#x27;s been almost 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>, I was contacted by a very smart-savvy and health-conscious customer asking a question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a whole lot of change</li>
            <li>my mascara goes on so much easier and fuller as well....</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t noticed much changes on my lashes</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t really bother me until my mom asked me when I started wearing purple eyeliner.</li>
            <li>That is where I bought it, but since it didn&#x27;t work, it really wasn&#x27;t a bargain.</li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim, but from dermstore.com, which sells it at a much affordable price.</li>
            <li>However, I just really, really wanted them to be longer, and they didn&#x27;t seem to be doing that.</li>
            <li>For me, it helped to curl my lashes to really see if there was a difference in length without mascara.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I don&#x27;t think I would&#x27;ve noticed as much.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say that I notice a difference</li>
            <li>I have light skin and hair but fairly coarse eyebrows.</li>
            <li>So my wife bought this eyelash enhancer and she couldnt stop telling me how much it really works.</li>
            <li>Not as fast as you might like</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Really saw no difference.</li>
            <li>If you use it twice a day, it really does work.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely did NOT work for me.</li>
            <li>since I have started using SmartLash, I really don&#x27;t think I need mascara anymore.</li>
            <li>it may not help that situation all that much.  </li>
            <li>They look fuller and I&#x27;ve noticed that they don&#x27;t break/fall out as much as they did.</li>
            <li>Also, I wear contacts and it does sometimes run into the eyes, but I haven&#x27;t experienced the burning sensation some people are talking about or the oiliness that remains behind.  </li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>This works really well.  </li>
            <li>I am a 62 yo woman with very sparse lashes :&#x27;-(  </li>
            <li>$100 dlls is just too much.</li>
            <li>and this really fits the bill.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my brows and lashes for a month and really didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really have a lot of hope this would work after I singed the lashes on one eye while barbecuing.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think this would work.</li>
            <li>with absolutely zero results.  </li>
            <li>I have found that there seem to be a few that are authentic good reviews, but there are also a lot on here and dermstore.com that are written on the same day or within a day or two, and are written in the same style.</li>
            <li>After my daughter confirmed that my eyelashes are indeed longer and a tad bit thicker, I ordered a second tube.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient to keep in my makeup bag in case I forget to apply in the morning.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the oily residue that goes into my eyes too -</li>
            <li>I rest my case finding one that really works.</li>
            <li>One time I was browsing through &amp;#34;Groupon&amp;#34; and I saw this eyelash tube for like 29 dollars, it seemed promising, I said why not.</li>
            <li>really didn&#x27;t have a review on the product yet, but they will not let me asking any question with a review.  </li>
            <li>but it really deserves a zero.</li>
            <li>you might not see as much improvement as I have.</li>
            <li>but I can say the application process with SmartLash is much easier.</li>
            <li>give it a 4 star because the formula irritated my eyes when I accidentally put too much on.</li>
            <li>The stuff really works for me.</li>
            <li>But after using it faithfully for 2 months (two full tubes) there was barely any improvement, so there&#x27;s no point in continuing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands before and they worked better than this one.</li>
            <li>I will go back to my original product line.</li>
            <li>So, I put okay for the support of the other viewer.  </li>
            <li>i have tried other products that have worked, my favorite is Rapid Lash.</li>
            <li>This, for me, leaves enough product on the brush (I can feel the cool liquid along the margin of my lashes) yet does not apply so much that it drips in</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way with this product, and it is very easy to brush on a light application both morning and night.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a daily special and that&#x27;s how I got it for $29.95.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t get more of an improvement, though, I will stop using it since the cost and twice-a-day application aren&#x27;t worth the improvement thus far, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  This product is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li>My eyebrows have been over plucked and I have trying to grow them back for years, so if this works to the full effect, it will be a blessing.</li>
            <li>If you are willing to wait, though, you might be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I am 56 years old, my lashes aren&#x27;t what they were when I was younger, but with the help of smart lash they are!!!</li>
            <li>I have made sure my lashes r clean &amp; I apply twice a day w/ no good results.</li>
            <li>The first week I kind of did it when I remembered and not regularly, but I saw a slight change after a week and decided to do it twice a day and on my eyebrows as well.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my lashes nice &amp; long &amp; when on occasion I&#x27;ve had a few fall out, this product fills those lashes in rather quickly.</li>
            <li>As of this point in time ,I have not seen any new growth, not even a stubble!  </li>
            <li>enjoy your long lashes, from a woman who used to have dinky lashes and have thicker and longer ones now!</li>
            <li>Luckily for me when I went back to my au naturelle</li>
            <li>I had a particular spot where there was NO hair</li>
            <li>I got the SmartLash at a discounted price through Groupon or Living Social and figured it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>I will start by saying I have decent lashes.  </li>
            <li>The DermStore site exaggerates I think, so have realistic expectations.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased three of these products thinking that maybe it was just taking longer since I am older or whatever....</li>
            <li>The only thing I noticed is that maybe my lashes weren&#x27;t falling out as quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love being able to &amp;#34;lengthen&amp;#34; my lashes, without &amp;#34;glueing&amp;#34; on lashes that fall off in random order.  </li>
            <li>Smartlash was highly recommended on Youtube</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Saw product highly rated in a style magazine.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend for all women who want longer and thicker eyelashes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s available for much cheaper elsewhere, as other commenters have said.</li>
            <li>I had long but sparse lashes, and this definitely increased the volume of lashes, whether by plumping the individual hairs, making me grow more hairs, or preventing existing hairs from falling out as quickly, I don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li>I can also see a little more fullness in the eyebrow</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>I heard a lot of great reviews from this product, so I bought two at dermstore.com where it was less than half the price.  </li>
            <li>Thankful to see that it was available &amp; that the price had come down significantly from the last time I had checked.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am Asian and, in my opinion, most of us aren&#x27;t blessed with long eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>This works so well that I have to move my glasses farther from my eyes than I would normally wear them,</li>
            <li>Worth the money to me personally.</li>
            <li>I am so upset to have waisted so much money all these months because my eyelash look EXACTLY THE SAME!!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try even if it only works a fraction as well for you as it did for me.</li>
            <li>After using Latisse for years and knowing it really works Im going back to it but being more careful not to get any in my eyes.</li>
            <li>and I thought it would help me not only keep from losing my lashes but help them grow long - like one of the social workers I met who used a lash treatment and had AMAZING lashes.</li>
            <li>I used it religiously twice a day for five weeks and my lashes are as short and fine as ever.  </li>
            <li>and I saw incredible results in mere weeks!</li>
            <li>you can brush your eyelashes and you can trim them on a new moon&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Does what it says-makes lashes stop breaking and creates new growth.</li>
            <li>Then around the one month mark, one day I noticed that a quick coat of mascara now looked like 3 long coats of mascara!  </li>
            <li>Found this product so pleasing I am not afraid of making additional purchases in the near future.</li>
            <li>as a mature woman, I have decent eyelashes</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive eyes and skin</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive eyes and had no issues with this product.</li>
            <li>Clearly, I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li>but what worried the most was that it is  prostaglandin analogs for ophthalmic use and are currently classified as Pregnancy Class C. meaning that there have been no human studies of the drug, but that animal studies have revealed some potential abnormalities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, so this didn&#x27;t work for me, but evidently it works for some.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>(I never bothered to use it during the day)  Low and behold, after about 2 months of consistent use they were beginning to get longer.  </li>
            <li>I used it exactly as directed for several months (morning &amp; evening)</li>
            <li>You apply it to the skin above the lashes (I use it underneath, too) and the first time I used it</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are exactly the same as they were.</li>
            <li>I have been following their directions exactly.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give SmartLash only one star is because I think my  top lashes aren&#x27;t as short as before</li>
            <li>Ive read some reviews in the past of other products where the seller is not selling the original product and just mixing it with water or another solution to make more product.</li>
            <li>My first tube which I got from another source is lasting over 60 days.</li>
            <li>3-4 sentences, same grammar, same style punctuation, slightly different story, but by a very excited person who says it works.</li>
            <li>this the new formula or the old one?</li>
            <li>I also used to have very long and full lashes, but now at 30, my lashes are a lot shorter and less full.</li>
            <li>I continued to use this product, never missing an application, and after 4 full months of using it, I saw absolutely no change.  </li>
            <li>I am careful with application because it can sting if it gets in your eyes, but quickly wears off</li>
            <li>Compared to the price of other things out there, it&#x27;s not a bad price.</li>
            <li>It was embarrassing having a huge gap of missing eyelashes on both eyelids.</li>
            <li>I DO NOT recommend if you have sensitive eyes like me</li>
            <li>but still we are hopeful that we can at least achieve a result of about 50% of that look :-)  </li>
            <li>So here&#x27;s the wild thing about this product - I had read that it can also be used on the eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Works well for me, as long as you&#x27;re consistent in use.</li>
            <li>and I naturally thought it was Smartlash that I was looking for</li>
            <li>As far as price?  </li>
            <li>Ladies, you need to go directly to dermstore.com and look up Smartlash - the price is $29.95 and you can choose auto-fill to lock in the price.  </li>
            <li>Friends have told me going directly to dermstore.com shows the product for $100.  </li>
            <li>I see so many negative reviews on this site.</li>
            <li>Like I said, it really worked well for me, but I do understand that everone&#x27;s body chemistry is different &amp; what might work for one person won&#x27;t work for another.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Wild&#x27;s MegaLash...</li>
            <li>I am a 70 year old woman</li>
            <li>This product is complete rubbish.</li>
            <li>lashes are twice as long as when I first started the treatment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am also using Rogaine for Women to hopefully help my thinning hair (I am 45 years old).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;And naturally, it will not work for every person.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve read that people are applying Smartlash directly on to their eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are growing so far</li>
            <li>I was young</li>
            <li>short, straight stump lashes.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>and I am 54 years old now.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>So far - NOTHING.  </li>
            <li>After I finished Latisse and went straight to SmartLash, my lashes shrunk dramatically because I stopped the Latisse, but Smartlash helped prevent them from being my short pre-Latisse</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive eyes pass.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>At the 5 week mark I haven&#x27;t seen a considerable difference from the 3 week mark.  </li>
            <li>(because once your lashes get full and long you can&#x27;t go back!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m delighted and hope they&#x27;ll grow longer, though I&#x27;m still skeptical on how much longer they could grow since my lashes were so short to begin with; maybe I&#x27;ll return with an update!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised there are so many negative reviews---</li>
            <li>I thought this was a better option than Latisse because it doesn&#x27;t affect colored eyes, but it was a big waste of time.</li>
            <li>We the consumer are wise enough to know that the models in these pics are wearing false lashes</li>
            <li>They are not beautifully long or thick, but they are decent and not horribly sparse.  </li>
            <li>I realize I saw results much faster than usual, and maybe I was just lucky, but I&#x27;m sticking with SmartLash.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used other products such as Rapidlash and it works much better for around the same price.</li>
            <li>I also read on here that other reviewers are experiencing oil from the product irritating their eyes, I have experienced this as well</li>
            <li>I have used latesse in the past, great product worked like a charm but a pain since you need a prescription for it and also a little concerned about the possibility that my eyes would turn yellow.  </li>
            <li>I quickly learned to pull the wand out and wait for a drop to work its way down to the brush, then wipe the drop off.  </li>
            <li>Clean your eyelash in the morning with green tea</li>
            <li>After reading some of the ridiculous reviews and suppositions here, I had to create my more informed and balanced review.  </li>
            <li>First, it only enhances the APPEARANCE of lashes, not actual growth.</li>
            <li>As a middle aged woman with quickly thinning brows, I thought I would give Smartlash a try.  </li>
            <li>my lashes have gone back to normal, need to curl them &amp; use lots of mascara</li>
            <li>I tried everything to fix this problem, I went from not using the eyelash curler or any mascara for several months and no luck, the eyelashes will grow on its own but very slowly</li>
            <li>They are now fuller and longer, not tremendously but enough to get excited about.</li>
            <li>When I found out the price I decided to live with short, sparse eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>The only stuff that really works is the bimatoprost and those in the same catagory.</li>
            <li>The product is definitely good, but it´s quiet expensive.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t work for me, and I was shocked, because I had read so many good reviews here and other places that it worked, worked, worked!!!</li>
            <li>My left eye has a ton of new hair that are shorter than the rest, my right doesn&#x27;t have nearly half that amount.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a month, and after the first couple of weeks, I cut back to only once a day.  </li>
            <li>I just thought other would-be purchasers should be aware of this.</li>
            <li>I tried SmartLash and it proved me wrong; I&#x27;m Asian with short lashes and honestly am seeing a difference, and I haven&#x27;t even been that consistent with putting it twice but only once a day.</li>
            <li>(some newly grown ones are shorter than my old ones; half of my old ones grew longer than the rest of the old ones.)</li>
            <li>I have tried other eyelash enhancement products in the past that worked great, but they left my eyelids looking slightly puffy</li>
            <li>and I am getting the feeling that they were mostly written by the same person who is trying to promote the product, shame on me for not catching this earlier before investing time and money.</li>
            <li>I have used it morning and night for over a month, and my lashes have barely grown at all.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that my lashed actually grew after about 2 weeks of using.</li>
            <li>I came in intending to, but saw an ad from an external website that was considerably cheaper, and decided to try it from there.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are still barely there.</li>
            <li>Apparently it works for some and not for others.  </li>
            <li>at how much I spent for junk that does absolutely NOTHING</li>
            <li>and I barely see any difference.</li>
            <li>So a big thumbs up so far, will write in about about 2 weeks what the status of my eyelashes are.</li>
            <li>I use go bare and use an eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li>Was not Happy with this products container, I opened the package everything has leaked through the container, and everytime I opened more of the liquid would come out .</li>
            <li>I am a fair skinned, blonde haired gal whose lashes are pale to say the least.</li>
            <li>Several months ago I went on a new protocol and my hair started coming back.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks though, I either got used to the new look so much that it didn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything</li>
            <li>so I purchased this for first time beginning December last year after trying other name brands, its been over 10 weeks since I started the regimen with SmartLash</li>
            <li>When I was younger I had such long eye lashes, but as I have grown older, I don&#x27;t know what happened to them.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping my \\&quot;blackest-black\\&quot; mascara wouldn&#x27;t have to work so hard to give a full fringe of lashes.</li>
            <li>Now, over 3 months later, I use it every other day and have much fuller and longer lashes than ever before.</li>
            <li>I got the burning sensation that everyone has talked about but ignored it because it seemed to be working, but now after three months off of Latisse and three months on Smartlash, I am back to barely visible lashes.  </li>
            <li>I use it for a week to two weeks and my lashes get long and lush and they stay that way then in about two to three weeks</li>
            <li>I am going to try this product on a bare spot on my lower lash line, so please forgive me for posting prior to trying the product.</li>
            <li>I also NEVER left the house without using brow filler before this, but I barely need the filler anymore</li>
            <li>and I barely see any results even if I was religiously following the use instructions, another thing</li>
            <li>I have been using Smart lash for about 2 months and have noticed my lashes are thicker and slightly longer.  </li>
            <li>I used Latisse before, so far, no other product has come closed to it.</li>
            <li>The slower growth might also be due to the fact that I am older.</li>
            <li>Then I realized that I had changed mascaras and the new one was harder to take off at night.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Update (5/27/12) I am starting to see growth in an area of my upper lashes that was prevously bare.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are thicker and a little longer, not a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li>, I only use one quick one, also, I used it on my brows which are sparse, I think it works, hard for me to tell, but the woman who does my brows noticed a difference..</li>
            <li>This product will NOT GIVE YOU NEW EYELASHES but will only allow the existing lashes to grow a little longer before succumbing to their natural cycle of falling out and growing back in.</li>
            <li>so, I have been using smart last for a little over 30 days.  </li>
            <li>in these tough economic times we can only afford our needs not our wants.  </li>
            <li>So, the good news is, it does work, the bad news is, it takes quite awhile.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have heard the good and bad about this product.</li>

    <ol>

            <li> , I got it everywhere, including in my eyes, which did not feel real good.  </li>

            <li> I chose this product because it was suggested on Dr. Oz to be the best for it,</li>
            <li> I love them now!!!</li>
            <li> nice every day!!</li>
            <li> The price here was very good.</li>

            <li> Good luck and happy lash hunting!  </li>
            <li> If that changes I will update, but for now, I am very pleased with the results of this product!</li>
            <li> The product is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be suspicious of all the great reviews on here, too.</li>
            <li> Lol</li>
            <li> Great product, have been using it for a year.</li>
            <li> But this product worked great for me.</li>
            <li> My lashes were diminishing and now I have great lashes again.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> Great alternative to the prescription products.</li>
            <li> SO, if length is what you are looking for, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have used Latisse before and had great results, but at $140 a tube, it just did not work within my budget.</li>
            <li> Great stuff</li>
            <li> If you want a 50% improvement on what you have then you will be happy.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product, not a lifechanger, but I definately noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> Now using another product and its working very nicely.</li>
            <li> amazing results in 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> Worked amazing for me!</li>
            <li> this are the two best when I make my conditioner I always put more of those two</li>
            <li> Three full weeks completed and family members and perfect strangers are commenting on how great my eyes look.</li>
            <li> so I saw this product and the reviews looked good</li>
            <li> I bought this based on reading lots of good reviews.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes looked gorgeous after mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I bought Rapidlash and mistakenly posted my good review, thinking it was Smartlash</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month, it was bought for about $13 on a Groupon.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, my lashes look a bit fuller, but I wonder if the product has some sort of glue in it, because I have lost almost no eyelashes since using it, and that is fairly atypical.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> So good luck to anyone wanting to give this a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was hoping for good results because I have used Latisse</li>
            <li> RapidLash did not give as good a result as SmartLash.</li>
            <li> I also figured if it was advertised on the Doctor&#x27;s it had to be a good product.  </li>
            <li> I think this is a good product for me.</li>
            <li> I think a lot of the good reviews were written by someone trying to push the product.</li>
            <li> It took a good 3 months of use before I saw results.</li>
            <li> Then Dr. Oz said that this was a good product</li>
            <li> good at all, hope not to buy it</li>
            <li> Good luck to you</li>
            <li> , I can see my good results from rapidlash drop to nothing.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this product through a Groupon offer and loved it.</li>
            <li> I had read good reviews and saw it on the Doctors TV show, which is why I ordered it</li>
            <li> After one month, I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> very satisfied.</li>
            <li> i hope, but if this is the best result I get, it is still worth it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> They are very healthy and with a coat of mascara</li>
            <li> I have been using it twice a day as directed and am very satisfied with  SmartLash.</li>
            <li> The promotions made it sound like a great product at a good price.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love my lashes!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> So OK, I&#x27;m 69! -</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> It works pretty great!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> This one much better than the others!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited to ditch my mascara and have lashes that look awesome all on their own:)</li>
            <li> Amazing results.</li>
            <li> The results are amazing.</li>
            <li> Happy that quality is the same - perfect!</li>
            <li> Maybe Dermstore is doing some kind of promotion?  </li>
            <li> I liked it because it doesn&#x27;t irritates my eyes or burning when it gets into my eyes</li>
            <li> and I also don&#x27;t want to spend that kind of money.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say NO</li>
            <li> Honest review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use Eyelash Enhancer AND NICE mascara...</li>
            <li> With many good reviews on Rapidlash, I am sure it works</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I am older, 66, but have very good skin and a youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li> My cousin used Latisse and that really worked, she had gorgeous lashes!</li>
            <li> Same great product as before at a great price.</li>
            <li> The first bottle seemed to work great, so I bought 3 more.  </li>
            <li> I love it and plan to buy it again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> working ok .</li>
            <li> Latisse saved the day and I love it.</li>
            <li> Mascara looks amazing now, even with a cheap drugstore brand.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see paying more than $20/container.</li>
            <li> I just wish my lashes could look \\&quot;younger\\&quot;, too :)</li>
            <li> I enjoyed it for the time</li>
            <li> but when I searched in Amazon, Rapidlash got better number</li>
            <li> I am wondering if another brand would work better?  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why I keep seeing it all over the web for upwards of $70 or more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using Latisse for just under a year and my eyelashes were phenomenal.  </li>
            <li> I like the results from Latisse better, but at about 1/4 to 1/3 the price of Latisse, I&#x27;ll be using Smartlash instead.</li>
            <li> Have purchased this many times from The Derm Store and have been using this product for over two years.</li>
            <li> so I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> thing I found is to make sure the brush isn&#x27;t too saturated when applying.</li>
            <li> Like any product, I&#x27;m sure it varies with everyone.</li>
            <li> bothers me more than knowing it doesn&#x27;t work....is the fact that this company is falsifying reviews to con people into buying it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased but patience is required.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes (top and bottom) and my eyebrows had thinned.  </li>
            <li> I mentioned, I was totally satisfied with this product, stopped using it, and now have reordered because my lashes have reverted to their thinned state.</li>
            <li> BETTER NEWS here is, I saw online that someone used this on their eyebrows and they claimed it helped thicken them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and now it is filled in nicely.</li>
            <li> I tried it based on price -- I should have known better.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I know that women need more explanation than that.</li>
            <li> I was able to buy three on Amazon for the price of one when I looked elsewher.</li>
            <li> On top of that after purchase it arrived in no time.</li>
            <li> Love it, it does help my eyelashes grow.</li>
            <li> Often once a hair follicle is damaged it will not produce any more hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to admit I am pleased with the results after about 5-6 weeks of using it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad she did.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than a month and there is no change in my eye lashes.</li>
            <li> I am flabbergasted that so many people like this product.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite product</li>
            <li> Then I thought to check how many of the reviews were written by verified purchasers.</li>
            <li> so the more I wear mascara</li>
            <li> the more lashes I lose -</li>
            <li> if anyone knows of a better place - please post</li>
            <li> incase I decide to buy more.</li>
            <li> I noticed those who dislike it, have not given it more than 3 weeks to 2 months.</li>
            <li> After 5 weeks, I could not look in the mirror and see a difference until I put on mascara, and then I could see that the mascara had more and longer lashes to rest on.  </li>
            <li> Also my brows are better again \\&quot;strengthen\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> So its okay.  </li>
            <li> Rapid lash is way better ...</li>
            <li> but we are satisfied with our results.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be nothing more than water.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I make sure to shake the bottle before each application.  </li>
            <li> I think it works better then</li>
            <li> I have 2 tubes and will finish them, but unless there&#x27;s a miracle, I won&#x27;t be buying more.  </li>
            <li> love this product I have used it  before</li>
            <li> I had more satisfying results with Rapid Lash but will give SmartLash more time to work.</li>
            <li> I think I got better results with Rimmel&#x27;s lash enhancer and their lash enhancer mascara.  </li>
            <li> I get better results applying mascara.</li>
            <li> Seems to be ok though.  </li>
            <li> and my lashes have filled in and are getting longer!  </li>
            <li> My brows are filling in too, after many decades of over plucking.</li>
            <li> One more thing...</li>
            <li> Therefore, others may not be able to see the differences unless I put mascara on to darken the color of my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am glad I stuck with it.  </li>
            <li> and I have more of them.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes with this product having so many great reviews.</li>
            <li> I used SmartLash when it first came out and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this now for a year &amp; have wonderful long lashes.</li>
            <li> I already had pretty good lashes to start but wanted &amp;#34;more&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The adage if it seems too good to be true is SO TRUE with this product.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have very full eyelashes to begin with</li>
            <li> She shipped promptly and followed up via email to make sure I had a positive experience...very nice touch...</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product!!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t interfere -</li>
            <li> It is easy and works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Application is easy and it is now part of my morning and nightly routine.</li>
            <li> and I saw results very quickly.  </li>
            <li> All I wanted was lashes that did not break as easily or pull out as easily when removing make-up</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t wash out easily.  </li>
            <li> so it would be easy to keep track.  </li>
            <li> and I like the fact that it is easy to apply, does not irritate my eyes</li>
            <li> Easy to use and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> , I guess that&#x27; why it&#x27;s easy for me to see the differences.</li>
            <li> ; LOL but if you are like me, someone who over-plucked for too many years and would like to have their eyebrows thicker, this might work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not being paid by the manufacturer nor have I gotten any product for free (I only wish!).</li>
            <li> I do wonder if this product works better for people who once had full eyelashes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t spend the full retail amount for this product because it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> That seems to be a very important key to using the product successfully.  </li>
            <li> and/or my hair is not as fine.</li>
            <li> The shipping and everything was fine</li>
            <li> However, I have very fine eyelashes and the newly grown ones are very fine too.</li>
            <li> Love, love this smart lash growth serum!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10 days and already I notice a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> and I can see huge results.</li>
            <li> This product even filled out my over-plucked eyebrows.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth the time and money if you want more  lashes.</li>
            <li> Plus this product ships free.  </li>
            <li> To my great delight, my lower lashes (toward the out edges of my eyes) had tiny lashes to which my mascara could attach.  </li>
            <li> you can however ask your primary care physician for a prescription to regrow your eyelashes &amp; eyebrows which has been approved by the F.D.A.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to run the risk involved in the prescription stuff (I have light eyes)</li>
            <li> Liked so much</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with the results on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I am not affiliated with any seller oranybody, Im just an honest person that likes to post reviews on products that do miracles and really work.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have filled in and have gotten longer.</li>
            <li> After 1 week, that spot filled in and my lashes thickened.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> This item was sent out very quickly and with a sweet note to ensure it was what I wanted and was looking for.</li>
            <li> I checked Amazon to see if the original formula was available.</li>
            <li> I am so thankful that I have significant results.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t as consistent but did see my lashes became more conditioned and thicker after time.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this product...</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s so excited</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t notice that my lashes had gotten significantly longer than they were until I got a pair of bifocal sunglasses</li>
            <li> Hello, for the people that this didn&#x27;t work, there could be a possibility that you are not getting the original product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bummed because it was really fun for the couple of weeks that it worked!</li>
            <li> I bought this product on special just to try it</li>
            <li> Smart Lash in my opinion was a better buy in results.</li>
            <li> Smart Lash is a safe alternative.</li>
            <li> price is right for me, too!  </li>
            <li> I really think any change for the better was imaginary.  </li>
            <li> But, a person could dye their lashes to get the full, fluttery, flush effect if they wished.</li>
            <li> Lashes are longer, but not as full as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Also make sure your purchasing the real thing.</li>
            <li> (Full disclosure:</li>
            <li> Frankly, that was good enough for</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since Latisse isn&#x27;t used on bottom lashes, but SmartLash can, this was a way for me to determine if they really lengthened my lashes because I know it wasn&#x27;t affected by Latisse&#x27;s magic already.  </li>
            <li> it works when you stay true to application.....</li>
            <li> Will rate a true review once I start using.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was getting such a good deal I bought two.</li>
            <li> Smart Lash has brought back my eye lashes, works great.</li>
            <li> For this purchase, the other website only offered an &amp;#34;advanced&amp;#34; formula that didn&#x27;t get good reviews from people that originally had good results from this original formula.</li>
            <li> Trying it out on my eyebrows and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working as quickly</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m lucky if I can remember to use it once a day let alone twice.  </li>
            <li> but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, and since I lose my eyelashes, I depend on this product.  </li>
            <li> It does make MY lashes longer and thicker BECAUSE the product keeps my eyelashes from falling out so quickly.  </li>
            <li> It dries fairly quickly, and then you can put on your makeup without its interfering with the application.  </li>
            <li> I am used to quick results from Revitalash and Latisse-</li>
            <li> I have also been applying to my brows and they have shown tremendous results already.</li>
            <li> I bought three bottles of this (better price if you purchased more) and have been using it religiously twice a day.  </li>
            <li> (I figured one is as good as the next, right?)</li>
            <li> I was very interested in purchasing smartlash seeing how I use latisse</li>
            <li> I guess everybody has different reactions, but I&#x27;m very pleased with the product!!!saw some results in just a week...</li>
            <li> I had gorgeous long eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I have always had a very few eyelashes, and since I have started using this product I have noticed an INCREDIBLE change.</li>
            <li> Really works!!</li>
            <li> Have one tube left and would love to return it!  </li>
            <li> I stopped using the product after a few months and my eyelashes are strong, not falling off and still look gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I know- lucky, right?)  </li>
            <li> I bought this product from dermstore at first, 39.00 on special ( it is listed now for 125.00)..</li>
            <li> After six weeks of applying it, amazingly my eyebrows began to grow back in.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge improvement in the lashes but they definitely seem longer however I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE difference in my eyebrows!</li>
            <li> My doctor couldn&#x27;t believe how good they looked and wanted me to give a class at the cancer center.</li>
            <li> I am surprised at how many people like this product.</li>
            <li> I honestly noticed longer lashes within two weeks of using it only once a day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> price isn&#x27;t the greatest but the product, for me, has been worth it as I have been tired of trying to &amp;#34;fill in&amp;#34; my eyebrow shortcomings.</li>
            <li> have not had any problems with irritation and if is does somehow get into my eye (rare event) it doesn&#x27;t cause any problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this product is definitely worth a shot for eyebrows if you are younger and your hair isn&#x27;t super fine or light.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands but they are not as good.</li>
            <li> My regular eyelashes are really long, full and beautiful.</li>
            <li> The price is right.</li>
            <li> My theory is that I sleep on my right side so the product may be getting rubbed off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and have always had great success.  </li>
            <li> Ask your doctor if you can get your hands on a sample of Lumigan (they will often give it to you for FREE), pending that you do not have high interocular pressure.</li>
            <li> Also, the more I read, the more I agree,  the other sites that show all positive reviews are a bunch of BS.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are pretty full and healthy and I wanted them just a bit longer but after 2 months of faithful twice a day daily use...nothin&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this more in hopes of filling in some bare spots in my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Good price at DermStore, but not worth spending your money or time.</li>
            <li> Or if you have dark eyes and want to spend the money, maybe the prescription lash enhancer is good for you.  </li>
            <li> they are long, with a nice curl...</li>
            <li> But not my eyelashes,lower lashes or eyebrows, so  I started back on the regimen of Latisse which was great for my upper lashes, but it is contraindicated for lower lashes.</li>
            <li> There is probably something better out there, but I don&#x27;t want to waste any more money looking.</li>
            <li> Actually, I&#x27;m reasonably happy, but will buy a more expensive brand when it runs out.  </li>
            <li> First of all I have used Latisse for a couple of years because I had a battle with cancer and with chemo</li>
            <li> The thing is you have to be consistent or</li>
            <li> I think it does actually make your lashes look better</li>
            <li> Will go back to Lilash though it is more pricey</li>
            <li> /&gt;Talking of side effects, I mistakenly ordered, the number one of this type, \\&quot;Rapid\\&quot;lash (4 stars from 1,046 customers) first.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two months now and after the first six weeks I noticed a difference in my lashes.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed that I am getting the results I have been looking for without a prescription or any weird side affects.</li>
            <li> Thank You SmartLash!  ;)</li>
            <li> I first ordered from another company and then looked and found through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This eyelash enhancer really works!</li>
            <li> I wish I had more faith in it&#x27;s potential when I started because if I did, I would have taken a before and now,</li>
            <li> I have been using SmartLast for a couple of months and found it to work within the first seven days.  </li>
            <li> When I first started using this product I thought I had gotten ripped off because nothing was happening.  </li>
            <li> I am still using the first tube but it will be time soon to order.  </li>
            <li> be patient and just use it consistently</li>
            <li> that is EXACTLY the time-table.  </li>
            <li> I started with RapidLash and THOUGHT I saw a difference, but it wasn&#x27;t enough to make me sure it wasn&#x27;t just in my head.  </li>
            <li> I used Latisse with excellent results, but it&#x27;s expensive and a nuisance to apply with a separate, disposable brush for each eye and a squeeze bottle of Latisse solution.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice that they are fuller, but that&#x27;s okay, since I can actually see my lashes now.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like the looks of the product at first.  </li>
            <li> I got it on Groupon for $25, wish I read reviews first before I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I only use it once a day and my lashes have never looked better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product religiously for months on most nights and mornings.  </li>
            <li> I went from having a full set of beautiful long natural eyelashes to no lashes where my friends were constantly asking me what happened to your eyelashes or why don&#x27;t you wear falsies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll finish up the second tube, but I won&#x27;t purchase any more.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work even though I followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks most of my lashes were about the same length</li>
            <li> At first, I applied it right before applying my eye makeup when I was getting ready for work.</li>
            <li> Pretty easy to figure out that more is not better in this case!&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m loving this and am just about to buy my second bottle.</li>
            <li> My daughter got me a tube of Smartlash as a gift because I kept complaining that my eyelashes were becoming sparse and short, with a bald spot!  </li>
            <li> Have used prescription Latisse in the past with good results, but wanted to avoid the itchy eyelid swelling and redness it provoked.  </li>
            <li> There are not more of them, but they are looking good and I will continue to purchase this product.  </li>
            <li> Not really sure if it does anything, but a good conditioner.</li>
            <li> I decided to give Smart Lash a try at $30.00 a tube.  </li>
            <li> I used  smart lash for 3 months twice a day and got zero results.</li>
            <li> I have been using smart lash since Aug</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using smart lash for 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy Smart Lash.</li>
            <li> Got an email containing info on Smart Lash.  </li>
            <li> For me I did not noticed a difference with Smart Lash.  </li>
            <li> I tried Smart Lash on the promotion on \\&quot;The Doctors\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> I tried Smart Lash morning and evening as directed&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li> smart lash does not make them thicker or longer</li>
            <li> Just to be honest, I have been applying it more than directed, usually 3 or 4 times a day as opposed to the twice daily recommendation on the package.</li>
            <li> This Smart Lash really does work.</li>
            <li> little bit of fenugreek&lt;br /&gt;You can make your own with just castor and olive oil</li>
            <li> My lashes are much longer.  </li>
            <li> , I really extend my usage of Latisse.  </li>
            <li> Second (and most important), SmartLash has oil in it and the oil manages to seep into your eyes no matter how carefully or sparingly you try to apply it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes but it did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had very sparse eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work.</li>
            <li> I really like the product and do not have any irritation from it.</li>
            <li> I have to say that yes, around the 30 day mark I was noticing my lashes were much fuller and longer...but not darker.</li>
            <li> I have not seen real results and it&#x27;s been almost 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> , I was contacted by a very smart-savvy and health-conscious customer asking a question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a whole lot of change</li>
            <li> my mascara goes on so much easier and fuller as well....</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t noticed much changes on my lashes</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t really bother me until my mom asked me when I started wearing purple eyeliner.</li>
            <li> That is where I bought it, but since it didn&#x27;t work, it really wasn&#x27;t a bargain.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim, but from dermstore.com, which sells it at a much affordable price.</li>
            <li> However, I just really, really wanted them to be longer, and they didn&#x27;t seem to be doing that.</li>
            <li> For me, it helped to curl my lashes to really see if there was a difference in length without mascara.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I don&#x27;t think I would&#x27;ve noticed as much.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say that I notice a difference</li>
            <li> I have light skin and hair but fairly coarse eyebrows.</li>
            <li> So my wife bought this eyelash enhancer and she couldnt stop telling me how much it really works.</li>
            <li> Not as fast as you might like</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> Really saw no difference.</li>
            <li> If you use it twice a day, it really does work.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely did NOT work for me.</li>
            <li> since I have started using SmartLash, I really don&#x27;t think I need mascara anymore.</li>
            <li> it may not help that situation all that much.  </li>
            <li> They look fuller and I&#x27;ve noticed that they don&#x27;t break/fall out as much as they did.</li>
            <li> Also, I wear contacts and it does sometimes run into the eyes, but I haven&#x27;t experienced the burning sensation some people are talking about or the oiliness that remains behind.  </li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> This works really well.  </li>
            <li> I am a 62 yo woman with very sparse lashes :&#x27;-(  </li>
            <li> $100 dlls is just too much.</li>
            <li> and this really fits the bill.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my brows and lashes for a month and really didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really have a lot of hope this would work after I singed the lashes on one eye while barbecuing.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think this would work.</li>
            <li> with absolutely zero results.  </li>
            <li> I have found that there seem to be a few that are authentic good reviews, but there are also a lot on here and dermstore.com that are written on the same day or within a day or two, and are written in the same style.</li>
            <li> After my daughter confirmed that my eyelashes are indeed longer and a tad bit thicker, I ordered a second tube.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient to keep in my makeup bag in case I forget to apply in the morning.</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the oily residue that goes into my eyes too -</li>
            <li> I rest my case finding one that really works.</li>
            <li> One time I was browsing through &amp;#34;Groupon&amp;#34; and I saw this eyelash tube for like 29 dollars, it seemed promising, I said why not.</li>
            <li> really didn&#x27;t have a review on the product yet, but they will not let me asking any question with a review.  </li>
            <li> but it really deserves a zero.</li>
            <li> you might not see as much improvement as I have.</li>
            <li> but I can say the application process with SmartLash is much easier.</li>
            <li> give it a 4 star because the formula irritated my eyes when I accidentally put too much on.</li>
            <li> The stuff really works for me.</li>
            <li> But after using it faithfully for 2 months (two full tubes) there was barely any improvement, so there&#x27;s no point in continuing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands before and they worked better than this one.</li>
            <li> I will go back to my original product line.</li>
            <li> So, I put okay for the support of the other viewer.  </li>
            <li> i have tried other products that have worked, my favorite is Rapid Lash.</li>
            <li> This, for me, leaves enough product on the brush (I can feel the cool liquid along the margin of my lashes) yet does not apply so much that it drips in</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product, and it is very easy to brush on a light application both morning and night.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a daily special and that&#x27;s how I got it for $29.95.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t get more of an improvement, though, I will stop using it since the cost and twice-a-day application aren&#x27;t worth the improvement thus far, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  This product is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> My eyebrows have been over plucked and I have trying to grow them back for years, so if this works to the full effect, it will be a blessing.</li>
            <li> If you are willing to wait, though, you might be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I am 56 years old, my lashes aren&#x27;t what they were when I was younger, but with the help of smart lash they are!!!</li>
            <li> I have made sure my lashes r clean &amp; I apply twice a day w/ no good results.</li>
            <li> The first week I kind of did it when I remembered and not regularly, but I saw a slight change after a week and decided to do it twice a day and on my eyebrows as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my lashes nice &amp; long &amp; when on occasion I&#x27;ve had a few fall out, this product fills those lashes in rather quickly.</li>
            <li> As of this point in time ,I have not seen any new growth, not even a stubble!  </li>
            <li> enjoy your long lashes, from a woman who used to have dinky lashes and have thicker and longer ones now!</li>
            <li> Luckily for me when I went back to my au naturelle</li>
            <li> I had a particular spot where there was NO hair</li>
            <li> I got the SmartLash at a discounted price through Groupon or Living Social and figured it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> I will start by saying I have decent lashes.  </li>
            <li> The DermStore site exaggerates I think, so have realistic expectations.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased three of these products thinking that maybe it was just taking longer since I am older or whatever....</li>
            <li> The only thing I noticed is that maybe my lashes weren&#x27;t falling out as quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love being able to &amp;#34;lengthen&amp;#34; my lashes, without &amp;#34;glueing&amp;#34; on lashes that fall off in random order.  </li>
            <li> Smartlash was highly recommended on Youtube</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Saw product highly rated in a style magazine.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend for all women who want longer and thicker eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s available for much cheaper elsewhere, as other commenters have said.</li>
            <li> I had long but sparse lashes, and this definitely increased the volume of lashes, whether by plumping the individual hairs, making me grow more hairs, or preventing existing hairs from falling out as quickly, I don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li> I can also see a little more fullness in the eyebrow</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of great reviews from this product, so I bought two at dermstore.com where it was less than half the price.  </li>
            <li> Thankful to see that it was available &amp; that the price had come down significantly from the last time I had checked.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am Asian and, in my opinion, most of us aren&#x27;t blessed with long eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> This works so well that I have to move my glasses farther from my eyes than I would normally wear them,</li>
            <li> Worth the money to me personally.</li>
            <li> I am so upset to have waisted so much money all these months because my eyelash look EXACTLY THE SAME!!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try even if it only works a fraction as well for you as it did for me.</li>
            <li> After using Latisse for years and knowing it really works Im going back to it but being more careful not to get any in my eyes.</li>
            <li> and I thought it would help me not only keep from losing my lashes but help them grow long - like one of the social workers I met who used a lash treatment and had AMAZING lashes.</li>
            <li> I used it religiously twice a day for five weeks and my lashes are as short and fine as ever.  </li>
            <li> and I saw incredible results in mere weeks!</li>
            <li> you can brush your eyelashes and you can trim them on a new moon&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Does what it says-makes lashes stop breaking and creates new growth.</li>
            <li> Then around the one month mark, one day I noticed that a quick coat of mascara now looked like 3 long coats of mascara!  </li>
            <li> Found this product so pleasing I am not afraid of making additional purchases in the near future.</li>
            <li> as a mature woman, I have decent eyelashes</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive eyes and skin</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive eyes and had no issues with this product.</li>
            <li> Clearly, I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> but what worried the most was that it is  prostaglandin analogs for ophthalmic use and are currently classified as Pregnancy Class C. meaning that there have been no human studies of the drug, but that animal studies have revealed some potential abnormalities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, so this didn&#x27;t work for me, but evidently it works for some.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> (I never bothered to use it during the day)  Low and behold, after about 2 months of consistent use they were beginning to get longer.  </li>
            <li> I used it exactly as directed for several months (morning &amp; evening)</li>
            <li> You apply it to the skin above the lashes (I use it underneath, too) and the first time I used it</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are exactly the same as they were.</li>
            <li> I have been following their directions exactly.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give SmartLash only one star is because I think my  top lashes aren&#x27;t as short as before</li>
            <li> Ive read some reviews in the past of other products where the seller is not selling the original product and just mixing it with water or another solution to make more product.</li>
            <li> My first tube which I got from another source is lasting over 60 days.</li>
            <li> 3-4 sentences, same grammar, same style punctuation, slightly different story, but by a very excited person who says it works.</li>
            <li> this the new formula or the old one?</li>
            <li> I also used to have very long and full lashes, but now at 30, my lashes are a lot shorter and less full.</li>
            <li> I continued to use this product, never missing an application, and after 4 full months of using it, I saw absolutely no change.  </li>
            <li> I am careful with application because it can sting if it gets in your eyes, but quickly wears off</li>
            <li> Compared to the price of other things out there, it&#x27;s not a bad price.</li>
            <li> It was embarrassing having a huge gap of missing eyelashes on both eyelids.</li>
            <li> I DO NOT recommend if you have sensitive eyes like me</li>
            <li> but still we are hopeful that we can at least achieve a result of about 50% of that look :-)  </li>
            <li> So here&#x27;s the wild thing about this product - I had read that it can also be used on the eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Works well for me, as long as you&#x27;re consistent in use.</li>
            <li> and I naturally thought it was Smartlash that I was looking for</li>
            <li> As far as price?  </li>
            <li> Ladies, you need to go directly to dermstore.com and look up Smartlash - the price is $29.95 and you can choose auto-fill to lock in the price.  </li>
            <li> Friends have told me going directly to dermstore.com shows the product for $100.  </li>
            <li> I see so many negative reviews on this site.</li>
            <li> Like I said, it really worked well for me, but I do understand that everone&#x27;s body chemistry is different &amp; what might work for one person won&#x27;t work for another.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Wild&#x27;s MegaLash...</li>
            <li> I am a 70 year old woman</li>
            <li> This product is complete rubbish.</li>
            <li> lashes are twice as long as when I first started the treatment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am also using Rogaine for Women to hopefully help my thinning hair (I am 45 years old).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;And naturally, it will not work for every person.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read that people are applying Smartlash directly on to their eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are growing so far</li>
            <li> I was young</li>
            <li> short, straight stump lashes.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> and I am 54 years old now.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> So far - NOTHING.  </li>
            <li> After I finished Latisse and went straight to SmartLash, my lashes shrunk dramatically because I stopped the Latisse, but Smartlash helped prevent them from being my short pre-Latisse</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive eyes pass.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> At the 5 week mark I haven&#x27;t seen a considerable difference from the 3 week mark.  </li>
            <li> (because once your lashes get full and long you can&#x27;t go back!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m delighted and hope they&#x27;ll grow longer, though I&#x27;m still skeptical on how much longer they could grow since my lashes were so short to begin with; maybe I&#x27;ll return with an update!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised there are so many negative reviews---</li>
            <li> I thought this was a better option than Latisse because it doesn&#x27;t affect colored eyes, but it was a big waste of time.</li>
            <li> We the consumer are wise enough to know that the models in these pics are wearing false lashes</li>
            <li> They are not beautifully long or thick, but they are decent and not horribly sparse.  </li>
            <li> I realize I saw results much faster than usual, and maybe I was just lucky, but I&#x27;m sticking with SmartLash.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other products such as Rapidlash and it works much better for around the same price.</li>
            <li> I also read on here that other reviewers are experiencing oil from the product irritating their eyes, I have experienced this as well</li>
            <li> I have used latesse in the past, great product worked like a charm but a pain since you need a prescription for it and also a little concerned about the possibility that my eyes would turn yellow.  </li>
            <li> I quickly learned to pull the wand out and wait for a drop to work its way down to the brush, then wipe the drop off.  </li>
            <li> Clean your eyelash in the morning with green tea</li>
            <li> After reading some of the ridiculous reviews and suppositions here, I had to create my more informed and balanced review.  </li>
            <li> First, it only enhances the APPEARANCE of lashes, not actual growth.</li>
            <li> As a middle aged woman with quickly thinning brows, I thought I would give Smartlash a try.  </li>
            <li> my lashes have gone back to normal, need to curl them &amp; use lots of mascara</li>
            <li> I tried everything to fix this problem, I went from not using the eyelash curler or any mascara for several months and no luck, the eyelashes will grow on its own but very slowly</li>
            <li> They are now fuller and longer, not tremendously but enough to get excited about.</li>
            <li> When I found out the price I decided to live with short, sparse eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> The only stuff that really works is the bimatoprost and those in the same catagory.</li>
            <li> The product is definitely good, but it´s quiet expensive.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me, and I was shocked, because I had read so many good reviews here and other places that it worked, worked, worked!!!</li>
            <li> My left eye has a ton of new hair that are shorter than the rest, my right doesn&#x27;t have nearly half that amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a month, and after the first couple of weeks, I cut back to only once a day.  </li>
            <li> I just thought other would-be purchasers should be aware of this.</li>
            <li> I tried SmartLash and it proved me wrong; I&#x27;m Asian with short lashes and honestly am seeing a difference, and I haven&#x27;t even been that consistent with putting it twice but only once a day.</li>
            <li> (some newly grown ones are shorter than my old ones; half of my old ones grew longer than the rest of the old ones.)</li>
            <li> I have tried other eyelash enhancement products in the past that worked great, but they left my eyelids looking slightly puffy</li>
            <li> and I am getting the feeling that they were mostly written by the same person who is trying to promote the product, shame on me for not catching this earlier before investing time and money.</li>
            <li> I have used it morning and night for over a month, and my lashes have barely grown at all.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that my lashed actually grew after about 2 weeks of using.</li>
            <li> I came in intending to, but saw an ad from an external website that was considerably cheaper, and decided to try it from there.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are still barely there.</li>
            <li> Apparently it works for some and not for others.  </li>
            <li> at how much I spent for junk that does absolutely NOTHING</li>
            <li> and I barely see any difference.</li>
            <li> So a big thumbs up so far, will write in about about 2 weeks what the status of my eyelashes are.</li>
            <li> I use go bare and use an eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li> Was not Happy with this products container, I opened the package everything has leaked through the container, and everytime I opened more of the liquid would come out .</li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned, blonde haired gal whose lashes are pale to say the least.</li>
            <li> Several months ago I went on a new protocol and my hair started coming back.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks though, I either got used to the new look so much that it didn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything</li>
            <li> so I purchased this for first time beginning December last year after trying other name brands, its been over 10 weeks since I started the regimen with SmartLash</li>
            <li> When I was younger I had such long eye lashes, but as I have grown older, I don&#x27;t know what happened to them.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping my \\&quot;blackest-black\\&quot; mascara wouldn&#x27;t have to work so hard to give a full fringe of lashes.</li>
            <li> Now, over 3 months later, I use it every other day and have much fuller and longer lashes than ever before.</li>
            <li> I got the burning sensation that everyone has talked about but ignored it because it seemed to be working, but now after three months off of Latisse and three months on Smartlash, I am back to barely visible lashes.  </li>
            <li> I use it for a week to two weeks and my lashes get long and lush and they stay that way then in about two to three weeks</li>
            <li> I am going to try this product on a bare spot on my lower lash line, so please forgive me for posting prior to trying the product.</li>
            <li> I also NEVER left the house without using brow filler before this, but I barely need the filler anymore</li>
            <li> and I barely see any results even if I was religiously following the use instructions, another thing</li>
            <li> I have been using Smart lash for about 2 months and have noticed my lashes are thicker and slightly longer.  </li>
            <li> I used Latisse before, so far, no other product has come closed to it.</li>
            <li> The slower growth might also be due to the fact that I am older.</li>
            <li> Then I realized that I had changed mascaras and the new one was harder to take off at night.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update (5/27/12) I am starting to see growth in an area of my upper lashes that was prevously bare.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are thicker and a little longer, not a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> , I only use one quick one, also, I used it on my brows which are sparse, I think it works, hard for me to tell, but the woman who does my brows noticed a difference..</li>
            <li> This product will NOT GIVE YOU NEW EYELASHES but will only allow the existing lashes to grow a little longer before succumbing to their natural cycle of falling out and growing back in.</li>
            <li> so, I have been using smart last for a little over 30 days.  </li>
            <li> in these tough economic times we can only afford our needs not our wants.  </li>
            <li> So, the good news is, it does work, the bad news is, it takes quite awhile.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have heard the good and bad about this product.</li>
            <li> I take a pretty heavy dose of thyroid medication and lost virtually all of my eyebrows a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but this stuff really works</li>
            <li> For a while, I didn&#x27;t notice much of anything, then notice that the curl was back in my lashes, meaning they had been growing past the point where they had been breaking off.  </li>
            <li> used to have pretty thick eyebrows but after years of over-zealous plucking, they have not grown back.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of using it morning and night with little to no results, besides normal growth in my eyebrows</li>
            <li> The only issue I came across from daily use was during the first couple of months, my lash line did itch quite a bit, but I attributed it to new growth (I&#x27;m prob wrong).</li>
            <li> if not more to see a real difference</li>
            <li> and they say it turns your irises dark so far that hasn&#x27;t happened.</li>
            <li> Generally when reading reviews there is a wide variety of spelling, and comments, not so with this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product this past year and it really lengthens your lashes and fills in your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes grew so long that I had to quit using it for a short period of time because they were \\&quot;really\\</li>
            <li> It stung my eyes so I could not continue to use it long enough to see if it worked.  </li>
            <li> and she made a comment about how pretty my eyes looked and that my lashes looked so thick now.</li>
            <li> I was diligent night and morning for two months on clean eyelids before I began to see a difference in length on one eye of about 1/16th of an inch, a little less on the other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products such as \\&quot;Revitalash\\&quot; and that one is more expensive but it seems to work faster.  </li>
            <li> I found that it does take several minutes to completely dry, so my eye liner pencil didn&#x27;t want to go on so well in a time crunch.</li>
            <li> so they naturally curl upwards slightly</li>
            <li> I have a suspicion that some of the bad reviews were written by another company (or more) trying to get people to not buy Smartlash!  </li>
            <li> Not very complete instructions with it.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon, I&#x27;ll be saving some serious money on my next tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please</li>
            <li> I have VERY short VERY straight eyelashes, and thin eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I have never had long eyelashes and almost never wear mascara.  </li>
            <li> they were so long.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have the expected results, even after a month of use, and my eyes stayed irritated to the point that I finally gave up and tossed it in the trash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say that about 5 weeks after switching, my eyelashes are almost as long as they were when I was using Latisse every day.</li>
            <li> a matter of fact, today my gal pal asked me if I was still using Latisse as my lashes looked so long.  </li>
            <li> I know that seems strange</li>
            <li> &quot; long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still searching for a product like Latisse which produces similar result but minus the price.</li>
            <li> have to say that this products lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product like this for a long time as my lashes seemed to be disappearing.</li>
            <li> the minimal results I would say save your money, especially at this price.</li>
            <li> It did take a LONG time to fully see the results (over 2 months).</li>
            <li> Through the years, they had gotten sparse and not as long.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last 2 weeks and have noticed absolutely no change in my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> long did you use the product before you start see  any results</li>
            <li> you stop using the product, will your lashes stay long or will they break</li>
            <li> so I tried this product and it maintained my long lashes for about 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I have been using roughly 10 days and I am starting to see some results.  </li>
            <li> Before using SmartLash, I had long eyelashes, but of varying length and thickness.  </li>
            <li> If you use it every day it tends to make your lashes very, very long I wear sunglasses and it makes my lashes so long that they get caught up in the glasses.</li>
            <li> A few days before starting a new bottle of Rogaine, I swore my lashes looks longer &amp; less sparse.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited when I ordered this product, I had used Latisse, but it was too expensive, but it worked, my lashes were so long they hit my glasses, w/ your product</li>
            <li> Last time I saw him he wanted to know what I was using so he could recommend it to other patients.</li>
            <li> While my lashes are only a little longer and fuller, but I can definitely see an improvement!!  </li>
            <li> I saw results in two weeks and now after a month my eyelashes are so long that they touch my eyebrows!</li>
            <li> After using this product and Physicians Formula Organic Mascara, I now have long eyelashes again!  </li>
            <li> My lashes are almost twice as long!  </li>
            <li> in other words I definitely gave it a chance.  </li>
            <li> Very, very minimal, but it is enough to make me continue using it for another month or two.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are very long anyway, but they were thinning out on me after I turned 40.</li>
            <li> Some days I have Dry eyes.</li>
            <li> Only a few will get the big results.</li>
            <li> No longer lashes, no thicker lashes and no new growth of brows.  </li>
            <li> and I did not see a single difference in my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> After I used Latisse, I used SmartLash, and I haven&#x27;t had a single compliment on my lashes since.  </li>
            <li> Quality products generally are not cheap.</li>
            <li> I am very VERY careful, I don&#x27;t use too much product, and I apply it at least 2, sometimes 3 times a day.  </li>
            <li> but I was hoping for at least a bit of new growth.</li>
            <li> I have been using Smartlash for a couple of months and have only noticed a slight improvement in my lashes.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve tried it for less, then you are not being persistent enough.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t grow as long as the other well-known products that&#x27;s out on the market ... but for the price ... you get what you get.</li>
            <li> I was sad to be missing partial of my eyelashes and they seemed shorter and would fall of easily.</li>
            <li> Everybody&#x27;s different but it made my lashes longer and a little thicker</li>
            <li> The eyelash growth formula works exactly as I&#x27;ve expected.</li>
            <li> I have no rhyme or reason) and unfortunately, because of this, I had a difficult time growing them back to a nice shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I went through four bottles with absolutely no change to either my brows or my lashes.</li>
            <li> I once in a while will get the itchiness on my lash line, but it occurs so infrequently and only for a few seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I had cataract surgery in the middle of menopause, and somehow the combination of the two laid the remaining lashes to waste (also my hair and fingernails, but that is another</li>
            <li> no matter how careful I am, it always gets in there and blurs my vision.</li>
            <li> but empty your wallet.</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice a day for 30 days and have seen absolutely no change at all.</li>
            <li> Less lashes fall out &amp; they stay long.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been diligently using SmartLash twice a day for about 6 weeks, and just within the last week I do think my eyelashes are Very slightly fuller and maybe a smidge longer.  </li>
            <li> I had long, thick lashes (that were, unfortunately, quite light, but still...).  </li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m not a huge fan of fake stuff or falsies, so i tried everything from applying oil to my eyelashes, to buying various promising brands at the local drug store like cvs, rite aid, walgreens, nothing worked, just a waste of maybe 20 dollars each time.</li>
            <li> Now, 4 months later they are thick and long like they used to be when I was a</li>
            <li> Never had that happen with the other two.</li>
            <li> I will try other eyelash growth products and see if any of them will work for me.</li>
            <li> I took a chance, but this does not work like other eyelash enhancers do.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that would work the same for people using liquid liners.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> *Buyer Beware***&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product due to \\&quot;rave</li>
            <li> since I seem to have no more tiny bald spots in my brows.  </li>
            <li> Add the cost of other beauty products and you´ll be broke before you know it.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, my friend who recommended it (who is 65) saw changes after just 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I even bought it for my friend who is loosing her eyebrows due to hypothyroid.  </li>
            <li> And it seemed like a dumb thing to spend money on, but I was bored and feeling adventurous, I guess.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for almost 2 months, once every other day or so.</li>
            <li> works faster than I expected!</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!  </li>
            <li> I have used other products for eyelashes and could see no results from this one.</li>
            <li> I like that there are no side effects (other than growing lashes/brows) unlike the leading prescription lash enhancer.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> used it twice a day for a few months (one tube lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I apply a thin line above my upper lashes.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I previously tried Wet n&#x27;</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are longer and the cost is much less than the other product you get at the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Eight months back I lost all my hair, lashes, and eyebrows because of the chemo and it was hard adjusting.</li>
            <li> (not make them grow), but it&#x27;s not worth getting the stuff in your eyes.</li>
            <li> , I think it is not worth the irritation, redness, and tearing that it causes.   </li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product first but after applying closer to my lashes every night for few weeks, others might not notice</li>
            <li> Sorry, but it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> your money Trust me, it is not worth it</li>
            <li> not as prescribed, not worth it</li>
            <li> I never really had thick and long lashes to begin with.</li>
            <li> and they were annoying me because my lashes were touching them.  </li>
            <li> Once my eyes settled down, I began to use it again.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other over-the-counter lash products, except for Latisse because of its side effects, and none have worked like Smartlash!  </li>
            <li> I did a little research and think it might be the prostaglandin in the other products that was causing my eyelids to puff up and turn purple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used SmartLash for about 6 weeks and just the other day noticed that my lashes are longer, and I haven&#x27;t even been applying the product correctly!  </li>
            <li> So I really don&#x27;t have a personal review, but I couldn&#x27;t say any bad without using it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year and a half and will continue too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had sparse lashes - they would literally fall out if I rubbed my eye slightly.  </li>
            <li> As for my eyelashes, I did see a subtle difference in the lower lashes - but it was my eyebrows coming back</li>
            <li> but I started to see a slight difference.</li>
            <li> I think there is a slight appearance of being fuller, but nothing I would pay for again.  </li>
            <li> I do have to say, that there are times when there is a slight stinging in my eyes</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 and a half mos.</li>
            <li> My lashes are longer and thicker but that is because they fall out less often</li>
            <li> After a week and a half, my lower lashes looked much less sparse.</li>
            <li> I saw faster results with a lot less irritation to my eyes.</li>
            <li> lashes are naturally fairly long but have thinned out and seemed a bit brittle lately.</li>
            <li> I start using it again to keep my lashes long and thick.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect thick long lashes as stated in commercials....</li>
            <li> , they are thick again and long.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product that is going to give you those extra long, fake looking lashes that resemble a black fan, forget it.  </li>
            <li> I am sorry I did not track the progress to tell you how long it took, but it wasn&#x27;t instant</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking to purchase a lash enhancer for awhile, and this seemed to be the little miracle in a bottle I was searching for.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because it does sting a little if it gets in your eyes.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a little over 2 weeks now.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes then have a chance to get a little longer and a little thicker.  </li>
            <li> But, unfourtunely it is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Ulta&#x27;s rapid lash did a little and was way cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I noticed there are people on the reviews of this product who were not very satisfied</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  </li>
            <li> i have to use few days then stop for while</li>
            <li> the only downside I found, is that after a month of none use, my eyelashes thin out again....</li>
            <li> It has few side affects like it makes me look like I have eyeliner on</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not susceptible to any kind of dermatitis, but two days of using this product gave me a horrible rash on both of my eyelids, which promptly went away after I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or your time on this product.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It does sting if you get it in your eyes, but a few blinks and it stops.</li>
            <li> ( I bought two tubes on groupon) for a product that wastes both time and money.</li>
            <li> I started using this product a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> A few lashes now grow longer than others.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money and time using it.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> The problem is the stuff doesn&#x27;t work don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> noticed definate improvement in lashes as to length amd density within a few weeks</li>
            <li> This is a Waste of your money.</li>
            <li> Bought this with groupon(still not cheap).</li>
            <li> Still short and thin.</li>
            <li> but it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Absolutely waste of money.</li>
            <li> If anything this product does, it&#x27;s shrink your lashes and make you waste your money on this.  </li>
            <li> I did notice that if I didn&#x27;t use the product as prescribed my lashes went back to their thin and stubby selves.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Smartlash for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I used Latisse, and Loved the lashes I got but Hated the red, itchy eyelids, which was bad enough to cause people to ask me what was wrong with them... not a good tradeoff... and it took about 3 weeks for the red to go away after I stopped using</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian and started with very few and thin lashes.</li>
            <li> In 2008 my eyelashes started falling off because I&#x27;ve been using excessive mascara everyday since maybe 1997 and the eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> I also had a bare spot from a waxing that went wrong years ago.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied it slapdash and noticed little hairs on my eyelids!</li>
            <li> I like writing positive reviews, but I am a little disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> After two weeks I was starting to become skeptical, but I re-read the directions</li>
            <li> But, not sure if it&#x27;s still going on.</li>
            <li> It did sting a small bit when I accidentally over-applied and it seeped into my eyes a smidge.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I think SmartLash works just as well as the products I used in the past, but doesn&#x27;t leave my eyes puffy with a purplish tint.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste yours!</li>
            <li> /&gt;But it did work, and work quite well for me, so I would recommend it to others, at least to give it a try for a few months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet</li>
            <li> Not sure if it will even work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly not sure which it is.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this didn&#x27;t work for some people</li>
            <li> I hate throwing things away, but this went right in the trash.</li>
            <li> I have very thin and short lashes</li>
            <li> the last year I have been purchasing it on another website because it was the least expensive, by a lot.</li>
            <li> My lashes have gotten so thin as I age that I had to use individual false lashes.</li>
            <li> I wear glasses and my lashes got so long it made it slightly uncomfortable, so I had to keep adjusting them on the bridge of my nose.</li>
            <li> I have hardly seen any lash growth and my brows almost nothing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hit and miss thing if you want to risk your hard earned money.  </li>
            <li> I even used it on a little area on my head where my hair was getting thin and it worked there also.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be a little irritating if it gets in your eyes</li>
            <li> It did take at least 30</li>
            <li> No stinging, no side effects, didn&#x27;t bother me in the least.</li>
            <li> I started doubting any lash product (that&#x27;s affordable, at least) could do that.</li>
            <li> Sucks</li>
            <li> Then I tired Ardell Growth Accelerator (don&#x27;t waste your time/money).  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work overnight, though, so if you are impatient, save your money and buy a set of false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I had people comment how thick my lashes were</li>
            <li> I started using this product with very little expectations and it has surpassed them!</li>
            <li> I went on the website where I had first purchased it and was shocked that it had gone up from $29.99 to $125!  </li>
            <li> Try it, you wont be sorry, money well spent!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my eyebrows were thinning and after using it just once a day for the past 3 months, the thin areas are filling in.</li>
            <li> I used it for nearly 2 months with no results :(  </li>
            <li> but it is also a lot less expensive</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, no results, feels like and looks like water, I will continue to use it even though it has done nothing so far because of the costs.</li>
            <li> I put on a little mascara yesterday and it looked like I had on fake lashes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad others didn&#x27;t experience the same.</li>
            <li> Not a good value</li>
            <li> but the product is no good</li>
            <li> The only thing that grew for me with this was my anger...</li>
            <li> but, unfortunately, still as pale as they ever were</li>
            <li> But, I wanted to put this out there for people who are skeptical or not sure if they should try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe all of the negative reviews on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Essentially cutting my cost For Latisse in half.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed to lose out on so much money</li>
            <li> It dries within seconds, which is why I am confused why people are applying it to their eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I also run the brush over my upper eyelash base after I put it on my brows, just to use up the rest.</li>
            <li> and I think my lashes are worse now.</li>
            <li> I was not happy at all.  </li>
            <li> I pick at my eye lashes when I get tired</li>
            <li> Additionally I have not experienced any eye irritation whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> Claims that it grows anything are false.</li>
            <li> I believed all the false advertizing.</li>
            <li> But I do have people ask me if I am wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> effects are mainly the awful stinging pain, itchy/red eyes, and causing some sensitivity.</li>
            <li> What a disappointing product and waste of my money!</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, there is a dramatic and noticeable improvement compared to what they were like before.</li>
            <li> Bought two 0.16 oz., and was disappointed due to the lack of growth and/or volume to my lashes.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried that it would cause damage to my eyes because it did burn so bad, but withno paperwork, I didnt know.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t produce results and I applied as directed: twice a day.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t afford to continue using it</li>
            <li> , I\\&quot;m sorry to say.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at the start, but within a week I saw a difference in my lashes.....</li>
            <li> Way too expensive.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to say I have seen no improvement in my lashes.</li>
            <li> Silly Me.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day, and, I&#x27;m sad to say, that it did nothing for my lashes.  </li>
            <li> It does get expensive if you continue to use and order monthly.  </li>
            <li> Im sorry to say it has done nothing.</li>
            <li> I admit I was skeptical and reluctant to try this product, but I decided to try it anyway.  </li>
            <li> Wrong.  </li>
            <li> But it is expensive and you run the risk of your pupils taking on a brown hue...</li>
            <li> Sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> and if they were fake.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say</li>
            <li> My lashes are worse than they did before I used anything!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very irritating and doesn&#x27;t wash out with eye drops.</li>
            <li> In fact, there was a time when I plucked them VERY thin</li>
            <li> But Latisse was getting very irritating to my lids.</li>
            <li> was disappointed to see the negative reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> But the stuff is crazy expensive; so I looked into alternatives.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t that affordable, I&#x27;m afraid I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it; I couldn&#x27;t repeatedly spend the amount it&#x27;s charged for here on Amazon; way too expensive for me.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> No tell-tale &amp;#34;missing eyelashes&amp;#34;, if you know what I mean!!!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes practically look fake but their not!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very expensive to maintain and</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very expensive, but after reading the reviews I think I&#x27;ll stick with the latisse.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> That said, I&#x27;ve purchased it 3 times so it isn&#x27;t all bad.  </li>
            <li> I know bad habit.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happen with all the people who wrote a bad review.</li>
            <li> Bad bad bad</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t had any bad reaction at all.</li>
            <li> The box came all messed up , wondering if I got a bad batch.  </li>
            <li> :(.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen no improvement whatsoever; so I am disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to get Liz Taylor lashes, you will disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but I am very afraid to try...</li>
            <li> and I am obsessed!!</li>
            <li> I have faithfully applied to base of eyelashes as directed by manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I actually hate wearing mascara on a  day to day basis and</li>
            <li> I hate wasting money</li>
            <li> and I hate people who take advantage of consumers.</li>
            <li> My doctor prescribed the very expensive Latisse to satisfy my vanity!  </li>
            <li> I was getting frustrated because it seemed like I was losing lashes instead of growing them!  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The day after I started using this it had seeped into my eyes and caused them horrible irritation to the point of where it hurt to move them.</li>
            <li> Terrible product</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t produce results and I applied as directed: twice a day. Save your money and try something else.</li>
            <li> BEEN USING IT FOR OVER A MONTH AND IT DOES NOT WORK FOR ME.</li>
            <li> Began Noticing The Difference In My Lashes Within 2 Weeks After Applying Smartlash Like Instructed. The Lashes Seemed To Look healthier.</li>
            <li> I have been using Latisse for years, but decided to try Smartlash because no prescription was needed.  It doesn&#x27;t work at all.  When I stopped the Latisse I had gorgeous long eyelashes.  3 months later, using SmartLash, they were short and stubby.  There were also fewer lashes.  I have gone back to using Latisse.</li>
            <li> This item was sent out very quickly and with a sweet note to ensure it was what I wanted and was looking for. The product is great. I love it and plan to buy it again.</li>
            <li> I used the prescription eyelash growth and it was awesome. Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t afford to continue using it so I saw this product and the reviews looked good and I decided to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;Wow, what a let-down. I saw NOTHING, no improvement at all. Save your money ladies, this product does not deliver results.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on reading lots of good reviews. I&#x27;ve been looking to purchase a lash enhancer for awhile, and this seemed to be the little miracle in a bottle I was searching for. After using it religiously for weeks, I haven&#x27;t seen any changes in the length or thickness of my lashes. I&#x27;d be suspicious of all the great reviews on here, too.</li>
            <li> This works for me. Took about 6 weeks til I started noticing. You did need to use it in the morning &amp; night. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year and a half and will continue too. Less lashes fall out &amp; they stay long.</li>
            <li> I used Latisse for about three months, it worked, I loved it!  But of course it can be cost prohibitive.  I decided to give Smart Lash a try at $30.00 a tube.  I got the burning sensation that everyone has talked about but ignored it because it seemed to be working, but now after three months off of Latisse and three months on Smartlash, I am back to barely visible lashes.  What I thought was continued growth was just the residual from the Latisse.  So I will go back to the Latisse and use it as I did before - sparingly - and it still worked.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have never had long eyelashes and almost never wear mascara.  A friend recommended I use SmartLash and it is working like a charm.  My lashes are much longer.  I put on a little mascara yesterday and it looked like I had on fake lashes they were so long.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for 3 months day and night as directed and I will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Will continue  to purchase</li>
            <li> yes I like it , it does work but not as well as latish but it is also a lot less expensive</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  I&#x27;ve used Lilash and babelash, both of which were awesome and I saw incredible results in mere weeks! This doesn&#x27;t work and it burns your eyes. Never had that happen with the other two.</li>
            <li> working ok . just use for while then start fill off lashs . i have to use few days then stop for while</li>
            <li> First of all I have used Latisse for a couple of years because I had a battle with cancer and with chemo and I lost all my lashes  and Latisse saved the day and I love it. I have hazel eyes  and  they have never changed color, nor have my eyelids darkened, but I am meticulous in my application. Unfortunately last summer I was diagnosed with metastatic cancer and will be on constantly changing chemo protocols for the rest of my life.  Eight months back I lost all my hair, lashes, and eyebrows because of the chemo and it was hard adjusting. I created the look of lashes with eyeliner and became an  expert on creating eyebrows with an angled brush and powdered eye shadow.  My doctor couldn&#x27;t believe how good they looked and wanted me to give a class at the cancer center. Several months ago I went on a new protocol and my hair started coming back. But not my eyelashes,lower lashes or eyebrows, so  I started back on the regimen of Latisse which was great for my upper lashes, but it is contraindicated for lower lashes. No growth happened with my lower lashes or eyebrows.  I decided to try smartlash on my lower eyelashes and eyebrows and it worked.  My lower lashes are there and longer than I ever remember and my eyebrows have returned which my oncologist told me would probably not happen. Last time I saw him he wanted to know what I was using so he could recommend it to other patients. Maybe it works because of the oil but all I can say is my eyebrows exist, although the are a tad darker than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I really extend my usage of Latisse.  Despite the warnings, I use one brush and one drop which works for both eyes, but again, I am meticulous. Essentially cutting my cost For Latisse in half.</li>
            <li> I used Latisse, and Loved the lashes I got but Hated the red, itchy eyelids, which was bad enough to cause people to ask me what was wrong with them... not a good tradeoff... and it took about 3 weeks for the red to go away after I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been diligently using SmartLash twice a day for about 6 weeks, and just within the last week I do think my eyelashes are Very slightly fuller and maybe a smidge longer.  Very, very minimal, but it is enough to make me continue using it for another month or two.  If I don&#x27;t get more of an improvement, though, I will stop using it since the cost and twice-a-day application aren&#x27;t worth the improvement thus far, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  This product is a waste of money.  I really think any change for the better was imaginary.  I continued to use this product, never missing an application, and after 4 full months of using it, I saw absolutely no change.  I decided to go back to Latisse, and to deal with my red/itchy eyelids, after they initial daily-use period of about 3 months, I am going to go to a \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot; application of only applying it every second or third day.  Was told this worked well for people.</li>
            <li> Good product. Easy to apply. Really works!!</li>
            <li> I returned this one, did not look like the one they show.</li>
            <li> Definitely works and makes my lashes noticeably longer. I wear glasses and my lashes got so long it made it slightly uncomfortable, so I had to keep adjusting them on the bridge of my nose. Mascara looks amazing now, even with a cheap drugstore brand. Trying it out on my eyebrows and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working as quickly but I&#x27;ll keep applying. The thing is you have to be consistent or it won&#x27;t make a big difference. The price is right. I can&#x27;t see paying more than $20/container.</li>
            <li> The day after I started using this it had seeped into my eyes and caused them horrible irritation to the point of where it hurt to move them. Maybe I had an allergic reaction to it or something but it made my eyes hurt whenever I used it so I stopped. I DO NOT recommend if you have sensitive eyes like me</li>
            <li> Same great product as before at a great price.</li>
            <li> Use religiously with no results!would not recommend this product to anyone..Save your money on this one product as it was a failure&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I am surprised at how many people like this product. First, it only enhances the APPEARANCE of lashes, not actual growth. Latisse, a prescription product, causes actual growth but it also has side effects. Second (and most important), SmartLash has oil in it and the oil manages to seep into your eyes no matter how carefully or sparingly you try to apply it. It&#x27;s very irritating and doesn&#x27;t wash out with eye drops. You just have to wait until enough time and tears have washed it away (about a day). I think it does actually make your lashes look better (not make them grow), but it&#x27;s not worth getting the stuff in your eyes. Especially if you wear contacts (I don&#x27;t, so that&#x27;s not what made it hurt my eyes), I think it is not worth the irritation, redness, and tearing that it causes.   Definitely not recommended. But, if you still want to try it for yourself, don&#x27;t buy it here. It&#x27;s available for much cheaper elsewhere, as other commenters have said.</li>
            <li> I have been using Smartlash for a couple of months and have only noticed a slight improvement in my lashes.  I have also been using it on one of my eyebrows to lenghthen and in an area where no hair seems to grow.  I have not seen any changes in the brow area.  I am older, 66, but have very good skin and a youthful appearance.  I just wish my lashes could look \\&quot;younger\\&quot;, too :) Purchased from Dermstore so I did not pay a lot of $ for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (5/27/12) I am starting to see growth in an area of my upper lashes that was prevously bare.  I can also see a little more fullness in the eyebrow I spoke about before.  While my lashes are only a little longer and fuller, but I can definitely see an improvement!!  The slower growth might also be due to the fact that I am older.</li>
            <li> I used  smart lash for 3 months twice a day and got zero results. It didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes but it did absolutely nothing for me. I am African American and I have noted that the majority of ads have pictures of caucasian or Latin models.  I have a friend who is caucasian and she has used latisse and it worked for her.  We the consumer are wise enough to know that the models in these pics are wearing false lashes but still we are hopeful that we can at least achieve a result of about 50% of that look :-)  I wore eyelash extensions for almost 3 years and recently decided to discontinue that beauty routine. I enjoyed it for the time but it&#x27;s very expensive to maintain and in these tough economic times we can only afford our needs not our wants.  I&#x27;ve always had very sparse eyelashes. Luckily for me when I went back to my au naturelle look my skimpy lashes were still intact.  I will try other eyelash growth products and see if any of them will work for me. Who knows? Lol</li>
            <li> I used this product but it caused irritation - puffy itchy eyes.  I stopped and thought maybe it was allergies.  Once my eyes settled down, I began to use it again.  Once again, puffy itchy eyes.&lt;br /&gt;So trash can it went!</li>
            <li> If you want longer eyelashes&lt;br /&gt;1. Careprost once a day( I buy mine for $18 at med-cab.net)&lt;br /&gt;2. Make a conditioner for you eyelash to apply every night&lt;br /&gt;What I use&lt;br /&gt;Castor oil&lt;br /&gt;Almond oil&lt;br /&gt;Olive oil after I let it soak for a week with a organic lemon peel&lt;br /&gt;Argon oil&lt;br /&gt;Vit e oil&lt;br /&gt;Coconut oil&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba oil&lt;br /&gt;A little bit of fenugreek&lt;br /&gt;You can make your own with just castor and olive oil this are the two best when I make my conditioner I always put more of those two then the rest of them&lt;br /&gt;3. Clean your eyelash in the morning with green tea this cleans your hair follicles&lt;br /&gt;Also you can brush your eyelashes and you can trim them on a new moon&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had sparse lashes - they would literally fall out if I rubbed my eye slightly.  Since using smartlash, I can actually buy mascara and use it and not look like I have bald spots.  I now have fuller and longer lashes. I actually had to trim them because they kept bumping my eyeglass lenses.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work. But after using it faithfully for 2 months (two full tubes) there was barely any improvement, so there&#x27;s no point in continuing.  Too bad.</li>
            <li> So here&#x27;s the wild thing about this product - I had read that it can also be used on the eyebrows. As a middle aged woman with quickly thinning brows, I thought I would give Smartlash a try.  After six weeks of applying it, amazingly my eyebrows began to grow back in. As for my eyelashes, I did see a subtle difference in the lower lashes - but it was my eyebrows coming back that made me a believer in this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I can definitely tell a difference in the fullness of my lashes.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 4 months and noticed no growth or additional thickness. Will go back to Lilash though it is more pricey it works and is once a day.</li>
            <li> Works well for me, as long as you&#x27;re consistent in use. This product even filled out my over-plucked eyebrows. Retail is usually double the price!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks now and I have seen an improvement. The first week I kind of did it when I remembered and not regularly, but I saw a slight change after a week and decided to do it twice a day and on my eyebrows as well. It has been working. My eye lashes are fuller and my eyebrows are sprouting finer hairs in the bald spots. My eyebrows have been over plucked and I have trying to grow them back for years, so if this works to the full effect, it will be a blessing. I also used to have very long and full lashes, but now at 30, my lashes are a lot shorter and less full. I do wonder if this product works better for people who once had full eyelashes but with age have thinned out.</li>
            <li> I really like the product and do not have any irritation from it. However, I bought one for my daughter and she had to stop using it because it darkened the area under her eyes.</li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned, blonde haired gal whose lashes are pale to say the least. I purchased SmartLash in June in hope of fuller lashes, not necessarily darker. I was hoping my \\&quot;blackest-black\\&quot; mascara wouldn&#x27;t have to work so hard to give a full fringe of lashes. After two weeks I was starting to become skeptical, but I re-read the directions and it says, \\&quot;up to 30 day to see results\\&quot;. I have to say that yes, around the 30 day mark I was noticing my lashes were much fuller and longer...but not darker. Now, over 3 months later, I use it every other day and have much fuller and longer lashes than ever before. I had to be patient though. It did take at least 30 if not more to see a real difference and like I said, it didn&#x27;t make them darker. But, a person could dye their lashes to get the full, fluttery, flush effect if they wished.</li>
            <li> I gave it one point, only because it was required.  Do not purchase this product.  It does not work.  Claims that it grows anything are false.</li>
            <li> Great product, have been using it for a year.</li>
            <li> I have not seen real results and it&#x27;s been almost 3 weeks. I&#x27;ve tried other brands before and they worked better than this one. I&#x27;m going to continue to use it to see if I see any results, once finished, i&#x27;m going back to Double Lash or Latisse</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product first but after applying closer to my lashes every night for few weeks, others might not notice but I started to see a slight difference. My lashes getting darker and longer. After one month, I am very pleased with my purchase. It&#x27;s a wonderful product without any side effects. My eyelashes looked gorgeous after mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talking of side effects, I mistakenly ordered, the number one of this type, \\&quot;Rapid\\&quot;lash (4 stars from 1,046 customers) first. I thought it was \\&quot;Smart\\&quot;lash. Smartlash was highly recommended on Youtube and I wanted to buy Smartlash but when I searched in Amazon, Rapidlash got better number and I naturally thought it was Smartlash that I was looking for but obviously it wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I bought Rapidlash and mistakenly posted my good review, thinking it was Smartlash but it was Rapidlash, I was contacted by a very smart-savvy and health-conscious customer asking a question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Is this the new formula or the old one? I can see in the list of ingredients that it includes Isopropyl Cloprostenate, thought that was out in the new\\&quot; -Clara&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my research, Indeed, Isopropyl Cloprostenate was listed as \\&quot;beware\\&quot;. Although it is a FDA-approved drugs to lower intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients but comes with side effects, irritation, hyperemia, iris color change, macular edema, ocular inflammation, and interference with glaucoma therapy but what worried the most was that it is  prostaglandin analogs for ophthalmic use and are currently classified as Pregnancy Class C. meaning that there have been no human studies of the drug, but that animal studies have revealed some potential abnormalities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, I didn&#x27;t used Rapidlash but I still keep it. With many good reviews on Rapidlash, I am sure it works but I am very afraid to try...</li>
            <li> very satisfied. The eyelash growth formula works exactly as I&#x27;ve expected. This is my third time to purchase this same product.. Happy that quality is the same - perfect!</li>
            <li> I have been religious about application also. No stinging, no side effects, didn&#x27;t bother me in the least. Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t interfere - but!  I don&#x27;t see a whole lot of change, I\\&quot;m sorry to say.  I think there is a slight appearance of being fuller, but nothing I would pay for again.  I used it for almost 3 months.  I like writing positive reviews, but I am a little disappointed with this. I am wondering if another brand would work better?  Everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, so this didn&#x27;t work for me, but evidently it works for some.  I&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
            <li> I took a chance, but this does not work like other eyelash enhancers do. They may require a visit to a Dr. but it&#x27;s worth the time and money if you want more  lashes.</li>
            <li> I am Asian and, in my opinion, most of us aren&#x27;t blessed with long eyelashes.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10 days and already I notice a huge difference.  My lashes ARE longer - even in the corners.  I have tried other over-the-counter lash products, except for Latisse because of its side effects, and none have worked like Smartlash!  As far as price?  Ladies, you need to go directly to dermstore.com and look up Smartlash - the price is $29.95 and you can choose auto-fill to lock in the price.  Plus this product ships free.  I don&#x27;t understand why I keep seeing it all over the web for upwards of $70 or more.  Maybe Dermstore is doing some kind of promotion?  I don&#x27;t know, but that&#x27;s where I purchased my product.  Good luck and happy lash hunting!  Update:  Friends have told me going directly to dermstore.com shows the product for $100.  Google \\&quot;smartlash 29.95\\&quot; and when the dermstore.com link appears, click on it and it will take you to the promotional $29.95 price.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have the expected results, even after a month of use, and my eyes stayed irritated to the point that I finally gave up and tossed it in the trash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using Latisse for just under a year and my eyelashes were phenomenal.  But the stuff is crazy expensive; so I looked into alternatives. I decided to try SmartLash even though the reviews were mixed.  I&#x27;d say that about 5 weeks after switching, my eyelashes are almost as long as they were when I was using Latisse every day. I have to admit, Smartlash says to use it morning and night and I&#x27;m lucky if I can remember to use it once a day let alone twice.  This works so well that I have to move my glasses farther from my eyes than I would normally wear them, otherwise my eyelashes brush the inner surface of the lenses and leave mascara smudges on the glasses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a matter of fact, today my gal pal asked me if I was still using Latisse as my lashes looked so long.  I like the results from Latisse better, but at about 1/4 to 1/3 the price of Latisse, I&#x27;ll be using Smartlash instead.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at the start, but within a week I saw a difference in my lashes.....my mascara goes on so much easier and fuller as well....the only downside I found, is that after a month of none use, my eyelashes thin out again....Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product!!</li>
            <li> I was very interested in purchasing smartlash seeing how I use latisse and it&#x27;s very expensive, but after reading the reviews I think I&#x27;ll stick with the latisse. It has few side affects like it makes me look like I have eyeliner on and they say it turns your irises dark so far that hasn&#x27;t happened. I&#x27;ve been using it for about four years now. I use it for a week to two weeks and my lashes get long and lush and they stay that way then in about two to three weeks I start using it again to keep my lashes long and thick. If you use it every day it tends to make your lashes very, very long I wear sunglasses and it makes my lashes so long that they get caught up in the glasses. I wear contacts and haven&#x27;t notice any adverse reaction. I also have very sensitive eyes and skin but the latisse doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me at all, unlike what I have read about the smartlash. So for all you who have written a review thank you for giving me the heads up on smartlash!</li>
            <li> Have purchased this many times from The Derm Store and have been using this product for over two years. Zero side affects. Amazing results. I&#x27;m very happy. Definitely suggest it to all. Forget Latisse! The two don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> When I was younger I had such long eye lashes, but as I have grown older, I don&#x27;t know what happened to them.  Smart Lash has brought back my eye lashes, works great.</li>
            <li> Everybody&#x27;s different but it made my lashes longer and a little thicker so I was satisfied. Worth the money to me personally.</li>
            <li> I have been using smart lash since Aug and I see no results! I&#x27;m so upset it didn&#x27;t do its job they way it was suppose to. Do not waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a month and I love it. I saw results in two weeks and now after a month my eyelashes are so long that they touch my eyebrows! My eyelashes practically look fake but their not! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t worked as well as when I purchased it before.</li>
            <li> Wow! I see so many negative reviews on this site. But this product worked great for me. I&#x27;ve only been using it for two weeks and I can see huge results. I&#x27;m hooked. It&#x27;s too bad others didn&#x27;t experience the same. Dermstore.com has some deal on it. It&#x27;s a daily special and that&#x27;s how I got it for $29.95. But, not sure if it&#x27;s still going on. I would have never tried it otherwise. Way too expensive.  I gave it 4 stars because it does sting a little if it gets in your eyes.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this stuff! I have been using it for about a year. I honestly noticed longer lashes within two weeks of using it only once a day.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it in the mornings after putting on my pencil liner, eye shadow, &amp; mascara. I apply a thin line above my upper lashes. At first, I applied it right before applying my eye makeup when I was getting ready for work. I found that it does take several minutes to completely dry, so my eye liner pencil didn&#x27;t want to go on so well in a time crunch. After switching to using it after applying my eye makeup, no issues. Not sure if that would work the same for people using liquid liners.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I found is to make sure the brush isn&#x27;t too saturated when applying. It did sting a small bit when I accidentally over-applied and it seeped into my eyes a smidge. Pretty easy to figure out that more is not better in this case!&lt;br /&gt;Over the last year I have been purchasing it on another website because it was the least expensive, by a lot. For this purchase, the other website only offered an &amp;#34;advanced&amp;#34; formula that didn&#x27;t get good reviews from people that originally had good results from this original formula. I checked Amazon to see if the original formula was available. Thankful to see that it was available &amp; that the price had come down significantly from the last time I had checked.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed to see the negative reviews on Amazon. Like I said, it really worked well for me, but I do understand that everone&#x27;s body chemistry is different &amp; what might work for one person won&#x27;t work for another. I am so thankful that I have significant results. I love my lashes!</li>
            <li> Save your money; it did nothing.</li>
            <li> I found the fibers fell off onto my face, otherwise I like it</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two months now and after the first six weeks I noticed a difference in my lashes. My lashes have gotten so thin as I age that I had to use individual false lashes. I don&#x27;t have to do that anymore. I had lunch with a friend I hadn&#x27;t seen in about six months and she made a comment about how pretty my eyes looked and that my lashes looked so thick now. I used this product twice a day and I am about to order my second tube. I do have to say, that there are times when there is a slight stinging in my eyes but it goes away quickly. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin and I&#x27;m not susceptible to any kind of dermatitis, but two days of using this product gave me a horrible rash on both of my eyelids, which promptly went away after I stopped using it. \\&quot;The Doctors\\&quot; tv show featured it and Realage.com constantly pushes this product, so I suspect they have a financial investment in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this products for two weeks now so I haven&#x27;t noticed much changes on my lashes yet I will wait and be patient so we will see..I liked it because it doesn&#x27;t irritates my eyes or burning when it gets into my eyes I use it in the morning under my makeup and sometimes at night..</li>
            <li> I have always had a very few eyelashes, and since I have started using this product I have noticed an INCREDIBLE change. My eyelashes are thicker and fuller!  A little goes a long way with this product, and it is very easy to brush on a light application both morning and night.  I am so impressed that I am getting the results I have been looking for without a prescription or any weird side affects. Will purchase again as soon as I run out!</li>
            <li> I have tried other eyelash enhancement products in the past that worked great, but they left my eyelids looking slightly puffy and like I was wearing purple eyeliner. I know that seems strange and it didn&#x27;t really bother me until my mom asked me when I started wearing purple eyeliner. So I stopped using it and decided to try SmartLash (because once your lashes get full and long you can&#x27;t go back!). I have to say, I think SmartLash works just as well as the products I used in the past, but doesn&#x27;t leave my eyes puffy with a purplish tint. I did a little research and think it might be the prostaglandin in the other products that was causing my eyelids to puff up and turn purple. Clearly, I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> Smartlash worked best on my sparse eyebrows.  I noticed some improvement to eyelashes. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> BTW: This is KELLY EVERTSEN, ( Rob&#x27;s wife),  I have been using SmartLash for years now...I have had no side effects &amp; it has helped my lashes grow back &amp; stay, (with continued use), if I stop using it, for a period of time, I notice my lashes getting thinner in spots again.  So, for me, I think it works great &amp; will continue to use it, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!  Thank You SmartLash!  ;)&lt;br /&gt;KELLY EVERTSEN</li>
            <li> I used it religiously twice a day for five weeks and my lashes are as short and fine as ever.  It just didn&#x27;t work.  But if you insist on buying it, get it at dermastore.com for $30.  That is where I bought it, but since it didn&#x27;t work, it really wasn&#x27;t a bargain. [...]</li>
            <li> Sorry to say I have seen no improvement in my lashes. I have tried to be patient, using it once or twice a day for two months and lashes are the same. Wish it had been different.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim, but from dermstore.com, which sells it at a much affordable price. If it wasn&#x27;t that affordable, I&#x27;m afraid I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it; I couldn&#x27;t repeatedly spend the amount it&#x27;s charged for here on Amazon; way too expensive for me. Anyway, I previously tried Wet n&#x27; Wild&#x27;s MegaLash...I wasn&#x27;t as consistent but did see my lashes became more conditioned and thicker after time. However, I just really, really wanted them to be longer, and they didn&#x27;t seem to be doing that. I started doubting any lash product (that&#x27;s affordable, at least) could do that. I tried SmartLash and it proved me wrong; I&#x27;m Asian with short lashes and honestly am seeing a difference, and I haven&#x27;t even been that consistent with putting it twice but only once a day. I&#x27;m delighted and hope they&#x27;ll grow longer, though I&#x27;m still skeptical on how much longer they could grow since my lashes were so short to begin with; maybe I&#x27;ll return with an update! Like any product, I&#x27;m sure it varies with everyone. You just have to keep trying to see what works for you. For me, it helped to curl my lashes to really see if there was a difference in length without mascara. Otherwise, I don&#x27;t think I would&#x27;ve noticed as much. Curling did wonders.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t for me.  Used as directed twice  a day for 45 days!! No improvement at all.  I&#x27;m done!  Good price at DermStore, but not worth spending your money or time.</li>
            <li> Silly Me. I believed all the false advertizing. Don&#x27;t waste your money or your time on this product. It Does Not Work!</li>
            <li> ***Buyer Beware***&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product due to \\&quot;rave reviews\\&quot; on the DermStore website and it just does not work the way that it claims.&lt;br /&gt;What bothers me more than knowing it doesn&#x27;t work....is the fact that this company is falsifying reviews to con people into buying it.  Thankfully and hopefully people can read Amazon reviews before considering a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other products such as Rapidlash and it works much better for around the same price.</li>
            <li> This does not work. There are no ingredients in it to make it work. It is an exercise in futility to buy this.</li>
            <li> dosent work at all!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I first ordered from another company and then looked and found through Amazon.  My lashes were diminishing and now I have great lashes again.  VERY HAPPY with this product.  I will keep this item in my cosmetic cabinet.</li>
            <li> It is easy and works.</li>
            <li> This eyelash enhancer really works!</li>
            <li> I used this product religiously for months, and I didn&#x27;t see any difference at all with any growth or fullness of my eyelashes. I was very disappointed. I contacted the company, but they never responded. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Losing my eyelashes but this product helped them grow back and fill out!  Love it!  Love it! Love it! Buy it!</li>
            <li> I have been using for two months (twice a day)and have just noticed a change.  I am pleased but patience is required.</li>
            <li> I used this product a couple of years ago.  Why I didn&#x27;t continue is beyond me because it works!  My eyelashes (top and bottom) and my eyebrows had thinned.  I began using as instructed and within a couple of weeks saw a change in both upper and lower lash density.  To my great delight, my lower lashes (toward the out edges of my eyes) had tiny lashes to which my mascara could attach.  I also had re-growth of my eyebrows (again thinning of the outer brows began filling in) so I could fill in with brow pencil--not just draw on brow pencil.&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned, I was totally satisfied with this product, stopped using it, and now have reordered because my lashes have reverted to their thinned state.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day, and, I&#x27;m sad to say, that it did nothing for my lashes.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> But, I wanted to put this out there for people who are skeptical or not sure if they should try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lashes are naturally fairly long but have thinned out and seemed a bit brittle lately. After using this product my lashes have definitely improved. I will however, tell you that this did NOT take place overnight. I have purchased 3 tubes of this and used this product religiously for 3 months and it was only after that time period that I had a noticeable difference. So, the good news is, it does work, the bad news is, it takes quite awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BETTER NEWS here is, I saw online that someone used this on their eyebrows and they claimed it helped thicken them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have pretty thick eyebrows but after years of over-zealous plucking, they have not grown back. In fact, there was a time when I plucked them VERY thin (I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking.. I have no rhyme or reason) and unfortunately, because of this, I had a difficult time growing them back to a nice shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I tried using SmartLash Eyelash Enhancer on my eyebrows (twice a day, as instructed for lashes) and guess what? AFTER JUST 2 weeks I noticed a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if there are a lot of people out there who are in need of &amp;#34;thicker eyebrows&amp;#34; LOL but if you are like me, someone who over-plucked for too many years and would like to have their eyebrows thicker, this might work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not being paid by the manufacturer nor have I gotten any product for free (I only wish!). If you are having thinning eyebrow issues or have over-plucked and want your brows to grow, I would recommend trying this product. I wish I had more faith in it&#x27;s potential when I started because if I did, I would have taken a before and now, an after photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price isn&#x27;t the greatest but the product, for me, has been worth it as I have been tired of trying to &amp;#34;fill in&amp;#34; my eyebrow shortcomings. I had a particular spot where there was NO hair and now it is filled in nicely. Maybe they need to offer this product for people that have thinning hairlines!?!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one!  I ordered it by mistake, meaning to order Rapidlash.  After a couple of months of Smartlash, my lashes were back to what they were BEFORE using Rapidlash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it before one month and I don&#x27;t realize any changes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for twice a day for over a month now.  I can&#x27;t really say that I notice a difference but I will contiune to use this product until it&#x27;s gone.  Then again, maybe I was hoping for something that isn&#x27;t within reason.</li>
            <li> I have been using SmartLast for a couple of months and found it to work within the first seven days.  My eyelashes grew so long that I had to quit using it for a short period of time because they were \\&quot;really\\&quot; long.  I am a 70 year old woman so age shouldn&#x27;t have anything to do with the product working or not working.  Please remember to \\&quot;shake\\&quot; the container before you use it \\&quot;everytime\\&quot;.  I even used it on a little area on my head where my hair was getting thin and it worked there also.</li>
            <li> its woooork .!&lt;br /&gt;thanks so much&lt;br /&gt;i just started from one week and im in the second week its work!</li>
            <li> No improvement noticed, but I realize I get what I pay for.  I tried it based on price -- I should have known better.  Quality products generally are not cheap.</li>
            <li> I ran out and went 1 month without it and could immediately tell I needed it back. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a little over 2 weeks now. I have faithfully applied to base of eyelashes as directed by manufacturer. As of this point in time ,I have not seen any new growth, not even a stubble!  Waste of money</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, and since I lose my eyelashes, I depend on this product.  I have tried other brands but they are not as good.</li>
            <li> what a waste of money. Tried for 2 months with no results..  Would not recommend this to anyone!!  Terrible product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised there are so many negative reviews--- I started using this product with very little expectations and it has surpassed them! My mom actually bought it for herself and it didn&#x27;t work well for her but it might be because I&#x27;m younger and/or my hair is not as fine. I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge improvement in the lashes but they definitely seem longer however I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE difference in my eyebrows! The tail ends of my eyebrow have always been sparse and I have to pencil them in however since using this product for a month I no longer need to pencil them in! I&#x27;d say this product is definitely worth a shot for eyebrows if you are younger and your hair isn&#x27;t super fine or light. I have light skin and hair but fairly coarse eyebrows. For the price I&#x27;ll buy again when I run out!</li>
            <li> This product is complete rubbish. The reviews were all glowing so I subscribed to the product for monthly delivery, I used it religiously as directed. I went through four bottles with absolutely no change to either my brows or my lashes. I went back and re-read the reviews and I am getting the feeling that they were mostly written by the same person who is trying to promote the product, shame on me for not catching this earlier before investing time and money. I have since cancelled my subscription. I believe I will take the plunge and go get a prescription for Latisse which I know is guaranteed to work.</li>
            <li> I am going to try this product on a bare spot on my lower lash line, so please forgive me for posting prior to trying the product. I will update with my results when I have tried the product for two months. I say two months because the time it takes for an eyelash to grow is up to 8 weeks. If you&#x27;ve tried it for less, then you are not being persistent enough. It&#x27;s not a mascara which makes lashes look longer by coating them. It is a product made to encourage lash growth, which can take up to 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> I definitely see some growth since using this. Lashes are longer, but not as full as I&#x27;d like. I noticed the change after 4 weeks of twice daily use. I&#x27;ve cut back to 3-4 times a week, once a day. Maybe my lashes would be fuller if I kept it up. It does sting if you get it in your eyes, but a few blinks and it stops. Mine is not oily as another reviewer posted- so I wonder if I have a different formulation.</li>
            <li> Bought two 0.16 oz., and was disappointed due to the lack of growth and/or volume to my lashes. I used Latisse before, so far, no other product has come closed to it. I&#x27;m still searching for a product like Latisse which produces similar result but minus the price.</li>
            <li> This product did not work as I&#x27;d hoped. I have used it morning and night for over a month, and my lashes have barely grown at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and have always had great success.  I&#x27;ve noticed longer lashes within 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The price is right for me, too!  I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who desires longer lashes!</li>
            <li> So my wife bought this eyelash enhancer and she couldnt stop telling me how much it really works. I know that women need more explanation than that. But Id rather paraphrase and say that it worked.</li>
            <li> It absolutly works! amazing results in 3 weeks! I guess everybody has different reactions, but I&#x27;m very pleased with the product!!!saw some results in just a week...will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this product I thought I had gotten ripped off because nothing was happening.  I was getting frustrated because it seemed like I was losing lashes instead of growing them!  Then I realized that I had changed mascaras and the new one was harder to take off at night.  I think the combination of the mascara and the make-up wipes I was using was just drying out the eyelash area.  Back to my regular mascara and using SmartLash every night before bed. (I never bothered to use it during the day)  Low and behold, after about 2 months of consistent use they were beginning to get longer.  Now, 4 months later they are thick and long like they used to be when I was a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that this products lasts a long time.  I am still using the first tube but it will be time soon to order.  I went on the website where I had first purchased it and was shocked that it had gone up from $29.99 to $125!  Thanks to Amazon, I&#x27;ll be saving some serious money on my next tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be patient and just use it consistently and you will see the results.  Not as fast as you might like but they will come!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It really works. I love it! My lashes started growing in 4 or 5 days .</li>
            <li> Great service!  Great product!</li>
            <li> is a scam, does NOT work. you can however ask your primary care physician for a prescription to regrow your eyelashes &amp; eyebrows which has been approved by the F.D.A.</li>
            <li> Darn. Really saw no difference. Used as directed for three months.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product like this for a long time as my lashes seemed to be disappearing. One day I came across a listing for SmartLash on Amazon and decided to give it a try. The results are amazing. After completing use of one tube, I have noticed my lashes are longer and even seem fuller so that met my expectations and then some. The best part about the prodduct is the price. I was able to buy three on Amazon for the price of one when I looked elsewher. On top of that after purchase it arrived in no time. Found this product so pleasing I am not afraid of making additional purchases in the near future.</li>
            <li> Love, love this smart lash growth serum!&lt;br /&gt;My lashes are twice as long as when I first started the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;If you need to grow lashes, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If you use it twice a day, it really does work.  I&#x27;ve applied it slapdash and noticed little hairs on my eyelids!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews but, I had to find out for myself that this product doesn&#x27;t work. Sorry, but it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was going through chemo and I thought it would help me not only keep from losing my lashes but help them grow long - like one of the social workers I met who used a lash treatment and had AMAZING lashes. (I figured one is as good as the next, right?) The chemo I was going through is not a hair loss type but my hair was thinning. I used Smartlash diligently, except the week I was in the hospital, and I have noticed no difference in my lash thickness or length. I am very disappointed to lose out on so much money ( I bought two tubes on groupon) for a product that wastes both time and money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month, it was bought for about $13 on a Groupon.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, my lashes look a bit fuller, but I wonder if the product has some sort of glue in it, because I have lost almost no eyelashes since using it, and that is fairly atypical.&lt;br /&gt;For the minimal results I would say save your money, especially at this price.</li>
            <li> Love it, it does help my eyelashes grow. Recommend it . That&#x27;s all I have to say about that. Ok.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I could definitely see a difference and would still be using it if I were not having a problem with sinuses. I will begin using it again as soon as the sinus problem is over.</li>
            <li> Absolutely did NOT work for me. I applied it properly but showed NO difference, no improvement in lashes.</li>
            <li> so, I have been using smart last for a little over 30 days.  I told myself that I was just going to finish the bottle &amp; if I didn&#x27;t notice any change, I would not buy another.  I checked every day with my face pressed up close to a mirror...are they getting longer?  are they getting thicker?  Then I relaxed a bit &amp; just kept applying morning &amp; night.  I am also using Rogaine for Women to hopefully help my thinning hair (I am 45 years old).  Each application bottle of that lasts 30 days.  A few days before starting a new bottle of Rogaine, I swore my lashes looks longer &amp; less sparse.  So I went back to purchase another bottle of SMARTLASH &amp; found that the reviews from dermstore.com made mention of customers seeing a difference after 28 days...so YES...that is EXACTLY the time-table.  They are in fact longer &amp; a wee bit denser.  Hopefully the results will continue..i hope, i hope, but if this is the best result I get, it is still worth it.</li>
            <li> I started using this product a few weeks ago and I am obsessed!! I actually hate wearing mascara on a  day to day basis and since I have started using SmartLash, I really don&#x27;t think I need mascara anymore. YAY!My lashes weren&#x27;t too short to begin with but I have definitely noticed that they have gotten longer and way thicker over the last couple weeks. I&#x27;m really excited to ditch my mascara and have lashes that look awesome all on their own:)</li>
            <li> After reading some of the ridiculous reviews and suppositions here, I had to create my more informed and balanced review.  I have used this product for over a year.  It does make MY lashes longer and thicker BECAUSE the product keeps my eyelashes from falling out so quickly.  My eyelashes then have a chance to get a little longer and a little thicker.  It will NOT give you eyelashes you do not already have.  It also will NOT make your eyelashes darker, this product is not designed to do that, it does not have any dye in it and the liquid is clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be a little irritating if it gets in your eyes but here&#x27;s how you prevent that:  after shaking the product every time you use it and pulling the applicator out of the container, swipe some of the product off the skinny brush (I find two swipes work well) using the inside edge of the container opening.  This, for me, leaves enough product on the brush (I can feel the cool liquid along the margin of my lashes) yet does not apply so much that it drips in my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me repeat:  This product will NOT DYE YOUR EYELASHES.  This product will NOT GIVE YOU NEW EYELASHES but will only allow the existing lashes to grow a little longer before succumbing to their natural cycle of falling out and growing back in. This is what makes your lashes a bit thicker and longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyebrows:  Yes, it works for eyebrows, too.  Once again, it will only work with what you already have AND if you did extensive plucking (which was the fashion when I was younger) it may not help that situation all that much.  Often once a hair follicle is damaged it will not produce any more hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And naturally, it will not work for every person.  I have a friend who has a habit of pulling her eyelashes out.  This is like repeatedly plucking your eyebrows; the follicle may get damaged and this product may not work for a situation like that.</li>
            <li> Ive been using SmartLash for 6 months now and I have definitely noticed a difference with the length/thickness of my eyelashes. They look fuller and I&#x27;ve noticed that they don&#x27;t break/fall out as much as they did. This product may not work for everyone, but using it once in the morning before putting on my makeup and at night before I go to bed, has shown results.  My lashes are longer, but I&#x27;ve also noticed that my lashes are stronger and fuller (especially my lower lashes), which is something I didn&#x27;t expect.  I am very pleased with the product and will continue to use. Also, I wear contacts and it does sometimes run into the eyes, but I haven&#x27;t experienced the burning sensation some people are talking about or the oiliness that remains behind.  The product dries within seconds.  The only issue I came across from daily use was during the first couple of months, my lash line did itch quite a bit, but I attributed it to new growth (I&#x27;m prob wrong). I once in a while will get the itchiness on my lash line, but it occurs so infrequently and only for a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I order my SmartLash through dermastore.com since its cheaper and the auto-delivery is convenient. It took close to 2 months before I started seeing results. It does get expensive if you continue to use and order monthly.  So good luck to anyone wanting to give this a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found where to add to my comment:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read that people are applying Smartlash directly on to their eyelashes. I apply mine on my upper eyelid as close to the lash line as possible (where you would line liquid eyeliner) and under the lash line on my lower lids. It dries within seconds, which is why I am confused why people are applying it to their eyelashes. Also make sure your purchasing the real thing. Have a great day!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 and a half mos. Im sorry to say it has done nothing. I was hoping for good results because I have used Latisse and it really works. But, unfourtunely it is a little pricey.SmartLash is much cheaper, but did nothing but waste my time.</li>
            <li> This was the third similar product I tried.  I started with RapidLash and THOUGHT I saw a difference, but it wasn&#x27;t enough to make me sure it wasn&#x27;t just in my head.  Then I tired Ardell Growth Accelerator (don&#x27;t waste your time/money).  I got the SmartLash at a discounted price through Groupon or Living Social and figured it was worth a try.  I had long but sparse lashes, and this definitely increased the volume of lashes, whether by plumping the individual hairs, making me grow more hairs, or preventing existing hairs from falling out as quickly, I don&#x27;t know.  I also NEVER left the house without using brow filler before this, but I barely need the filler anymore since I seem to have no more tiny bald spots in my brows.  I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a month, and after the first couple of weeks, I cut back to only once a day.  So far, I&#x27;m loving this and am just about to buy my second bottle.</li>
            <li> This works really well.  For me, it makes my lashes longer.  Not thicker.  But I do have people ask me if I am wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> I admit I was skeptical and reluctant to try this product, but I decided to try it anyway.  I have to admit I am pleased with the results after about 5-6 weeks of using it.  I have also stumbled upon a heated eyelash curler and between the two products, I can&#x27;t believe the results. Everyone&#x27;s chemistry is different, so obviously the results will vary, but this stuff worked for me.</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money.I used this lash enhancer twice a day for three weeks and did&#x27;nt see a change at all!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Saw results almost immediately!</li>
            <li> I am almost 50 and my lashes have become sparser and thinner over the years. My 50+ girlfriend recommended this product and I&#x27;m glad she did. It did take a LONG time to fully see the results (over 2 months). My lashes now have the fullness and length that I had 20 years ago. I never had super-lush or super-thick lashes before, and I still don&#x27;t. HOWEVER, there is a dramatic and noticeable improvement compared to what they were like before. I am very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Application is easy and it is now part of my morning and nightly routine.</li>
            <li> I am a 62 yo woman with very sparse lashes :&#x27;-(  I&#x27;ve used SmartLash for about 6 weeks and just the other day noticed that my lashes are longer, and I haven&#x27;t even been applying the product correctly!  I learned from online reviews that I should shake the applicator and apply it twice daily (thank you, those who read the instructions).  With just once daily application and no shaking my lashes are longer.  They are not fuller, but longer.  There are some shorter ones coming in, so maybe with time they will be fuller.  I used Latisse with excellent results, but it&#x27;s expensive and a nuisance to apply with a separate, disposable brush for each eye and a squeeze bottle of Latisse solution.  RapidLash did not give as good a result as SmartLash. I&#x27;ll start using SmartLash on my eyebrows, too.  [[ASIN:B003H897AQ SmartLash Eyelash Enhancer 0.16 oz.]]</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than a month and there is no change in my eye lashes.</li>
            <li> Kay2008 is great!!! She shipped promptly and followed up via email to make sure I had a positive experience...very nice touch...</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my eyebrows were thinning and after using it just once a day for the past 3 months, the thin areas are filling in. I also run the brush over my upper eyelash base after I put it on my brows, just to use up the rest. I have noticed that my eyelashes are not falling out as often and they are getting longer and fuller. I think the people who are seeing no results may be failing to shake it before using or they may have some type of lotion or makeup residue on their skin. I was skeptical at first, but this stuff really works and I&#x27;m not even using it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that my lashed actually grew after about 2 weeks of using. It doesn&#x27;t grow as long as the other well-known products that&#x27;s out on the market ... but for the price ... you get what you get.</li>
            <li> This does not grow lashes. That said, I&#x27;ve purchased it 3 times so it isn&#x27;t all bad.  I use it twice a day and I&#x27;ve found it strengthens the lashes I do have as well as helps the lashes keep their curl from the eye lash curler.  Compared to the price of other things out there, it&#x27;s not a bad price. There is probably something better out there, but I don&#x27;t want to waste any more money looking.</li>
            <li> This is awesome and I saw results very quickly.  I had lost a lot of eye lashes and length to a severe eye infection and my eyelashes were stubby and short.  After using this product and Physicians Formula Organic Mascara, I now have long eyelashes again!  There is hope for us ladies!!!  Try it, you wont be sorry, money well spent!</li>
            <li> The product is definitely good, but it´s quiet expensive. $100 dlls is just too much. Add the cost of other beauty products and you´ll be broke before you know it.</li>
            <li> I am flabbergasted that so many people like this product. I used it exactly as directed for several months (morning &amp; evening) and I think my lashes are worse now. The prescription stuff (forgot the name) does work and I&#x27;ll go back to it.  Can&#x27;t believe I wasted my money on this product. Don&#x27;t waste yours!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product that is going to give you those extra long, fake looking lashes that resemble a black fan, forget it.  You might want to go get lash extensions for that.  Or if you have dark eyes and want to spend the money, maybe the prescription lash enhancer is good for you.  All I wanted was lashes that did not break as easily or pull out as easily when removing make-up and this really fits the bill.  My lashes are longer and thicker but that is because they fall out less often and so they have a chance to grow longer.  They are very healthy and with a coat of mascara I have had people ask me if I have extensions.  I put this stuff on (like eyeliner) every night before bed.  I don&#x27;t want to run the risk involved in the prescription stuff (I have light eyes) and I also don&#x27;t want to spend that kind of money.  This tube lasts for months and makes my lashes look great!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, no results, feels like and looks like water, I will continue to use it even though it has done nothing so far because of the costs.</li>
            <li> I have very thin and short lashes so I purchased this for first time beginning December last year after trying other name brands, its been over 10 weeks since I started the regimen with SmartLash and I barely see any results even if I was religiously following the use instructions, another thing, it stings my eyes and makes my eyes water all day...of all the name brands I&#x27;ve tried, Lashipix worked the best for me followed by Jan Marini, they&#x27;re just more expensive, but then why pay, even if its cheaper for something that doesn&#x27;t even work? This is my opinion on the eyelash enhancer use...</li>
            <li> SmartLash seems to add growth, but it takes about 3 months to actually see results.  I also read on here that other reviewers are experiencing oil from the product irritating their eyes, I have experienced this as well and it doesn&#x27;t wash out easily.  I&#x27;ve used other products such as \\&quot;Revitalash\\&quot; and that one is more expensive but it seems to work faster.  Not my favorite product</li>
            <li> I used SmartLash when it first came out and loved it.  I couldn&#x27;t believe all of the negative reviews on Amazon! Then I thought to check how many of the reviews were written by verified purchasers. As of this moment, out of 36 4- and 5-star reviews, 19 were by verified purchasers.  Out of 38 1- and 2-star reviews, only 4 were by verified purchasers!  I will definitely order SmartLash again. I just thought other would-be purchasers should be aware of this.</li>
            <li> This product does not work! Don&#x27;t waste your money. I have been using it for three months now and there is no difference.</li>
            <li> Have been using this religiously for over a month with no perceived change(s) in lashes or brows.  Have used prescription Latisse in the past with good results, but wanted to avoid the itchy eyelid swelling and redness it provoked.  This simply is NOT working - there should be something visible by now, but nothing whatever.  Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking with this until the container is gone, but after 4 weeks - totally following directions - I don&#x27;t see a bit of change. So OK, I&#x27;m 69! - but I was hoping for at least a bit of new growth. On the other hand, my friend who recommended it (who is 65) saw changes after just 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are growing so far but I don&#x27;t see them getting thicker.</li>
            <li> I have lived with short stubby lashes all my life! I&#x27;m very happy to say that I have had excellent results.  My lashes are almost twice as long!  I wish others who may use it get the same results as well.  Also, I am a legitimate review.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes with this product having so many great reviews. I even bought it for my friend who is loosing her eyebrows due to hypothyroid.  I used it on my brows and lashes for a month and really didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all.  Not and increase in length of either, no increase in thickness of either.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are pretty full and healthy and I wanted them just a bit longer but after 2 months of faithful twice a day daily use...nothin&#x27;.  I didn&#x27;t miss one day either.  I started on January 1st, 2013 so it would be easy to keep track.  It is now March 10th and I have had no results whatsoever.  Zilch!  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and fell for the hype, too.  I also figured if it was advertised on the Doctor&#x27;s it had to be a good product.  Wrong.  I have been using this faithfully 2x a day for almost 2 months on both my upper and lower eyelashes and also my brows.  I have seen NO change what so ever!  No longer lashes, no thicker lashes and no new growth of brows.  I am very disappointed.  However, I am grateful that I didn&#x27;t spend a ton on this, I got it off of Derm store for under $30.00. Also, the more I read, the more I agree,  the other sites that show all positive reviews are a bunch of BS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Latisse before so I know when an eye lash enhancer works. I used SmartLash until I finished the tube and I did not see a single difference in my eyelashes. I wouldn&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this product...it&#x27;s cheaper than the prescription brand *but that one actually works...but there were no results, and it burns if you get it in your eyes. Avoid it!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my lashes after 4 weeks.  I will spend the money on Latisse next time</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.  It is totally ineffective and I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It took a while to notice that my lashes were longer.  I don&#x27;t notice that they are fuller, but that&#x27;s okay, since I can actually see my lashes now.  A few lashes now grow longer than others.  I didn&#x27;t really have a lot of hope this would work after I singed the lashes on one eye while barbecuing.  I take a pretty heavy dose of thyroid medication and lost virtually all of my eyebrows a long time ago.  I started using this product between the age of 66 and 67.  My eyebrows have begun to grow in some areas, but not as well as the lashes.  I also use SmartLash on my lower eyelashes and they are also longer, but not thicker.  I think this is a good product for me.</li>
            <li> I gave it as a gift to my daughter. She&#x27;s so excited because it works, her eyelashes are longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think this would work. And it seemed like a dumb thing to spend money on, but I was bored and feeling adventurous, I guess. After a week and a half, my lower lashes looked much less sparse. After two weeks, even my husband admitted my lashes looked longer. Three full weeks completed and family members and perfect strangers are commenting on how great my eyes look. With mascara, the results are especially noticeable. I realize I saw results much faster than usual, and maybe I was just lucky, but I&#x27;m sticking with SmartLash.</li>
            <li> (Full disclosure: I did not purchase this through Amazon.  I came in intending to, but saw an ad from an external website that was considerably cheaper, and decided to try it from there.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not purchase this thinking I would get a miracle, so I cannot speak to what it will do for someone who is young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was young I had long, thick lashes (that were, unfortunately, quite light, but still...).  Through the years, they had gotten sparse and not as long.  Then I had cataract surgery in the middle of menopause, and somehow the combination of the two laid the remaining lashes to waste (also my hair and fingernails, but that is another story.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lashes were brittle, and they no longer had a curl to them-- short, straight stump lashes.  I was not happy at all.  I kept waiting for them to grow back, but they weren&#x27;t doing it, so I decided to give this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like the looks of the product at first.  It is not a serum (which I was expecting) it just looks like water.  You apply it to the skin above the lashes (I use it underneath, too) and the first time I used it, I got it everywhere, including in my eyes, which did not feel real good.  I quickly learned to pull the wand out and wait for a drop to work its way down to the brush, then wipe the drop off.  It dries fairly quickly, and then you can put on your makeup without its interfering with the application.  After it dries, it is like it is not even there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it twice a day for a few months (one tube lasts a very long time.  I think I am on tube #3, and have been using it for two years.)  For a while, I didn&#x27;t notice much of anything, then notice that the curl was back in my lashes, meaning they had been growing past the point where they had been breaking off.  Frankly, that was good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept using the product, but I only got around to doing it one a day.  I don&#x27;t even use it the same time every day--either in the morning or before bed, depending on my mood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice that my lashes had gotten significantly longer than they were until I got a pair of bifocal sunglasses and they were annoying me because my lashes were touching them.  So I went home and gave them a closer inspection.  They are like they were when I was younger-- they are long, with a nice curl...but, unfortunately, still as pale as they ever were, so the mascara people will still be getting my business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know if it will work well on someone who always had sparse, short lashes.  I am sorry I did not track the progress to tell you how long it took, but it wasn&#x27;t instant, it was gradual over a period of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it did work, and work quite well for me, so I would recommend it to others, at least to give it a try for a few months.  It doesn&#x27;t work overnight, though, so if you are impatient, save your money and buy a set of false eyelashes.  If you are willing to wait, though, you might be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. :(. Waste of money and time using it. After 2 months of using it twice a day....nothing. Sucks</li>
            <li> I used this eyelash &amp;#34;enhancer?&amp;#34; for several months (6)  with absolutely zero results.  Not a good value so don&#x27;t waste your money.  The adage if it seems too good to be true is SO TRUE with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last 2 weeks and have noticed absolutely no change in my eyelashes.  They are still barely there.</li>
            <li> Saw product highly rated in a style magazine.  Thought I would try.  Saw a difference within 2 weeks.  Liked so much I started giving as gifts.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me, and I was shocked, because I had read so many good reviews here and other places that it worked, worked, worked!!! Well, now that it hasn&#x27;t worked, I&#x27;ve come back to re-read those reviews. I have found that there seem to be a few that are authentic good reviews, but there are also a lot on here and dermstore.com that are written on the same day or within a day or two, and are written in the same style. 3-4 sentences, same grammar, same style punctuation, slightly different story, but by a very excited person who says it works. Go back and look and you&#x27;ll see what I&#x27;m talking about. Generally when reading reviews there is a wide variety of spelling, and comments, not so with this product. So, I guess I think it&#x27;s a conspiracy now...oh well...but I do. I think a lot of the good reviews were written by someone trying to push the product. I will continue to use it until my bottle is out, and will update if there is some change. But just wanted to point this out to everyone that is considering buying this product.</li>
            <li> I pick at my eye lashes when I get tired so the more I wear mascara the more lashes I lose - I know bad habit. Anyways I decided to try this to help grow them back for my upcoming wedding and also fill in my eyebrows. After two weeks of using it morning and night with little to no results, besides normal growth in my eyebrows I decided to cut back some and try to make the bottle last longer. I have been using it for almost 2 months, once every other day or so. My eyebrows are double the thickness than before. My left eye has a ton of new hair that are shorter than the rest, my right doesn&#x27;t have nearly half that amount. My theory is that I sleep on my right side so the product may be getting rubbed off. This week I have been putting it on in the morning to prevent this. Overall I am happy with the results on my eyebrows. Eyelashes could use some improvement but time will tell. I am from Canada and had to buy this on ebay as no one else would ship it here, so if anyone knows of a better place - please post incase I decide to buy more.</li>
            <li> I will start by saying I have decent lashes.  They are not beautifully long or thick, but they are decent and not horribly sparse.  I have naturally curly hair so they naturally curl upwards slightly and I do not use an eyelash curler (I know- lucky, right?)  My cousin used Latisse and that really worked, she had gorgeous lashes! But it is expensive and you run the risk of your pupils taking on a brown hue... since I have hazel eyes and don&#x27;t want them to turn brown I decided to try this instead after reading reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the gel stings my eyes if I get it into them, but then again so does soap.  I am very VERY careful, I don&#x27;t use too much product, and I apply it at least 2, sometimes 3 times a day.  After 2 weeks I thought maybe, just maybe they were longer.  Then around the one month mark, one day I noticed that a quick coat of mascara now looked like 3 long coats of mascara!  So it worked!  When I close my eye I can see the lashes are definitely longer and thicker.  There are not more of them, but they are looking good and I will continue to purchase this product.  I wish I had taken before and afters to post.</li>
            <li> I love this product! The issue is that you have to give it time. It took a good 3 months of use before I saw results. Your lashes are NOT just going to appear. It takes time to grow length. This gives length, but not volume. It doesn&#x27;t claim to give volume either. I noticed those who dislike it, have not given it more than 3 weeks to 2 months. I&#x27;ve been using this now for a year &amp; have wonderful long lashes. I also use on my brows &amp; it&#x27;s helped with that as well. GIVE IT TIME!</li>
            <li> This has to be the biggest ripoff ever. I followed directions,twice a day, I see NO results&lt;br /&gt;I got royally ripptoff&lt;br /&gt;Save your money Trust me, it is not worth it</li>
            <li> This Smart Lash really does work. I now can feel my eye lashes touch my eye brows and I am 54 years old now. WOW</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I ordered this product, I had used Latisse, but it was too expensive, but it worked, my lashes were so long they hit my glasses, w/ your product my lashes have gone back to normal, need to curl them &amp; use lots of mascara so they can be seen. I have made sure my lashes r clean &amp; I apply twice a day w/ no good results. Very disappointed. jane</li>
            <li> My doctor prescribed the very expensive Latisse to satisfy my vanity!  When I found out the price I decided to live with short, sparse eyelashes.  Then Dr. Oz said that this was a good product so I tried it.  After my daughter confirmed that my eyelashes are indeed longer and a tad bit thicker, I ordered a second tube.  I have been using it twice a day as directed and am very satisfied with  SmartLash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t spend the full retail amount for this product because it doesn&#x27;t work. I got it on Groupon for $25, wish I read reviews first before I purchased it. I have been using this product since September, day and night and have not seen any results. My eyelashes are exactly the same as they were. I would rate it 0 stars if I could. I hate wasting money and I hate people who take advantage of consumers. This product should be pulled off the market. Definitely a scam..........</li>
            <li> Worked amazing for me! I had gotten semi permanent lashes for my wedding and when they finally came off weeks later I almost cried. I had NO lashes. Well ordered this and within a week I had lashes again!</li>
            <li> After 5 weeks, I could not look in the mirror and see a difference until I put on mascara, and then I could see that the mascara had more and longer lashes to rest on.  Seems to work, just not as dramatically as the advertising indicates.  But I am buying another tube.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few weeks.  I feel it may be strengthening my lashes and not falling out. So in that case its improving the appearance. Also my brows are better again \\&quot;strengthen\\&quot;. So its okay.  Don&#x27;t expect thick long lashes as stated in commercials....not going to happen. In my opinion of course for Me!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happen with all the people who wrote a bad review. In my experience in almost two months using this product I see a BIG difference in my lashes... I love them now!!!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as it stings your eyes . Rapid lash is way better ...</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product over latisse. I saw faster results with a lot less irritation to my eyes. Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet if I&#x27;ll like it or not. Not very complete instructions with it. Not sure if it will even work. I&#x27;ll see . . . .</li>
            <li> My daughter &amp; I are both on our 3rd tube of this SmartLash and it is working for us both.  Longer lashes and thicker growth.&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any problems with irritation and if is does somehow get into my eye (rare event) it doesn&#x27;t cause any problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;Like any product, maybe it&#x27;s not for everyone but we are satisfied with our results.</li>
            <li> This product Definately did noT work. It appeared to have been tampered with. It seemed to be nothing more than water.</li>
            <li> works faster than I expected!</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my lashes nice &amp; long &amp; when on occasion I&#x27;ve had a few fall out, this product fills those lashes in rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been using it on my eyebrows, especially the two weeks before my wedding I used it religiously since I had overplucked.  It&#x27;s very convenient to keep in my makeup bag in case I forget to apply in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using smart lash for 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this product.  People are always asking me if I&#x27;m wearing lash extensions or what mascara I use.  I am 56 years old, my lashes aren&#x27;t what they were when I was younger, but with the help of smart lash they are!!!</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!  Does not work at all.  It is too watery, and it gets into your eyes and it BURNS. I hate throwing things away, but this went right in the trash.</li>
            <li> After using Latisse, I thought I could maintain the growth with this product.  Not only didn&#x27;t that work, after 1 tube of SmartLash I&#x27;m almost back to where I started before I started using Latisse.  Back to Latisse for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my eyelashes and eyebrows and it&#x27;s been about two months.  It works pretty great! Noticible difference. :D</li>
            <li> not as prescribed, not worth it&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x60;t notice any different&lt;br /&gt;not good at all, hope not to buy it</li>
            <li> I purchased SmartLash hoping to see a difference from my scarce lashes to fuller, possibly longer ones.  I&#x27;ve seen no improvement whatsoever; so I am disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> The problem is the stuff doesn&#x27;t work don&#x27;t waste your money. The shipping and everything was fine but the product is no good</li>
            <li> I bought this product on special just to try it our and it TOTALLY works!! my lashes are longer &amp; stronger.  Great alternative to the prescription products.</li>
            <li> It really works.  My eyelashes are longer and the cost is much less than the other product you get at the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 2 months and no change.  I really don&#x27;t like the oily residue that goes into my eyes too - no matter how careful I am, it always gets in there and blurs my vision.</li>
            <li> I have used other products for eyelashes and could see no results from this one. I will go back to my original product line.</li>
            <li> Gee, another hype and did that for almost 2 months.  It says I&#x27;ll see results in 30 days.  BS! I used it for nearly 2 months with no results :(  I rest my case finding one that really works. Oh and the \\&quot;awesome\\&quot; reviews here...  ding ding ding! &#x3D; suspicious.</li>
            <li> I work for an Opthamologist. The prescription drug that we hand out, Lumigan, has a side effect where the eyelashes grow fuller and longer. None of the ingredients in Lumigan (sodium chloride,sodium phosphate, dibasic,citric acid,water,sodium hydroride,hydrochloric acid and BIMATOPROST) are listed in Smartlash. Do not buy this--it is a hoax. Ask your doctor if you can get your hands on a sample of Lumigan (they will often give it to you for FREE), pending that you do not have high interocular pressure.</li>
            <li> I have been using Smartlash for over 8 months religiously.  I have been following their directions exactly.  I am so upset to have waisted so much money all these months because my eyelash look EXACTLY THE SAME!!!!  Zero difference!  Do not waist your money on Smartlash!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week now and I am already seeing a difference.  My lashes are longer than they were last week, they are darker and seem fuller and definately have a pleasing curl to them.  I read the reviews and I make sure to shake the bottle before each application.  That seems to be a very important key to using the product successfully.  Ladies, we must shake the product before applying to get results (so they tell me).  Additionally I have not experienced any eye irritation whatsoever.  So far, so good.  If that changes I will update, but for now, I am very pleased with the results of this product!</li>
            <li> I was diligent night and morning for two months on clean eyelids before I began to see a difference in length on one eye of about 1/16th of an inch, a little less on the other. That&#x27;s about 20% increase in length. That is noticeable by me, but not others, but \\&quot;you get what you pay for.\\&quot;  No change in lash count, no darkening or increase in hair thickness.  Actually, I&#x27;m reasonably happy, but will buy a more expensive brand when it runs out.  The DermStore site exaggerates I think, so have realistic expectations.  Only a few will get the big results.</li>
            <li> I am used to quick results from Revitalash and Latisse- This one does not irritated but does not perform, either.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I think it works better then the lash enhancer I bought at the spa for 5 times the money. I only use it once a day and my lashes have never looked better.  I will continue to buy Smart Lash.</li>
            <li> This is day 8 of using SmartLash for me. Just to be honest, I have been applying it more than directed, usually 3 or 4 times a day as opposed to the twice daily recommendation on the package. My lashes are very long anyway, but they were thinning out on me after I turned 40. WOW!! I can already see the volume returning to my lashes, especially my lower lashes. I have also been applying to my brows and they have shown tremendous results already. I like that there are no side effects (other than growing lashes/brows) unlike the leading prescription lash enhancer. I noticed there are people on the reviews of this product who were not very satisfied so I will just say that for my lashes and brows this product is a panacea. It&#x27;s worth a try even if it only works a fraction as well for you as it did for me. Excellent product that delivers on it&#x27;s promise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on week 3 of using this twice a day.  So far - NOTHING.  I have 2 tubes and will finish them, but unless there&#x27;s a miracle, I won&#x27;t be buying more.  If results change, I will revise my review.</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of great reviews from this product, so I bought two at dermstore.com where it was less than half the price.  After I used Latisse, I used SmartLash, and I haven&#x27;t had a single compliment on my lashes since.  I&#x27;ve been using the product religiously for months on most nights and mornings.  I always had compliments when I used Latisse when strangers didn&#x27;t know I used Latisse which I also used for months.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give SmartLash only one star is because I think my  top lashes aren&#x27;t as short as before Latisse meaning that the SmartLash could have given some length.  After I finished Latisse and went straight to SmartLash, my lashes shrunk dramatically because I stopped the Latisse, but Smartlash helped prevent them from being my short pre-Latisse length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Latisse isn&#x27;t used on bottom lashes, but SmartLash can, this was a way for me to determine if they really lengthened my lashes because I know it wasn&#x27;t affected by Latisse&#x27;s magic already.  I can honestly say NO, SmartLash didn&#x27;t grow a bit for my bottom lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side effects are mainly the awful stinging pain, itchy/red eyes, and causing some sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Hello, for the people that this didn&#x27;t work, there could be a possibility that you are not getting the original product. Ive read some reviews in the past of other products where the seller is not selling the original product and just mixing it with water or another solution to make more product. This worked wonderful for me and I do need to give it 5 stars. In 2008 my eyelashes started falling off because I&#x27;ve been using excessive mascara everyday since maybe 1997 and the eyelash curler. My regular eyelashes are really long, full and beautiful. I was sad to be missing partial of my eyelashes and they seemed shorter and would fall of easily. I tried everything to fix this problem, I went from not using the eyelash curler or any mascara for several months and no luck, the eyelashes will grow on its own but very slowly and once I would apply mascara or curl my eyelashes they would fall off again. It was embarrassing having a huge gap of missing eyelashes on both eyelids. I went from having a full set of beautiful long natural eyelashes to no lashes where my friends were constantly asking me what happened to your eyelashes or why don&#x27;t you wear falsies. Well I&#x27;m not a huge fan of fake stuff or falsies, so i tried everything from applying oil to my eyelashes, to buying various promising brands at the local drug store like cvs, rite aid, walgreens, nothing worked, just a waste of maybe 20 dollars each time. One time I was browsing through &amp;#34;Groupon&amp;#34; and I saw this eyelash tube for like 29 dollars, it seemed promising, I said why not. Ive been using this ever since, my eyelashes grew back to fuller, they are thick again and long. I started using mascara and the eyelash curler daily again and when i do people think I&#x27;m wearing falsies. I stopped using the product after a few months and my eyelashes are strong, not falling off and still look gorgeous. Within 7 days I noticed a difference, the eyelashes grew back. Honest review. I am not affiliated with any seller oranybody, Im just an honest person that likes to post reviews on products that do miracles and really work.</li>
            <li> love this product I have used it  before and this is a repurchase for me...it works when you stay true to application.....yeswill buy again</li>
            <li> Not really sure if it does anything, but a good conditioner.</li>
            <li> I bought three bottles of this (better price if you purchased more) and have been using it religiously twice a day.  However, there hasn&#x27;t been any change in my eyelashes.  What a disappointing product and waste of my money!</li>
            <li> It takes awhile to see results with this stuff, so I&#x27;m still waiting.  I had more satisfying results with Rapid Lash but will give SmartLash more time to work.</li>
            <li> I have heard the good and bad about this product. If any one can answer this question that is currently using this and have been for well.  Questions are listed below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How long did you use the product before you start see  any results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you have any reaction for example; rash, swelling, infection, irritation, redness etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once they start growing, did you have to continue using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you stop using the product, will your lashes stay long or will they break off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you have to use this product for the rest of your life to keep the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really didn&#x27;t have a review on the product yet, but they will not let me asking any question with a review.  So, I put okay for the support of the other viewer.  Will rate a true review once I start using.  So I really don&#x27;t have a personal review, but I couldn&#x27;t say any bad without using it.  If you have any answers for my questions, please respond.</li>
            <li> Got an email containing info on Smart Lash.  i have tried other products that have worked, my favorite is Rapid Lash. For me I did not noticed a difference with Smart Lash.  I have hardly seen any lash growth and my brows almost nothing.  Good luck to you, it did not work for me.  I will go back to Rapid lash.</li>
            <li> I already had pretty good lashes to start but wanted &amp;#34;more&amp;#34;.  I used Latisse  for about 4 months and got longer, fuller lashes.  But Latisse was getting very irritating to my lids. I did not want to lose may lashes (which happens when you stop Latisse) so I tried this product and it maintained my long lashes for about 6 months.  So I use Latisse when I notice I&#x27;m losing lashes and then give my lids a break from the irritation by using this product as needed.</li>
            <li> No changes!  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I do not see a difference</li>
            <li> works well though price has gone up a lot.  noticed definate improvement in lashes as to length amd density within a few weeks</li>
            <li> I have purchased three of these products thinking that maybe it was just taking longer since I am older or whatever....in other words I definitely gave it a chance.  The promotions made it sound like a great product at a good price.  I followed directions and never missed a time throughout all these applications.  The only thing I noticed is that maybe my lashes weren&#x27;t falling out as quickly.  That&#x27;s about it!  I also was using it on my brows hoping that it would help fill them in-nothing!  I am suspicious of a product working so well on some and not at all on others-it doesn&#x27;t make any sense.  I wish I had my money back!</li>
            <li> It stung my eyes so I could not continue to use it long enough to see if it worked.  If you have sensitive eyes pass.</li>
            <li> I tried Smart Lash on the promotion on \\&quot;The Doctors\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Even as a mature woman, I have decent eyelashes but my eyebrows are&lt;br /&gt;quite sparse after the arch.  I tried Smart Lash morning and evening as directed&lt;br /&gt;on the skin at the lash line and on my eyebrows.  I was religous about this protocol for 2 months.  There was no change. I think I got better results with Rimmel&#x27;s lash enhancer and their lash enhancer mascara.  Would not recommend</li>
            <li> I used this product for two months and saw no change in appearance or length. Apparently it works for some and not for others.  It&#x27;s a hit and miss thing if you want to risk your hard earned money.  I gave it one star but it really deserves a zero. I get better results applying mascara.</li>
            <li> This did NOT work.  Don&#x27;t even try it, they should NOT be in business selling this product, as it is a gimmick!  SAVE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> Do not buy. This is a Waste of your money. This stuff does nothing. Sorry I bought it. Bad bad bad</li>
            <li> Bought this with groupon(still not cheap). I&#x27;ve used it for over a month, am and pm, and see no difference.  Even with mascara, no difference.  Still short and thin. Have one tube left and would love to return it!  Ulta&#x27;s rapid lash did a little and was way cheaper.  Would not waist your $$$</li>
            <li> No instructions came with this.  I thought that you just use it like eyeliner, but if any gets in your eyes, it burns like hell.  I was a little worried that it would cause damage to my eyes because it did burn so bad, but withno paperwork, I didnt know.  Seems to be ok though.  And it does seem to increase my lash length.</li>
            <li> I have just purchased this through a Facebook offer at Dermstore, and I have never used it before. I have VERY short VERY straight eyelashes, and thin eyebrows. I&#x27;m going to try it on both and post photos so we&#x27;ll see if it actually works. I&#x27;ll post photos maybe once every 2 weeks and we will ALL see if there are any results. I will update when I start using it.</li>
            <li> The only thing that grew for me with this was my anger... at how much I spent for junk that does absolutely NOTHING but empty your wallet.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Been using this for two weeks and I like the fact that it is easy to apply, does not irritate my eyes and I think I am seeing a difference already.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but I do see a big difference in my eyelashes. I took a picture of my eyelashes before and after and sent the pic to my family and everyone is using it. You have to apply it twice a day. Take the mascara off before you go to bed leaving it on can cause your eyelashes to break.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of a friend. I bought two of them and started just before Christmas 2014. I&#x27;ve been using it day and night since then and I barely see any difference. I&#x27;ll finish up the second tube, but I won&#x27;t purchase any more. Maybe it works on others, but not for me.</li>
            <li> My daughter got me a tube of Smartlash as a gift because I kept complaining that my eyelashes were becoming sparse and short, with a bald spot!  All my life my lashes were one of my best features - if I put two coats of mascara on they looked like fakes. I have been using it faithfully twice a day and my lashes have filled in and are getting longer!  Applying mascara is no longer a chore and I don&#x27;t have to fill in with liner. My brows are filling in too, after many decades of over plucking. I have sensitive skin AND I wear contacts but I haven&#x27;t had any bad reaction at all. I have a suspicion that some of the bad reviews were written by another company (or more) trying to get people to not buy Smartlash!  I swear that no one asked me to write this nor do I have any connection to the company that makes Smartlash. One more thing...if your eyelashes have always been short and/or sparse you might not see as much improvement as I have. You might need Latisse.</li>
            <li> I have been using roughly 10 days and I am starting to see some results.  So a big thumbs up so far, will write in about about 2 weeks what the status of my eyelashes are.</li>
            <li> The first bottle seemed to work great, so I bought 3 more.  After a few weeks though, I either got used to the new look so much that it didn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything or the product stopped working.  I&#x27;m honestly not sure which it is.  I think i will use up what I have and then try Latisse.  I&#x27;m bummed because it was really fun for the couple of weeks that it worked!</li>
            <li> I have used this product this past year and it really lengthens your lashes and fills in your eyebrows. Easy to use and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> Some days I have Dry eyes. My lashes are definitely longer and thicker. I noticed results in a week.</li>
            <li> This product worked for me. I had people comment how thick my lashes were and if they were fake. I did have leakage of the tube and it ran out. It could have been my fault. I got a deal on Latisse and thought I would try it as a comparison. It is only day one but I can say the application process with SmartLash is much easier.</li>
            <li> It did not do a thing . The box came all messed up , wondering if I got a bad batch.  I used it faithfully but nothing . Now using another product and its working very nicely. Sorry to say but it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This one much better than the others!</li>
            <li> I switched from rapidlash to this hoping it would do the same thing. Absolutely waste of money. Not that it burns my eyes and caused a lot of irritation and pigmentation around my eyes, I can see my good results from rapidlash drop to nothing. My lashes are worse than they did before I used anything! If anything this product does, it&#x27;s shrink your lashes and make you waste your money on this.  NEVER buying again and wish I could get my money back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and I can already see the differences. My eyelashes used to be all at the same length, but now I can see 3 different lengths mixed together (some newly grown ones are shorter than my old ones; half of my old ones grew longer than the rest of the old ones.) I&#x27;m Asian so I don&#x27;t have very full eyelashes to begin with, I guess that&#x27; why it&#x27;s easy for me to see the differences. However, I have very fine eyelashes and the newly grown ones are very fine too. Therefore, others may not be able to see the differences unless I put mascara on to darken the color of my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;I give it a 4 star because the formula irritated my eyes when I accidentally put too much on.</li>
            <li> I purchased this more in hopes of filling in some bare spots in my eyelashes.  It did not work for that, but my lashes are definitely longer.  SO, if length is what you are looking for, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd order of SmartLash.  The stuff really works for me. My eyelashes have filled in and have gotten longer. My first tube which I got from another source is lasting over 60 days. The price here was very good.</li>
            <li> Was not Happy with this products container, I opened the package everything has leaked through the container, and everytime I opened more of the liquid would come out . I only had this product for 10 days and there&#x27;s nothing left, it all leaked out</li>
            <li> I love being able to &amp;#34;lengthen&amp;#34; my lashes, without &amp;#34;glueing&amp;#34; on lashes that fall off in random order.  This works for me. Not so $$$ and not so labor intensive. I&#x27;d rather use Eyelash Enhancer AND NICE mascara...no fuss...no muss....nice every day!! I am in control. No tell-tale &amp;#34;missing eyelashes&amp;#34;, if you know what I mean!!!</li>
            <li> Nothing-no change after 2 months except burny eyes when contacts are in. Bummer is I thought I was getting such a good deal I bought two. Don&#x27;t bother!</li>
            <li> I have used Latisse before and had great results, but at $140 a tube, it just did not work within my budget. I stumbled upon this product through a Groupon offer and loved it. My eyelashes are comprable to how they were after 2 months of using Latisse for a fourth the price.  I don&#x27;t even wear mascara now. I use go bare and use an eyelash curler.  I am on my second bottle now.  Great stuff and I highly recommend for all women who want longer and thicker eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Only been a month but it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> I bought this and then tried another more expensive brand....Smart Lash in my opinion was a better buy in results.</li>
            <li> I guess I fell into the hype and decided to give it a try. But it&#x27;s a scam. It didn&#x27;t work even though I followed the directions exactly. It has been two months and I&#x27;ve seen no difference.</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice a day for 30 days and have seen absolutely no change at all. I had read good reviews and saw it on the Doctors TV show, which is why I ordered it but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my eyelashes needed help. I am glad I stuck with it.  This product does what it says it does. My lashes are thicker and a little longer, not a dramatic difference. Just enough for me. I never really had thick and long lashes to begin with. So ladies stick with the product and don&#x27;t forget to shake it.</li>
            <li> Used it for two months and I couldn&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
            <li> I have been using Smart lash for about 2 months and have noticed my lashes are thicker and slightly longer.  I did notice that if I didn&#x27;t use the product as prescribed my lashes went back to their thin and stubby selves.  The product did not work on my eyebrows.  I have used latesse in the past, great product worked like a charm but a pain since you need a prescription for it and also a little concerned about the possibility that my eyes would turn yellow.  Smart Lash is a safe alternative.</li>
            <li> what can i say, it works. its just a fact.  and if your eyebrows need some filling in or just needs to be fuller, it works there also. enjoy your long lashes, from a woman who used to have dinky lashes and have thicker and longer ones now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this didn&#x27;t work for some people but it definitely worked for me. I noticed a thickening in my lashes after about a week. I also have very sensitive eyes and had no issues with this product.</li>
            <li> I tried the SmartLash eyelash enhancer for around two months.  I did not see any change at all in my eyelashes or my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Does what it says-makes lashes stop breaking and creates new growth. Excellent product.  Hopefully this product will continue to be made affordable.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to get Liz Taylor lashes, you will disappointed.  If you want a 50% improvement on what you have then you will be happy. What I got was longer and moderately thicker lashes.  Before using SmartLash, I had long eyelashes, but of varying length and thickness.  I also had a bare spot from a waxing that went wrong years ago.  After 1 week, that spot filled in and my lashes thickened.  After 3 weeks most of my lashes were about the same length and I have more of them.  At the 5 week mark I haven&#x27;t seen a considerable difference from the 3 week mark.  I was hoping for a bit thicker lashes, but I am very happy with the results I have received.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying twice daily for 10 days and I&#x27;ve already noticed results. I&#x27;m Asian and started with very few and thin lashes. They are now fuller and longer, not tremendously but enough to get excited about. Can&#x27;t wait to see the progress in 30 days.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a better option than Latisse because it doesn&#x27;t affect colored eyes, but it was a big waste of time. I used this for months and nothing changed! I used 3 similar types of peptide eyelash enhancers and the same thing. NOthing. The only stuff that really works is the bimatoprost and those in the same catagory. After using Latisse for years and knowing it really works Im going back to it but being more careful not to get any in my eyes. The generic only runs around $40.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because it was suggested on Dr. Oz to be the best for it,s price. I have been using it with another product( which ran out) &amp; alone smart lash does not make them thicker or longer</li>
            <li> I have been using Smartlash for a few weeks now. I have followed directions to the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;. I have not seen any difference or growth with my eye lashes. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from dermstore at first, 39.00 on special ( it is listed now for 125.00).. anyway, after 3 weeks of 2x day, I noticed thicker longer lashes, where I used to use 2 coats of mascara, I only use one quick one, also, I used it on my brows which are sparse, I think it works, hard for me to tell, but the woman who does my brows noticed a difference.. I am happy with this product, not a lifechanger, but I definately noticed a difference.  I am careful with application because it can sting if it gets in your eyes, but quickly wears off</li>
    </ol>
