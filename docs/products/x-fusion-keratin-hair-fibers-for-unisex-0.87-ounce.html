            <li>Thanks for a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I really liked the Toppix but wish it didn&#x27;t have sufates in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I own a hair salon and was hesitant about these &#x27;scalp hiding&#x27; products.  </li>
            <li>This product is so easy to use and does a good job concealing bald spots.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for my very fine, thinning , Snow White hair.</li>
            <li>This one costs a bit more, but it lasts longer so it comes out in the end with the cost difference.  </li>
            <li>Also It  would be better if there was&lt;br</li>
            <li>But maybe it would be better to spring for the Toppix since the clumping factor occured?</li>
            <li>I like it better than Toppik.  </li>
            <li>It seems to cover better and stay more even, whereas Toppik would tend to get a patchy look by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>so glad my beautician recommended this product -</li>
            <li>It is okay.</li>
            <li>Love this for my senior women who may be sparse</li>
            <li>I the top.  </li>
            <li>this is easy to apply, just tap it over your part, and it vanishes.  </li>
            <li>I have platinum/white hair, and the white fiber just blends in beautifully.</li>
            <li>but the description was accurate.  </li>
            <li>The product is good if you are  not too sensitive , it causes sever itch.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle some on the right places and I have fooled so many of my friends...</li>
            <li>Makey styles look extra nice!</li>
            <li>It works amazingly well and actually give my hair more body.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>I guess my shipment must have been in a humid situation since I really have to shake the box and even pound it on the counter in order to get a free flowing product.  </li>
            <li>I have been so happy with this product and only wish i would have known about it years earlier.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have with this product is the  holes on top are not large enough for powder to  dispense easily, .other wise is a good coverage for very thin hair.</li>
            <li>I ordered the large &#x27;white&#x27; color that my supply didn&#x27;t have available.  </li>
            <li>Really disguises bald spots on my thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>I chose this rating because i really like the product - I</li>
            <li>I have been using it for over a year and a half and love the ease of use altough</li>
            <li>A few clients were buying another brand and it was pretty cool.  </li>
            <li>the holes on the bottle make it less user friendly than competitor Caboki.  </li>
            <li>When applying, be sure to use the sprayer applicator and hold it at least 6\\&quot; away from the scalp.  </li>
            <li>Use gentle back and forth motions (as in spray painting) and don&#x27;t overdo.  </li>
            <li>A true blessing for those older or exceptionally thin haired.</li>
            <li>products are made by the same company and have the exact same ingredients so there is really no reason to buy the more expensive Toppix.  </li>

            <li> Really disguises bald spots on my thinning hair.  Love it!  Just wish I had found it years ago.</li>
            <li> XFusion is the best concealor product on  the market.  I have been using it for over a year and a half and love the ease of use altough the holes on the bottle make it less user friendly than competitor Caboki.

I have been so happy with this product and only wish i would have known about it years earlier.</li>
            <li> I found this product surfing the net. This product is so easy to use and does a good job concealing bald spots. Thanks for a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> The product is good if you are  not too sensitive , it causes sever itch. Also It  would be better if there was&lt;br /&gt;more  variety in color.</li>
            <li> I had tried Toppix previously and thought I&#x27;d try this product since it was so much less expensive.  After receiving X-Fusion Keratin Hair fibers, I noticed it didn&#x27;t &#x27;sprinkle&#x27; as well as the Toppix.  The instructions tell you to keep the product in a dry place.  I guess my shipment must have been in a humid situation since I really have to shake the box and even pound it on the counter in order to get a free flowing product.  I really liked the Toppix but wish it didn&#x27;t have sufates in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both products are made by the same company and have the exact same ingredients so there is really no reason to buy the more expensive Toppix.  But maybe it would be better to spring for the Toppix since the clumping factor occured?</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin due to illness, this gives me confidence to leave the house</li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested this product and I found it here for a lot cheaper than anywhere else.  It works amazingly well and actually give my hair more body.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for my very fine, thinning , Snow White hair. I couldn&#x27;t  do without it. The body and scalp coverage is so great!!</li>
            <li> I own a hair salon and was hesitant about these &#x27;scalp hiding&#x27; products.  A few clients were buying another brand and it was pretty cool.  Then, my supply house began to carry the XFusion.  I bought just a few different colors and started using them on my thin-topped ladies.  They get hooked immediately!  This is a great retail product for your business!  It is a great value as well.  You can even custom mix colors for your clients.  When applying, be sure to use the sprayer applicator and hold it at least 6\\&quot; away from the scalp.  If you hold it closer, you will soon realize the air pressure generated will blow the powder away from what you are covering.  Use gentle back and forth motions (as in spray painting) and don&#x27;t overdo.  They will LOVE it!  A true blessing for those older or exceptionally thin haired. Won&#x27;t mess up your pillowcase and washes out with ease.  Men like it too!  I ordered the large &#x27;white&#x27; color that my supply didn&#x27;t have available.  Was worried about the picture as it is not the product pic but the description was accurate.  The correct product was shipped.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be put off by the previous review...this is easy to apply, just tap it over your part, and it vanishes.  I have platinum/white hair, and the white fiber just blends in beautifully. You can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s there, but somehow the pink scalp is gone!</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the X-Fusion Keratin Fibers gray color.  My hair isn&#x27;t totally white, but when I use the gray fibers alone it is too dark.  This is a good product.  I like it better than Toppik.  It seems to cover better and stay more even, whereas Toppik would tend to get a patchy look by the end of the day.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My hair has been thinning for years, and I thought I&#x27;d have to get a wig, or partial wig now.  This product is the best! No wig needed! Sprinkle some on the right places and I have fooled so many of my friends...they all think I have &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; hair&amp;#34;! The biggest benefit, though, is that it gave me back my confidence when out in public. I&#x27;m not fretting over my scalp showing through anymore...and I am a woman. My daughter has the same problem (guess it&#x27;s genetic) and she is much younger, so her confidence level was already low when being out in public. She also loves this product.</li>
            <li> This product delivers what it promises for women and men whose hair is thinning. I have recommended it to friends and family and my hairstylist.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Actually fills in areas to make hair look fuller</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because i really like the product - I a m so glad my beautician recommended this product - I know a lot of people are using it.</li>
            <li> I have used this on myself and my husband. It is okay. Nothing special. Seems to help a little but not like I was hoping. It seems like it should work so I will probably try another brand next time and compare results. Would not reorder this one.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this product is the  holes on top are not large enough for powder to  dispense easily, .other wise is a good coverage for very thin hair. Sometimes irritate the scalp.</li>
            <li> Love this for my senior women who may be sparse I the top.  Makey styles look extra nice!</li>
