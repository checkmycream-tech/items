            <li>I would highly recommend this affordable purchase you will have a great time changing your looks for beautiful lashes.&lt;br /&gt;cb of Palo Alto, CA</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind doing that, they&#x27;re perfectly comfortable and look great.</li>
            <li>These lashes are amazing</li>
            <li>This bundle is truly amazing for performers.  </li>
            <li>Amazing deal-</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>This was an amazing buy.</li>
            <li>70 lashes for $15 Is an amazing deal I just want to know if I should buy this product</li>
            <li>Regarding the crisscross pair, I wanted to let everyone readingknow that when I received mine, the hairs were nicely crisscrossed</li>
            <li>however they were kind of stuck/clumped together</li>
            <li>However, after opening the box and seeing the amount i received and the variety, I was thrilled.</li>
            <li>I liked them</li>
            <li>I even used some of the thinner lashes to make my own bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>Nice assortment of styles.  </li>
            <li>Let be honest here..</li>
            <li>This eyelashes looks nice</li>
            <li>Such great quality and variety, for an awesome price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very picky about my lashes, I will explain to you my version of the perfect lashes.</li>
            <li>I kind of like that these are plastic</li>
            <li>They have a nice gloss to them.</li>
            <li>They have this band along the lashes that doesn&#x27;t look that nice.</li>
            <li>The set was nice.</li>
            <li>Nice price.</li>
            <li>nice variety of styles</li>
            <li>These are nice eyelashes, well packed and presented.</li>
            <li>but I saw so many good reviews here on amazon and YouTube</li>
            <li>The choices were nice, but some of the lashes ripped because they were glued to the plastic.</li>
            <li>(keep a q-tip handy for eye watering) because once water touches the glue your screwed.</li>
            <li>the drug store kind exceeding 4 dollars.</li>
            <li>Everything came in nice packaging and nothing was damaged.</li>
            <li>It nicely divided to service 3 females-</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very well made, don&#x27;t fall apart and look awesome.</li>
            <li>BUT the are nice and look nice.</li>
            <li>The variety in this pack is also nice.</li>
            <li>for to the eye nice also.</li>
            <li>Love love love the bundle of eye lashes I have to get another bundle soon!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very experienced with lashes, so that&#x27;s also why I am giving them this high of a rating.</li>
            <li>Obviously not the best quality, but still really great lashes for a fabulous price!</li>
            <li>so when theyr on your eyes they may bother you but if you use a good glue with good technique you shouldnt have a problem- saved loads of money on this its exactly what i was looking for thank you!</li>
            <li>They were of very good quality and honestly you really can&#x27;t beat that deal.</li>
            <li>I love them because i have many options and they are good quality</li>
            <li>It is very easy to put on.</li>
            <li>These break very easily.</li>
            <li>some were more adventurous than others, but there were lashes for everyone!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know how much more than 2 applications because I have so many to try now!</li>
            <li>The variety is nice, but like I said, very cheaply made. &#x27;</li>
            <li>I wear lashes just about everyday when I go to work or just to go out, they are PERFECT and they are reusable which is good too!</li>
            <li>Easy to bend which means easy to apply and they stay on great.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re fun during special occasions of course since they look awesome in pictures.</li>
            <li>I liked that was able to buy these lashes in bulk but some of them I could not use.</li>
            <li>nice my daughter love the choices</li>
            <li>the best style that stay on the longest is the natural looking one.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so nice to have so many</li>
            <li>but they look natural and great for any day use!</li>
            <li>but after you apply it, I&#x27;m sure no one really notices, so it still looks great! :)</li>
            <li>i saw some reviews that these eyelashes were cheap and also some reviews that they were good quality</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying this brand, I thought it was a good price for what you get, but if you&#x27;re expecting good quality lashes</li>
            <li>The ones that were good though were pretty darn good.</li>
            <li>I love these lashes, they are the best I have ever purchased, comfortable, easy to fit on my eye.</li>
            <li>They look great on and after a bit of adjusting them they disappear/blend right into my lashes.</li>
            <li>Easy choice either pay $15 for a pack of five or $12 for a pack of 70!</li>
            <li>70 pairs makes it easy to rip off, toss, reapply eyeliner and then touch up my mascara if I still want to party the rest of the night!</li>
            <li>Shipping was very quick considering that I ordered on a Saturday!</li>
            <li>Can easily reuse!</li>
            <li>and im grateful that i got 70 pairs of unique good quality  lashes.</li>
            <li>The product was received on time, good condition, great price, but I didn&#x27;t like the product quality...not soft, did not work well.</li>
            <li>The best by far .... I would recommend these to many....</li>
            <li>This was pretty great.  </li>
            <li>I found this great deal and was willing to give them a shot.</li>
            <li>Love them...easy to apply if you&#x27;re experienced with putting on lashes...also easy to clean and reuse</li>
            <li>This seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li>so i ordered these, 70 pairs for $15, sounds to good to be true huh?</li>
            <li>They look very cheap.</li>
            <li>, thats all i can say, and very cheap compare to a $6 ones that you get at stores</li>
            <li>Do not buy them very cheaply made. &#x3D;</li>
            <li>These are high quality and gorgeous!</li>
            <li>and I was thrilled they were so easy to use.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t need to be amazing quality to look fine on camera.</li>
            <li>Again, at a quarter, I&#x27;m totally happy and will certainly be re-ordering.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THEM AS ALWAYS</li>
            <li>took them out of the box, and I think I&#x27;m already in love :)</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re way better quality than I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t believe I was able to get these many pairs of lashes at such a great price!  </li>
            <li>I love the many choices.  </li>
            <li>I love them for this purpose at this</li>
            <li>I love the look ....</li>
            <li>Love my eyes...</li>
            <li>there were many types I would not wear but for the price</li>
            <li>I am going to buy again! :)</li>
            <li>Love the variety of lashes....</li>
            <li>but obviously a spoolie will work perfectly) and ran the brush over the lashes while they were still adhered to the sheet.  </li>
            <li>I tested it out with a crisscross pair and it makes these lengthy lashes much more wearable.  </li>
            <li>(BTW using my husband&#x27;s Amazon account to purchase) :) DK</li>
            <li>i really ilke them and great price to ...</li>

            <li>I also use a pair more than once and extend it to 4 uses before it starts to unravel when I peel the eyelash glue off.  </li>
            <li>(Although, for hygiene purposes I would throw a pair out if you have worn them 5 times or more...).</li>
            <li>I would love to buy these again when I run out.</li>
            <li>I love the way these lashes feel.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve re-used one pair three times already and they hold up better than expected.&lt;br</li>
            <li>dont try to use lases more than once.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy this product again, but I won&#x27;t have to for a while since there&#x27;re sooo many sets in this box.  </li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, but for the price, I&#x27;ll just buy another box. :)</li>

            <li>but I look cute in them</li>
            <li>Love the variety and quality.</li>
            <li>If you do manage to get them off of the packaging they come in, you wont be able to use them because they will be so misshapen that they dont allign with the curve of your eyelid.</li>
            <li>Well, surprisingly enough, they are the best lashes I&#x27;ve used yet!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>

            <li>BUT THEY ARE DEFINETLY THE CHEAP KIND</li>
            <li>(most lashes need to be trimmed to size anyway) and they are not the quality that you can get at Sally&#x27;s or Walgreens.</li>
            <li>Most of the lashes that I apply are used once and thrown away so</li>
            <li>Bought some for my daughter and myself and we both love them.  </li>

            <li>I have worn lashes for many years - the quality is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>She and her clients are quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>The more you use one pair</li>
            <li>Hope this review helps some of you :)</li>

            <li>It makes my eyes appear more awake and more youthful.  </li>
            <li>These lashes makes your eye make up stand out more.</li>
            <li>These are awesome, especially for someone who needs to be able to practice putting on lashes.  </li>
            <li>On top of that it took me a while to get the hang of it</li>
            <li>Finally, you don&#x27;t know what style will look best on your eyes until you try it.</li>
            <li>I love my lashes and love the variety.</li>
            <li>I think everyone need to buy, and will certainly be satisfied</li>
            <li>While these lashes are OK-- I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li>I love the thickness of the strip.</li>
            <li>Even better price.</li>
            <li>My clients even love these.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>

            <li>so many compliments.</li>
            <li>was able to reuse a couple.</li>
            <li>For sure, when \\&quot;putting on my face,\\&quot; I am satisfied with shadow, eyeliner and mascara.</li>

            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>Omg I love love love these lashes.</li>
            <li>Such a great deal for the price!</li>
            <li>it was great to see lashes at such an affordable price, however it&#x27;d be good if the lash quality was better.</li>

            <li>So awesome with so many different styles.</li>
            <li>I will be getting more of these for sure.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I love the variety that you get with this eyelashes</li>
            <li>I model, and they are ok for photo shoots.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Lol, not that I go out in goopy mascara, but you get my point:)</li>
            <li>Love all of them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>They are awesome and you get several choices which is neat.</li>
            <li>but most I wont be able to use on anyone..</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed the more conservative looking lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had them on for a week already and love them.</li>
            <li>The price is great on these and shipping was fast.</li>

            <li>Love these lashes</li>
            <li>Love the styles in the box.</li>
            <li>i love wearing lashes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s will make your eyeliner blend better.</li>
            <li>You probably won&#x27;t be able to curl them either.  </li>
            <li>This is a great buy due to getting a great price on so many lashes as well as getting so many types and styles of lashes.....</li>
            <li>but they are very good other wise.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with how quickly the package arrived.</li>
            <li>I received them fast and they are just like the photos!!!!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!!!!</li>
            <li>today was very excited.</li>
            <li>Opening this package I was very excited to see what I purchased for my friend for Christmas.</li>
            <li>i was very excited to get it in the mail...</li>
            <li>Overall very nice!</li>
            <li>and I lost most of my eye lashes so this will be fun!!  </li>
            <li>I try to look for lashes that are comfortable, but these are so inexpensive, and really made quite beautifully and</li>
            <li>I thought it was a great deal and the lashes are of a decent quality.</li>
            <li>Otherwise theyre decent but hardly great.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with my purchase and would highly recommend these lashes.</li>
            <li>Great price, high grade.</li>
            <li>they are also very real looking and blend in good with my lashes.</li>
            <li>The lashes are synthetic (seem \\&quot;plasticky\\&quot;) and are not of superb quality, however, they are okay, which is frankly better than I expected for</li>
            <li>I make soft sculpted dolls and these lashes are inexpensive and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>but these are still pretty good</li>
            <li>These lashes are pretty good quality they hold up well for me.</li>
            <li>Pretty good quality for their price.</li>
            <li>Excited to use them!</li>
            <li>Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s what I was expecting the gift came with a lot of different styles and the person I got them for liked them a lot !!</li>
            <li>So excited for this purchase!  </li>
            <li>Soo worth the price!!</li>
            <li>great for people that want to try a new look every once in a while.</li>
            <li>the 1st pair I tried worked perfectly and lasted through a very long night.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this very large set.</li>
            <li>They look great and stay on great with a little weave glue!</li>
            <li>Once she unpacked these, she could not stop complementing the product and how fantastic she looked and for your information I agreed as well as many others.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure you will enjoy.</li>
            <li>When I bent the band to better fit my eye</li>
            <li>Perfect for costume parties and if your going for the \\&quot;drag queen\\&quot; look.  </li>
            <li>however I think they&#x27;d be good for really glam looks or nights out with some tweaking.  </li>
            <li>but i am satisfied none the less great buy!</li>
            <li>They are very clean , not plasticy and shiney like cheap ones</li>
            <li>I will probably never have to buy lashes again since I do not wear them daily or anything, but these are good quality lashes!</li>
            <li>Have fun! :)</li>
            <li>The smallest style isn&#x27;t that impressive, but again it would work for bottom lashes or for layering with other, fuller</li>
            <li>not the best selection of lashes they are not pretty stlyes.</li>
            <li>I will never run out with these endless options that are perfect for the stage.</li>
            <li>easy to apply...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so exciting that I will be able to get more looks out of them this way.  </li>
            <li>I love the veriety, their are some lashes that are natrual, sexy, and fun.</li>
            <li>But I will get more of these when I run low because they are great.</li>
            <li>Really you do get a nice variety of looks, and I love the value.</li>
            <li>They are so easy to put on..</li>
            <li>The thicker lashes were easy to put on</li>
            <li>I was able to clean and reuse the thicker lashes, but I couldn&#x27;t do it with the thinner ones.</li>
            <li>The bands are easy to work with, no problems with stiffness or &amp;#34;popping up&amp;#34; while trying to affix with glue.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, the sticky residue that attaches them to the plastic makes it easy to wrap the lashed around your brushes to shape them for even easier application.</li>
            <li>I ordered this and rec&#x27;d the item very quickly.  </li>
            <li>So easy to use.  </li>
            <li>After seeing so many good reviews I was surprised to have this problem.</li>
            <li>the come in a that box and the strips are easy to get them off.</li>
            <li>You can change up your look easily with these.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t bend easy and the lashes almost look plastic.</li>
            <li>They are easy to apply and work with.</li>
            <li>As written before, they dont bend easy..</li>
            <li>My happeness went away very quickly..</li>
            <li>There are 2 hair type styles included that are very bold, but they have that hair type feathery feel to them.</li>
            <li>I love them, such a great deal.</li>
            <li>I love lashes that look great and are relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li>If you wear lashes everyday like I do or fairly often then these will be great for you.  </li>
            <li>I use the thiner ones to work because they easily blend in w/</li>
            <li>i love this bundle pack, it has a great variety of different sizes and looks.</li>
            <li>I wanted lashes that I could easily wear during the day but these lashes are costume like.</li>
            <li>Great buy and will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>They are easy to apply.</li>
            <li>No doubt that I would repurchase:) a great price especially with</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s an easy fix</li>
            <li>but they are easy to use and apply.</li>
            <li>So many different variety, great quality and quantity.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to be able to order the ones I really like from this pack in bulk.</li>
            <li>i strongly recomend this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good product and Nice selection of different styles of eye lashes for all occasions.</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and are all in good shape &amp; pretty, not to mention the money your saving.</li>
            <li>and these work amazing and look real !</li>
            <li>Of course who could turn down 70 LASHES FOR AN AWESOME PRICE LIKE THAT?!</li>
            <li>received seven different styles and was very pleased to receive some \\&quot;natural\\&quot; styles along with the newer, trendy, feathery-style lashes.</li>
            <li>This product suits me fine.  </li>
            <li>Once you loosen them up a bit they are fine.</li>
            <li>and they stick perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>this is a great deal but most of the lashes are too long for me.</li>
            <li>but I cut them and they were fine.</li>
            <li>And always easy to put on and comfortable to wear, when placed correctly.</li>
            <li>So much so that I have ordered more for another one of my daughters!</li>
            <li>The main thing I liked about these is in order to save for later use the glue will peel right off without leaving residue which is great!</li>
            <li>The price was so cheap on these I was expecting to receive a lower end product - which I was fine with, I use them for dolls.</li>
            <li>:)) I am going to keep buying them forever haha!!</li>
            <li>but that probably because I have huge eyes.</li>
            <li>and I can always trim to fit my eye length.</li>
            <li>I was a bit worried about buying these since some of the reviews said they were cheap.</li>
            <li>I had to cut them to fit</li>
            <li>not only was this bundle a GREAT value but</li>
            <li>They are cheap.</li>
            <li>Cheap product.</li>
            <li>Still, even when I accounted for those, I was still happy with the price and selection and will 100% use this product in the future.</li>
            <li>There are times that I have to work with these lashes by bending them a bit to easily fit my eye shape.  </li>
            <li>I know all the lashes lightly sticks to the box</li>
            <li>Its such a great price if it weren&#x27;t for that defect.</li>
            <li>I know they were cheap lashes, but</li>
            <li>but I bought them anyway taking a chance they were cheaply made or tacky looking.</li>
            <li>I enjoy my lashes.</li>
            <li>These were CHEAP and they are CHEAP.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re looking for some usable cheap ones.</li>
            <li>I alway enjoy using each set of lashes for photo shoots and weddings.</li>
            <li>The rest of the lashes are great, I&#x27;ll definitely use them all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was cheap</li>
            <li>Yes they&#x27;re cheap, but I&#x27;m a dancer and the girls</li>
            <li>in the box look AMAZING trying to put on not so much.</li>
            <li>They arent flimsy or cheap.</li>
            <li>these are so worth it because the price and you can wear it more than once, in stores, one will be $3-$10, depending which one you like and material</li>
            <li>This is a lot for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>This is extremely important when applying lashes because you want to prevent the lash from lifting.</li>
            <li>This item is a great value for the price, and I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>You can tell the lashes are cheap.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;just a few tips for the way they work best for me...</li>
            <li>These are a great set of lashes and especially for the price!</li>
            <li>These fantastic eyelashes will draw attention to your  eyes making every blink a sweeping sensation.</li>
            <li>, we can freely loan (give) a pair to a teammate who forgot hers.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my daughters, they seem to enjoy it</li>
            <li>its just great overall!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>But overall it&#x27;s a great addition to any make-up kit</li>
            <li>Great variety of lashes for different occasions.</li>
            <li>These lashes are quite cheap in quality.  </li>
            <li>The price is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Different style were great.</li>
            <li>but I do enjoy them on occasion.</li>
            <li>It is a great buy especially if you wear them all the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So its a great product if your just starting out and want the practice.</li>
            <li>but really good last i will buy them again :)</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t pay much for them, since I definitely won&#x27;t be able to use every pair.</li>
            <li>i love this item it come right on time.</li>
            <li>so i got these eyelashes last week and let me just say that i am absolutly in love with this product!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super super pleased with these eyelashes</li>
            <li>I like that they are lightweight, easy to apply, and super comfortable.</li>
            <li>get a nice variety of lashes, from full, glam types, to the more natural daytime looks.</li>
            <li>Past the fussing around when trying to apply them though, they are great lashes for an amazing price.</li>
            <li>There are many different styles in here, and they are relatively easy to put on and nice to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These, however, are great, and I love that there&#x27;s a selection of different lashes ranging from more modest to daring.</li>
            <li>These lashes are a very good value, and they are very good quality, but they are a little too extreme.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to hear about this bundle from Andrea&#x27;s Choice on YouTube that I just had to buy it.</li>
            <li>and she was excited to receive them.</li>
            <li>When i got this package on my door, i was excited to see them.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get these lashes because I&#x27;m now getting into falsies</li>
            <li>I was pleased and they arrived on the exact date they were estimated to arrive on.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price, you cant beat it with a stick!</li>
            <li>I was excited about these lashes when I received them.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>First off, the thicker band gives more surface area to attach to your eyelids.</li>
            <li>Took a bit to get here as they had a long way to travel to me here in CO, but great deal for the price.</li>
            <li>For anyone who considers buying this item, I would recommend spend more money,but buy a better quality product that you actually will be able to use.</li>
            <li>If you tried to clean up the glue adhesive (that&#x27;s already on it)</li>
            <li>Sort of like you&#x27;re blowing your breath on glasses to clean them off.</li>
            <li>Granted they are not the best quaily if you are  a professional makeup artist and like the human hair ones</li>
            <li>I have gotten pretty good with detecting which side is suppose to be or looks better at being the outer lash as opposed to the inner lash.</li>
            <li>wow, all I can say is ahhhhhhhmazing qualiyu, im in love!</li>
            <li>They look great &amp; have a good variety of natural to more dramatic but are not over the top.</li>
            <li>I use lashes for special occasions and these have never let me down.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is right!</li>
            <li>Well, I was right!</li>
            <li>I was super excited to get these-</li>
            <li>My daughter said she liked only a certain kind</li>
            <li>The quality is not really that great, even on the thinner lashes.</li>
            <li>Great for stage makeup and drag.</li>
            <li>Such a great variety if you have many clients that may desire lashes to complete the look.</li>
            <li>This product arrived sooner than expected and in Great condition.</li>
            <li>Good price for as many as you get hopefully it will be dark where ever you are</li>
            <li>jusr put some mascara on the lashes to fluff them up and it&#x27;ll look great</li>
            <li>style I&#x27;ve tried so far has been amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is not what i had expected it to be, i read these reviews and they all said great things about it.</li>
            <li>They are fabulous and def worth buying wether</li>
            <li>I read most of the reviews and they were very helpful.</li>
            <li>only 3 out of 7 were good for my eyes&lt;</li>
            <li>Only thing is that you have to buy your own glue which is not a big deal, there are lots of glue out there that works well, the one i use is by Darkness and works great with these.</li>
            <li>Overall good lashes</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>The band isn&#x27;t too thick, and the length is perfect for my eyes though the lashes do feel and look a lot like plastic.</li>
            <li>the rest are really full.</li>
            <li>I have saved so much money with buying these lashes, and I love the variety.</li>
            <li>Most of them were very dramatic/thick - not the look</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase these lashes because they look FULL.</li>
            <li>I think they hold their shape better than real hair eyelashes and would recommend these to anyone</li>
            <li>A reasonable deal, with mostly usable lashes.</li>
            <li>They all loved playing with the different lashes...</li>
            <li>These came really fast, and I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>So they are reusable, if you take care of them and are gentle. :)</li>
            <li>Overall they are good for the price.</li>
            <li>The only reason I am giving them a 4 is because the lashes are not \\&quot;great\\&quot; but Good.</li>
            <li>so I could have a full look.</li>
            <li>Love this soooo much will be buying it again</li>
            <li>so these are still lasting after almost a year, but when I do wear them, they look good.</li>
            <li>Love all of them fast shipping</li>
            <li>I have trichtotrillomania and have never had a full set of eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Love these absolutely a must have for me.</li>
            <li>They get the job done, and if applied correctly with a good glue will last all</li>
            <li>There is a good variety of different style lashes also.</li>
            <li>However, the more natural looking lashes have bands that are reasonably easy to apply, and with a little practice I was able to get them on and have them looking amazing!</li>
            <li>but I was lucky enough to find this pack of lashes which I thought would be to good to be true</li>
            <li>The package was easy to open and the lashes are AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I will admit that these are slightly less quality than the 4 dollar ones but the price is so good that it more than makes up for it.</li>
            <li>i like all the choices and they all fit perfectly right out of the box, no need for trimming.</li>
            <li>, I pulled a pair of lashes off of each tray and it came off pretty easy.  </li>
            <li>I get the cheap ones at my local store and they were better!</li>
            <li>the only reason I am giving a 4 Star &amp; not 5 is because I reallly wish they were more human hair like instead of being plastic but for the price there really good :)</li>
            <li>I am in LOVE with my new lashes!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some success picking some of it off with my tweezers or clean fingernails</li>
            <li>This lash set offers a wide variety of lashes to choose from, and the best part is the price.</li>
            <li>I love that they come in so many different styles as well.</li>
            <li>Plus, who is touching your eyelashes to see if they&#x27;re realistic feeling?</li>
            <li>They obviously aren&#x27;t the best quality, I suggest only buying them if you&#x27;re practicing to put eyelashes on.</li>
            <li>There is a variety of styles but mostly bold looks.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering again, not for a while since I have so many now :)</li>
            <li>This is not only a great price but the lashes look so real.</li>
            <li>So many lashes so many different looks to achieve.</li>
            <li>Love the many different styles that are included in the box.  </li>
            <li>just wish all 70 pairs were all the same type as my favorite set of them all :)</li>
            <li>It was affordable and it came in the mail quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>They can be pretty stiff, but with the right glue, and after you cut to size, you&#x27;ll have flawless lashes.</li>
            <li>highly recommend. :]</li>
            <li>There is also a crisscross style which is very pretty.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re good as any other cheap lashes.</li>
            <li>This product proves true, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I didnt see any similar enough to my favorite style &amp;#34;Demi Wispies&amp;#34; but Im satisfied with what I purchased!!</li>
            <li>This product arrived in a few days and I love them many different styles and a great price i will be buying this product again</li>
            <li>and I was happy with their previous products</li>
            <li>and it is most used and favorite amazon.com purchase in a long time.</li>
            <li>I wish they were softer but overall pretty good buy.</li>
            <li>For the price these lashes are awesome and last long.</li>
            <li>Also they ship this fast!!</li>
            <li>I knew I was recieving 70 pairs, but you dont realize exactly how many that is until you open the box! :-)  </li>
            <li>Definitely buying more!</li>
            <li>They go from a more natural look to glamorous!  </li>
            <li>When I took the lashes out, I simply fell in love!</li>
            <li>but I love them so far!</li>
            <li>Pretty amazing set for such a cheap price.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it so far!</li>
            <li>Since most single drugstore eyelash falsies cost three dollars or more, this monster bundle...the price per eyelash strip is a joke...</li>
            <li>I recommend these to anyone who wants fuller, natural looking, sexy lashes!</li>
            <li>Great for guests that may need a little help with they &amp;#34;swag&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>But still great look just wish was a little shorter</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great buy hands down 🙌!</li>
            <li>This product is great and not cheap quality.</li>
            <li>the material is very plastic like and the lashes are cheap.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These lashes aren&#x27;t made from natural hair, which in my case, is awesome because you don&#x27;t get the same humidity and fragility problems that you would otherwise have with a natural lash product.</li>
            <li>Amazing choice for the low price!</li>
            <li>You get 70 pair of lashes for a great price and the hairs dont feel heavy on your eyelids.</li>
            <li>When I saw that I could get 70 pairs for $15.99 and free shipping with Prime, I couldn&#x27;t order fast enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have purchased this twice, because I truly do believe it is WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li>I cut some of the more natural lashes apart and applied as singles.</li>
            <li>putting them on is no problem, it was well worth the money</li>
            <li>Three of the styles are spaced out and more natural, varying in length and taper.  </li>
            <li>This product is really worth its price.</li>
            <li>I def think this is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li>The fun lashes.</li>
            <li>There was just one individual set that looked like it was cut kind of.</li>
            <li>Also I liked using every one of the 7 styles, especially the criss-cross lashes.</li>
            <li>Still fun to wear for night time.</li>
            <li>The pack comes with a variety but the thicker lashes look much more natural than the thinner.</li>
            <li>I let them choose their own lashes before I apply and they are definitely wowed when I take them out for them to see.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>After getting tired of looking for the perfect mascara I decided to give these a go...</li>
            <li>Then its always fun .</li>
            <li>They are reusable and I feel definitely worth the cost.</li>
            <li>You get a variety of different lashes which is nice.</li>
            <li>Worth the price compared to a pair in retail stores</li>
            <li>It is worth the money to try them out.  </li>
            <li>There are soooo many choices and they look like professional quality.</li>
            <li>Nice if your just starting out to use lashes and need some to practice with.</li>
            <li>I will have so much fun playing with alll the looks.</li>
            <li>There are several choices in styles which is nice.</li>
            <li>Try it guys because its worth the money.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>But they are worth the buck.</li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t tried them all but so far I&#x27;m satisfied, going to a party soon</li>
            <li>Fun, Fun,</li>
            <li>Fun</li>
            <li>REALLY WORTH IT FOR THE PRICE</li>
            <li>really worth the cost</li>
            <li>Although they take an excessive amount of time to bend and glue on, they look beautiful blended in with your lashes.</li>
            <li>Took these with me to Vegas and got several of my girlfriends buying their own eyelash bundle.</li>
            <li>They are nicely organized on individual strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only found one kind, but am stuck with 70 of them.</li>
            <li>These are so much fun to play with.</li>
            <li>Not all are the ones I like but still worth it.</li>
            <li>It comes in a different variety of styles but no glue, you&#x27;ll have to buy that on your own.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re certainly not day appropriate for most people</li>
            <li>The larger sizes are ready to wear right out of the box, and the smaller lashes are perfect for layering together or for wearing as bottom lashes.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase, but I wish I could purchase just one particular style because I&#x27;m not gonna get the most use out of the more natural style lashes.</li>
            <li>They barely bend which is good for a straighter lid, which an asian girlfriend of mine could use it just fine, but no one else.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The thinner ones are ok but the more dramatic ones aren&#x27;t so nice.</li>
            <li>The price to me is amazing, and if you have $16 (plus possible shipping) to spare and want to become comfortable with lashes I would HIGHLY recommend grabbing these as they ring in at about 23 cents per pair.  </li>
            <li>They are certainly not high quality, and you need to be pretty good at eyelashes to apply them.</li>
            <li>So I was a little worried getting this because it seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li>&quot; lashes set - seemed a little too good to be true</li>
            <li>I love using them for special occasions, such as chaperoning Prom, Gradnite, Graduation, weddings etc.</li>
            <li>Lashes come right apart when you take them of the holder.</li>
            <li>They send it right away</li>
            <li>Very wide though so that&#x27;s good if not just cut them.</li>
            <li>if you want a dramatic effect (which I love!) will be buying again!!!</li>
            <li>Normal price for a good set of human hair lashes run about $3 to $7 depending on the brand and the store</li>
            <li>These lashes are a little plastic-y, and they might not be great for people who want lashes to accentuate their everyday or more natural look, but for performers this set is a pretty good deal.  </li>
            <li>All styles are really cute and different, from a fun night out type to a more natural type.</li>
            <li>Very quick shipping, I was surprised!</li>
            <li>One day, more natural, the next day I look more vamp.</li>
            <li>I wish you had the option of buying a bundle with your fave styles because I don&#x27;t really like the ultra full ones</li>
            <li>The lashes are great and the price is unbelievable.</li>
            <li>When I applied the smaller, more natural lash, I thought they were ok.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not careful, you&#x27;ll get those cheap, flimsy ones that look like they&#x27;re made out of reinforced sewing thread!  </li>
            <li>Even if they are too long, thats where scissors come in handy.</li>
            <li>Kind of too long for my eyelids ( not the lash length)</li>
            <li>Looks good on, easy to use, last long time, can use over and over again.</li>
            <li>If your wanting more natural looking lashes, this may not be your first choice, but if your a diva like me, than your going to be quiet pleased with your purchase.</li>
            <li>Intensity goes from natural to drag queen lol</li>
            <li>No one has lashes that thick and perfect naturally</li>
            <li>Pros:  -Super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Human Hair lashes are much easier to apply and they look amazing.</li>
            <li>I am a professional makeup artist and need my falsies to easily adhere to my client&#x27;s lashes and stay put.</li>
            <li>These are GREAT with several different styles!</li>
            <li>But they are all beautiful styles and long enough to clip to the length that I need them to be!</li>
            <li>You will need your own glue, but overall for the price this is an absolute steal.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t bend on their own, so when you pull them off the white plastic case, they come off as a straight line.</li>
            <li>The bulk nature of the product really came in handy when she was asked to do the makeup for her entire dance troupe.</li>
            <li>The lashes are SYNTHETIC hair, so they are a bit more stiff and take a skilled hand to glue on.</li>
            <li>When used right, you can get multiple uses out of any one pair, and they&#x27;re not horrible quality.  </li>
            <li>Overall, the price is right and you get a ton of OK lashes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product you will love it, I just love the wide band on the lash line and the natural look that it gives and how it bring out the beauty in your eyes!!!!</li>
            <li>And when you take it off the plastic, it&#x27;s very straight.</li>
            <li>Very light on my clients eyes and very simple to apply.</li>
            <li>These lashes are very cheaply made - all plastic, not real human hair.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy these, there are plenty of other websites that sell better lashes for cheap.</li>
            <li>At stores you pay at least 4 bucks per pair if you are lucky, the amount you get for these and not to mention the variety, really makes me happy.</li>
            <li>The thinner the band, the better, and these bands are definitely not very thin compared to many more expensive products.</li>
            <li>Overall, for $15, you can&#x27;t beat how many you get.</li>
            <li>I reuse my favorite ones, and I would definitely recommend these lashes to a friend.</li>
            <li>I like these better than Sally&#x27;s because they are lighter then regular ones and you forget you&#x27;re even wearing them.</li>
            <li>The last style of lashes are really cute and they crisscross.  </li>
            <li>but I love them all the same.  </li>
            <li>I would love to try those next, if they offer them.</li>
            <li>(thats when i finally run outn:) )</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d definitely buy again :)</li>
            <li>At first you might think that you would never wear them</li>
            <li>I was a bit hesitant at first on purchasing this item but figured for the price, what did I have to lose.</li>
            <li>i love the different variety of lashes.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s more time-consuming, I&#x27;ll be going back to that method.  </li>
            <li>I love to alter the length for different effects.</li>
            <li>As an avid user of lashes, I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love MAC but can&#x27;t afford them for daily use.</li>
            <li>then what I like, but as a makeup artist I go through a lot of lashes and this will help me out so much!</li>
            <li>And then I had so many different styles to choose from!</li>
            <li>Shipping was extremely fast also!</li>
            <li>thx ;)</li>
            <li>I love to double up on them too</li>
            <li>The Bundle Monster 70 Pairs Fake Eyelashes are just wonderful to have especially if you love doing makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that the Bundle Monster eyelashes are back in stock.</li>
            <li>This was the first pack of eyelashes</li>
            <li>They had akword and unnatural shapes to them and also they fall apart the first time you remove them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is an absolute steal!  </li>
            <li>I love that I have a variety of styles to choose from, that suits my needs for different occasions.  </li>
            <li>obviously the MAC ones look and feel better</li>
            <li>I wanted more bang for my buck instead of constantly buying indiviual packs at $2.99 each.</li>
            <li>You will have to manuvor the lashes for your eye but they are pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>Well, that&#x27;s exactly what I got.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I have a choice from multiple eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Other than that I love the box of lashes!</li>
            <li>this is my first time buying lashes with them.</li>
            <li>After watching several youtube videos I felt pretty confident.</li>
            <li>On a side note here, this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried these sort of lashes</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy them again:)</li>
            <li>Very plastic and rigid!</li>
            <li>I ordered these with hesitance based on some of the reviews; however what I have found is they are exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I thought these were ok until I actually wore the first pair.</li>
            <li>Many different kinds in the box.</li>
            <li>Crappy quality, spend the extra money and get better lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn all of the different styles of lashes, and to my surprise the thicker lashes look a lot better.</li>
            <li>Although I love these lashes, I will explain why i only gave them a 3 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many different styles of lashes.</li>
            <li>Many styles, but I will stick with what I know next time.</li>
            <li>Better luck next time!</li>
            <li>yes they arent the best quality in fake lashes</li>
            <li>Love them second time I&#x27;ve order a set like these</li>
            <li>I had been buying in the store as the lashes went on sale and they rarely last more than 2 uses.</li>
            <li>And not to brag on how fast the arrived !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;i ve only worn one pair of these lashes and I&#x27;ve reused them about 4 times, I&#x27;ve never been able to do that.  </li>
            <li>Comes in 7 different stylish designs.</li>
            <li>I am an avid lash wearer.</li>
            <li>The actual lash itself looked ok but didn&#x27;t give my eyes that flirty pretty look</li>
            <li>This is girly heaven in a box that is not expensive.</li>
            <li>theres more and different lashs.</li>
            <li>; Will I order more in the future?</li>
            <li>, More than likely, Yes, P.S. my lashes came within two days of my purchase!</li>
            <li>they really are worth it.</li>
            <li>If you are concerned about discomfort just take the 2 extra minutes to take the glue off your lashes :)</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I love the different styles for day and night.</li>
            <li>Con would be the lack of any glue, then again it didn&#x27;t advertise any so DUO works pretty well.</li>
            <li>These are not the same quality as Ardell (which is a drug store fave of mine), BUT they are okay.  </li>
            <li>They definitely work better for those that are used to putting on falsies.</li>
            <li>The profile of the strip itself is more oblong than circular, further helping with the eyelashes-</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>and I think they were made for more almond or Asian eyes.</li>
            <li>I love these, and the different eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Love that there is such a variety.</li>
            <li>At the store they are prices way higher.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the criss-cross ones yet, but they look pretty funky.</li>
            <li>Love the different styles of lashes.</li>
            <li>but there are so many different varieties</li>
            <li>and i love them, there are seven cards with ten pairs of lashes ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s just a few that aren&#x27;t good and not the rest of the box.</li>
            <li>But if you take good care of the eyelashes you can reuse them a few times.</li>
            <li>I guess I already knew half of it would be unwearable, but it seemed so cheap for so many</li>
            <li>I think these are super fun lashes and not everyday lashes.</li>
            <li>The natural ones look very natural, and im able to reuse them without them being ruined.</li>
            <li>Lots of options with these lashes from thick to more length!!</li>
            <li>The other lashes though are really nice.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve used other brands that look like it would be your own lashes.</li>
            <li>They take a little maneuvering (trimming, bending) to get them really looking good.</li>
            <li>Decent variety, kind of cheap and hard to bend, but hey for the price it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>There are some I&#x27;d wear daily but most of them are very unnatural looking.</li>
            <li>of these lashes are good quality and can be used several times if removed and cleaned properly.</li>
            <li>Super soft lashes!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They come very nicely organized and you can find the thinner ones at the top which if worn look totally natural but give an extra little push of elegance and beauty and delicacy!  </li>
            <li>However, with all the positive reviews, I had to try these.</li>
            <li>It takes me a long time to get through all pairs and some I like more than others.</li>
            <li>If I mess up, there are 69 more pairs to keep trimming!</li>
            <li>Who wouldn&#x27;t love long lashes for every occasion?</li>
            <li>These will retain the shape after you remove them really well, I&amp;#34;ve been using my first pair about 5 times now</li>
            <li>I like falsies that do not have a huge gap separation between each lash, because although my real lashes are fairly long they aren&#x27;t that full.</li>
            <li>Love the variety, came in good length so at least they weren&#x27;t too short</li>
            <li>I usually go to a drug store or Sally&#x27;s, but I like I said I loved the bundle idea.</li>
            <li>i love the lashes, and if you take good care of them, they usually last 2-3 days, at least for me they do.</li>
            <li>Easy to cut and apply, long lasting, they hold their shape well, and the variety in the package makes for fabulous versatility!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge lash wearer, usually just for going out or special occasions, Lashes usually cost me $4-$6 a pair at the drug store, so when I saw this, i thought it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>This was such an amazing find for someone like myself who wears them almost everyday thanks SO MUCH bundle monster!!!!</li>
            <li>received these lashes in less than 2 days of ordering, they are in a nice package like the picture.</li>
            <li>the packaging makes it easy to take care of the lashes for multiple uses.</li>
            <li>Most of these were too dramatic for my own taste, but I really like them regardless.</li>
            <li>There are two sets that are kind of natural but still long.</li>
            <li>I really love my eyelashes every single pair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a freelance makeup artist &amp; do events where I&#x27;m applying lashes in large volumes.</li>
            <li>They look super fake lol</li>
            <li>The lashes are a little hard to work with, and feel heavy, but once they are on they look amazing, and it&#x27;s a great deal for the price, all of the different styles are really nice!</li>
            <li>you cannot beat the price, even if they end up only good for a single use each.</li>
            <li>They are easily trimmed down to fit your eye shape and are great for dramatic looks.</li>
            <li>Most MUAs I&#x27;ve come across on the net say that these type are the hardest to apply, but after trying natural lashes, I&#x27;d have to disagree!  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not the same quality as the store bought ones, but I like them just fine for the price.</li>
            <li>Love this bundle deal so many lashes to choose from the only downside was that 3 out of the 7 different styles are exactly the same</li>
            <li>If you are new to false lashes, here is a really great tip for application; snip the weft of lashes into 3-4 big sections and apply one section at a time, that way it wont keep popping up in the corners while you try to adhere them to your lid :)</li>
            <li>It was a good deal, but the material made the eyelashes hard to glue it on.</li>
            <li>They are gorgeous &amp;&amp; hardly shed.</li>
            <li>If these are too long you can always cut them and also a fun trick is to cut some of them in half for those cute wispy demi lashes at the end of your eyes, it gives such an adorable flirty look !</li>
            <li>Fantastic economic necessary and luxurious indeed.</li>
            <li>I guess I can&#x27;t say much on this since I paid such a cheap amount.</li>
            <li>Depending on the type of lashes you prefer determines how much you will like the product.  </li>
            <li>When I wear those, people assume the lashes are real.  </li>
            <li>I just buy the whole box and get rid of rid of what I don&#x27;t like&lt;br /&gt;Great lashes.</li>
            <li>Onto the specifics of the lashes themselves and why I like them so much . . .</li>
            <li>Shipping was freaky fast too.</li>
            <li>but you have to take the lash off carefull if you them fast they will brake</li>
            <li>Not so much.  </li>
            <li>Its compact enough for me to leave out on my makeup station and have it not be obtrusive, yet the lashes inside are secure and they were not damaged in transit.</li>
            <li>very plastic.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really recommend getting these from Amazon...</li>
            <li>I would recommend these lashes unless you&#x27;re really picky about your lashes.</li>
            <li>The quality of the lashes is really plastic-y.</li>
            <li>Very plastic looking.</li>
            <li>They worked very well</li>
            <li>The shipping was exceedingly fast too.</li>
            <li>Very shinny</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest these!</li>
            <li>These lashes arrived fast, I ordered them Saturday with 2 day shipping and somehow they got to me Monday in CA.</li>
            <li>They got to my door fast~</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>These are very plastic not hair looking..</li>
            <li>whole lash  would be a bit much.theatre,dance.pagents.modeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been practicing with these opposed to wearing them out, I&#x27;ve been ripping them on and off repeatedly without any change to the shape, so they seem really durable.</li>
            <li>but these were just too much.</li>
            <li>This has saved me so much money.</li>
            <li>I was really going for.</li>
            <li>I ended up getting Ardell and was much happier.</li>
            <li>I really dont care for these lashes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li>It is very luxurious, Much comfort.</li>
            <li>These are made of plastic, but you really can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li>and I really looked like a drag queen (minus the manly features lol).  </li>
            <li>But for real life?</li>
            <li>They look and feel real.</li>
            <li>I also use the on some stuffed giraffes and they really put the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li>i really like the selection of the lashes.  </li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t look real at all not even close.</li>
            <li>but they arent real hair</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care for them.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind it looking really un-natural</li>
            <li>There is too much adhesive on the lashes for them to stick to the molding in their packaging.</li>
            <li>Feel real and looks like it too.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and delivery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real</li>
            <li>I really like the diversity of styles and lengths.  </li>
            <li>THe lashes are absolutely beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually really like these eyelash extension.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>believe they give you day and night versions of eyelashes, will be batting these cognac eyes at the fella very soon.</li>
            <li>the edge stabbed your eye and really hurts.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t cost as much either.</li>
            <li>Really accents the eyes</li>
            <li>I think I will purchase this again, they really are reusable.</li>
            <li>They are very shiny and plastic.  </li>
            <li>However, given the price/quantity, I really can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t ready to give up that look</li>
            <li>Priced very affordable.</li>
            <li>Gave these as a Christmas gift to my sister and she absolutely LOVES them and has worn them all year.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s so much variety to choose from.  </li>
            <li>The quality is MUCH lower than what I am used to.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re actually really flexible.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s absolutely adores it</li>
            <li>A very versatile set of lashes for the price you pay.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>They look very unnatural.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>I really like the variety of eyelashes that come with this bundle.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>It comes with 7 different styles to fit all occasions and all looks.</li>
            <li>Will absolutely buy again and recommend it.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>and they are ready to put on.</li>
            <li>and we both highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li>There is just one set out of the seven that I can actually use without being mistaken for a cheap hooker.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t glue very well.</li>
            <li>and I really tried to like them.</li>
            <li>I feel like my money&#x27;s just so much better spent on mink lashes.</li>
            <li>and I feel like they take away from my whole look instead of enhancing it.</li>
            <li>These were a good value in that you got so many pairs of eyelashes, but unfortunately, these are not at all natural looking.</li>
            <li>I pulled and pulled as gently as I could and ended up ripping out a few of my own lashes in the process.</li>
            <li>The band was wayy too thick to even get a good curve to stick on to the lash line.</li>
            <li>They are easy to apply and stay on for a long period of time.</li>
            <li>Missing 5 lashes, they are VERY durable and steady, the glue is SO easy to remove, however I had to cut some full models in halves because they are plastic</li>
            <li>Normally $15 would only get you 3 or 5 pairs, 70 pairs is a damn fine bargain.</li>
            <li>Excited to wear them in public!!</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m pretty sure these aren&#x27;t the highest quality lashes you can find on the market, I couldn&#x27;t have been happier with the product in relation to how little I paid for them.</li>
            <li>I was excited because the set included multiples of the various styles.  </li>
            <li>And the lower heavier eyelashes are more glamourous, some totally extreme</li>
            <li>I find that I have to use more glue with these than other brands.</li>
            <li>These lashes are not super high end (like brands such as Dolly Wink) but they are good for everyday use and you can use a pair of eyelashes more than once if you take care of them !</li>
            <li>I like the look but the clients I have put them on felt they were too long (and I used the more natural looking</li>
            <li>Lastly, these lashes will need to be wrapped around a brush handle or pinky finger to make them a bit more pliable because of the band, or you may just want to save yourself some aggravation and cut them in either half/thirds/fourths and apply the pieces to your lash line (a lot of people do this for ease of application with lashes in general).  </li>
            <li>It was very cost effective purchasing the product, being as though 1 pack of lashes usually run anywhere from 3 to $4 a pack.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the box, I saw the more natural ones vs the more dramatic ones</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price at all, but quality wise i am not impressed.</li>
            <li>but these eyelashes are good for experimenting on what type of false lashes you would be interested in using.</li>
            <li>Some of the thicker lashes can be a little bit stiffer so you&#x27;ll have to press them to your eyes until the glue is completely dry, but otherwise great.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest the person wearing them also trim them down a great deal since they&#x27;re rather wide.</li>
            <li>After i take them off i just wash it under warm water and use a tissue to tap dry and then store them for next time</li>
            <li>These lashes are strong enough to be reused about 4x or more depending how gently you remove old glue from them, but I usually just peel/rip off the old glue and them give them a quick rinse off the mascara before reapplying.</li>
            <li>You do need to cut them to fit your eye because they are rather long.</li>
            <li>As with any pair of falsies, you should trim the edges so that they fit your eyes (as they&#x27;re made long on purpose).</li>
            <li>Now for a true Diva that is 7 different looks.</li>
            <li>I have a Youtube Channel ([...]) in which I review this and many other products!</li>
            <li>I bought thses around the holidays 26December and recieved them before New years eve!</li>
            <li>Did I mention I&#x27;m new at falsies?!</li>
            <li>so I will get to try a new look!</li>
            <li>But for the price I will probably purchase again because I love a few of the styles so much.</li>
            <li>Decent look and wear depending on your use.</li>
            <li>Of course those are more expensive :)</li>
            <li>It is more difficult to save them for more than one performance since they don&#x27;t have cases but the girls figured out how.</li>
            <li>i love there are several different looks in this affordable kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the easiest way to get the lashes to curve a little more than they were made to is to bend them completely in a circle and blow your hot breath on them.</li>
            <li>They make you feel very pretty, like your in one of those mascara commercials and actually have the effect they advertise.</li>
            <li>I love to mess with make up</li>
            <li>usually i spend 4.99 for just one set,  good quality and really neat &amp; different styles,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have one high quality pair of lashes then a box of these.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if your on a stage every night, then these high drama lashes might work for you.</li>
            <li>I am giving this 5 stars because I didn&#x27;t have high expectations when i bought this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend  this product and seller</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend them</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these lashes to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>When I read the other reviews, quite a few people said they were great lashes for the price.</li>
            <li>This comes with different sizes, this can do no wrong!</li>
            <li>They are cheaper but if you roll them in your fingers for awhile they are a little more flexible.</li>
            <li>I was so happily surprised with this box!!  </li>
            <li>if you wiggle the lashes around they are a little more movable for gluing</li>
            <li>It looks as if they are made of plastic and arent really easy to apply due to the stiffness of them.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong with these, you&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li>However, I find that they are really matted together and does not have a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow I Really Like Them</li>
            <li>They really look natural on her</li>
            <li>so I would have lashes on hand if I ever need them and so far, I don&#x27;t really NEED them.</li>
            <li>I decided after watching some YouTube videos and reading reviews here that at this low price it would be worth it to grab these.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an economical way to assure they all have the same style.</li>
            <li>i am able to wear them a few times too.</li>
            <li>This will last me a while, definitely worth getting if you don&#x27;t want to continue purchasing lashes all the time.</li>
            <li>I read another review that said the same thing, but i took the risk and bought it anyway (totally worth it).</li>
            <li>with such a variety, it was totally worth</li>
            <li>You have to hold them to shape for a while longer than normal ones.</li>
            <li>you wear all styles of the lashes for normal days?</li>
            <li>A few styles look okay</li>
            <li>And not sharp!!&lt;br /&gt;You can tell these are good quality false lashes.</li>
            <li>Also I found that if you cut the thicker lashes in half they and trim them a little, they make great \\&quot;winged\\&quot; lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It was way too long&lt;br /&gt;Clear tacky glue did not blend into my skin color and was very noticeable&lt;br /&gt;There was very few variety, many of them looked the same&lt;br /&gt;Uncomfortable</li>
            <li>Other than that they are fine.</li>
            <li>One other great perk is you have such a wide variety of lashes to choose from</li>
            <li>Had a great selection of lash styles, but on the down side they were really stiff and would not glue</li>
            <li>They are stiff and most wont stay on.</li>
            <li>They do need glue, but that&#x27;s a cheap pickup compared to the expenses of the other lashes.</li>
            <li>I have other products from them that are fantastic.</li>
            <li>It could contain any number of harsh chemicals and the last place I want to put hazardous substances is right next to my eyeball!</li>
            <li>For those of you that like to use very thick heavy eyelashes, this product is perfect for you.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to lashes?</li>
            <li>Live by these...</li>
            <li>but I just wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li>Ok.. I am new at wearing lashes and after watching youtubers on how to put on falsies, I decided to try it by buying ardell lashes from the drug store for practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been playing with it all day and trying new looks.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to finishing all of the box &amp; order a new one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These aren&#x27;t ultra luxury, and they are not that natural looking, but they are a great addition to your kit if you are a performer, especially if you are as hard on lashes as I am!</li>
            <li>Good buy if you are into costume or dramatic makeup, and</li>
            <li>Looks great from far away, looks fake up close.</li>
            <li>I realize I only spent about 15 dollars on 70 pairs of lashes, but I think they should be better crafted.  </li>
            <li>Not amazing but good enough.</li>
            <li>and they look very natural.</li>
            <li>Lashes are very SOFT wasn&#x27;t expecting that from synthetic fibers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>reason why the thicker ones are better is because its fuller, and with the thick lash strip it blends in a little more because the lashes are thicker.</li>
            <li>The fiber band that keeps the lashes in place does not bend easily, and I can definitely feel this band on my eye all day long.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s a huge gap that separates each lash from the other, which doesn&#x27;t even make the lashes look natural.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect much given the price, and I was shocked at how great these lashes look.  </li>
            <li>I love the idea of having multiple sets of the same lashes for several reasons.</li>
            <li>but i still have pair left from my first box i bought 9months ago.</li>
            <li>Wow! 70 pair for $15.00????</li>
            <li>I purchased these when I first starting doing makeup over a year ago.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitely the better way to go, dont be fooled by the other bulk eyelash dealers.</li>
            <li>not everyday you get Quality with Quanity!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m willing to pay the extra money.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot of glue btw and always focus on the inner corner first</li>
            <li>Its exactly as pictured so look closely before ordering you just have to cut the lashes to adjust to your actual eyelid.</li>
            <li>The natural lashes can be cropped shorter (just outer edges) for a more subtle pretty daytime look or you can crop them to fit your entire lash line and its a fuller, more dramatic evening look.</li>
            <li>Although some of the sets are a bit way too dramatic to wear on a daily basis, it&#x27;s a great bargain.</li>
            <li>I had to cut them down quite a bit to fit my eye.</li>
            <li>This also makes them easier to clean and reuse if you put mascara on, or get any other product on them.</li>
            <li>Nice lashes just a little long.</li>
            <li>The lashes are nice, some are a little more dramatic and some a little less, but thats whats so good about them.</li>
            <li>I love how they have 4 styles too, ranging from naturally to flirty to fun to dramatic.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll start knowing how to take care of it, make sure you only put glue on the lines because if it drys up where the lashes start it will dry up and could fall easy because the material is hard.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly re-use one pair over ten times as long as you be careful when taking them off or peeling off old glue!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m thinking with a little eyeliner it should be fine.</li>
            <li>I love these lashes there a little stiff but hey there synthetic not human hair overall there a good value I have no room for further complaints.</li>
            <li>Although I am not crazy about all of the designs, For what I usually pay for lashes in individual packages, I found its still a GREAT DEAL even if I only use HALF of them</li>
            <li>Also, they don&#x27;t set easily, they don&#x27;t really bend to fit your eye, and you spend a minute stabbing it on to your eyelash.</li>
            <li>The bands are not stiff.</li>
            <li>I like that it is a bundle of them, but the lashes feel and look a little cheap.</li>
            <li>I was a little aprehensive because it was a cheap price, but the product exceeded my expectataions.</li>
            <li>Before you apply these lashes on your eyes, make sure to flex them a little bit back and forth</li>
            <li>There were a couple that added just a little more volume, and then there were some that looked like giant, plastic centipedes.  </li>
            <li>Bands are a little flimsy and I prefer Red Cherry or Ardell over these, but I got lots of compliments on these lashes :-)</li>
            <li>they are hard material, so make sure when you curl them, hold it longer and use mascara to hold it.</li>
            <li>B00027D8IC Duo Lash Adhesive, Clear, 0.25 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s great to wear and toss without feeling guilty that I only got one use out of them for $5-15 a pair.</li>
            <li>They were nice, looks real, but feels fake, of course.</li>
            <li>Also, there&#x27;s this clear silicone on the lash lines that hurt my eyes when I wear the lashes.</li>
            <li>I can reuse them and they really exaggerate my big eyes.</li>
            <li>Also, I do add mascara to make it look natural.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The lashes are soft but</li>
            <li>In no way shape or form do these lashes look natural on your eyes.</li>
            <li>Completely unnatural looking.</li>
            <li>Well, its not completely a waste of money</li>
            <li>If you are looking for natural lashes these are not for you.</li>
            <li>but beware, you will not have the natural look.</li>
            <li>but they look so natural even when applied.</li>
            <li>So out of the whole box I only use the fuller ones.</li>
            <li>now thats a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>Its really 70 pair of lashes contained in this box with seven different styles.</li>
            <li>I have had no problems SO FAR</li>
            <li>I used to get my lashes done professionally until my natural lashes started falling out.</li>
            <li>I have been doing makeup my whole life and recently got into the business.</li>
            <li>Wow wow</li>
            <li>They are long and pretty.</li>
            <li>Plus mine came early.</li>
            <li>These lashes feel like paper and they are far too long/dramatic.</li>
            <li>So far and I have gotten compliments on them.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>So far I have lost 3 pairs of lashes because they were stuck to the cardboard, losing an additional pair for every pair I&#x27;ve put on so far.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that there&#x27;re a lot of sets, but the average girl can&#x27;t wear all these styles.</li>
            <li>Even if you wear only one style, it&#x27;s worth the price since I&#x27;d paid around $4.00 for only one pair.</li>
            <li>i love this bundles of false lashes, so much to choose from.</li>
            <li>Quality wise, there is nothing wrong with them so far (no shedding, glue comes off etc.)</li>
            <li>I am able to wear the thinner ones to work and they look like I have naturally thick and curled lashes without looking like</li>
            <li>But even the lashes at the 99 cent store are better quality, 1/2 of them cant be used because the strip is to thick to bend with the curve of the eyes.</li>
            <li>this was the worse thing i have seen i thought the lashes looked nice in the picture when i got the product</li>
            <li>Notwithstanding, when a gal seeks to \\&quot;challenge the eye,\\&quot; his, not her own, false eyelashes are an acceptable and desirable means.</li>
            <li>They are easy to put on, little glue is needed!</li>
            <li>My first pair kept irritating my eyes because they were so stiff... but overall, for the price, they are pretty darn good quality lashes.</li>
            <li>If you want a dramatic, sexy look than buy these!</li>
            <li>I got them today and they were even more unbelievable in person!</li>
            <li>the little extra effort is well worth the price!!</li>
            <li>Cheap looking, stiff and unusable.</li>
            <li>Three other styles are much thicker and would still look semi-natural on women whose lashes are much thicker.  </li>
            <li>Not easy to fit eyes.</li>
            <li>I recommend these for daily use, and for those extra special occasions and big nights out, I&#x27;ll use the MAC or Ardell.</li>
            <li>my real eyelashes &amp; i use the more dramatic ones when I go out.  </li>
            <li>A drag queen would LOVE these but not the average classy, working woman.</li>
            <li>The other strips within themselves though are worth the comparable price they cost.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll probably have to do this a few times til it stays, but its worth it, because you dont want to look like you have lazy eyes... : )</li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;m definitely not the kind of girl to wear fake lashes often</li>
            <li>i guess its good value but the lashes are pretty bad quality...</li>
            <li>i usually buy 2 boxes at a time i loooove them so many different types to choice from!</li>
            <li>Several styles from normal to wild....</li>
            <li>Basicly they are strong enough to withstand my rough handling</li>
            <li>Great for mass projects like theater makeup jobs or a dramatic photo shoot for an amateur..but other than that...</li>
            <li>Overall, I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>bought bc the quantity was high and price was low</li>
            <li>and I usually do end up cutting off a good chunk of them because they&#x27;re way too long for my own eyes.</li>
            <li>The thicker/more dramatic lashes were fine, but the thinner lashes were more difficult to work with and didn&#x27;t fit well.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have much space between your lash line and brows, you will be able to cut one strip exactly down the middle and use it as two half lashes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I have been wearing falsies for about seven years, usually the Ardell brand because that&#x27;s what&#x27;s available at the beauty supply chains for about $3-5 a pop.</li>
            <li>I do have to snip off a small piece  to fit my eyes.  </li>
            <li>When i first got the lashes i expected Ardell-quality lashes .</li>
            <li>you glue them on, and they pop right off unless you HOLD them in place for the entire time it takes for the glue to dry.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great starter kit, but some of the kinds of lashes have a hard edge and are hard to apply because of that</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical about this purchase due to the fact that you got so many lashes for so cheap.</li>
            <li>Personally I adore all things cosmetic and am a new freelancer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m waiting on a new glue to see if I have the same problem again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the 50 lash set I few months ago and needed a new set so decided to go with this bundle since I got more for less.  </li>
            <li>Purchase the CLEAR, it applies white but always dries clear.</li>
            <li>i just love my eye lashes.i can have a different dramatic eye look every day,they are very convenient to use.</li>
            <li>Three styles of lashes are thin and more natural looking.  </li>
            <li>luv them they should give you choice,  like the long dark ones, reusable, cheap</li>
            <li>They definitely aren&#x27;t made of real hair, and up close you can definitely tell the lashes are synthetic.</li>
            <li>They are really long and need to be cut down on the ends just to fit your eye.</li>
            <li>I buy these for my daughter, she loves this brand and insists no other will do.</li>
            <li>No regrets!</li>
            <li>I have been very happy in the past with fake eyelashes from the local store.</li>
            <li>They are very cheaply made not natural at all and very long almost all had to be cut down to size ..</li>
            <li>They loose their shape and hairs fall off fast.</li>
            <li>They eyelashes are awesome, they are a little less quality than ARDELL false lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to use them to become more comfortable with cutting, stacking, and otherwise customizing different lash styles for different looks and at this price it won&#x27;t pain me.  </li>
            <li>I also wish that there would have been more natural looking lashes, as I can&#x27;t necessarily wear the big thick funky lashes to work and out during the day, because I look like Twiggy or like i&#x27;m from the sixties.</li>
            <li>Save your money if you are looking for affordable but natural looking lashes check out my other reviews you will find some lashes that i purchased that I absolutely adore.</li>
            <li>I payed much more for much less product previously.</li>
            <li>The styles are varied and you can create more natural looks to dramatic ones.</li>
            <li>It lasts long - at least i can get more than one times the wear on each of them.  </li>
            <li>the only downside is that the lashes arent soft</li>
            <li>Finally have a twizzer near you for easier maneuver of the lashes.</li>
            <li>The Monster Bundle of seventy (70) pairs provides a nearly inexhaustible supply of that piece de resistance of eye makeup; whereas, the cost per pair is insignificant should I ruin a pair or two in learning proper application and care.</li>
            <li>and they are so thick they wouldn&#x27;t curve to fit my eye.</li>
            <li>The bands are thick and take time to soften up to fit for desired eye shapes.</li>
            <li>I wear false lashes a lot and the quantity is part of what I love.</li>
            <li>I am a newcomer to false lashes and I absolutely love this set.  </li>
            <li>As far as getting a large amount of lashes go these will last you a while however they are straight up hard plastic.</li>
            <li>I find that the less dramatic lashes don&#x27;t really do much for me, honestly I buy these for the more dramatic ones.</li>
            <li>The quality isn&#x27;t the finest horse hairs from a hidden village or anything, but I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re a lot better looking than the Japanese ones I used to buy that just looked like shiny black plastic.</li>
            <li>I have only worn the natural look, but i can&#x27;t wait to try on the more dramatic ones.</li>
            <li>With seven different styles to chose from and 70 pairs total is enough to last a whole year or longer.  </li>
            <li>Some of the lash band have too much of the hair sticking out from the other side</li>
            <li>the reason why they get a 3 star rating from me is because the more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking lashes, each individual lash is so thick and long</li>
            <li>These lashes remind me a lot of the Ardell Runway lashes- super long, super dramatic, but quality not as similar.</li>
            <li>Takes a while to get them on right since theyre so stiff.</li>
            <li>I love wearing lashes for when I go out at night, and sometimes during the day when I want a dramatic look.</li>
            <li>LOVE these lashes but a set of the really dramatic ones</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably trim the thicker ones and just use them as end pieces to fill out my lashes for a more dramatic look.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like is because there are only 2 lashes that look natural</li>
            <li>Because I am a professional make-up artist and I&#x27;ve used the product on several different clients and I&#x27;ve had to make alterations to every set of lashes used.</li>
            <li>so I am not able to use this product to its full potential</li>
            <li>The thicker one are harder to put on since they have a more thick band also are synthetic hairs.</li>
            <li>The more the lash is thick the harder it is to make it stay on your lid.</li>
            <li>I wear false lashes almost daily, and I love changing my look.</li>
            <li>Some are just way too over the top obvious that you&#x27;re wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li>They are very cute, but are pretty stiff and must be broken down before applying otherwise</li>
            <li>it arrived here only three days...which that was great.. but the only that was bad about it was that there wasnt 70 pairs of eyelashes..</li>
            <li>Most of them comes in exaggerated length and shape and only 2 comes in natural style and length  </li>
            <li>They are pretty but did not fit the shape or size of eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much a waste of money.</li>
            <li>uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time - may be good for a photoshoot but not for a long day of wear.</li>
            <li>The rest of the lashes are really thick and full and I didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li>I will have to trim down some of the lashes because they are way too long (I wear lashes everyday), but for the price I paid, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>but I absolutely love the dramatic ones especially at night time.</li>
            <li>I could tell from the moment I opened the box that the two fuller types of lashes would look ridiculous, and on trying them they were just too long and full!</li>
            <li>The lashes can be kinda stiff at first</li>
            <li>Wow I can wear one set for a very long time before I even think about switching to another pair.</li>
            <li>The only thing that is kind of annoying about them is that the strip that holds the lashes on is rather stiff, so you have to make sure you have a sufficient amount of glue to keep them on.</li>
            <li>I have made the few sets of drugstore lashes that I have purchased in the past last for several applications simply by handling them gently and keeping them clean.  </li>
            <li>There are various designs for every social gathering I go to.  </li>
            <li>Good for practice and a few different looks depending on what you like or how dramatic you want to go.</li>
            <li>I used to wear the super thick lashes that come with these (from Model21)</li>
            <li>Thick and bold lashes.</li>
            <li>Good for recitals and costume makeup, but awful for daily use or special occasions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought from this seller several times and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed; product is made well, can be used multiple times, they look great.</li>
            <li>Nice variety from conservative to wild and unbelievably crazy long.</li>
            <li>I purchased these for \\&quot;practice\\&quot;, thinking that they would be a good, less expensive alternative to drugstore lashes (which can become quite an expense over time), helping me to get used to both applying them and wearing them.  </li>
            <li>GREAT FAKE LASHES!!</li>
            <li>the thick band was so hard to glued and won&#x27;t stay in place even I am using a nice brand of glue.</li>
            <li>Oh And before putting on fake eyelashes always apply black eyeliner that way they appear much more realistic.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that they are a bit on the cheap end, but can only be expected from the cost of the item.</li>

            <li> thing - the best lash adhesive on the planet has to be this stuff:</li>
            <li> They are disposable, as trying to remove the glue from the day before tends to jack up the shape of the lash strip, but still a great purchase!  </li>
            <li> I  am very happy with them</li>
            <li> Perfect for going out</li>

            <li> Amazing deal-</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> This was an amazing buy.</li>
            <li> 70 lashes for $15 Is an amazing deal I just want to know if I should buy this product</li>
            <li> Regarding the crisscross pair, I wanted to let everyone readingknow that when I received mine, the hairs were nicely crisscrossed</li>
            <li> however they were kind of stuck/clumped together</li>
            <li> However, after opening the box and seeing the amount i received and the variety, I was thrilled.</li>
            <li> I liked them</li>
            <li> I even used some of the thinner lashes to make my own bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> Nice assortment of styles.  </li>
            <li> Let be honest here..</li>
            <li> This eyelashes looks nice</li>
            <li> Such great quality and variety, for an awesome price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very picky about my lashes, I will explain to you my version of the perfect lashes.</li>
            <li> I kind of like that these are plastic</li>
            <li> They have a nice gloss to them.</li>
            <li> They have this band along the lashes that doesn&#x27;t look that nice.</li>
            <li> The set was nice.</li>
            <li> Nice price.</li>
            <li> nice variety of styles</li>
            <li> These are nice eyelashes, well packed and presented.</li>
            <li> but I saw so many good reviews here on amazon and YouTube</li>
            <li> The choices were nice, but some of the lashes ripped because they were glued to the plastic.</li>
            <li> (keep a q-tip handy for eye watering) because once water touches the glue your screwed.</li>
            <li> the drug store kind exceeding 4 dollars.</li>
            <li> Everything came in nice packaging and nothing was damaged.</li>
            <li> It nicely divided to service 3 females-</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very well made, don&#x27;t fall apart and look awesome.</li>
            <li> BUT the are nice and look nice.</li>
            <li> The variety in this pack is also nice.</li>
            <li> for to the eye nice also.</li>
            <li> Love love love the bundle of eye lashes I have to get another bundle soon!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very experienced with lashes, so that&#x27;s also why I am giving them this high of a rating.</li>
            <li> Obviously not the best quality, but still really great lashes for a fabulous price!</li>
            <li> so when theyr on your eyes they may bother you but if you use a good glue with good technique you shouldnt have a problem- saved loads of money on this its exactly what i was looking for thank you!</li>
            <li> They were of very good quality and honestly you really can&#x27;t beat that deal.</li>
            <li> I love them because i have many options and they are good quality</li>
            <li> It is very easy to put on.</li>
            <li> These break very easily.</li>
            <li> some were more adventurous than others, but there were lashes for everyone!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know how much more than 2 applications because I have so many to try now!</li>
            <li> The variety is nice, but like I said, very cheaply made. &#x27;</li>
            <li> I wear lashes just about everyday when I go to work or just to go out, they are PERFECT and they are reusable which is good too!</li>
            <li> Easy to bend which means easy to apply and they stay on great.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re fun during special occasions of course since they look awesome in pictures.</li>
            <li> I liked that was able to buy these lashes in bulk but some of them I could not use.</li>
            <li> nice my daughter love the choices</li>
            <li> the best style that stay on the longest is the natural looking one.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so nice to have so many</li>
            <li> but they look natural and great for any day use!</li>
            <li> but after you apply it, I&#x27;m sure no one really notices, so it still looks great! :)</li>
            <li> i saw some reviews that these eyelashes were cheap and also some reviews that they were good quality</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying this brand, I thought it was a good price for what you get, but if you&#x27;re expecting good quality lashes</li>
            <li> The ones that were good though were pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes, they are the best I have ever purchased, comfortable, easy to fit on my eye.</li>
            <li> They look great on and after a bit of adjusting them they disappear/blend right into my lashes.</li>
            <li> Easy choice either pay $15 for a pack of five or $12 for a pack of 70!</li>
            <li> 70 pairs makes it easy to rip off, toss, reapply eyeliner and then touch up my mascara if I still want to party the rest of the night!</li>
            <li> Shipping was very quick considering that I ordered on a Saturday!</li>
            <li> Can easily reuse!</li>
            <li> and im grateful that i got 70 pairs of unique good quality  lashes.</li>
            <li> The product was received on time, good condition, great price, but I didn&#x27;t like the product quality...not soft, did not work well.</li>
            <li> The best by far .... I would recommend these to many....</li>
            <li> This was pretty great.  </li>
            <li> I found this great deal and was willing to give them a shot.</li>
            <li> Love them...easy to apply if you&#x27;re experienced with putting on lashes...also easy to clean and reuse</li>
            <li> This seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li> so i ordered these, 70 pairs for $15, sounds to good to be true huh?</li>
            <li> They look very cheap.</li>
            <li> , thats all i can say, and very cheap compare to a $6 ones that you get at stores</li>
            <li> Do not buy them very cheaply made. &#x3D;</li>
            <li> These are high quality and gorgeous!</li>
            <li> and I was thrilled they were so easy to use.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t need to be amazing quality to look fine on camera.</li>
            <li> Again, at a quarter, I&#x27;m totally happy and will certainly be re-ordering.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THEM AS ALWAYS</li>
            <li> took them out of the box, and I think I&#x27;m already in love :)</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re way better quality than I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t believe I was able to get these many pairs of lashes at such a great price!  </li>
            <li> I love the many choices.  </li>
            <li> I love them for this purpose at this</li>
            <li> I love the look ....</li>
            <li> Love my eyes...</li>
            <li> there were many types I would not wear but for the price</li>

            <li> Love the variety of lashes....</li>
            <li> but obviously a spoolie will work perfectly) and ran the brush over the lashes while they were still adhered to the sheet.  </li>
            <li> I tested it out with a crisscross pair and it makes these lengthy lashes much more wearable.  </li>
            <li> (BTW using my husband&#x27;s Amazon account to purchase) :) DK</li>
            <li> i really ilke them and great price to ...</li>

            <li> (Although, for hygiene purposes I would throw a pair out if you have worn them 5 times or more...).</li>
            <li> I would love to buy these again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I love the way these lashes feel.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this lash pack</li>
            <li> I love these lashes they&#x27;re synthetic</li>
            <li> I wasnt sure of what to expect when this item arrived.</li>
            <li> so I almost never wear any of the more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking ones.&lt;br</li>

            <li> but I look cute in them</li>
            <li> Love the variety and quality.</li>
            <li> If you do manage to get them off of the packaging they come in, you wont be able to use them because they will be so misshapen that they dont allign with the curve of your eyelid.</li>
            <li> Well, surprisingly enough, they are the best lashes I&#x27;ve used yet!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> How can you beat 5 bucks for so many lashes, I give them to my friends before we go out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering again:)</li>

            <li> I HAVE RECIEVED BETTER ONS</li>
            <li> BUT THEY ARE DEFINETLY THE CHEAP KIND</li>
            <li> (most lashes need to be trimmed to size anyway) and they are not the quality that you can get at Sally&#x27;s or Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Most of the lashes that I apply are used once and thrown away so</li>
            <li> Bought some for my daughter and myself and we both love them.  </li>

            <li> I will def be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I have worn lashes for many years - the quality is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> She and her clients are quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> The more you use one pair</li>
            <li> Hope this review helps some of you :)</li>
            <li> I just love this product these lashes are my #1 go to in my beauty case</li>
            <li> It makes my eyes appear more awake and more youthful.  </li>
            <li> These lashes makes your eye make up stand out more.</li>
            <li> These are awesome, especially for someone who needs to be able to practice putting on lashes.  </li>
            <li> On top of that it took me a while to get the hang of it</li>
            <li> Finally, you don&#x27;t know what style will look best on your eyes until you try it.</li>
            <li> I love my lashes and love the variety.</li>
            <li> I think everyone need to buy, and will certainly be satisfied</li>
            <li> While these lashes are OK-- I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love the thickness of the strip.</li>
            <li> Even better price.</li>
            <li> My clients even love these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I love em</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll buy these again, but its going to be a while because I have sooo many :)</li>
            <li> &amp; I still love them.</li>
            <li> so many compliments.</li>
            <li> was able to reuse a couple.</li>
            <li> For sure, when \\&quot;putting on my face,\\&quot; I am satisfied with shadow, eyeliner and mascara.</li>
            <li> and I thought these would be ok.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> Omg I love love love these lashes.</li>
            <li> Such a great deal for the price!</li>
            <li> it was great to see lashes at such an affordable price, however it&#x27;d be good if the lash quality was better.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> So awesome with so many different styles.</li>
            <li> I will be getting more of these for sure.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to use a quality glue</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I love the variety that you get with this eyelashes</li>
            <li> I model, and they are ok for photo shoots.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Lol, not that I go out in goopy mascara, but you get my point:)</li>
            <li> Love all of them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> They are awesome and you get several choices which is neat.</li>
            <li> but most I wont be able to use on anyone..</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed the more conservative looking lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them on for a week already and love them.</li>
            <li> The price is great on these and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Great quality fast delivery</li>
            <li> Love these lashes</li>
            <li> Love the styles in the box.</li>
            <li> i love wearing lashes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s will make your eyeliner blend better.</li>
            <li> You probably won&#x27;t be able to curl them either.  </li>
            <li> This is a great buy due to getting a great price on so many lashes as well as getting so many types and styles of lashes.....</li>
            <li> but they are very good other wise.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with how quickly the package arrived.</li>
            <li> I received them fast and they are just like the photos!!!!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> today was very excited.</li>
            <li> Opening this package I was very excited to see what I purchased for my friend for Christmas.</li>
            <li> i was very excited to get it in the mail...</li>
            <li> Overall very nice!</li>
            <li> and I lost most of my eye lashes so this will be fun!!  </li>
            <li> I try to look for lashes that are comfortable, but these are so inexpensive, and really made quite beautifully and</li>
            <li> I thought it was a great deal and the lashes are of a decent quality.</li>
            <li> Otherwise theyre decent but hardly great.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my purchase and would highly recommend these lashes.</li>
            <li> Great price, high grade.</li>
            <li> they are also very real looking and blend in good with my lashes.</li>
            <li> The lashes are synthetic (seem \\&quot;plasticky\\&quot;) and are not of superb quality, however, they are okay, which is frankly better than I expected for</li>
            <li> I make soft sculpted dolls and these lashes are inexpensive and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> but these are still pretty good</li>
            <li> These lashes are pretty good quality they hold up well for me.</li>
            <li> Pretty good quality for their price.</li>
            <li> Excited to use them!</li>
            <li> Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I was expecting the gift came with a lot of different styles and the person I got them for liked them a lot !!</li>
            <li> So excited for this purchase!  </li>
            <li> Soo worth the price!!</li>
            <li> great for people that want to try a new look every once in a while.</li>
            <li> the 1st pair I tried worked perfectly and lasted through a very long night.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this very large set.</li>
            <li> They look great and stay on great with a little weave glue!</li>
            <li> Once she unpacked these, she could not stop complementing the product and how fantastic she looked and for your information I agreed as well as many others.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure you will enjoy.</li>
            <li> When I bent the band to better fit my eye</li>
            <li> Perfect for costume parties and if your going for the \\&quot;drag queen\\&quot; look.  </li>
            <li> however I think they&#x27;d be good for really glam looks or nights out with some tweaking.  </li>
            <li> but i am satisfied none the less great buy!</li>
            <li> They are very clean , not plasticy and shiney like cheap ones</li>
            <li> I will probably never have to buy lashes again since I do not wear them daily or anything, but these are good quality lashes!</li>
            <li> Have fun! :)</li>
            <li> The smallest style isn&#x27;t that impressive, but again it would work for bottom lashes or for layering with other, fuller</li>
            <li> not the best selection of lashes they are not pretty stlyes.</li>
            <li> I will never run out with these endless options that are perfect for the stage.</li>
            <li> easy to apply...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so exciting that I will be able to get more looks out of them this way.  </li>
            <li> I love the veriety, their are some lashes that are natrual, sexy, and fun.</li>
            <li> But I will get more of these when I run low because they are great.</li>
            <li> Really you do get a nice variety of looks, and I love the value.</li>
            <li> They are so easy to put on..</li>
            <li> The thicker lashes were easy to put on</li>
            <li> I was able to clean and reuse the thicker lashes, but I couldn&#x27;t do it with the thinner ones.</li>
            <li> The bands are easy to work with, no problems with stiffness or &amp;#34;popping up&amp;#34; while trying to affix with glue.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, the sticky residue that attaches them to the plastic makes it easy to wrap the lashed around your brushes to shape them for even easier application.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and rec&#x27;d the item very quickly.  </li>
            <li> So easy to use.  </li>
            <li> After seeing so many good reviews I was surprised to have this problem.</li>
            <li> the come in a that box and the strips are easy to get them off.</li>
            <li> You can change up your look easily with these.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t bend easy and the lashes almost look plastic.</li>
            <li> They are easy to apply and work with.</li>
            <li> As written before, they dont bend easy..</li>
            <li> My happeness went away very quickly..</li>
            <li> There are 2 hair type styles included that are very bold, but they have that hair type feathery feel to them.</li>
            <li> I love them, such a great deal.</li>
            <li> I love lashes that look great and are relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> If you wear lashes everyday like I do or fairly often then these will be great for you.  </li>
            <li> I use the thiner ones to work because they easily blend in w/</li>
            <li> i love this bundle pack, it has a great variety of different sizes and looks.</li>
            <li> I wanted lashes that I could easily wear during the day but these lashes are costume like.</li>
            <li> Great buy and will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> They are easy to apply.</li>
            <li> No doubt that I would repurchase:) a great price especially with</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s an easy fix</li>
            <li> but they are easy to use and apply.</li>
            <li> So many different variety, great quality and quantity.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to be able to order the ones I really like from this pack in bulk.</li>
            <li> i strongly recomend this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good product and Nice selection of different styles of eye lashes for all occasions.</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and are all in good shape &amp; pretty, not to mention the money your saving.</li>
            <li> and these work amazing and look real !</li>
            <li> Of course who could turn down 70 LASHES FOR AN AWESOME PRICE LIKE THAT?!</li>
            <li> received seven different styles and was very pleased to receive some \\&quot;natural\\&quot; styles along with the newer, trendy, feathery-style lashes.</li>
            <li> This product suits me fine.  </li>
            <li> Once you loosen them up a bit they are fine.</li>
            <li> and they stick perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> this is a great deal but most of the lashes are too long for me.</li>
            <li> but I cut them and they were fine.</li>
            <li> And always easy to put on and comfortable to wear, when placed correctly.</li>
            <li> So much so that I have ordered more for another one of my daughters!</li>
            <li> The main thing I liked about these is in order to save for later use the glue will peel right off without leaving residue which is great!</li>
            <li> The price was so cheap on these I was expecting to receive a lower end product - which I was fine with, I use them for dolls.</li>
            <li> :)) I am going to keep buying them forever haha!!</li>
            <li> but that probably because I have huge eyes.</li>
            <li> and I can always trim to fit my eye length.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried about buying these since some of the reviews said they were cheap.</li>
            <li> I had to cut them to fit</li>
            <li> not only was this bundle a GREAT value but</li>
            <li> They are cheap.</li>
            <li> Cheap product.</li>
            <li> Still, even when I accounted for those, I was still happy with the price and selection and will 100% use this product in the future.</li>
            <li> There are times that I have to work with these lashes by bending them a bit to easily fit my eye shape.  </li>
            <li> I know all the lashes lightly sticks to the box</li>
            <li> Its such a great price if it weren&#x27;t for that defect.</li>
            <li> I know they were cheap lashes, but</li>
            <li> but I bought them anyway taking a chance they were cheaply made or tacky looking.</li>
            <li> I enjoy my lashes.</li>
            <li> These were CHEAP and they are CHEAP.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re looking for some usable cheap ones.</li>
            <li> I alway enjoy using each set of lashes for photo shoots and weddings.</li>
            <li> The rest of the lashes are great, I&#x27;ll definitely use them all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was cheap</li>
            <li> Yes they&#x27;re cheap, but I&#x27;m a dancer and the girls</li>
            <li> in the box look AMAZING trying to put on not so much.</li>
            <li> They arent flimsy or cheap.</li>
            <li> these are so worth it because the price and you can wear it more than once, in stores, one will be $3-$10, depending which one you like and material</li>
            <li> This is a lot for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> This is extremely important when applying lashes because you want to prevent the lash from lifting.</li>
            <li> This item is a great value for the price, and I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> You can tell the lashes are cheap.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;just a few tips for the way they work best for me...</li>
            <li> These are a great set of lashes and especially for the price!</li>
            <li> These fantastic eyelashes will draw attention to your  eyes making every blink a sweeping sensation.</li>
            <li> , we can freely loan (give) a pair to a teammate who forgot hers.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughters, they seem to enjoy it</li>
            <li> its just great overall!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> But overall it&#x27;s a great addition to any make-up kit</li>
            <li> Great variety of lashes for different occasions.</li>
            <li> These lashes are quite cheap in quality.  </li>
            <li> The price is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Different style were great.</li>
            <li> but I do enjoy them on occasion.</li>
            <li> It is a great buy especially if you wear them all the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So its a great product if your just starting out and want the practice.</li>
            <li> but really good last i will buy them again :)</li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t pay much for them, since I definitely won&#x27;t be able to use every pair.</li>
            <li> i love this item it come right on time.</li>
            <li> so i got these eyelashes last week and let me just say that i am absolutly in love with this product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super super pleased with these eyelashes</li>
            <li> I like that they are lightweight, easy to apply, and super comfortable.</li>
            <li> get a nice variety of lashes, from full, glam types, to the more natural daytime looks.</li>
            <li> Past the fussing around when trying to apply them though, they are great lashes for an amazing price.</li>
            <li> There are many different styles in here, and they are relatively easy to put on and nice to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These, however, are great, and I love that there&#x27;s a selection of different lashes ranging from more modest to daring.</li>
            <li> These lashes are a very good value, and they are very good quality, but they are a little too extreme.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to hear about this bundle from Andrea&#x27;s Choice on YouTube that I just had to buy it.</li>
            <li> and she was excited to receive them.</li>
            <li> When i got this package on my door, i was excited to see them.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get these lashes because I&#x27;m now getting into falsies</li>
            <li> I was pleased and they arrived on the exact date they were estimated to arrive on.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price, you cant beat it with a stick!</li>
            <li> I was excited about these lashes when I received them.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> First off, the thicker band gives more surface area to attach to your eyelids.</li>
            <li> Took a bit to get here as they had a long way to travel to me here in CO, but great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> For anyone who considers buying this item, I would recommend spend more money,but buy a better quality product that you actually will be able to use.</li>
            <li> If you tried to clean up the glue adhesive (that&#x27;s already on it)</li>
            <li> Sort of like you&#x27;re blowing your breath on glasses to clean them off.</li>
            <li> Granted they are not the best quaily if you are  a professional makeup artist and like the human hair ones</li>
            <li> I have gotten pretty good with detecting which side is suppose to be or looks better at being the outer lash as opposed to the inner lash.</li>
            <li> wow, all I can say is ahhhhhhhmazing qualiyu, im in love!</li>
            <li> They look great &amp; have a good variety of natural to more dramatic but are not over the top.</li>
            <li> I use lashes for special occasions and these have never let me down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is right!</li>
            <li> Well, I was right!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get these-</li>
            <li> My daughter said she liked only a certain kind</li>
            <li> The quality is not really that great, even on the thinner lashes.</li>
            <li> Great for stage makeup and drag.</li>
            <li> Such a great variety if you have many clients that may desire lashes to complete the look.</li>
            <li> This product arrived sooner than expected and in Great condition.</li>
            <li> Good price for as many as you get hopefully it will be dark where ever you are</li>
            <li> jusr put some mascara on the lashes to fluff them up and it&#x27;ll look great</li>
            <li> style I&#x27;ve tried so far has been amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is not what i had expected it to be, i read these reviews and they all said great things about it.</li>
            <li> They are fabulous and def worth buying wether</li>
            <li> I read most of the reviews and they were very helpful.</li>
            <li> only 3 out of 7 were good for my eyes&lt;</li>
            <li> Only thing is that you have to buy your own glue which is not a big deal, there are lots of glue out there that works well, the one i use is by Darkness and works great with these.</li>
            <li> Overall good lashes</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> The band isn&#x27;t too thick, and the length is perfect for my eyes though the lashes do feel and look a lot like plastic.</li>
            <li> the rest are really full.</li>
            <li> I have saved so much money with buying these lashes, and I love the variety.</li>
            <li> Most of them were very dramatic/thick - not the look</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase these lashes because they look FULL.</li>
            <li> I think they hold their shape better than real hair eyelashes and would recommend these to anyone</li>
            <li> A reasonable deal, with mostly usable lashes.</li>
            <li> They all loved playing with the different lashes...</li>
            <li> These came really fast, and I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> So they are reusable, if you take care of them and are gentle. :)</li>
            <li> Overall they are good for the price.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving them a 4 is because the lashes are not \\&quot;great\\&quot; but Good.</li>
            <li> so I could have a full look.</li>
            <li> Love this soooo much will be buying it again</li>
            <li> so these are still lasting after almost a year, but when I do wear them, they look good.</li>
            <li> Love all of them fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have trichtotrillomania and have never had a full set of eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Love these absolutely a must have for me.</li>
            <li> They get the job done, and if applied correctly with a good glue will last all</li>
            <li> There is a good variety of different style lashes also.</li>
            <li> However, the more natural looking lashes have bands that are reasonably easy to apply, and with a little practice I was able to get them on and have them looking amazing!</li>
            <li> but I was lucky enough to find this pack of lashes which I thought would be to good to be true</li>
            <li> The package was easy to open and the lashes are AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I will admit that these are slightly less quality than the 4 dollar ones but the price is so good that it more than makes up for it.</li>
            <li> i like all the choices and they all fit perfectly right out of the box, no need for trimming.</li>
            <li> , I pulled a pair of lashes off of each tray and it came off pretty easy.  </li>
            <li> I get the cheap ones at my local store and they were better!</li>
            <li> the only reason I am giving a 4 Star &amp; not 5 is because I reallly wish they were more human hair like instead of being plastic but for the price there really good :)</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with my new lashes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some success picking some of it off with my tweezers or clean fingernails</li>
            <li> This lash set offers a wide variety of lashes to choose from, and the best part is the price.</li>
            <li> I love that they come in so many different styles as well.</li>
            <li> Plus, who is touching your eyelashes to see if they&#x27;re realistic feeling?</li>
            <li> They obviously aren&#x27;t the best quality, I suggest only buying them if you&#x27;re practicing to put eyelashes on.</li>
            <li> There is a variety of styles but mostly bold looks.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be ordering again, not for a while since I have so many now :)</li>
            <li> This is not only a great price but the lashes look so real.</li>
            <li> So many lashes so many different looks to achieve.</li>
            <li> Love the many different styles that are included in the box.  </li>
            <li> just wish all 70 pairs were all the same type as my favorite set of them all :)</li>
            <li> It was affordable and it came in the mail quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> They can be pretty stiff, but with the right glue, and after you cut to size, you&#x27;ll have flawless lashes.</li>
            <li> highly recommend. :]</li>
            <li> There is also a crisscross style which is very pretty.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good as any other cheap lashes.</li>
            <li> This product proves true, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I didnt see any similar enough to my favorite style &amp;#34;Demi Wispies&amp;#34; but Im satisfied with what I purchased!!</li>
            <li> This product arrived in a few days and I love them many different styles and a great price i will be buying this product again</li>
            <li> and I was happy with their previous products</li>
            <li> and it is most used and favorite amazon.com purchase in a long time.</li>
            <li> I wish they were softer but overall pretty good buy.</li>
            <li> For the price these lashes are awesome and last long.</li>
            <li> Also they ship this fast!!</li>
            <li> I knew I was recieving 70 pairs, but you dont realize exactly how many that is until you open the box! :-)  </li>
            <li> Definitely buying more!</li>
            <li> They go from a more natural look to glamorous!  </li>
            <li> When I took the lashes out, I simply fell in love!</li>
            <li> but I love them so far!</li>
            <li> Pretty amazing set for such a cheap price.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it so far!</li>
            <li> Since most single drugstore eyelash falsies cost three dollars or more, this monster bundle...the price per eyelash strip is a joke...</li>
            <li> I recommend these to anyone who wants fuller, natural looking, sexy lashes!</li>
            <li> Great for guests that may need a little help with they &amp;#34;swag&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> But still great look just wish was a little shorter</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great buy hands down 🙌!</li>
            <li> This product is great and not cheap quality.</li>
            <li> the material is very plastic like and the lashes are cheap.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These lashes aren&#x27;t made from natural hair, which in my case, is awesome because you don&#x27;t get the same humidity and fragility problems that you would otherwise have with a natural lash product.</li>
            <li> Amazing choice for the low price!</li>
            <li> You get 70 pair of lashes for a great price and the hairs dont feel heavy on your eyelids.</li>
            <li> When I saw that I could get 70 pairs for $15.99 and free shipping with Prime, I couldn&#x27;t order fast enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have purchased this twice, because I truly do believe it is WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> I cut some of the more natural lashes apart and applied as singles.</li>
            <li> putting them on is no problem, it was well worth the money</li>
            <li> Three of the styles are spaced out and more natural, varying in length and taper.  </li>
            <li> This product is really worth its price.</li>
            <li> I def think this is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Well worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li> The fun lashes.</li>
            <li> There was just one individual set that looked like it was cut kind of.</li>
            <li> Also I liked using every one of the 7 styles, especially the criss-cross lashes.</li>
            <li> Still fun to wear for night time.</li>
            <li> The pack comes with a variety but the thicker lashes look much more natural than the thinner.</li>
            <li> I let them choose their own lashes before I apply and they are definitely wowed when I take them out for them to see.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> After getting tired of looking for the perfect mascara I decided to give these a go...</li>
            <li> Then its always fun .</li>
            <li> They are reusable and I feel definitely worth the cost.</li>
            <li> You get a variety of different lashes which is nice.</li>
            <li> Worth the price compared to a pair in retail stores</li>
            <li> It is worth the money to try them out.  </li>
            <li> There are soooo many choices and they look like professional quality.</li>
            <li> Nice if your just starting out to use lashes and need some to practice with.</li>
            <li> I will have so much fun playing with alll the looks.</li>
            <li> There are several choices in styles which is nice.</li>
            <li> Try it guys because its worth the money.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> But they are worth the buck.</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t tried them all but so far I&#x27;m satisfied, going to a party soon</li>
            <li> Fun, Fun,</li>
            <li> Fun</li>
            <li> REALLY WORTH IT FOR THE PRICE</li>
            <li> really worth the cost</li>
            <li> Although they take an excessive amount of time to bend and glue on, they look beautiful blended in with your lashes.</li>
            <li> Took these with me to Vegas and got several of my girlfriends buying their own eyelash bundle.</li>
            <li> They are nicely organized on individual strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only found one kind, but am stuck with 70 of them.</li>
            <li> These are so much fun to play with.</li>
            <li> Not all are the ones I like but still worth it.</li>
            <li> It comes in a different variety of styles but no glue, you&#x27;ll have to buy that on your own.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re certainly not day appropriate for most people</li>
            <li> The larger sizes are ready to wear right out of the box, and the smaller lashes are perfect for layering together or for wearing as bottom lashes.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase, but I wish I could purchase just one particular style because I&#x27;m not gonna get the most use out of the more natural style lashes.</li>
            <li> They barely bend which is good for a straighter lid, which an asian girlfriend of mine could use it just fine, but no one else.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The thinner ones are ok but the more dramatic ones aren&#x27;t so nice.</li>
            <li> The price to me is amazing, and if you have $16 (plus possible shipping) to spare and want to become comfortable with lashes I would HIGHLY recommend grabbing these as they ring in at about 23 cents per pair.  </li>
            <li> They are certainly not high quality, and you need to be pretty good at eyelashes to apply them.</li>
            <li> So I was a little worried getting this because it seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li> &quot; lashes set - seemed a little too good to be true</li>
            <li> I love using them for special occasions, such as chaperoning Prom, Gradnite, Graduation, weddings etc.</li>
            <li> Lashes come right apart when you take them of the holder.</li>
            <li> They send it right away</li>
            <li> Very wide though so that&#x27;s good if not just cut them.</li>
            <li> if you want a dramatic effect (which I love!) will be buying again!!!</li>
            <li> Normal price for a good set of human hair lashes run about $3 to $7 depending on the brand and the store</li>
            <li> These lashes are a little plastic-y, and they might not be great for people who want lashes to accentuate their everyday or more natural look, but for performers this set is a pretty good deal.  </li>
            <li> All styles are really cute and different, from a fun night out type to a more natural type.</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping, I was surprised!</li>
            <li> One day, more natural, the next day I look more vamp.</li>
            <li> I wish you had the option of buying a bundle with your fave styles because I don&#x27;t really like the ultra full ones</li>
            <li> The lashes are great and the price is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> When I applied the smaller, more natural lash, I thought they were ok.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not careful, you&#x27;ll get those cheap, flimsy ones that look like they&#x27;re made out of reinforced sewing thread!  </li>
            <li> Even if they are too long, thats where scissors come in handy.</li>
            <li> Kind of too long for my eyelids ( not the lash length)</li>
            <li> Looks good on, easy to use, last long time, can use over and over again.</li>
            <li> If your wanting more natural looking lashes, this may not be your first choice, but if your a diva like me, than your going to be quiet pleased with your purchase.</li>
            <li> Intensity goes from natural to drag queen lol</li>
            <li> No one has lashes that thick and perfect naturally</li>
            <li> Pros:  -Super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Human Hair lashes are much easier to apply and they look amazing.</li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist and need my falsies to easily adhere to my client&#x27;s lashes and stay put.</li>
            <li> These are GREAT with several different styles!</li>
            <li> But they are all beautiful styles and long enough to clip to the length that I need them to be!</li>
            <li> You will need your own glue, but overall for the price this is an absolute steal.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t bend on their own, so when you pull them off the white plastic case, they come off as a straight line.</li>
            <li> The bulk nature of the product really came in handy when she was asked to do the makeup for her entire dance troupe.</li>
            <li> The lashes are SYNTHETIC hair, so they are a bit more stiff and take a skilled hand to glue on.</li>
            <li> When used right, you can get multiple uses out of any one pair, and they&#x27;re not horrible quality.  </li>
            <li> Overall, the price is right and you get a ton of OK lashes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product you will love it, I just love the wide band on the lash line and the natural look that it gives and how it bring out the beauty in your eyes!!!!</li>
            <li> And when you take it off the plastic, it&#x27;s very straight.</li>
            <li> Very light on my clients eyes and very simple to apply.</li>
            <li> These lashes are very cheaply made - all plastic, not real human hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy these, there are plenty of other websites that sell better lashes for cheap.</li>
            <li> At stores you pay at least 4 bucks per pair if you are lucky, the amount you get for these and not to mention the variety, really makes me happy.</li>
            <li> The thinner the band, the better, and these bands are definitely not very thin compared to many more expensive products.</li>
            <li> Overall, for $15, you can&#x27;t beat how many you get.</li>
            <li> I reuse my favorite ones, and I would definitely recommend these lashes to a friend.</li>
            <li> I like these better than Sally&#x27;s because they are lighter then regular ones and you forget you&#x27;re even wearing them.</li>
            <li> The last style of lashes are really cute and they crisscross.  </li>
            <li> but I love them all the same.  </li>
            <li> I would love to try those next, if they offer them.</li>
            <li> (thats when i finally run outn:) )</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d definitely buy again :)</li>
            <li> At first you might think that you would never wear them</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant at first on purchasing this item but figured for the price, what did I have to lose.</li>
            <li> i love the different variety of lashes.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s more time-consuming, I&#x27;ll be going back to that method.  </li>
            <li> I love to alter the length for different effects.</li>
            <li> As an avid user of lashes, I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love MAC but can&#x27;t afford them for daily use.</li>
            <li> then what I like, but as a makeup artist I go through a lot of lashes and this will help me out so much!</li>
            <li> And then I had so many different styles to choose from!</li>
            <li> Shipping was extremely fast also!</li>
            <li> thx ;)</li>
            <li> I love to double up on them too</li>
            <li> The Bundle Monster 70 Pairs Fake Eyelashes are just wonderful to have especially if you love doing makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that the Bundle Monster eyelashes are back in stock.</li>
            <li> This was the first pack of eyelashes</li>
            <li> They had akword and unnatural shapes to them and also they fall apart the first time you remove them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is an absolute steal!  </li>
            <li> I love that I have a variety of styles to choose from, that suits my needs for different occasions.  </li>
            <li> obviously the MAC ones look and feel better</li>
            <li> I wanted more bang for my buck instead of constantly buying indiviual packs at $2.99 each.</li>
            <li> You will have to manuvor the lashes for your eye but they are pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> Well, that&#x27;s exactly what I got.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I have a choice from multiple eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Other than that I love the box of lashes!</li>
            <li> this is my first time buying lashes with them.</li>
            <li> After watching several youtube videos I felt pretty confident.</li>
            <li> On a side note here, this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried these sort of lashes</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy them again:)</li>
            <li> Very plastic and rigid!</li>
            <li> I ordered these with hesitance based on some of the reviews; however what I have found is they are exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I thought these were ok until I actually wore the first pair.</li>
            <li> Many different kinds in the box.</li>
            <li> Crappy quality, spend the extra money and get better lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn all of the different styles of lashes, and to my surprise the thicker lashes look a lot better.</li>
            <li> Although I love these lashes, I will explain why i only gave them a 3 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many different styles of lashes.</li>
            <li> Many styles, but I will stick with what I know next time.</li>
            <li> Better luck next time!</li>
            <li> yes they arent the best quality in fake lashes</li>
            <li> Love them second time I&#x27;ve order a set like these</li>
            <li> I had been buying in the store as the lashes went on sale and they rarely last more than 2 uses.</li>
            <li> And not to brag on how fast the arrived !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;i ve only worn one pair of these lashes and I&#x27;ve reused them about 4 times, I&#x27;ve never been able to do that.  </li>
            <li> Comes in 7 different stylish designs.</li>
            <li> I am an avid lash wearer.</li>
            <li> The actual lash itself looked ok but didn&#x27;t give my eyes that flirty pretty look</li>
            <li> This is girly heaven in a box that is not expensive.</li>
            <li> theres more and different lashs.</li>
            <li> ; Will I order more in the future?</li>
            <li> , More than likely, Yes, P.S. my lashes came within two days of my purchase!</li>
            <li> they really are worth it.</li>
            <li> If you are concerned about discomfort just take the 2 extra minutes to take the glue off your lashes :)</li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> I love the different styles for day and night.</li>
            <li> Con would be the lack of any glue, then again it didn&#x27;t advertise any so DUO works pretty well.</li>
            <li> These are not the same quality as Ardell (which is a drug store fave of mine), BUT they are okay.  </li>
            <li> They definitely work better for those that are used to putting on falsies.</li>
            <li> The profile of the strip itself is more oblong than circular, further helping with the eyelashes-</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> and I think they were made for more almond or Asian eyes.</li>
            <li> I love these, and the different eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Love that there is such a variety.</li>
            <li> At the store they are prices way higher.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the criss-cross ones yet, but they look pretty funky.</li>
            <li> Love the different styles of lashes.</li>
            <li> but there are so many different varieties</li>
            <li> and i love them, there are seven cards with ten pairs of lashes ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s just a few that aren&#x27;t good and not the rest of the box.</li>
            <li> But if you take good care of the eyelashes you can reuse them a few times.</li>
            <li> I guess I already knew half of it would be unwearable, but it seemed so cheap for so many</li>
            <li> I think these are super fun lashes and not everyday lashes.</li>
            <li> The natural ones look very natural, and im able to reuse them without them being ruined.</li>
            <li> Lots of options with these lashes from thick to more length!!</li>
            <li> The other lashes though are really nice.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve used other brands that look like it would be your own lashes.</li>
            <li> They take a little maneuvering (trimming, bending) to get them really looking good.</li>
            <li> Decent variety, kind of cheap and hard to bend, but hey for the price it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> There are some I&#x27;d wear daily but most of them are very unnatural looking.</li>
            <li> of these lashes are good quality and can be used several times if removed and cleaned properly.</li>
            <li> Super soft lashes!</li>
            <li> /&gt;They come very nicely organized and you can find the thinner ones at the top which if worn look totally natural but give an extra little push of elegance and beauty and delicacy!  </li>
            <li> However, with all the positive reviews, I had to try these.</li>
            <li> It takes me a long time to get through all pairs and some I like more than others.</li>
            <li> If I mess up, there are 69 more pairs to keep trimming!</li>
            <li> Who wouldn&#x27;t love long lashes for every occasion?</li>
            <li> These will retain the shape after you remove them really well, I&amp;#34;ve been using my first pair about 5 times now</li>
            <li> I like falsies that do not have a huge gap separation between each lash, because although my real lashes are fairly long they aren&#x27;t that full.</li>
            <li> Love the variety, came in good length so at least they weren&#x27;t too short</li>
            <li> I usually go to a drug store or Sally&#x27;s, but I like I said I loved the bundle idea.</li>
            <li> i love the lashes, and if you take good care of them, they usually last 2-3 days, at least for me they do.</li>
            <li> Easy to cut and apply, long lasting, they hold their shape well, and the variety in the package makes for fabulous versatility!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge lash wearer, usually just for going out or special occasions, Lashes usually cost me $4-$6 a pair at the drug store, so when I saw this, i thought it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> This was such an amazing find for someone like myself who wears them almost everyday thanks SO MUCH bundle monster!!!!</li>
            <li> received these lashes in less than 2 days of ordering, they are in a nice package like the picture.</li>
            <li> the packaging makes it easy to take care of the lashes for multiple uses.</li>
            <li> Most of these were too dramatic for my own taste, but I really like them regardless.</li>
            <li> There are two sets that are kind of natural but still long.</li>
            <li> I really love my eyelashes every single pair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a freelance makeup artist &amp; do events where I&#x27;m applying lashes in large volumes.</li>
            <li> They look super fake lol</li>
            <li> The lashes are a little hard to work with, and feel heavy, but once they are on they look amazing, and it&#x27;s a great deal for the price, all of the different styles are really nice!</li>
            <li> you cannot beat the price, even if they end up only good for a single use each.</li>
            <li> They are easily trimmed down to fit your eye shape and are great for dramatic looks.</li>
            <li> Most MUAs I&#x27;ve come across on the net say that these type are the hardest to apply, but after trying natural lashes, I&#x27;d have to disagree!  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not the same quality as the store bought ones, but I like them just fine for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this bundle deal so many lashes to choose from the only downside was that 3 out of the 7 different styles are exactly the same</li>
            <li> If you are new to false lashes, here is a really great tip for application; snip the weft of lashes into 3-4 big sections and apply one section at a time, that way it wont keep popping up in the corners while you try to adhere them to your lid :)</li>
            <li> It was a good deal, but the material made the eyelashes hard to glue it on.</li>
            <li> They are gorgeous &amp;&amp; hardly shed.</li>
            <li> If these are too long you can always cut them and also a fun trick is to cut some of them in half for those cute wispy demi lashes at the end of your eyes, it gives such an adorable flirty look !</li>
            <li> Fantastic economic necessary and luxurious indeed.</li>
            <li> I guess I can&#x27;t say much on this since I paid such a cheap amount.</li>
            <li> Depending on the type of lashes you prefer determines how much you will like the product.  </li>
            <li> When I wear those, people assume the lashes are real.  </li>
            <li> I just buy the whole box and get rid of rid of what I don&#x27;t like&lt;br /&gt;Great lashes.</li>
            <li> Onto the specifics of the lashes themselves and why I like them so much . . .</li>
            <li> Shipping was freaky fast too.</li>
            <li> but you have to take the lash off carefull if you them fast they will brake</li>
            <li> Not so much.  </li>
            <li> Its compact enough for me to leave out on my makeup station and have it not be obtrusive, yet the lashes inside are secure and they were not damaged in transit.</li>
            <li> very plastic.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really recommend getting these from Amazon...</li>
            <li> I would recommend these lashes unless you&#x27;re really picky about your lashes.</li>
            <li> The quality of the lashes is really plastic-y.</li>
            <li> Very plastic looking.</li>
            <li> They worked very well</li>
            <li> The shipping was exceedingly fast too.</li>
            <li> Very shinny</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest these!</li>
            <li> These lashes arrived fast, I ordered them Saturday with 2 day shipping and somehow they got to me Monday in CA.</li>
            <li> They got to my door fast~</li>
            <li> THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> These are very plastic not hair looking..</li>
            <li> whole lash  would be a bit much.theatre,dance.pagents.modeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been practicing with these opposed to wearing them out, I&#x27;ve been ripping them on and off repeatedly without any change to the shape, so they seem really durable.</li>
            <li> but these were just too much.</li>
            <li> This has saved me so much money.</li>
            <li> I was really going for.</li>
            <li> I ended up getting Ardell and was much happier.</li>
            <li> I really dont care for these lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li> It is very luxurious, Much comfort.</li>
            <li> These are made of plastic, but you really can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li> and I really looked like a drag queen (minus the manly features lol).  </li>
            <li> But for real life?</li>
            <li> They look and feel real.</li>
            <li> I also use the on some stuffed giraffes and they really put the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> i really like the selection of the lashes.  </li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t look real at all not even close.</li>
            <li> but they arent real hair</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t care for them.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind it looking really un-natural</li>
            <li> There is too much adhesive on the lashes for them to stick to the molding in their packaging.</li>
            <li> Feel real and looks like it too.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real</li>
            <li> I really like the diversity of styles and lengths.  </li>
            <li> THe lashes are absolutely beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually really like these eyelash extension.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> believe they give you day and night versions of eyelashes, will be batting these cognac eyes at the fella very soon.</li>
            <li> the edge stabbed your eye and really hurts.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t cost as much either.</li>
            <li> Really accents the eyes</li>
            <li> I think I will purchase this again, they really are reusable.</li>
            <li> They are very shiny and plastic.  </li>
            <li> However, given the price/quantity, I really can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t ready to give up that look</li>
            <li> Priced very affordable.</li>
            <li> Gave these as a Christmas gift to my sister and she absolutely LOVES them and has worn them all year.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s so much variety to choose from.  </li>
            <li> The quality is MUCH lower than what I am used to.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re actually really flexible.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s absolutely adores it</li>
            <li> A very versatile set of lashes for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> They look very unnatural.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li> I really like the variety of eyelashes that come with this bundle.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> It comes with 7 different styles to fit all occasions and all looks.</li>
            <li> Will absolutely buy again and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> and they are ready to put on.</li>
            <li> and we both highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> There is just one set out of the seven that I can actually use without being mistaken for a cheap hooker.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t glue very well.</li>
            <li> and I really tried to like them.</li>
            <li> I feel like my money&#x27;s just so much better spent on mink lashes.</li>
            <li> and I feel like they take away from my whole look instead of enhancing it.</li>
            <li> These were a good value in that you got so many pairs of eyelashes, but unfortunately, these are not at all natural looking.</li>
            <li> I pulled and pulled as gently as I could and ended up ripping out a few of my own lashes in the process.</li>
            <li> The band was wayy too thick to even get a good curve to stick on to the lash line.</li>
            <li> They are easy to apply and stay on for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> Missing 5 lashes, they are VERY durable and steady, the glue is SO easy to remove, however I had to cut some full models in halves because they are plastic</li>
            <li> Normally $15 would only get you 3 or 5 pairs, 70 pairs is a damn fine bargain.</li>
            <li> Excited to wear them in public!!</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m pretty sure these aren&#x27;t the highest quality lashes you can find on the market, I couldn&#x27;t have been happier with the product in relation to how little I paid for them.</li>
            <li> I was excited because the set included multiples of the various styles.  </li>
            <li> And the lower heavier eyelashes are more glamourous, some totally extreme</li>
            <li> I find that I have to use more glue with these than other brands.</li>
            <li> These lashes are not super high end (like brands such as Dolly Wink) but they are good for everyday use and you can use a pair of eyelashes more than once if you take care of them !</li>
            <li> I like the look but the clients I have put them on felt they were too long (and I used the more natural looking</li>
            <li> Lastly, these lashes will need to be wrapped around a brush handle or pinky finger to make them a bit more pliable because of the band, or you may just want to save yourself some aggravation and cut them in either half/thirds/fourths and apply the pieces to your lash line (a lot of people do this for ease of application with lashes in general).  </li>
            <li> It was very cost effective purchasing the product, being as though 1 pack of lashes usually run anywhere from 3 to $4 a pack.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the box, I saw the more natural ones vs the more dramatic ones</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price at all, but quality wise i am not impressed.</li>
            <li> but these eyelashes are good for experimenting on what type of false lashes you would be interested in using.</li>
            <li> Some of the thicker lashes can be a little bit stiffer so you&#x27;ll have to press them to your eyes until the glue is completely dry, but otherwise great.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest the person wearing them also trim them down a great deal since they&#x27;re rather wide.</li>
            <li> After i take them off i just wash it under warm water and use a tissue to tap dry and then store them for next time</li>
            <li> These lashes are strong enough to be reused about 4x or more depending how gently you remove old glue from them, but I usually just peel/rip off the old glue and them give them a quick rinse off the mascara before reapplying.</li>
            <li> You do need to cut them to fit your eye because they are rather long.</li>
            <li> As with any pair of falsies, you should trim the edges so that they fit your eyes (as they&#x27;re made long on purpose).</li>
            <li> Now for a true Diva that is 7 different looks.</li>
            <li> I have a Youtube Channel ([...]) in which I review this and many other products!</li>
            <li> I bought thses around the holidays 26December and recieved them before New years eve!</li>
            <li> Did I mention I&#x27;m new at falsies?!</li>
            <li> so I will get to try a new look!</li>
            <li> But for the price I will probably purchase again because I love a few of the styles so much.</li>
            <li> Decent look and wear depending on your use.</li>
            <li> Of course those are more expensive :)</li>
            <li> It is more difficult to save them for more than one performance since they don&#x27;t have cases but the girls figured out how.</li>
            <li> i love there are several different looks in this affordable kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the easiest way to get the lashes to curve a little more than they were made to is to bend them completely in a circle and blow your hot breath on them.</li>
            <li> They make you feel very pretty, like your in one of those mascara commercials and actually have the effect they advertise.</li>
            <li> I love to mess with make up</li>
            <li> usually i spend 4.99 for just one set,  good quality and really neat &amp; different styles,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have one high quality pair of lashes then a box of these.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if your on a stage every night, then these high drama lashes might work for you.</li>
            <li> I am giving this 5 stars because I didn&#x27;t have high expectations when i bought this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend  this product and seller</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend them</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these lashes to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> When I read the other reviews, quite a few people said they were great lashes for the price.</li>
            <li> This comes with different sizes, this can do no wrong!</li>
            <li> They are cheaper but if you roll them in your fingers for awhile they are a little more flexible.</li>
            <li> I was so happily surprised with this box!!  </li>
            <li> if you wiggle the lashes around they are a little more movable for gluing</li>
            <li> It looks as if they are made of plastic and arent really easy to apply due to the stiffness of them.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with these, you&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> However, I find that they are really matted together and does not have a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow I Really Like Them</li>
            <li> They really look natural on her</li>
            <li> so I would have lashes on hand if I ever need them and so far, I don&#x27;t really NEED them.</li>
            <li> I decided after watching some YouTube videos and reading reviews here that at this low price it would be worth it to grab these.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an economical way to assure they all have the same style.</li>
            <li> i am able to wear them a few times too.</li>
            <li> This will last me a while, definitely worth getting if you don&#x27;t want to continue purchasing lashes all the time.</li>
            <li> I read another review that said the same thing, but i took the risk and bought it anyway (totally worth it).</li>
            <li> with such a variety, it was totally worth</li>
            <li> You have to hold them to shape for a while longer than normal ones.</li>
            <li> you wear all styles of the lashes for normal days?</li>
            <li> A few styles look okay</li>
            <li> And not sharp!!&lt;br /&gt;You can tell these are good quality false lashes.</li>
            <li> Also I found that if you cut the thicker lashes in half they and trim them a little, they make great \\&quot;winged\\&quot; lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It was way too long&lt;br /&gt;Clear tacky glue did not blend into my skin color and was very noticeable&lt;br /&gt;There was very few variety, many of them looked the same&lt;br /&gt;Uncomfortable</li>
            <li> Other than that they are fine.</li>
            <li> One other great perk is you have such a wide variety of lashes to choose from</li>
            <li> Had a great selection of lash styles, but on the down side they were really stiff and would not glue</li>
            <li> They are stiff and most wont stay on.</li>
            <li> They do need glue, but that&#x27;s a cheap pickup compared to the expenses of the other lashes.</li>
            <li> I have other products from them that are fantastic.</li>
            <li> It could contain any number of harsh chemicals and the last place I want to put hazardous substances is right next to my eyeball!</li>
            <li> For those of you that like to use very thick heavy eyelashes, this product is perfect for you.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to lashes?</li>
            <li> Live by these...</li>
            <li> but I just wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li> Ok.. I am new at wearing lashes and after watching youtubers on how to put on falsies, I decided to try it by buying ardell lashes from the drug store for practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been playing with it all day and trying new looks.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to finishing all of the box &amp; order a new one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These aren&#x27;t ultra luxury, and they are not that natural looking, but they are a great addition to your kit if you are a performer, especially if you are as hard on lashes as I am!</li>
            <li> Good buy if you are into costume or dramatic makeup, and</li>
            <li> Looks great from far away, looks fake up close.</li>
            <li> I realize I only spent about 15 dollars on 70 pairs of lashes, but I think they should be better crafted.  </li>
            <li> Not amazing but good enough.</li>
            <li> and they look very natural.</li>
            <li> Lashes are very SOFT wasn&#x27;t expecting that from synthetic fibers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> reason why the thicker ones are better is because its fuller, and with the thick lash strip it blends in a little more because the lashes are thicker.</li>
            <li> The fiber band that keeps the lashes in place does not bend easily, and I can definitely feel this band on my eye all day long.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s a huge gap that separates each lash from the other, which doesn&#x27;t even make the lashes look natural.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect much given the price, and I was shocked at how great these lashes look.  </li>
            <li> I love the idea of having multiple sets of the same lashes for several reasons.</li>
            <li> but i still have pair left from my first box i bought 9months ago.</li>
            <li> Wow! 70 pair for $15.00????</li>
            <li> I purchased these when I first starting doing makeup over a year ago.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is definitely the better way to go, dont be fooled by the other bulk eyelash dealers.</li>
            <li> not everyday you get Quality with Quanity!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m willing to pay the extra money.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot of glue btw and always focus on the inner corner first</li>
            <li> Its exactly as pictured so look closely before ordering you just have to cut the lashes to adjust to your actual eyelid.</li>
            <li> The natural lashes can be cropped shorter (just outer edges) for a more subtle pretty daytime look or you can crop them to fit your entire lash line and its a fuller, more dramatic evening look.</li>
            <li> Although some of the sets are a bit way too dramatic to wear on a daily basis, it&#x27;s a great bargain.</li>
            <li> I had to cut them down quite a bit to fit my eye.</li>
            <li> This also makes them easier to clean and reuse if you put mascara on, or get any other product on them.</li>
            <li> Nice lashes just a little long.</li>
            <li> The lashes are nice, some are a little more dramatic and some a little less, but thats whats so good about them.</li>
            <li> I love how they have 4 styles too, ranging from naturally to flirty to fun to dramatic.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll start knowing how to take care of it, make sure you only put glue on the lines because if it drys up where the lashes start it will dry up and could fall easy because the material is hard.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly re-use one pair over ten times as long as you be careful when taking them off or peeling off old glue!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m thinking with a little eyeliner it should be fine.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes there a little stiff but hey there synthetic not human hair overall there a good value I have no room for further complaints.</li>
            <li> Although I am not crazy about all of the designs, For what I usually pay for lashes in individual packages, I found its still a GREAT DEAL even if I only use HALF of them</li>
            <li> Also, they don&#x27;t set easily, they don&#x27;t really bend to fit your eye, and you spend a minute stabbing it on to your eyelash.</li>
            <li> The bands are not stiff.</li>
            <li> I like that it is a bundle of them, but the lashes feel and look a little cheap.</li>
            <li> I was a little aprehensive because it was a cheap price, but the product exceeded my expectataions.</li>
            <li> Before you apply these lashes on your eyes, make sure to flex them a little bit back and forth</li>
            <li> There were a couple that added just a little more volume, and then there were some that looked like giant, plastic centipedes.  </li>
            <li> Bands are a little flimsy and I prefer Red Cherry or Ardell over these, but I got lots of compliments on these lashes :-)</li>
            <li> they are hard material, so make sure when you curl them, hold it longer and use mascara to hold it.</li>
            <li> B00027D8IC Duo Lash Adhesive, Clear, 0.25 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s great to wear and toss without feeling guilty that I only got one use out of them for $5-15 a pair.</li>
            <li> They were nice, looks real, but feels fake, of course.</li>
            <li> Also, there&#x27;s this clear silicone on the lash lines that hurt my eyes when I wear the lashes.</li>
            <li> I can reuse them and they really exaggerate my big eyes.</li>
            <li> Also, I do add mascara to make it look natural.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The lashes are soft but</li>
            <li> In no way shape or form do these lashes look natural on your eyes.</li>
            <li> Completely unnatural looking.</li>
            <li> Well, its not completely a waste of money</li>
            <li> If you are looking for natural lashes these are not for you.</li>
            <li> but beware, you will not have the natural look.</li>
            <li> but they look so natural even when applied.</li>
            <li> So out of the whole box I only use the fuller ones.</li>
            <li> now thats a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> Its really 70 pair of lashes contained in this box with seven different styles.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems SO FAR</li>
            <li> I used to get my lashes done professionally until my natural lashes started falling out.</li>
            <li> I have been doing makeup my whole life and recently got into the business.</li>
            <li> Wow wow</li>
            <li> They are long and pretty.</li>
            <li> Plus mine came early.</li>
            <li> These lashes feel like paper and they are far too long/dramatic.</li>
            <li> So far and I have gotten compliments on them.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> So far I have lost 3 pairs of lashes because they were stuck to the cardboard, losing an additional pair for every pair I&#x27;ve put on so far.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that there&#x27;re a lot of sets, but the average girl can&#x27;t wear all these styles.</li>
            <li> Even if you wear only one style, it&#x27;s worth the price since I&#x27;d paid around $4.00 for only one pair.</li>
            <li> i love this bundles of false lashes, so much to choose from.</li>
            <li> Quality wise, there is nothing wrong with them so far (no shedding, glue comes off etc.)</li>
            <li> I am able to wear the thinner ones to work and they look like I have naturally thick and curled lashes without looking like</li>
            <li> But even the lashes at the 99 cent store are better quality, 1/2 of them cant be used because the strip is to thick to bend with the curve of the eyes.</li>
            <li> this was the worse thing i have seen i thought the lashes looked nice in the picture when i got the product</li>
            <li> Notwithstanding, when a gal seeks to \\&quot;challenge the eye,\\&quot; his, not her own, false eyelashes are an acceptable and desirable means.</li>
            <li> They are easy to put on, little glue is needed!</li>
            <li> My first pair kept irritating my eyes because they were so stiff... but overall, for the price, they are pretty darn good quality lashes.</li>
            <li> If you want a dramatic, sexy look than buy these!</li>
            <li> I got them today and they were even more unbelievable in person!</li>
            <li> the little extra effort is well worth the price!!</li>
            <li> Cheap looking, stiff and unusable.</li>
            <li> Three other styles are much thicker and would still look semi-natural on women whose lashes are much thicker.  </li>
            <li> Not easy to fit eyes.</li>
            <li> I recommend these for daily use, and for those extra special occasions and big nights out, I&#x27;ll use the MAC or Ardell.</li>
            <li> my real eyelashes &amp; i use the more dramatic ones when I go out.  </li>
            <li> A drag queen would LOVE these but not the average classy, working woman.</li>
            <li> The other strips within themselves though are worth the comparable price they cost.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll probably have to do this a few times til it stays, but its worth it, because you dont want to look like you have lazy eyes... : )</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m definitely not the kind of girl to wear fake lashes often</li>
            <li> i guess its good value but the lashes are pretty bad quality...</li>
            <li> i usually buy 2 boxes at a time i loooove them so many different types to choice from!</li>
            <li> Several styles from normal to wild....</li>
            <li> Basicly they are strong enough to withstand my rough handling</li>
            <li> Great for mass projects like theater makeup jobs or a dramatic photo shoot for an amateur..but other than that...</li>
            <li> Overall, I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> bought bc the quantity was high and price was low</li>
            <li> and I usually do end up cutting off a good chunk of them because they&#x27;re way too long for my own eyes.</li>
            <li> The thicker/more dramatic lashes were fine, but the thinner lashes were more difficult to work with and didn&#x27;t fit well.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have much space between your lash line and brows, you will be able to cut one strip exactly down the middle and use it as two half lashes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I have been wearing falsies for about seven years, usually the Ardell brand because that&#x27;s what&#x27;s available at the beauty supply chains for about $3-5 a pop.</li>
            <li> I do have to snip off a small piece  to fit my eyes.  </li>
            <li> When i first got the lashes i expected Ardell-quality lashes .</li>
            <li> you glue them on, and they pop right off unless you HOLD them in place for the entire time it takes for the glue to dry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great starter kit, but some of the kinds of lashes have a hard edge and are hard to apply because of that</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this purchase due to the fact that you got so many lashes for so cheap.</li>
            <li> Personally I adore all things cosmetic and am a new freelancer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting on a new glue to see if I have the same problem again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the 50 lash set I few months ago and needed a new set so decided to go with this bundle since I got more for less.  </li>
            <li> Purchase the CLEAR, it applies white but always dries clear.</li>
            <li> i just love my eye lashes.i can have a different dramatic eye look every day,they are very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> Three styles of lashes are thin and more natural looking.  </li>
            <li> luv them they should give you choice,  like the long dark ones, reusable, cheap</li>
            <li> They definitely aren&#x27;t made of real hair, and up close you can definitely tell the lashes are synthetic.</li>
            <li> They are really long and need to be cut down on the ends just to fit your eye.</li>
            <li> I buy these for my daughter, she loves this brand and insists no other will do.</li>
            <li> No regrets!</li>
            <li> I have been very happy in the past with fake eyelashes from the local store.</li>
            <li> They are very cheaply made not natural at all and very long almost all had to be cut down to size ..</li>
            <li> They loose their shape and hairs fall off fast.</li>
            <li> They eyelashes are awesome, they are a little less quality than ARDELL false lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to use them to become more comfortable with cutting, stacking, and otherwise customizing different lash styles for different looks and at this price it won&#x27;t pain me.  </li>
            <li> I also wish that there would have been more natural looking lashes, as I can&#x27;t necessarily wear the big thick funky lashes to work and out during the day, because I look like Twiggy or like i&#x27;m from the sixties.</li>
            <li> Save your money if you are looking for affordable but natural looking lashes check out my other reviews you will find some lashes that i purchased that I absolutely adore.</li>
            <li> I payed much more for much less product previously.</li>
            <li> The styles are varied and you can create more natural looks to dramatic ones.</li>
            <li> It lasts long - at least i can get more than one times the wear on each of them.  </li>
            <li> the only downside is that the lashes arent soft</li>
            <li> Finally have a twizzer near you for easier maneuver of the lashes.</li>
            <li> The Monster Bundle of seventy (70) pairs provides a nearly inexhaustible supply of that piece de resistance of eye makeup; whereas, the cost per pair is insignificant should I ruin a pair or two in learning proper application and care.</li>
            <li> and they are so thick they wouldn&#x27;t curve to fit my eye.</li>
            <li> The bands are thick and take time to soften up to fit for desired eye shapes.</li>
            <li> I wear false lashes a lot and the quantity is part of what I love.</li>
            <li> I am a newcomer to false lashes and I absolutely love this set.  </li>
            <li> As far as getting a large amount of lashes go these will last you a while however they are straight up hard plastic.</li>
            <li> I find that the less dramatic lashes don&#x27;t really do much for me, honestly I buy these for the more dramatic ones.</li>
            <li> The quality isn&#x27;t the finest horse hairs from a hidden village or anything, but I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re a lot better looking than the Japanese ones I used to buy that just looked like shiny black plastic.</li>
            <li> I have only worn the natural look, but i can&#x27;t wait to try on the more dramatic ones.</li>
            <li> With seven different styles to chose from and 70 pairs total is enough to last a whole year or longer.  </li>
            <li> Some of the lash band have too much of the hair sticking out from the other side</li>
            <li> the reason why they get a 3 star rating from me is because the more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking lashes, each individual lash is so thick and long</li>
            <li> These lashes remind me a lot of the Ardell Runway lashes- super long, super dramatic, but quality not as similar.</li>
            <li> Takes a while to get them on right since theyre so stiff.</li>
            <li> I love wearing lashes for when I go out at night, and sometimes during the day when I want a dramatic look.</li>
            <li> LOVE these lashes but a set of the really dramatic ones</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably trim the thicker ones and just use them as end pieces to fill out my lashes for a more dramatic look.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like is because there are only 2 lashes that look natural</li>
            <li> Because I am a professional make-up artist and I&#x27;ve used the product on several different clients and I&#x27;ve had to make alterations to every set of lashes used.</li>
            <li> so I am not able to use this product to its full potential</li>
            <li> The thicker one are harder to put on since they have a more thick band also are synthetic hairs.</li>
            <li> The more the lash is thick the harder it is to make it stay on your lid.</li>
            <li> I wear false lashes almost daily, and I love changing my look.</li>
            <li> Some are just way too over the top obvious that you&#x27;re wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> They are very cute, but are pretty stiff and must be broken down before applying otherwise</li>
            <li> it arrived here only three days...which that was great.. but the only that was bad about it was that there wasnt 70 pairs of eyelashes..</li>
            <li> Most of them comes in exaggerated length and shape and only 2 comes in natural style and length  </li>
            <li> They are pretty but did not fit the shape or size of eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much a waste of money.</li>
            <li> uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time - may be good for a photoshoot but not for a long day of wear.</li>
            <li> The rest of the lashes are really thick and full and I didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> I will have to trim down some of the lashes because they are way too long (I wear lashes everyday), but for the price I paid, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> but I absolutely love the dramatic ones especially at night time.</li>
            <li> I could tell from the moment I opened the box that the two fuller types of lashes would look ridiculous, and on trying them they were just too long and full!</li>
            <li> The lashes can be kinda stiff at first</li>
            <li> Wow I can wear one set for a very long time before I even think about switching to another pair.</li>
            <li> The only thing that is kind of annoying about them is that the strip that holds the lashes on is rather stiff, so you have to make sure you have a sufficient amount of glue to keep them on.</li>
            <li> I have made the few sets of drugstore lashes that I have purchased in the past last for several applications simply by handling them gently and keeping them clean.  </li>
            <li> There are various designs for every social gathering I go to.  </li>
            <li> Good for practice and a few different looks depending on what you like or how dramatic you want to go.</li>
            <li> I used to wear the super thick lashes that come with these (from Model21)</li>
            <li> Thick and bold lashes.</li>
            <li> Good for recitals and costume makeup, but awful for daily use or special occasions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought from this seller several times and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed; product is made well, can be used multiple times, they look great.</li>
            <li> Nice variety from conservative to wild and unbelievably crazy long.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for \\&quot;practice\\&quot;, thinking that they would be a good, less expensive alternative to drugstore lashes (which can become quite an expense over time), helping me to get used to both applying them and wearing them.  </li>
            <li> GREAT FAKE LASHES!!</li>
            <li> the thick band was so hard to glued and won&#x27;t stay in place even I am using a nice brand of glue.</li>
            <li> Oh And before putting on fake eyelashes always apply black eyeliner that way they appear much more realistic.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that they are a bit on the cheap end, but can only be expected from the cost of the item.</li>
            <li> I have never worn lashes before and was not ready to fork over $6 or more for 1 pair of false lashes.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone who love to wear false lashes!</li>
            <li> As someone who buys fake lashes every other week , because I ultimately lose them this is an amazing deal.</li>
            <li> I can understand why some people might think the thicker lashes are a bit dramatic but to me, they&#x27;re perfectly fine for a night out with the friends.</li>
            <li> The flexibility is almost nil, and every &#x27;style&#x27; of lash in this assortment is far too thick and far too long, so they looked nothing resembling natural.  </li>
            <li> otherwise they are very straight and can be hard to put on making both sides stick at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to grab a completely clean and sanitized old mascara brush (I keep them after my mascaras finished for brushing out eyebrows and random things</li>
            <li> They look real, Some are a little long on me, I just snip the corners.</li>
            <li> The lashes run bug especially the thick full ones, you can start looking like a drag queen ...</li>
            <li> Indeed, some of the styles are extremely over the top and have relatively thick bands, which can be hard to bend or apply (especially if you are new to lashes).</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re the type of person that likes dramatic lashes and don&#x27;t mind cheap feeling of the lashes .</li>
            <li> At first, I was skeptical because they were so straight</li>
            <li> The false lashes are beautiful and sorry forgot to comment it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;here&#x27;s a tip for anyone who wears these lashes and doesn&#x27;t like the shiny black lash strip, I just take some really matte black eye shadow with an angled liner brush and add a little bit of eye drops to make it a little tacky and lightly dab it over the strip.</li>
            <li> They are a little longer than I normally wear - hits my glasses when I blink...</li>
            <li> I have a flat eyelid, so they are easy for me to use and wear, but I&#x27;ve found that they are pretty difficult to put on my friends with very round eyes -</li>
            <li> Since I am fairly new to the whole false eyelash thing, I decided to get this kit</li>
            <li> The only thing that bugs me is that it has a black band instead of clear.</li>
            <li> They are hard to use to say the least and unless you are asian, do not buy these because you will not be able to use them.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not readily apparent on the lashes.</li>
            <li> If they are too long for your eyes, simply cut them.</li>
            <li> for the length they were a bit long for my asian eyes</li>
            <li> i have to say, 70 pairs eyelashes are enough to use for a long tiem.</li>
            <li> They are pretty stiff, and lash glue works pretty poorly for some reason with them.</li>
            <li> The band on the more dramatic lashes in this bundle are VERY thick and can rip off your real lashes.</li>
            <li> These lashes feel less natural than the Ardell version, but</li>
            <li> the fact that you have many styles to give different looks from everyday to dramatic night life .</li>
            <li> A few of them are quite dramatic and I more than likely won&#x27;t wear them to work</li>
            <li> I only will probably wear four out of the seven styles but still have spent far less than if I bought them individually at $5 a pair!</li>
            <li> This will last me for a very long time!</li>
            <li> Seriously saves so much money!  </li>
            <li> Mine came with 5 different styles and the other 2 were the same as one</li>
            <li> :) totally recommend these if you&#x27;re looking to buy some fake eyelashes!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a dramatic feel the fuller ones are so perfect, and if you want something subtle they&#x27;ve got a few that will compliment an everyday look!</li>
            <li> /&gt;these lashes are all a bit long for me, and since there seems to be a little extra length at one end of each without lashes above, it seems natural to cut each down anyway.</li>
            <li> CHEAP AND WRONG.  </li>
            <li> These do at least that much</li>
            <li> First off they are fake lashes, they are not by all means natural looking.</li>
            <li> A long time user of Ardell as well.</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of &amp;#34;gyaru&amp;#34; inspired make up which calls for lots of lashes so long was a plus.</li>
            <li> These lashes are too long even the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ones.</li>
            <li> if youre planning to wear out for a long day or night out i do not recommend bc</li>
            <li> This are big full lashes so not good for everyday wear.  </li>
            <li> so they are not soft, but you get what you pay for (plastic).</li>
            <li> /&gt;They came in a blank white box with a green circle sticker w. the Bundle Monster logo, not the red box that&#x27;s shown</li>
            <li> It lasted me a long time.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes came earlier than expected and bubble wrapped.</li>
            <li> but they are too long.</li>
            <li> I have to say the range from medium to long.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, these last a while with careful handling and maintaining.</li>
            <li> use glue from Sephora, and at $8.00 a tube it is pricey but the tube lasts a long long time.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> /&gt;You have to really work with them and the band is kinda thick</li>
            <li> These lashes are long so they will need to be trimmed, in other words they will probably be too long for your eye because they are longer than the standard Ardell lashes, Andrea lashes, and Kiss lashes</li>
            <li> I mean really into it.</li>
            <li> I would probably never wear the more dramatic ones they just look much too fake.</li>
            <li> I will always buy them again and again, due to the fact that constantly people are asking me what I use and where I got them.</li>
            <li> Packaging is small, i was surprised!</li>
            <li> One obviously being you need to replace them after wear and tear, the other being</li>
            <li> I received the lashes and I didn&#x27;t have the same problem with the excess glue like the other ladies do here.</li>
            <li> But if you like extreme lashes, I would definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> i bought here on Amazon over a year ago and they lasted so long!</li>
            <li> I bought this box which has saved me money in the long run!</li>
            <li> I have had four other friends buy this same box after using mine.</li>
            <li> Same quality as every other eyelash sold everywhere.</li>
            <li> If I knew I could purchase 70 pairs of lashes for $15 I would have kicked KISS, CHERRY, and ARDELL to the curb a long time ago!</li>
            <li> Other than that, I like all the different shapes and styles.</li>
            <li> This made putting them on the first time very hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m set for a very long time 😉</li>
            <li> Not so great for the occasional evening out &amp; worst for day to day.</li>
            <li> If you are picky with your false lashes and only go name brand you may not like so much.</li>
            <li> Thick lashes, exotic lashes and thin lashes.</li>
            <li> The hairs look natural (may be synthetic though, I&#x27;m not sure).</li>
            <li> They do come with a little bit of adhesive on them, but it isn&#x27;t enough to actually wear them, so all you need is a little extra lash glue</li>
            <li> Considering they last maybe two or three applications, spending an average of $5 per pair seems like a lot of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had all kinds of fake lashes before and these are not bad quality.</li>
            <li> but if anyone has suggestions on how to remove the thick amount on some of the more dramatic pairs I would appreciate it as I don&#x27;t want it to show through.  </li>
            <li> There were two styles I really loved that were dramatic but not too scary.  </li>
            <li> I even trimmed down the thinner lashes and applied them as individual lashes for a weekday look.</li>
            <li> I ruined several pair trying to get the glue off the lash, which goes halfway down the lashes.  </li>
            <li> not high wuatlity</li>
            <li> and i think i will have these for a very long time!</li>
            <li> i am someone who wears eyelashes daily, so it gets pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> I was definitely debating this purchase for a long time because I don&#x27;t like waste.  </li>
            <li> 7 different styles, 10 pairs each, for way less than a dollar</li>
            <li> There are 70 lashes, 10 pairs each of 7 different styles, and at less than $20 for the set</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously purchased a 50pack of assorted lashes and could only use 4 of the 5 styles.</li>
            <li> I typically use Ardell and Red Cherry</li>
            <li> Even if it&#x27;s the same style, you&#x27;ll notice one side is either slightly longer and fuller</li>
            <li> Just like the super expensive ones you get</li>
            <li> Like why there are several models of artificial еѕеласхес and also the price is pretty solid in terms of what is offered ...</li>
            <li> , i wear the long extreme ones</li>
            <li> ANother con i had noticed is that the bands are unusually  thick and do not bend, they are pretty stiff.</li>
            <li> Got these last year and still have a little over half of the box left.</li>
            <li> Lastly, You can also crop the more crazy dramatic lashes in this set (That some people may shy away from) for just the outer eye so they are not so overwhelming if thats not your style.</li>
            <li> They are a little hard to work with, the strip is very heavy(dark).</li>
            <li> Only criticism I have is that they bend a little out of shape after you&#x27;ve used them once.</li>
            <li> Some where very long and thick and other where natural and a bit spaced out.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s enough to last me for at least a year.</li>
            <li> The bands on some of the lashes are quite wide</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are ten styles, though a few look alike to me.</li>
            <li> and I expected them to have a lot of defects</li>
            <li> I was WAY TOO curious not to see, so I did.</li>
            <li> Looks like what I expected.</li>
            <li> -I&#x27;m an everyday user and one pair of these lashes last me a week.    </li>
            <li> Used the \\&quot;drag queen lashes\\&quot; on halloween.  </li>
            <li> No thanks</li>
            <li> Total junk..don&#x27;t waste your money..</li>
            <li> The product came as expected, I like it</li>
            <li> a really thin layer of mascara will work and give it a real look</li>
            <li> They definitely are not for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> They are worse than my real lashes.</li>
            <li> They are not as bendy as ones I&#x27;ve tried before and have thicker bands so they are a bit harder to put on</li>
            <li> I would say that half of the collection is too thick to use for realistic non-trashy make-up.</li>
            <li> There is a THICK band of glue already on them which stuck to my natural lashes.</li>
            <li> But then again, all false lashes are capable of doing so.</li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;ve ever used false eye lashes before you know that is EXTREMELY fast.</li>
            <li> When finished apply mascara to blend your real eyelshes with the false lashes.</li>
            <li> You could even share with friends or trim down if too long and see how it turns out.</li>
            <li> I also read that some human hair lashes can actually be made out of animal hair, and as a vegan, that is not ok with me!</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitate on purchasing these lashes because I bought some other lashes on amazon that looked similar to these</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the lashes can sometimes be hard to get off of the clear appliqué due to the glue, so be careful taking them off as you could mess up the integrity of the lash!</li>
            <li> Very obvious and a stiff band.</li>
            <li> The price is right but these lashes are extremely fake looking &amp; feeling.  </li>
            <li> I had wasted money buying other lash glue, and they stopped working mid way.</li>
            <li> but I have done so with other friends who have big round eyes</li>
            <li> I must say that when I ordered this I thought I was going to receive something cheap and useless !</li>
            <li> Ardell brand lashes have rather thin bands that make them invisible on the normal user, but on someone without a natural lash line to act as secondary support, they have a tendency to start flopping into my eyes by mid-day.</li>
            <li> If you feel like the band is too wide (other reviewers said this was an issue), how &#x27;bout drawing a thicker line for your liner???</li>
            <li> The bands are thick and slightly sticky so they are slightly more difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> There is only one that I found to be unwearable, because they are too long, and the strip was too thick and wouldn&#x27;t curve correctly.</li>
            <li> The lash line is too thick and therefore makes it very difficult for the lash to stick to your own eyelash line / eyelid.  </li>
            <li> A little long for me</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s where the other four sheets of lashes come in.  </li>
            <li> and I cannot get the other 5 types of lashes to stay on.  </li>
            <li> Will be sticking to my usual Asian brand Shisem/Darkness lashes from now on.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the lashes are human hair or not or if I can re-use them</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only tried the thicker pair and they do look fake but that&#x27;s expected..</li>
            <li> &amp; they do their job extremely well considering the price .</li>
            <li> Maybe in a photo shoot, but other than that - I don&#x27;t know what to do with them.</li>
            <li> extremely stiff&lt;br</li>
            <li> I carefully tried to peel them off at the end of the night and they were stuck!</li>
            <li> I will say that I don&#x27;t wear the thinner sets of lashes, but I can see how they may fall apart - they are extremely thin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the person who stated in another review that they look fake and plasticy, firstly, lashes like this don&#x27;t exist in reality...period.</li>
            <li> So after reading other reviews I was a but sceptical but purchased anyway.</li>
            <li> I also do recommend not buying these if your first time user of lashes because these lashes will probably be difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re conveniently packaged in a small box &amp; they&#x27;re in different styles.  </li>
            <li> Love them and people can&#x27;t even tell if they are real or fake</li>
            <li> Both ends will not stay due to no bending ability.</li>
            <li> There was really seven different styles, ranging from thin to thick.</li>
            <li> when im going out, and the shorter ones to work or other profressional events.</li>
            <li> I usually add mascara to my lashes and it only enhances the look.</li>
            <li> Which means you can&#x27;t put anything on them other then the glue.</li>
            <li> If you want something that won&#x27;t take you twenty minutes to make work for you and then barely stick because the plastic is too thick.</li>
            <li> You can go dramatic with the thicker lashes, natural with the thin ones, or get really wild with the criss cross lashes.</li>
            <li> but she said it is to hard for her to apply them because they are to straight and hard to bend $15 dollars to the trash I try to save her money with this gift now</li>
            <li> The glue they used to stick the lashes onto the plastic got a little messy and stuck some actual lashes (not just the band) to the plastic</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re very careful, taking them out shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> These are cheap eyelashes, which are impossible to install due to their inability to bend &amp; be flexible to match an eye contour.</li>
            <li> So I was really looking forward to getting these in the mail and when they finally arrived, I was overcome with utmost disappointment.</li>
            <li> I wear false lashes occasionally, and I have used them on clients for recent work.  </li>
            <li> If you wear false lashes somewhat regularly, then this is a total steal for the quantity of lashes you get for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only difference would be if you compared them to human hair false lashes instead of synthetic.</li>
            <li> These are less than 10% of what I have been paying for other lashes.</li>
            <li> Like I said, these lasted about a year, the EyeSplashes brand only lasted a few months because lower quality and I basicly threw out 3 palets of the ugly weird lashes (30 pairs of garbage)&lt;br /&gt;Obviously any bulk lashes will be lower quality than the drug store brands (like revlon which cost $3-4 each) but this is better quality than other bulk sellers.</li>
            <li> You have to trim any lash to fit your eye which I think is also a contributor to the bad ratings.</li>
            <li> Your lashes are black, your mascara will be black and your eyeliner is black, not sure why anyone would use white glue.</li>
            <li> I get at least 3 uses out of them, meaning I have worn them, taken them off, and then re-applied the same pair again and again.</li>
            <li> I still have a lot left and wear these at least 4 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  December 2015.  </li>
            <li> But I do that to any fake lashes I buy, even the real hair lashes.</li>
            <li> Not fun....</li>
            <li> Heck lets face it its dark.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money they don&#x27;t stay on at all.</li>
            <li> I was tempted by the price and gave it a try but is definitely not worth it.  </li>
            <li> and I can understand how the average user would have a problem with this.</li>
            <li> They are just not worth the money.</li>
            <li> And the actually lash strip is just so thick that you can see the lash strip on your eyes</li>
            <li> I have to cut a few mm off of them before wearing them so that I don&#x27;t look like a clown or drag queen.</li>
            <li> The thin ones look au natural.  </li>
            <li> The stack was firmly and carefully placed.</li>
            <li> The other point I wanted to share is that 5 out of the 7 styles (2 of the dramatic, 2 of the natural, and the crisscrossed)</li>
            <li> I think I can trim them down a bit.</li>
            <li> these will droop down and make you look sleepy after some time.</li>
            <li> after i cut them down (always from the shorter inside part</li>
            <li> One con is the bands are super thick and they look so fake.</li>
            <li> I trim them down a bit before I apply.</li>
            <li> and I admit, I was a little scared since reading the other reviews about how the lashes were stuck to the tray.  </li>
            <li> Be careful pulling these off, so you don&#x27;t accidentally rip the glue or the lash itself!!</li>
            <li> Maybe using a dark or black eyeshadow would cover it up?  </li>
            <li> Personally, I think these lashes are horrible to work with, not flexible at all and very cheap</li>
            <li> The hard plastic makes them hard to work with because they wont bend to follow your natural lash line</li>
            <li> (All other brands, in my experience, melt and become gummy within a few hours - this lasts over 24 hours if you don&#x27;t fuss with your eyes.)</li>
            <li> They have natural ones to dramatic ones.</li>
            <li> use black glue ( amazon sells it).</li>
            <li> I received 70 pairs for less than $20!what a deal.</li>
            <li> They have 10 Pairs of lashes for each style for about a dollar - which would cut the price in half and you&#x27;d also get to choose your styles.</li>
            <li> Seriously a box could last you a year if you preserve them well and save you hundreds!!</li>
            <li> and they are less than a $1 each</li>
            <li> and I want to say I am half way done with the box.</li>
            <li> but what I do is just cut them in half and use as accents&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used two pairs without mishaps but yesterday tried to take a pair off for a bride and about half of the strip came off and the rest stuck to the plastic backing.</li>
            <li> You have to hide it with a really black eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Worse case scenario you give them to a friend if you don&#x27;t like them and only spent $ 15.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a slight difference.</li>
            <li> less then 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I had had the box for about a year and a half.</li>
            <li> About half of the lashes are well made and usable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anyone that would wear them, they didn&#x27;t even look like lashes, just a black clump of plastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s at least 1 cm long from the edge down the fibers.</li>
            <li> These lashes are a bit stiff, as other reviewers mentioned, but I use the Lashtite adhesive, which will hold anything on.</li>
            <li> i dont recomend putting them on because the lashes are long and make glasses wearing kinda hard.</li>
            <li> so i was afraid to order them at first.</li>
            <li> I was being slow and careful, and I had been sucessful with other pairs.</li>
            <li> My complaints are that the eyelash band is fairly long and thick.</li>
            <li> The lashes are too damn long and the pasty part of the lashes is to thick.</li>
            <li> i would probably only use half of these, the other half are way too dramatic looking.</li>
            <li> The bands are generally thick and stiff, and I have noticed quite a few pairs with extra glue both on and underneath the lash band which I want to remove.  </li>
            <li> This makes it hard for the eyelash adhesive to work because it&#x27;s not being applied to a completely dry lash strip.</li>
            <li> They too were covered in glue, but at least it was dry and could be picked off.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear over half the lashes, what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Stiff and plasticy corners don&#x27;t stay bent down.</li>
            <li> Not worth it!</li>
            <li> I would say if you have a little bit of time, and some scissors, you should go for it.  </li>
            <li> The band on the lashes is a little thicker</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your time, money and return shipping on this mess.</li>
            <li> but you just have to work them a little bit.</li>
            <li> I usually get from other lashes.</li>
            <li> The lashes are a little longer than I thought, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Alright, I&#x27;m gonna try to make this as easy to understand as possible, I&#x27;m awful at describing things.</li>
            <li> this collection gives u a look for everyday...</li>
            <li> were missing a piece of lashes regardless</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this</li>
            <li> I guess its guid for the club scene but not for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I give this product one star because they look plastic, aren&#x27;t flexible, and the glue is a waste of time.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I ran out and was looking for the 70 pair deal again but couldn&#x27;t find the brand/distributor \\&quot;Bundle Monster\\&quot; because they were out of stock.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> EyeSplashes doesn&#x27;t include the criss-cross lashes, and a few of their 7 palets are duplicates</li>
            <li> IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY_ BUY ARDELL</li>
            <li> and  i use them everyday.</li>
            <li> but these lashes are a waste.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pretend like you&#x27;ve never been out with your homegirls dancing the night away and then realize you&#x27;re missing a falsie.  </li>
            <li> I thought if I bought bulk, I would wear lashes everyday.</li>
            <li> to start of I used to neverrrr wear falsies, just was always impatient to learn and at 4 bucks a pop i would never want to spend the money.</li>
            <li> Granted I didnt wear them everyday.</li>
            <li> Not tacky or too heavy either.</li>
            <li> i wouldn&#x27;t waste my time with these.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that they are a bit heavy</li>
            <li> so I went through a few pairs experimenting.</li>
            <li> There are a few funky looking lashes that I would probably never use but maybe for Halloween.</li>
            <li> This is the waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Ive even sold some to my friends for a few bucks a pair.</li>
            <li> But for everyday wear, or for going out, I would rather have goopy mascara than wear these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the glue doesn&#x27;t come off either without destroying the lashes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this box of false eyelashes after spending countless dollars on one pair packs.</li>
            <li> have finally decided that wearing false lashes is how my life is going to be.</li>
            <li> these can be used and thrown away after each use but took me a little practice to get use to how stiff they are</li>
            <li> Other lashes are too thick</li>
            <li> I highly recommend if you want the look of false eyelashes without screaming \\&quot;I am wearing false eyelashes</li>
            <li> so they aren&#x27;t so stiff on your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> They are stiff but you can work with them by molding them.</li>
            <li> band is a bit stiff but they&#x27;re sturdy and reusable.</li>
            <li> there to stiff.</li>
            <li> They pop off because they are so stiff.</li>
            <li> Stiff and hurt on eyes.</li>
            <li> I purchased them because I wear lashes on a daily basis and was so tired of buying expensive pairs because I hate wearing lashes more than once or twice before I toss them, these were the solution!</li>
            <li> in this set are tapered at both ends and longest in the middle, meaning that if you are like me and don&#x27;t want too much dramatic length throughout/</li>
            <li> , so you can have a natural everyday look or a very dramatic look for a night on the town.  </li>
            <li> Plus the bands are not thick and stiff like I was afraid they would be.</li>
            <li> come on these are pretty bad</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like because one set was extremely thin and then one was cross weaved and extremely hard.</li>
            <li> The lashes are a little stiff and hard to manipulate but they are manageable.</li>
            <li> So lame most of the shapes are so ugly</li>
            <li> These lashes are glued to the plastic with a very tacky, sticky substance that is impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> IF YOU PULL A LITTLE TO HARD</li>
            <li> the others are just way too long or dramatic.</li>
            <li> Yes the band is a little thick</li>
            <li> I have a big box of lashes that I cannot use unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable</li>
            <li> and its heavy!</li>
            <li> Since getting them a few weeks ago I have worn them just about everywhere, I would recommend this product and fully intend on buying this again!  </li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re usually about 4 bucks a pop.</li>
            <li> Anyone who doesn&#x27;t buy this package is missing out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist and usually use this for runway, Fashion shoots, and gratis makeup gigs.</li>
            <li> I tried over and over to find at least a couple of styles that would work and they basically were a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I will do with those.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I had the issue with the glue</li>
            <li> There is some glue to hold the lashes in the packaging, but it is not an excessive amount.</li>
            <li> Lashes usually cost $3-$5 for a set.</li>
            <li> no more shiny lash strip.</li>
            <li> Still not sure if I plan on returning these.</li>
            <li> the only problem is I use the wrong glue.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have small eyes</li>
            <li> I guess I could trim them or pray no one is all up on my eyeball wonder why my eyelashes go way past my skin of the corner of my eye.</li>
            <li> only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 was because of this glue like thing on the lashes which can be rather uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> so it looks extra fake.</li>
            <li> If not for the mere fact that you can buy two pairs at Walgreens for the same price as 70 pairs!</li>
            <li> I ended up buying my usual brands in the store.</li>
            <li> No more running to Walgreens to buy $6 pairs.</li>
            <li> They are short and thin!</li>
            <li> This pack takes me to a simple, every day business casual look, to an all glammed up look for a party, and everything else in between.</li>
            <li> The lashes are too stiff and they are hard to work with.</li>
            <li> These lashes are not easy to manipulate and they show up too thick on the lash line.</li>
            <li> The thin eyelashes are basically only for one wear because they are so thin</li>
            <li> I know they are fake lashes, but they really, really look fake.</li>
            <li> The band is too stiff, I don&#x27;t know what to do with it!</li>
            <li> they are long and some r very dramatic and some r for everyday...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using fake lashes for years and always buy the expensive realistic ones</li>
            <li> They are hard to work with anyways.</li>
            <li> The band is definitely hard to work with, but it is do-able.</li>
            <li> you get A LOT of lashes, but they are hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d still recommend them, just wouldn&#x27;t use the hard edged ones.</li>
            <li> Extremely hard and plastic.</li>
            <li> They were hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Hard to bend.</li>
            <li> I wish that I could have had that option when buying, but it is hard to see the thickness on the photographs.</li>
            <li> These lashes where so hard to remove from the plastic case.</li>
            <li> this material could be hard, but i keep each lash on 1-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> lashes are too hard.  </li>
            <li> Hard to glue on.</li>
            <li> But it was really hard to put on and have it stay on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never ordered false lashes online and was a little nervous about what the quality would be like.</li>
            <li> If your not use to applying false eyelashes, this may be a LITTLE troublesome.</li>
            <li> They have a thick sticky strip which makes it hard to glue to the lashes</li>
            <li> The lash line is thick and hard plastic.</li>
            <li> TOO THICK AND HARD TO KEEP ON</li>
            <li> The other half were REALLY thick and crazy looking.</li>
            <li> 70 uses of the Ardell lashes would probably run me at LEAST $50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Three of the styles are extremely dramatic, thick and black.  </li>
            <li> I want my money back... if you buy this you crazy.</li>
            <li> And rather then spend at least $3 on just one pair of lashes</li>
            <li> Recommend buying and have bought over and over again at least 4times this year alone.</li>
            <li> Have purchased this item at least 4 times.</li>
            <li> Its this thick plastic glue gun material and does not rub off.</li>
            <li> The glue was so thick you have to peel it off..</li>
            <li> Some of them are EXTREMELY thick, almost like costume eyelashes</li>
            <li> The wefts or whatever..are too, too thick.</li>
            <li> Also the plastic is so thick on the edge that they don&#x27;t stay on ...</li>
            <li> I have to say some of the lashes are really thick</li>
            <li> So, I have yet to wear the thick eyelashes</li>
            <li> The part where the lashes are attached is way to thick.  </li>
            <li> is VERY thick and stiff.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t terrible because now you can have super dramatic lashes and just regular dramatic lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These eye lashes are not what I expected and are of very poor quality.</li>
            <li> , I mean they are literally camel lashes.</li>
            <li> I recently started wearing false eyelashes on occasion and was shocked at how expensive they are at local retail shops.</li>
            <li> the eyelashes are way to thick not good at all</li>
            <li> and i would hate having to buy new ones 2 to 3 times a week</li>
            <li> Trying to discover where I can and cannot make less expensive subtitutes.</li>
            <li> So I wasn&#x27;t looking not for subtle lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> they just look ridiculous on me.</li>
            <li> but it had Asian writing on the outside of the package and they were HORRIBLE!!</li>
            <li> Now if you are serious about being a Diva</li>
            <li> The model is asian and the lashes don&#x27;t look too bad on her.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not really good with lashes, but now I feel like Im pro.</li>
            <li> Also, the clear plastic lash line is annoying.</li>
            <li> The lash band is so hard !</li>
            <li> Very poor quality and not easy to put on.</li>
            <li> The strip is thicker and less plyable than some brands and very uncomfortable and distracting to wear if you don&#x27;t cut the strips into at least three pieces before you apply them.</li>
            <li> They look like the other expensive brands too!</li>
            <li> Duh!  </li>
            <li> Eyelashes are made of very hard plastic.</li>
            <li> I do not like cutting my lashes in two like others have suggested, because the line looks odd then, when I try to match my liner.  </li>
            <li> Rarely in my past have I worn false eyelashes, as either they were too gaudy or too difficult to apply correctly.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these were too hard for me to use.  </li>
            <li> The people that said these were difficult to put on were simply just bad at putting on false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> the quality was poor.</li>
            <li> This is even advisable from the make-up artist at the department stores, like Macy&#x27;s, when you buy their fake eye lashes that run at least $15 a pair.  </li>
            <li> and I was tired of paying 4.00 per set</li>
            <li> Poor quality eye lashes.</li>
            <li> Not happy with these.</li>
            <li> poor quality.popped off my eyes</li>
            <li> only downside is that they put -a lot- of glue on the lash to attach it to the base.</li>
            <li> it was horrible some of the lashes were plastic and some felt real</li>
            <li> Just got my false eyelashes</li>
            <li> As a newcomer to the world of false eyelashes</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to people who loves wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> I have never worn false eyelashes</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of false eyelashes</li>
            <li> I am wearing false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I have 2 daughters in competition dance and show choir and we use LOTS of false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> they are false eyelashes</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister who loves to use false eye lashes.</li>
            <li> Because typically when I use false lashes, I ease up on the eye liner, and its very annoying to have that random black strip visibly making my thin eye liner so choppy</li>
            <li> Usually this lasts me AT LEAST 6 MONTHS!!!</li>
            <li> it is very stiff and difficult to use, and difficult to keep on.</li>
            <li> They were too dramatic for me.</li>
            <li> Some women prefer the dramatic look</li>
            <li> Way too dramatic for me.</li>
            <li> To dramatic for me .</li>
            <li> Some are a bit to dramatic for me</li>
            <li> For dramatic days, I use dramatic ones.  </li>
            <li> All of these lashes are so DRAMATIC.</li>
            <li> are so dramatic</li>
            <li> A lot of people complain saying some of the styles are too dramatic for them</li>
            <li> I have ordered other lashes before, not from this seller, and was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The base is so stiff that they don&#x27;t contour to the lash line well, and the lashes are very stiff and fake looking.  </li>
            <li> These are just horrible and they look ridiculous...especially because they are not flexible and do not apply completely.</li>
            <li> However, they are a bit difficult to place on the eye because the eyelash is really thin.</li>
            <li> but their poor quality makes them look as fake as it gets.  </li>
            <li> Terrible quality, meaning impossible to apply and super fake looking.</li>
            <li> white glue shows and the texture is very hard.. and the shine makes it especially fake looking.</li>
            <li> rest are over dramatic and fake looking</li>
            <li> There was a dead animal/bug on one of the lash strips!!!!</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> ill defintetly be ordering these again</li>
            <li> What I saw was so disturbing</li>
            <li> None of the lashes can be of use because of this which is unfortunate.</li>
            <li> Ive been using fake eye lashes for a while now</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, all of these are way overdone.</li>
            <li> I have had fake eyelashes placed on me by others but wanted to learn how to do it myself.  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> Can not go wrong at this price...</li>
            <li> but all in all you really can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.</li>
            <li> You can not go wrong with this purchase.....</li>
            <li> Ill never buy them from the store again.</li>
            <li> I put fake lashes on each day.</li>
            <li> This is a Bundle Monster FAIL.</li>
            <li> Lashes at the store are really expensive and it would probably be cheaper for me to just reorder what I got before.</li>
            <li> they do feel fake</li>
            <li> I wear fake eyelashes almost 7 days a week</li>
            <li> Ill be buying deveral boxes and sime as gifts</li>
            <li> Unable to get them to stick to my eyelid.  </li>
            <li> Really fake.</li>
            <li> False!</li>
            <li> I think is made too thick, it doesn&#x27;t glue like regulars lashes..:(</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t expect the quality of a Shu Uemura Lashes but these looked silly and were very difficult to even put on.  </li>
            <li> I do wish that we could pick the styles that are in the bundle though, but ill find use for the very fake looking ones.</li>
            <li> I feel like dumb buying this crap</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to go at it with some pressure because these lashes are sturdy and can take the beating.  </li>
            <li> There are plenty of styled to pick from....conservative to crazy.</li>
            <li> like so they shine TOO artificially.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist and go through lashes like crazy.</li>
            <li> my eyes started to burn like crazy, so I took off the eyelashes and glue.</li>
            <li> If I was crazy about lashes</li>
            <li> it was a disappointing buy.</li>
            <li> I don recommend cutting the strip corners along with the ends of the lashes.</li>
            <li> band is kinda stiff but they aren&#x27;t the worst bands in the world like I</li>
            <li> It if very expensive to start out</li>
            <li> Not pliable and very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The bands on the eyelashes do not bend and make it impossible to stick onto my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> thing that was bad</li>
            <li> And they don&#x27;t look that bad on.</li>
            <li> These are so bad it makes me never want to purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> i was shocked and just had to have it.</li>
            <li> I am soooo disappointed with these lashes.</li>
            <li> the lashes feel very artificial at the touch</li>
            <li> it breaks the lash base.  </li>
            <li> Just peel out the lashes, and add a line of DUO glue on the base.</li>
            <li> Anyone who doesn&#x27;t have experience with lashes is going to hate these.</li>
            <li> So, I agree with another reviewer who states that if you don&#x27;t know how to put on lashes, you;ll hate these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why they&#x27;re charging me money for a piece of crap product.</li>
            <li> HATED THEM.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this buy.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed I ordered 2 boxes, I will be giving them away to whom ever will take them.</li>
            <li> If this isn&#x27;t bad, I don&#x27;t know what is!!</li>
            <li> Worst product I have ever received from Amazon.</li>
            <li> horrible</li>
            <li> These synthetic lashes are the worst!</li>
            <li> Terrible quality.</li>
            <li> and we&#x27;re causing stress and embarrassment at work..totally horrible</li>
            <li> These have to be the worst eyelashes ever.</li>
            <li> I use them for photoshoots and the sheen they set off is horrible.</li>
            <li> these lashes were AWFUL.</li>
            <li> too bad!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The price is right but these lashes are extremely fake looking &amp; feeling.  They are hard to use to say the least and unless you are asian, do not buy these because you will not be able to use them.  They barely bend which is good for a straighter lid, which an asian girlfriend of mine could use it just fine, but no one else.  They are hard to work with anyways.</li>
            <li> Stiff and plasticy corners don&#x27;t stay bent down.</li>
            <li> I am a growing makeup artist. Trying to discover where I can and cannot make less expensive subtitutes. Personally, I think these lashes are horrible to work with, not flexible at all and very cheap/fake looking. If you want something that won&#x27;t take you twenty minutes to make work for you and then barely stick because the plastic is too thick. DONT get these. Not worth it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THEM AS ALWAYS</li>
            <li> the lashes feel very artificial at the touch (hmm like a paper fan)..I like the look but the clients I have put them on felt they were too long (and I used the more natural looking ones)&lt;br /&gt;I guess for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> I just got them in. took them out of the box, and I think I&#x27;m already in love :) They&#x27;re way better quality than I thought it was going to be. Super soft lashes! I can&#x27;t wait to try them and can&#x27;t wait to play with the different styles!</li>
            <li> It was a good deal, but the material made the eyelashes hard to glue it on. The look were ok!</li>
            <li> Came in great time, and everything came in perfect condition! I will totally post pictures when I used each one!!! Love the variety, came in good length so at least they weren&#x27;t too short and I can always trim to fit my eye length. I can&#x27;t want to go out in these! 70 PAIRS!!!!! Good investment!</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t believe I was able to get these many pairs of lashes at such a great price!  Most MUAs I&#x27;ve come across on the net say that these type are the hardest to apply, but after trying natural lashes, I&#x27;d have to disagree!  I like the thicker bands, give me something to grasp!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this twice, because I truly do believe it is WORTH THE MONEY. I love wearing lashes for when I go out at night, and sometimes during the day when I want a dramatic look. This lash set offers a wide variety of lashes to choose from, and the best part is the price. The band on the more dramatic lashes in this bundle are VERY thick and can rip off your real lashes. But then again, all false lashes are capable of doing so. The thinner the band, the better, and these bands are definitely not very thin compared to many more expensive products. But, that is the trade off. I find that the less dramatic lashes don&#x27;t really do much for me, honestly I buy these for the more dramatic ones. Overall, for $15, you can&#x27;t beat how many you get. Usually this lasts me AT LEAST 6 MONTHS!!! I reuse my favorite ones, and I would definitely recommend these lashes to a friend.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought these eyelashes. I will always buy them again and again, due to the fact that constantly people are asking me what I use and where I got them. It takes me a long time to get through all pairs and some I like more than others. Bottom line, I would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Before you apply these lashes on your eyes, make sure to flex them a little bit back and forth so they aren&#x27;t so stiff on your eyelashes. My first pair kept irritating my eyes because they were so stiff... but overall, for the price, they are pretty darn good quality lashes.</li>
            <li> Love it! A variety of lashes for a great price!</li>
            <li> I love these lashes there a little stiff but hey there synthetic not human hair overall there a good value I have no room for further complaints. I will be buying again...</li>
            <li> I received them fast and they are just like the photos!!!!  I love the many choices.  They are easy to put on, little glue is needed!</li>
            <li> I buy these for my daughter, she loves this brand and insists no other will do. I bought her two bundles for Christmas and she was thrilled! Product always arrives on time.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried about buying these since some of the reviews said they were cheap. I&#x27;ve had all kinds of fake lashes before and these are not bad quality. They are just like the ones I used to buy at Sally&#x27;s or Walgreens. I like these better than Sally&#x27;s because they are lighter then regular ones and you forget you&#x27;re even wearing them. Sure, you can&#x27;t reuse them, but you get 70 pairs of lashes for $15! Normally $15 would only get you 3 or 5 pairs, 70 pairs is a damn fine bargain. I love how they have 4 styles too, ranging from naturally to flirty to fun to dramatic. I will be buying these again!</li>
            <li> I love these lashes! Yes the band is a little thick but how can you beat the price? For the thinner lashes you can double them up for an even fuller effect! They are fabulous and def worth buying wether you&#x27;re a novice or an expert, great for practicing too.. I only use synthetic because I like the way they look and feel.. The main thing I liked about these is in order to save for later use the glue will peel right off without leaving residue which is great! Great supply and amount for the money, ESP if you want a dramatic effect (which I love!) will be buying again!!!</li>
            <li> This product comes with 10 pair of 7 styles of eyelashes.  Depending on the type of lashes you prefer determines how much you will like the product.  Three styles of lashes are thin and more natural looking.  When I wear those, people assume the lashes are real.  Three other styles are much thicker and would still look semi-natural on women whose lashes are much thicker.  The last style of lashes are really cute and they crisscross.  I have yet to wear that style but I love them all the same.  The money paid for these lashes are nothing compared to quantity of lashes.  Depending on the type of glue used for application, these lashes can be reusable.  Now I have to see if they have a bundle of individual lashes.  I would love to try those next, if they offer them.</li>
            <li> Fantastic economic necessary and luxurious indeed. the only downside is that the lashes arent soft so when theyr on your eyes they may bother you but if you use a good glue with good technique you shouldnt have a problem- saved loads of money on this its exactly what i was looking for thank you!</li>
            <li> Often you get what you pay for, and the price and the quality of these lashes are definitely correlative. The lashes are synthetic (seem \\&quot;plasticky\\&quot;) and are not of superb quality, however, they are okay, which is frankly better than I expected for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been wearing falsies for about seven years, usually the Ardell brand because that&#x27;s what&#x27;s available at the beauty supply chains for about $3-5 a pop. These lashes feel less natural than the Ardell version, but for 70 pairs (!) you cannot beat the price, even if they end up only good for a single use each. 70 uses of the Ardell lashes would probably run me at LEAST $50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received seven different styles and was very pleased to receive some \\&quot;natural\\&quot; styles along with the newer, trendy, feathery-style lashes. These lashes are a bit stiff, as other reviewers mentioned, but I use the Lashtite adhesive, which will hold anything on. I cut some of the more natural lashes apart and applied as singles. I love them for this purpose at this price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> luv them they should give you choice,  like the long dark ones, reusable, cheap, I will only buy the bundle.</li>
            <li> I love the look .... Just got my false eyelashes today was very excited. I read most of the reviews and they were very helpful. The rim is thicker but it is managable....n for the price this is a great deal....my mom loves how they look on me..can&#x27;t wait to wear them tonight....they are long and some r very dramatic and some r for everyday...this collection gives u a look for everyday... Love my eyes...definitely a fan now</li>
            <li> They are pretty but did not fit the shape or size of eyes. I had to cut them to fit and they are so thick they wouldn&#x27;t curve to fit my eye. I have a big box of lashes that I cannot use unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Great deal for the money there were many types I would not wear but for the price I just buy the whole box and get rid of rid of what I don&#x27;t like&lt;br /&gt;Great lashes. Great shipping</li>
            <li> LOVE these lashes but a set of the really dramatic ones were missing a piece of lashes regardless I am going to buy again! :)</li>
            <li> not only was this bundle a GREAT value but some of the best lashes i&#x27;ve purchased yet! and ive purchased a LOT!</li>
            <li> i am someone who wears eyelashes daily, so it gets pretty expensive. when i saw this deal i was shocked and just had to have it. i got my package in two days and it came in great shape all the eyelashes were in place. putting them on is no problem, it was well worth the money good thing i bought two boxes,  ill defintetly be ordering these again (thats when i finally run outn:) )</li>
            <li> The lashes look great and for 15.99, I don&#x27;t mind not being able to reuse them. The quality isn&#x27;t the finest horse hairs from a hidden village or anything, but I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re a lot better looking than the Japanese ones I used to buy that just looked like shiny black plastic. Overall, I would highly recommend this product and I&#x27;d definitely buy again :)</li>
            <li> only 3 out of 7 were good for my eyes&lt;br /&gt;the rest are over dramatic and fake looking</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never ordered false lashes online and was a little nervous about what the quality would be like. I&#x27;m very pleased.. I would say drug-store quality. The hairs look natural (may be synthetic though, I&#x27;m not sure). I ordered two boxes. I think they doubled up on one type in one of the boxes, but I&#x27;m not complaining. All styles are really cute and different, from a fun night out type to a more natural type. Excited to use them! Delivery was on time, no issue with Buyer at all.</li>
            <li> Love the variety of lashes.... Intensity goes from natural to drag queen lol&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to apply... Durable and reusable... Will last forever.... The only eyelashes you&#x27;ll ever need to buy....</li>
            <li> I received this product in 3 days via USPS. The package was easy to open and the lashes are AMAZING. They dont have that plastic feeling to it, and you get different type of lashes for different occasion. I have only worn the natural look, but i can&#x27;t wait to try on the more dramatic ones. Maybe its because i am a pro at applying eyelashes, but the fact that they weren&#x27;t curved did not bother me. All you have to do it put your glue and curve them to shape your eye. While you curve them blow on the glue to not only pre-dry it before you apply them, but also it give your eyelashes the curve you so desire. Finally have a twizzer near you for easier maneuver of the lashes. And voila ! Finally, do not use white glue when you apply eyelshes. use black glue ( amazon sells it). Your lashes are black, your mascara will be black and your eyeliner is black, not sure why anyone would use white glue. The residue shows up. Hope i was of any help</li>
            <li> I purchased these recently through my husbands account with prime so I did not pay shipping.  I was definitely debating this purchase for a long time because I don&#x27;t like waste.  Personally I adore all things cosmetic and am a new freelancer.  I wear false lashes occasionally, and I have used them on clients for recent work.  I decided after watching some YouTube videos and reading reviews here that at this low price it would be worth it to grab these.  I&#x27;m going to use them to become more comfortable with cutting, stacking, and otherwise customizing different lash styles for different looks and at this price it won&#x27;t pain me.  The price to me is amazing, and if you have $16 (plus possible shipping) to spare and want to become comfortable with lashes I would HIGHLY recommend grabbing these as they ring in at about 23 cents per pair.  Onto the specifics of the lashes themselves and why I like them so much . . . Three of the styles are extremely dramatic, thick and black.  At first you might think that you would never wear them however I think they&#x27;d be good for really glam looks or nights out with some tweaking.  They&#x27;re certainly not day appropriate for most people but that&#x27;s where the other four sheets of lashes come in.  Three of the styles are spaced out and more natural, varying in length and taper.  There is also a crisscross style which is very pretty.  The bands are generally thick and stiff, and I have noticed quite a few pairs with extra glue both on and underneath the lash band which I want to remove.  I&#x27;ve had some success picking some of it off with my tweezers or clean fingernails but if anyone has suggestions on how to remove the thick amount on some of the more dramatic pairs I would appreciate it as I don&#x27;t want it to show through.  Maybe using a dark or black eyeshadow would cover it up?  In any case, even though the lashes are synthetic they are not overly shiny or super-fake looking. Regarding the crisscross pair, I wanted to let everyone readingknow that when I received mine, the hairs were nicely crisscrossed however they were kind of stuck/clumped together which I didn&#x27;t like the look of.  I decided to grab a completely clean and sanitized old mascara brush (I keep them after my mascaras finished for brushing out eyebrows and random things but obviously a spoolie will work perfectly) and ran the brush over the lashes while they were still adhered to the sheet.  I have to tell you, this opened up the lashes very nicely - now my crisscrossed lashes are fluttery and beautiful at the ends as each hair is separated.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to go at it with some pressure because these lashes are sturdy and can take the beating.  The other point I wanted to share is that 5 out of the 7 styles (2 of the dramatic, 2 of the natural, and the crisscrossed) in this set are tapered at both ends and longest in the middle, meaning that if you are like me and don&#x27;t want too much dramatic length throughout/don&#x27;t have much space between your lash line and brows, you will be able to cut one strip exactly down the middle and use it as two half lashes.  I tested it out with a crisscross pair and it makes these lengthy lashes much more wearable.  It&#x27;s so exciting that I will be able to get more looks out of them this way.  Lastly, these lashes will need to be wrapped around a brush handle or pinky finger to make them a bit more pliable because of the band, or you may just want to save yourself some aggravation and cut them in either half/thirds/fourths and apply the pieces to your lash line (a lot of people do this for ease of application with lashes in general).  I would say if you have a little bit of time, and some scissors, you should go for it.  I hope this helped some of you decide.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I thought why not for this price.  I dumped the box in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect the quality of a Shu Uemura Lashes but these looked silly and were very difficult to even put on.  I&#x27;d rather have one high quality pair of lashes then a box of these.  Maybe if your on a stage every night, then these high drama lashes might work for you.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant at first on purchasing this item but figured for the price, what did I have to lose. Normal price for a good set of human hair lashes run about $3 to $7 depending on the brand and the store you purchase them from. Although some of the sets are a bit way too dramatic to wear on a daily basis, it&#x27;s a great bargain. I think I can trim them down a bit. If I mess up, there are 69 more pairs to keep trimming! The bands on some of the lashes are quite wide but I&#x27;m thinking with a little eyeliner it should be fine. (BTW using my husband&#x27;s Amazon account to purchase) :) DK</li>
            <li> I love the veriety, their are some lashes that are natrual, sexy, and fun. This product is really worth its price.</li>
            <li> I am a PRO Makeup Artist and purchased these lashes for weddings, &amp; on location jobs. They look great &amp; have a good variety of natural to more dramatic but are not over the top. I recommend these to anyone who wants fuller, natural looking, sexy lashes!</li>
            <li> These are great eyelashes. Mine came with 5 different styles and the other 2 were the same as one so I have 30 of one style with was a downer. But I will get more of these when I run low because they are great. Shipping was freaky fast too.</li>
            <li> I guess I can&#x27;t say much on this since I paid such a cheap amount. They are cheap. And they might take some time to bend properly. I tried one on and it would not bend. So, I don&#x27;t know. Cheap product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner and instead of spending lots of money on different eyelashes i decided to buy a bundle. It is a great decision. Different Styles and lots of them, it&#x27;s enough to last me for at least a year. I&#x27;ve worn one pair of them for 3 times now and after i got used to how to stick them on and how they feel on my eyes, they&#x27;re great. Only thing is that you have to buy your own glue which is not a big deal, there are lots of glue out there that works well, the one i use is by Darkness and works great with these. After i take them off i just wash it under warm water and use a tissue to tap dry and then store them for next time</li>
            <li> everything i thought it would be. i love the different variety of lashes. they have lashes for day and eve ware.</li>
            <li> i really ilke them and great price to ... but you have to take the lash off carefull if you them fast they will brake but really good last i will buy them again :)</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this purchase due to the fact that you got so many lashes for so cheap. However, after opening the box and seeing the amount i received and the variety, I was thrilled. The lashes are SYNTHETIC hair, so they are a bit more stiff and take a skilled hand to glue on. If your wanting more natural looking lashes, this may not be your first choice, but if your a diva like me, than your going to be quiet pleased with your purchase.</li>
            <li> These are amazing! Recommended by a friend, and i couldn&#x27;t pass up this deal. Who wouldn&#x27;t love long lashes for every occasion? Weddings, partied, Halloween,  costumes, dressing up. There are plenty of styled to pick from....conservative to crazy.</li>
            <li> The bands on the eyelashes do not bend and make it impossible to stick onto my eyelids.  I can only use two packages of 10 of the lightest lashes because the thicker the lashes are the stiffer the band.  I&#x27;m using DUO glue and I cannot get the other 5 types of lashes to stay on.  I can&#x27;t wear over half the lashes, what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I received the eyelashes in one day which was great- but the quality of the lashes did not match up to the photographs. I will have to trim down some of the lashes because they are way too long (I wear lashes everyday), but for the price I paid, I am satisfied. Will be sticking to my usual Asian brand Shisem/Darkness lashes from now on. These lashes remind me a lot of the Ardell Runway lashes- super long, super dramatic, but quality not as similar.</li>
            <li> As a newcomer to the world of false eyelashes I purchased these for \\&quot;practice\\&quot;, thinking that they would be a good, less expensive alternative to drugstore lashes (which can become quite an expense over time), helping me to get used to both applying them and wearing them.  Not so much.  Not only do these look like plastic, they feel and behave like plastic.  The flexibility is almost nil, and every &#x27;style&#x27; of lash in this assortment is far too thick and far too long, so they looked nothing resembling natural.  I have made the few sets of drugstore lashes that I have purchased in the past last for several applications simply by handling them gently and keeping them clean.  Although it&#x27;s more time-consuming, I&#x27;ll be going back to that method.  These will be going in the trash.  If there were a lower rating than one star, I would have selected that one instead.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the lashes are human hair or not or if I can re-use them but I love them. I love the selection</li>
            <li> I am giving this 5 stars because I didn&#x27;t have high expectations when i bought this. if you are expecting some top quality lashes these aren&#x27;t it. I think these are super fun lashes and not everyday lashes. and for the price and how many you get I would recommend to a friend</li>
            <li> I bought these for my sister as part of a birthday gift one year,  now every year I make sure to get them for her,  she loves the variety,  Great buy!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. I&#x27;m a huge lash wearer, usually just for going out or special occasions, Lashes usually cost me $4-$6 a pair at the drug store, so when I saw this, i thought it was too good to be true. Its an awesome value. Packaging is small, i was surprised! Its compact enough for me to leave out on my makeup station and have it not be obtrusive, yet the lashes inside are secure and they were not damaged in transit. I love the idea of having multiple sets of the same lashes for several reasons. One obviously being you need to replace them after wear and tear, the other being I love to alter the length for different effects. The natural lashes can be cropped shorter (just outer edges) for a more subtle pretty daytime look or you can crop them to fit your entire lash line and its a fuller, more dramatic evening look. Lastly, You can also crop the more crazy dramatic lashes in this set (That some people may shy away from) for just the outer eye so they are not so overwhelming if thats not your style. I def think this is worth the price. Even if i only use 3 pairs out of this box, its the same as going to the store so it was a no brainer. &lt;3 BUY IT NOW!</li>
            <li> Some of them won&#x27;t go stay on even with eye glue.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes are not flexible</li>
            <li> These lashes are awesome. It&#x27;s a very nice verity of lashes to switch up for night or day. I liked them so well I got another one for my sister and I shared mine with my daughter. I will buy them again.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the quality. ..variety and price!</li>
            <li> I love these lashed I even used some of the thinner lashes to make my own bottom lashes. I like that I can reuse them and they really exaggerate my big eyes. I don&#x27;t even have to clip the but that probably because I have huge eyes. Awesome!</li>
            <li> I love the lashes! I received 70 pairs for less than $20!what a deal.Plus, the quality of the lashes is excellent.I get at least 3 uses out of them, meaning I have worn them, taken them off, and then re-applied the same pair again and again. Additionally, they arrived on-time and had no shipping cost. Highly recommend  this product and seller</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this the eyelashes are way to thick not good at all I want my money back... if you buy this you crazy.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  They arrived quickly and are all in good shape &amp; pretty, not to mention the money your saving.</li>
            <li> I wear false lashes almost daily, and I love changing my look. One day, more natural, the next day I look more vamp. I have been buying my lashes in the drugstore, but that adds up. I also read that some human hair lashes can actually be made out of animal hair, and as a vegan, that is not ok with me! So I ordered these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are ten styles, though a few look alike to me. Really you do get a nice variety of looks, and I love the value. These are less than 10% of what I have been paying for other lashes. They do on well for me after trimming and bending, but you do need to put the time in for these steps. You also need to use a great lash glue like Duo, which is avalible on Amazon. [[ASIN:B00027D8IC Duo Lash Adhesive, Clear, 0.25 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that was bad, some of the stips fell apart as I was trying to peel them off the plastic they come on. I was being slow and careful, and I had been sucessful with other pairs. Some styles of lash seem improperly made so they just fall apart. Still, even when I accounted for those, I was still happy with the price and selection and will 100% use this product in the future.</li>
            <li> bought bc the quantity was high and price was low but you pay for what you get bc the quality was poor. very plastic.</li>
            <li> As an avid user of lashes, I&#x27;ve tried them all. I absolutely love MAC but can&#x27;t afford them for daily use. A long time user of Ardell as well. However, with all the positive reviews, I had to try these. The package comes with a variety. There is only one that I found to be unwearable, because they are too long, and the strip was too thick and wouldn&#x27;t curve correctly. I do not like cutting my lashes in two like others have suggested, because the line looks odd then, when I try to match my liner.  Bottom line, it&#x27;s great to wear and toss without feeling guilty that I only got one use out of them for $5-15 a pair. At about .25 cents a pair, I wear daily and dispose. I did try once to remove the glue to see if I could tweak a second wearing out of them, but the lashes ripped off. Again, at a quarter, I&#x27;m totally happy and will certainly be re-ordering. I recommend these for daily use, and for those extra special occasions and big nights out, I&#x27;ll use the MAC or Ardell. You can&#x27;t go wrong with these, you&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> So I was a little worried getting this because it seemed too good to be true. I just got my package today and I&#x27;m blown away! there are 70 pairs of lashes. They are the same quality of any ardell or similar brand lashes, so that is an extra bonus. The band on the lashes is a little thicker then what I like, but as a makeup artist I go through a lot of lashes and this will help me out so much! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, and if anyone else is worried about it don&#x27;t, get them!!</li>
            <li> At my local Drug Store AND Beauty Supply store, lashes go for $3.50-$5.00 just for ONE pair! I could not believe the deal on this, I instantly got them, no problem with shipping. And then I had so many different styles to choose from! I wear lashes just about everyday when I go to work or just to go out, they are PERFECT and they are reusable which is good too! I would use ARDELL lash glue, it works the best and you can get it at your drugstore or beauty supply. A MUST recomnendtion for anyone who loves to wear lashes.</li>
            <li> I loved these!  Great deal and I expected them to have a lot of defects but they were perfect for my needs.  I would order these again!</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought these.  The price is awesome.  The product is really good.  It is not human hair lashes but plastic,,  Still, It is well made and has an assortment.  It looks good on!  I also use a pair more than once and extend it to 4 uses before it starts to unravel when I peel the eyelash glue off.  Well worth the purchase.  I still have a lot left and wear these at least 4 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  December 2015.  Bought this product, again.  I still think it is still a good product.  I do have to snip off a small piece  to fit my eyes.  But I do that to any fake lashes I buy, even the real hair lashes. There are times that I have to work with these lashes by bending them a bit to easily fit my eye shape.  But, same goes for the human hair lashes.  It lasts long - at least i can get more than one times the wear on each of them.  Also, I do add mascara to make it look natural.  This is even advisable from the make-up artist at the department stores, like Macy&#x27;s, when you buy their fake eye lashes that run at least $15 a pair.  This product suits me fine.  Will probably buy them again in another year.</li>
            <li> Opening this package I was very excited to see what I purchased for my friend for Christmas. I was WAY TOO curious not to see, so I did. What I saw was so disturbing, I ran to the restroom and threw up! There was a dead animal/bug on one of the lash strips!!!! If this isn&#x27;t bad, I don&#x27;t know what is!! Don&#x27;t buy!!!! So gross!!</li>
            <li> Nice assortment of styles.  If you tried to clean up the glue adhesive (that&#x27;s already on it) it breaks the lash base.  So I found that only DUO glue works with these lashes without having to remove the adhesives. Just peel out the lashes, and add a line of DUO glue on the base. hope that helps others... I had wasted money buying other lash glue, and they stopped working mid way. Not fun....</li>
            <li> Alright, I&#x27;m gonna try to make this as easy to understand as possible, I&#x27;m awful at describing things. These lashes are good. They are priced perfectly for the quality. The band is definitely hard to work with, but it is do-able. I&#x27;m very experienced with lashes, so that&#x27;s also why I am giving them this high of a rating. If you&#x27;re new to lashes? Walk away. You have to trim any lash to fit your eye which I think is also a contributor to the bad ratings. Anyone who doesn&#x27;t have experience with lashes is going to hate these. So far I&#x27;ve only tried the thicker pair and they do look fake but that&#x27;s expected.. No one has lashes that thick and perfect naturally so I don&#x27;t mind that you can tell I&#x27;m wearing lashes. That&#x27;s the point. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase, but I wish I could purchase just one particular style because I&#x27;m not gonna get the most use out of the more natural style lashes. But for the price I will probably purchase again because I love a few of the styles so much. I&#x27;ve found that the easiest way to get the lashes to curve a little more than they were made to is to bend them completely in a circle and blow your hot breath on them. Sort of like you&#x27;re blowing your breath on glasses to clean them off. The moist heat seems to make curving the band easier. Hope this is helpful!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of these lashes already so I thought I&#x27;d write a review. These lashes are not super high end (like brands such as Dolly Wink) but they are good for everyday use and you can use a pair of eyelashes more than once if you take care of them ! (Although, for hygiene purposes I would throw a pair out if you have worn them 5 times or more...). If these are too long you can always cut them and also a fun trick is to cut some of them in half for those cute wispy demi lashes at the end of your eyes, it gives such an adorable flirty look ! Overall good lashes but I don&#x27;t really recommend getting these from Amazon... your best bet is to get these on Ebay. They have 10 Pairs of lashes for each style for about a dollar - which would cut the price in half and you&#x27;d also get to choose your styles.</li>
            <li> They are so easy to put on.. I would love to buy these again when I run out. Also they ship this fast!! GREAT FAKE LASHES!!</li>
            <li> I like the lashes.  There are various designs for every social gathering I go to.  There are probably 4 designs I would not wear for myself but over all, I like them.</li>
            <li> Looks like what I expected. You can&#x27;t beat the price. In good condition when it arrived.</li>
            <li> All the lashes have glue on them that STAYS on them! Its does not come out of the lashes. Its this thick plastic glue gun material and does not rub off. I know all the lashes lightly sticks to the box but these are GLUED to the box and the glue stays ON the lashes!    Its such a great price if it weren&#x27;t for that defect. None of the lashes can be of use because of this which is unfortunate.</li>
            <li> I love the way these lashes feel. They are great, I&#x27;ve re-used one pair three times already and they hold up better than expected.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for my clients because they have 7 different styles to choose from, I have a lash for every occasion or personality. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> you get A LOT of lashes, but they are hard to apply. They are stiff and most wont stay on. even with the best glue out there.  dont try to use lases more than once.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy this product again, but I won&#x27;t have to for a while since there&#x27;re sooo many sets in this box.  It&#x27;s true that there&#x27;re a lot of sets, but the average girl can&#x27;t wear all these styles. Some are just way too over the top obvious that you&#x27;re wearing false lashes. Even if you wear only one style, it&#x27;s worth the price since I&#x27;d paid around $4.00 for only one pair. The strip is thicker and less plyable than some brands and very uncomfortable and distracting to wear if you don&#x27;t cut the strips into at least three pieces before you apply them. If you don&#x27;t mind doing that, they&#x27;re perfectly comfortable and look great. I would recommend these lashes unless you&#x27;re really picky about your lashes. They&#x27;re not the same quality as the store bought ones, but I like them just fine for the price.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes! The bonus of having sooo many styles and amounts is great for the price. They are actually the ones shown! Gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Just came in today! Just as it look like on the pitcure i&#x27;m looking forward to buying more and soon!</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife because she had it on her wish list and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes and I&#x27;ve received nothing but compliments from my friends and coworkers! I like to wear a variety of lashes and this was a perfect package! I wish these lashes came with the option to subscribe and save. The thicker lashes were easy to put on and I like to wear them when I go out.  The thinner lashes I wear for work and they look very natural. I was able to clean and reuse the thicker lashes, but I couldn&#x27;t do it with the thinner ones. The pair I wore today, literally came apart after I took them off. You get what you pay for, but for the price, I&#x27;ll just buy another box. :)</li>
            <li> These lashes came in yesterday, I am asian, so only 30 or so lashes work for me the others are just way too long or dramatic. ANother con i had noticed is that the bands are unusually  thick and do not bend, they are pretty stiff. Some of my lashes had white glue on the bands so, i simply went over it with permanent marker. Not bad for the price at all, but quality wise i am not impressed.</li>
            <li> The product was ok, and it came in just 2days. but sending me just 60 pairs?? I think that&#x27;s an issue and box seems tampered. I&#x27;m may think twice before ordering again.</li>
            <li> but some need the inner eye corner cut since the plastic line continued on</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of &amp;#34;gyaru&amp;#34; inspired make up which calls for lots of lashes so long was a plus. So I wasn&#x27;t looking not for subtle lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The band is kinda stiff but they aren&#x27;t the worst bands in the world like I read.&lt;br /&gt;If you bend them before applying there should be no problems. Some of the lash band have too much of the hair sticking out from the other side but I just snipped it a bit and boom, it worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lashes are soft but not all the lashes on each page are the same length. This isn&#x27;t terrible because now you can have super dramatic lashes and just regular dramatic lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are definitely not drugstore lashes in quality but drugstores in my area didn&#x27;t carry the type of lashes that I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy these again when I run out of lashes because they&#x27;re a great deal and get the job done.</li>
            <li> The variety of lashes is great, however they do not want to stay on no matter what I did.</li>
            <li> Love the fact I have plenty to share and wear and I dont have to save it I can get another one luv it</li>
            <li> The pictures of this product made these eyelashes look great. I&#x27;ve purchased from bundle monster before and I was happy with their previous products so I decided to try these out. The model is asian and the lashes don&#x27;t look too bad on her. I received the lashes and I didn&#x27;t have the same problem with the excess glue like the other ladies do here. My problem with the lashes is that they look like lashes you buy during halloween at the costume store. In no way shape or form do these lashes look natural on your eyes. The quality of the lashes is really plastic-y. I know they were cheap lashes, but come on these are pretty bad (I bought lashes from flea market style place in a 3rd world country and they were the best lashes in the world and they were 75 cents a pair). These lashes are too long even the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ones. Would not recommend unless you&#x27;re getting them bc you are either a tranny, gogo dancer, or a stripper. It&#x27;s pretty much a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Pros:  -Super fast shipping.  -Great value for price.  -I&#x27;m an everyday user and one pair of these lashes last me a week.    -Loved the variety. Used the \\&quot;drag queen lashes\\&quot; on halloween.  Cons:   Takes some practice putting these on as they do not hold their shape.</li>
            <li> I just bought my second box but i still have pair left from my first box i bought 9months ago. Seriously a box could last you a year if you preserve them well and save you hundreds!! best product every!!!</li>
            <li> i guess its good value but the lashes are pretty bad quality... white glue shows and the texture is very hard.. and the shine makes it especially fake looking. i would probably only use half of these, the other half are way too dramatic looking.</li>
            <li> Nice variety from conservative to wild and unbelievably crazy long. You could even share with friends or trim down if too long and see how it turns out. The bands are easy to work with, no problems with stiffness or &amp;#34;popping up&amp;#34; while trying to affix with glue. Good deal.</li>
            <li> these are just wonderful. makes me feel like i&#x27;m actually getting all dolled up. lol very cute and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Wow! 70 pair for $15.00???? Unbelievable but I bought them anyway taking a chance they were cheaply made or tacky looking. I got them today and they were even more unbelievable in person! None of them had any flaws, greatly packaged and organized.I&#x27;m wearing a pair now and cant stop glancing in the mirror to bat my eyes at myself lol! No regrets!</li>
            <li> Worst product I have ever received from Amazon. Lashes come right apart when you take them of the holder. Very plastic looking. Not easy to fit eyes. I guess its guid for the club scene but not for everyday use. They look very cheap. horrible</li>
            <li> This was so amazing, at walgreens, like one package is $3.00! This comes with different sizes, this can do no wrong! Love it, BEST THING I EVER BOUGHT!&lt;3</li>
            <li> Ive been using fake eye lashes for a while now and these work amazing and look real ! The only thing i would recommend is buying extra glue for them.</li>
            <li> I ordered the bundle pack of lashes because I use them all the time. They came promptly in the mail. They were of very good quality and honestly you really can&#x27;t beat that deal. I will most definitly be ordering again from this company.</li>
            <li> i love this bundles of false lashes, so much to choose from. I would recommend it to people who loves wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> Nice variety, fit well. Easy choice either pay $15 for a pack of five or $12 for a pack of 70! Can use each pair more than once as well. Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time!</li>
            <li> I enjoy my lashes. Cheaper and arrived in good condition. I plan to buy the ones for parties. The fun lashes.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to hear about this bundle from Andrea&#x27;s Choice on YouTube that I just had to buy it. I will probably never have to buy lashes again since I do not wear them daily or anything, but these are good quality lashes! I love that they come in so many different styles as well. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> So many plus reusable. Not a 100% quality look but doesn&#x27;t matter to me. Very wide though so that&#x27;s good if not just cut them. Excited to wear them in public!!</li>
            <li> They worked very well I would order them agin</li>
            <li> So, I agree with another reviewer who states that if you don&#x27;t know how to put on lashes, you;ll hate these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it takes two seconds to get the glue off the lashes. Second, bend the, wave them back and forth so they are flexible. Third, take your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear these for work, going out and even grocery shopping, there are lashes for every occasion. Have fun! :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this product! I couldn&#x27;t say enough good things about it. The shipping was exceedingly fast too. This is probably one of the best purchases I have made in a while.</li>
            <li> This is really a great buy. I&#x27;m super super pleased with these eyelashes they are beautiful! Can&#x27;t wait to wear them out! I will be purchasing again. Shipping was extremely fast also! thx ;)</li>
            <li> I know there has been some mixed reviews on this item, some people didnt like the length some people didnt like the quality. Let be honest here.. It&#x27;s 15 dollars for 70 pairs of lashes! It doesnt get better then that. You pay 5 dollars a box for almost the same quality in a drug store. This was such an amazing find for someone like myself who wears them almost everyday thanks SO MUCH bundle monster!!!! Will be reordering SOON!</li>
            <li> Great price, No problem with the lashes. They look real, Some are a little long on me, I just snip the corners.</li>
            <li> and its heavy! if youre planning to wear out for a long day or night out i do not recommend bc these will droop down and make you look sleepy after some time. i constantly had to push these up. but these eyelashes are good for experimenting on what type of false lashes you would be interested in using.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased these and she was excited to receive them. Once she unpacked these, she could not stop complementing the product and how fantastic she looked and for your information I agreed as well as many others. This product is great and not cheap quality.</li>
            <li> Although they aren&#x27;t the best quality, but you can&#x27;t beat the price!! Good for practice and a few different looks depending on what you like or how dramatic you want to go. If you are picky with your false lashes and only go name brand you may not like so much. But then there&#x27;s the people in between rest like myself who don&#x27;t mind and love them!! Bought about 4 of these bundles already they are great!! There are so many you don&#x27;t have to re use them and for the price can&#x27;t beat it!! Have gotten many compliments on these when wearing them :).</li>
            <li> They loose their shape and hairs fall off fast. Very shinny</li>
            <li> This bundle is a great deal for sure. I purchased these when I first starting doing makeup over a year ago. It&#x27;s a great starter kit, but some of the kinds of lashes have a hard edge and are hard to apply because of that and/or they hurt your eyes. I&#x27;d still recommend them, just wouldn&#x27;t use the hard edged ones.</li>
            <li> Great value. Decent look and wear depending on your use. Good for recitals and costume makeup, but awful for daily use or special occasions. Very obvious and a stiff band. Completely unnatural looking. Had my box almost a year now and only used 4 pairs of the 70. Threw the rest of them away yesterday. Won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> These are amazing quality for as cheap as they are. They are easily trimmed down to fit your eye shape and are great for dramatic looks. Easy to apply, the sticky residue that attaches them to the plastic makes it easy to wrap the lashed around your brushes to shape them for even easier application. I even trimmed down the thinner lashes and applied them as individual lashes for a weekday look. I would highly suggest these!</li>
            <li> These were a good value in that you got so many pairs of eyelashes, but unfortunately, these are not at all natural looking. I have been very happy in the past with fake eyelashes from the local store. Unfortunately, all of these are way overdone. I will never wear these.</li>
            <li> Great can reuse if u take the glue off nicely and don&#x27;t ruin them. One box last me forever. I love to double up on them too</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these lashes there so cute and flirty and if anyone who loves lashes and knows how expensive there are at a store would love these too because of the price... These lashes are amazing and I would highly recommend them</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d try this \\&quot;fake\\&quot; lashes set - seemed a little too good to be true (value wise)...and it was. Terrible quality, meaning impossible to apply and super fake looking. These synthetic lashes are the worst! Human Hair lashes are much easier to apply and they look amazing. These are just horrible and they look ridiculous...especially because they are not flexible and do not apply completely. I returned them immediately for a refund. Instead, I just order several styles of Red Cherry lashes so I am looking forward to receiving those (100% Human Hair lashes). You can find them on Amazon.com, too. Great prices! Search for them :) Please don&#x27;t waste your time, money and return shipping on this mess.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with my new lashes! They are good quality and so versatile!  If you are looking for a dramatic feel the fuller ones are so perfect, and if you want something subtle they&#x27;ve got a few that will compliment an everyday look! Since getting them a few weeks ago I have worn them just about everywhere, I would recommend this product and fully intend on buying this again!  Can&#x27;t beat this price!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this and rec&#x27;d the item very quickly.  There are so many varieties of lashes to choose from its great.  You need to buy eyelash glue though b/c they dont stick to your lashes without it.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> If you want a dramatic, sexy look than buy these! You wont find a deal as good as this one anywhere! I am a pin up model so I wear lashes a lot and they&#x27;re usually about 4 bucks a pop. I will admit that these are slightly less quality than the 4 dollar ones but the price is so good that it more than makes up for it. Plus, who is touching your eyelashes to see if they&#x27;re realistic feeling? The people that said these were difficult to put on were simply just bad at putting on false eyelashes. If you are new to false lashes, here is a really great tip for application; snip the weft of lashes into 3-4 big sections and apply one section at a time, that way it wont keep popping up in the corners while you try to adhere them to your lid :)</li>
            <li> so i been buying from bundle monster for 2 yrs now great deal on eyelashes i usually buy 2 boxes at a time i loooove them so many different types to choice from! will continue buying :)</li>
            <li> I guess I already knew half of it would be unwearable, but it seemed so cheap for so many so I bought this bundle anyways. Well, its not completely a waste of money but I wish I didn&#x27;t. The quality is not really that great, even on the thinner lashes. The glue adhesive that&#x27;s on it to make it stick to the plastic can&#x27;t be taken off. And when you take it off the plastic, it&#x27;s very straight. It doesn&#x27;t have a curve to it that fits your eyes. Takes a while to get them on right since theyre so stiff. I used to wear the super thick lashes that come with these (from Model21) but no longer do because I realized how hideous they actually look, I mean they are literally camel lashes. Unless you like that look, don&#x27;t bother getting these. You&#x27;ll be stuck with unwearable caterpillars!</li>
            <li> The thicker/more dramatic lashes were fine, but the thinner lashes were more difficult to work with and didn&#x27;t fit well.</li>
            <li> I am soooo disappointed with these lashes. Very poor quality and not easy to put on. You get what you pay for!! These were CHEAP and they are CHEAP.  Skip them....you will be happy with a better quality brand.</li>
            <li> when i bought this eyelashes i was very excited to get it in the mail... it arrived here only three days...which that was great.. but the only that was bad about it was that there wasnt 70 pairs of eyelashes..there was only 60 so i am dissppointed about that...but everything else was great fast delivery...got here in 3 days only..havent tried it yet to tell u if its good or not..but will try soon</li>
            <li> This is agreat deal for the money! The lashes can be kinda stiff at first but you just have to work them a little bit. Once you loosen them up a bit they are fine. I wear lashes quite alot and I think they are an awesome deal. I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> When i first got the lashes i expected Ardell-quality lashes . But then i remembered i payed 16 bucks for 70 &amp; set my standards lower . I only wear these once &amp; they do their job extremely well considering the price . I would buy this bundle again because its nice knowing that i always have a pair of lashes to pull out of my arsenal !</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve gave them 5 stars if they were flexible like human lashes -- but, still great deal! I&#x27;m happy with them.</li>
            <li> I liked that was able to buy these lashes in bulk but some of them I could not use. They were too dramatic for me. However, I gave a lot of them away. Some women prefer the dramatic look but I do not. I loved the crisscrossed ones.</li>
            <li> 7 different styles, 10 pairs each, for way less than a dollar a pair why not? The band isn&#x27;t too thick, and the length is perfect for my eyes though the lashes do feel and look a lot like plastic. I didn&#x27;t have to do any trimming. Quality wise, there is nothing wrong with them so far (no shedding, glue comes off etc.) I can re-use lashes also that I have used. They&#x27;re good as any other cheap lashes. Definitely recommend if you&#x27;ve used falsies before and you&#x27;re looking for some usable cheap ones.</li>
            <li> Genius the fact that you have many styles to give different looks from everyday to dramatic night life . I would recommend this to others it gives them a chance to see which style thay prefer.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes, they are the best I have ever purchased, comfortable, easy to fit on my eye. And not sharp!!&lt;br /&gt;You can tell these are good quality false lashes.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful price for eyelashes and quite a variety. The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like is because there are only 2 lashes that look natural the rest are really full. If you are looking for natural lashes these are not for you. The rest of the lashes are really thick and full and I didn&#x27;t like it so mine are just sitting on my vanity.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product unless you are a pro at putting on eyelashes. I had to work the lashes to make them useable for my eye shape. These lashes do last all day and I have been able to see the lashes from a distance. I just do not like the design of the lashes. The fiber band that keeps the lashes in place does not bend easily, and I can definitely feel this band on my eye all day long.</li>
            <li> They all looked great. Just like the pictures. There was just one individual set that looked like it was cut kind of. But 69 of 70 pairs were perfect! Fantastic deal!</li>
            <li> So lame most of the shapes are so ugly and I never wore I ended up throwing them all away. I&#x27;m an eyelash PRO. Don&#x27;t get these cheapies</li>
            <li> This are big full lashes so not good for everyday wear.  I did like the different styles but beware, you will not have the natural look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I was expecting the gift came with a lot of different styles and the person I got them for liked them a lot !!</li>
            <li> Omg!!!! Love love love the bundle of eye lashes I have to get another bundle soon!! Love wearing them and being fierce!!!</li>
            <li> These lashes are the perfect touch up to my makeup. They can be pretty stiff, but with the right glue, and after you cut to size, you&#x27;ll have flawless lashes. Anyone who doesn&#x27;t buy this package is missing out!</li>
            <li> These lashes are a very good value, and they are very good quality, but they are a little too extreme. All but 2 style of lashes I cannot wear - they just look ridiculous on me. Maybe in a photo shoot, but other than that - I don&#x27;t know what to do with them. I kinda wish I hadn&#x27;t bought these. But if you like extreme lashes, I would definitely recommend them. They all come perfectly packaged - none are damaged, and again, they are very good lashes.</li>
            <li> These lashes arrived fast, I ordered them Saturday with 2 day shipping and somehow they got to me Monday in CA. These lashes are long so they will need to be trimmed, in other words they will probably be too long for your eye because they are longer than the standard Ardell lashes, Andrea lashes, and Kiss lashes (I wear them all without trimming). I took a pair of Ardell lashes and cut the Monster bundle lashes to be the same length. They are not human hair so they are not soft, but you get what you pay for (plastic). I will order them again because they do look  great once they are on and they are less than a $1 each so I will not reuuse them, I feel good throwing them away after each use.</li>
            <li> I give this product one star because they look plastic, aren&#x27;t flexible, and the glue is a waste of time. Save your money if you are looking for affordable but natural looking lashes check out my other reviews you will find some lashes that i purchased that I absolutely adore.</li>
            <li> The Bundle Monster 70 Pairs Fake Eyelashes are just wonderful to have especially if you love doing makeup. I like that they are lightweight, easy to apply, and super comfortable. With seven different styles to chose from and 70 pairs total is enough to last a whole year or longer.  I love cosmetology and I hoping to be a makeup artist one day so these were perfect for me. I get to test them out on my friends and myself. You can go dramatic with the thicker lashes, natural with the thin ones, or get really wild with the criss cross lashes. These finish off any look perfectly! I am so happy with my purchase and would highly recommend these lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that the Bundle Monster eyelashes are back in stock. This was the first pack of eyelashes i bought here on Amazon over a year ago and they lasted so long! A few months ago I ran out and was looking for the 70 pair deal again but couldn&#x27;t find the brand/distributor \\&quot;Bundle Monster\\&quot; because they were out of stock.&lt;br /&gt;I found another deal from the brand/dist \\&quot;Eye Splashes\\&quot; for 70 pairs of assorted lashes but they aren&#x27;t as good quality like these. They had akword and unnatural shapes to them and also they fall apart the first time you remove them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely the better way to go, dont be fooled by the other bulk eyelash dealers. Like I said, these lasted about a year, the EyeSplashes brand only lasted a few months because lower quality and I basicly threw out 3 palets of the ugly weird lashes (30 pairs of garbage)&lt;br /&gt;Obviously any bulk lashes will be lower quality than the drug store brands (like revlon which cost $3-4 each) but this is better quality than other bulk sellers. Also I liked using every one of the 7 styles, especially the criss-cross lashes. EyeSplashes doesn&#x27;t include the criss-cross lashes, and a few of their 7 palets are duplicates so you actually get like only 5 styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They came in a blank white box with a green circle sticker w. the Bundle Monster logo, not the red box that&#x27;s shown here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; * Also I should add that I dont use regular eyelash glue, i use hair glue (like for weave) because it keeps a stronger hold that lasts all day &amp;night. These lashes are strong enough to be reused about 4x or more depending how gently you remove old glue from them, but I usually just peel/rip off the old glue and them give them a quick rinse off the mascara before reapplying. Basicly they are strong enough to withstand my rough handling lol. Love these guys, you will too!</li>
            <li> When i got this package on my door, i was excited to see them. They&#x27;re so beautiful! They got to my door fast~ and i just love them, thats all i can say, and very cheap compare to a $6 ones that you get at stores and sometimes you cant even reuse them..</li>
            <li> BEST LASHES EVER. I BROUGHT THIS FOR A PHOTO SHOOT AND THIS WORKED PERFECT. I WILL BUY AGAIN. GREAT PRODUCT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> Still trying to figure these out..but for the price- what a great option to have. Several styles from normal to wild....and the price is great to experiment with. d t</li>
            <li> This bundle is truly amazing for performers.  There are 70 lashes, 10 pairs each of 7 different styles, and at less than $20 for the set it is an absolute steal!  These lashes are a little plastic-y, and they might not be great for people who want lashes to accentuate their everyday or more natural look, but for performers this set is a pretty good deal.  The larger sizes are ready to wear right out of the box, and the smaller lashes are perfect for layering together or for wearing as bottom lashes.  The smallest style isn&#x27;t that impressive, but again it would work for bottom lashes or for layering with other, fuller lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These aren&#x27;t ultra luxury, and they are not that natural looking, but they are a great addition to your kit if you are a performer, especially if you are as hard on lashes as I am!</li>
            <li> Extremely hard and plastic. I can&#x27;t even wear these.</li>
            <li> Missing 5 lashes, they are VERY durable and steady, the glue is SO easy to remove, however I had to cut some full models in halves because they are plastic like so they shine TOO artificially. However its a great purchase, no need to buy day or night lashes in a loong time.</li>
            <li> I bought these lashes because I use lashes all the time! And rather then spend at least $3 on just one pair of lashes I bought this box which has saved me money in the long run! They are good quality! I recommend these lashes to anyone who loves lashes!</li>
            <li> WONT STAY ON__ LOOK LIKE MISS PIGGY EYELASHES_ CHEAP AND WRONG.  DO NOT BUY THESE_ IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY_ BUY ARDELL</li>
            <li> I love that I have a variety of styles to choose from, that suits my needs for different occasions.  So easy to use.  This pack takes me to a simple, every day business casual look, to an all glammed up look for a party, and everything else in between.</li>
            <li> this is what i was looking for the item was great. i love this item it come right on time. Great secives!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> First off they are fake lashes, they are not by all means natural looking. There are two sets that are kind of natural but still long. I love using them for special occasions, such as chaperoning Prom, Gradnite, Graduation, weddings etc. I love to use them in vegas. You just toss them after a fun night and you are good to go. no need to try to find them to put them on the next day. I use Duo lash glue to adhere better. You do need to cut them to fit your eye because they are rather long. They are stiff but you can work with them by molding them. I have had them for 4 months and I want to say I am half way done with the box. ( I share with my friends and family all the time). The price of the box is the cost of one mac set. obviously the MAC ones look and feel better but I will save those for a date night.</li>
            <li> These eye lashes are not what I expected and are of very poor quality. Thick and bold lashes. A drag queen would LOVE these but not the average classy, working woman.</li>
            <li> I have saved so much money with buying these lashes, and I love the variety.I am completely satisfied and I am telling everyone about this steal of a deal.</li>
            <li> These are very plastic not hair looking.. don&#x27;t like to bend to eye shape. Still fun to wear for night time. Heck lets face it its dark. people cant tell then.</li>
            <li> I will not be running out anytime soon&lt;br /&gt;These lashes are great if you want a glamorous look&lt;br /&gt;But extremely stiff&lt;br /&gt;You have to really work with them and the band is kinda thick but what I do is just cut them in half and use as accents&lt;br /&gt;The whole lash  would be a bit much.theatre,dance.pagents.modeling.&lt;br /&gt; Would love these!!!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was on time.</li>
            <li> Great product and exceptional value!</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist and go through lashes like crazy. the amount of styles and lashes that you get in this bundle you won&#x27;t find cheaper anywhere else. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the lashes can sometimes be hard to get off of the clear appliqué due to the glue, so be careful taking them off as you could mess up the integrity of the lash!</li>
            <li> I wanted more bang for my buck instead of constantly buying indiviual packs at $2.99 each. The pack comes with a variety but the thicker lashes look much more natural than the thinner. You will have to manuvor the lashes for your eye but they are pretty sturdy. If you wear glass (like I do) i dont recomend putting them on because the lashes are long and make glasses wearing kinda hard.</li>
            <li> Since I am fairly new to the whole false eyelash thing, I decided to get this kit so I could not only try different styles, but also have plenty of pairs to practice with. Well, that&#x27;s exactly what I got. Although I&#x27;m pretty sure these aren&#x27;t the highest quality lashes you can find on the market, I couldn&#x27;t have been happier with the product in relation to how little I paid for them. Since I&#x27;ve been practicing with these opposed to wearing them out, I&#x27;ve been ripping them on and off repeatedly without any change to the shape, so they seem really durable. Indeed, some of the styles are extremely over the top and have relatively thick bands, which can be hard to bend or apply (especially if you are new to lashes). However, the more natural looking lashes have bands that are reasonably easy to apply, and with a little practice I was able to get them on and have them looking amazing! They do come with a little bit of adhesive on them, but it isn&#x27;t enough to actually wear them, so all you need is a little extra lash glue and they stick perfectly fine. Although I haven&#x27;t had the chance to wear every style out and about yet, the ones I&#x27;ve tried look really cute on. I would definitely consider buying these again (not that I&#x27;ll run out any time soon!)</li>
            <li> I alway enjoy using each set of lashes for photo shoots and weddings. What a great buy and I&#x27;m sure you will enjoy.</li>
            <li> This bundle of 70 pair of lashes its the greatest deal i ever came across. I love it and  i use them everyday. These lashes are great for its price.</li>
            <li> just. no. These made me look drag-queenesque. I like the glam look but these were just too much.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product. I am a professional makeup artist and need my falsies to easily adhere to my client&#x27;s lashes and stay put. They have a thick sticky strip which makes it hard to glue to the lashes and they don&#x27;t seem to curve with the shape of eyes.</li>
            <li> my wife love this will be buying more soon she loved the various styles and length great deal for the product.</li>
            <li> Great variety. I love this for clients. I let them choose their own lashes before I apply and they are definitely wowed when I take them out for them to see.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist and always need lots of lashes. This has saved me so much money. They look like the other expensive brands too!</li>
            <li> I loved the variety with the exception of 2 out of 7 I didn&#x27;t like because one set was extremely thin and then one was cross weaved and extremely hard. I definitely will have my husband purchase them again I have gotten alot of compliments when I go out to bars/clubs.</li>
            <li> Obviously not the best quality, but still really great lashes for a fabulous price! Have purchased twice and would again.</li>
            <li> My girlfriends and I love to wear eyelashes when we go out and I was tired of paying 4.00 per set so I bought this box. They are cheaper but if you roll them in your fingers for awhile they are a little more flexible. Can&#x27;t beat the price. I have had four other friends buy this same box after using mine.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes do come in a bundle. I love the fact that I have a choice from multiple eyelashes. However, they are a bit difficult to place on the eye because the eyelash is really thin. Other than that I love the box of lashes!</li>
            <li> I like that it is a bundle of them, but the lashes feel and look a little cheap. Something I&#x27;m not use to...this is my first time buying lashes with them. I usually go to a drug store or Sally&#x27;s, but I like I said I loved the bundle idea. They work fine..just a different material.</li>
            <li> I have had fake eyelashes placed on me by others but wanted to learn how to do it myself.  After watching several youtube videos I felt pretty confident. Unfortunately these were too hard for me to use.  Perhaps it&#x27;s my eye shape but none of these worked. Most of them were very dramatic/thick - not the look I was really going for. They were hard to apply. I ended up getting Ardell and was much happier. Of course those are more expensive :)</li>
            <li> I really dont care for these lashes. It looks as if they are made of plastic and arent really easy to apply due to the stiffness of them. I even gave them away and i got the same feed back. Sorry but these lashes are a waste.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase these lashes because they look FULL. However, I find that they are really matted together and does not have a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thinner ones are ok but the more dramatic ones aren&#x27;t so nice.</li>
            <li> They obviously aren&#x27;t the best quality, I suggest only buying them if you&#x27;re practicing to put eyelashes on. There are some I&#x27;d wear daily but most of them are very unnatural looking.</li>
            <li> These are very good quality , please remember as with ALL  falso lashes, youre life will be easier if you let the glue get tacky first before applying it! Duh!  They are very clean , not plasticy and shiney like cheap ones these are actually good qualoty and im grateful that i got 70 pairs of unique good quality  lashes. I will buy them again soon as i use up all these .</li>
            <li> These lashes are GREAT for costume/ stage makeup! Not so great for the occasional evening out &amp; worst for day to day. They are a little hard to work with, the strip is very heavy(dark).</li>
            <li> Can not go wrong at this price...</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist and purchased these for brides and models.  I was excited because the set included multiples of the various styles.  I&#x27;ve used two pairs without mishaps but yesterday tried to take a pair off for a bride and about half of the strip came off and the rest stuck to the plastic backing. I shrugged it off but it happened again to the second pair I tried. This shouldn&#x27;t happen! After seeing so many good reviews I was surprised to have this problem. I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s just a few that aren&#x27;t good and not the rest of the box. Time will tell.</li>
            <li> They were nice, looks real, but feels fake, of course. Good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Poor quality eye lashes. Hard to bend. I&#x27;m very disappointed with this buy. Would not recommend this product to any one.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this very large set. It&#x27;s very affordable. It lasted me a long time. It is very luxurious, Much comfort. I bought them like a year ago and I think they lasted me maybe six months.</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping, I was surprised! I love the variety and the price. This is definitely worth the buy. Will be purchasing again once I can manage to get through all these lashes :-) Thank you!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&amp;#34;ll ever need to buy lashes again after getting this kit. These will retain the shape after you remove them really well, I&amp;#34;ve been using my first pair about 5 times now and they still could be used again. These are made of plastic, but you really can&#x27;t tell. I think they hold their shape better than real hair eyelashes and would recommend these to anyone</li>
            <li> This eyelashes looks nice I bought them for my girlfriend and she was so exited when she got them but she said it is to hard for her to apply them because they are to straight and hard to bend $15 dollars to the trash I try to save her money with this gift now I feel like dumb buying this crap</li>
            <li> nice my daughter love the choices</li>
            <li> After getting tired of looking for the perfect mascara I decided to give these a go... And am I ever glad I did! They look great on and after a bit of adjusting them they disappear/blend right into my lashes. On a side note here, this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried these sort of lashes and I was thrilled they were so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Amazing deal- I love this brand . Only brand I will buy now . Thank you, I  love my eyes. I like the assorted eyelashes to. Then its always fun . My eyes look awesome !!!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get these lashes because I&#x27;m now getting into falsies and it was really a great deal for the money.  I could tell from the moment I opened the box that the two fuller types of lashes would look ridiculous, and on trying them they were just too long and full! I tried one and I really looked like a drag queen (minus the manly features lol).  The rest of the lashes are great, I&#x27;ll definitely use them all. I&#x27;ll probably trim the thicker ones and just use them as end pieces to fill out my lashes for a more dramatic look.  I don&#x27;t regret the purchase, who knows maybe I&#x27;ll use the fuller ones for Halloween or something.  A reasonable deal, with mostly usable lashes. I would recommend, just know what you&#x27;re getting may not fully be usable.</li>
            <li> Great quality faux eyelashes.  This is my 2nd time purchasing. I&#x27;m a makeup artist and usually use this for runway, Fashion shoots, and gratis makeup gigs. There is a variety of styles but mostly bold looks. They are easy to apply and stay on for a long period of time. Great value.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pretend like you&#x27;ve never been out with your homegirls dancing the night away and then realize you&#x27;re missing a falsie.  If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;re gonna ditch your lashes at some point during a drunken evening. 70 pairs makes it easy to rip off, toss, reapply eyeliner and then touch up my mascara if I still want to party the rest of the night! These are GREAT with several different styles! Great for guests that may need a little help with they &amp;#34;swag&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I was so happily surprised with this box!!  There were many different styles for any occasion, and this is a GREAT value!</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are excellent ! 4 the price ! I would definitely buy them again:) I was really happy with the shipping  .. the only reason I am giving a 4 Star &amp; not 5 is because I reallly wish they were more human hair like instead of being plastic but for the price there really good :)</li>
            <li> Very plastic and rigid! I tried over and over to find at least a couple of styles that would work and they basically were a waste of money and time. I wound up scrapping the entire box! For the theatre, or a dance recital they are probably great.... But for real life? No thanks</li>
            <li> so many for the price!  usually i spend 4.99 for just one set,  good quality and really neat &amp; different styles,</li>
            <li> Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It was way too long&lt;br /&gt;Clear tacky glue did not blend into my skin color and was very noticeable&lt;br /&gt;There was very few variety, many of them looked the same&lt;br /&gt;Uncomfortable&lt;br /&gt;Not reusable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;It was cheap&lt;br /&gt;Did the job</li>
            <li> My order arrived quickly and the quality of the the product was excellent! It was very cost effective purchasing the product, being as though 1 pack of lashes usually run anywhere from 3 to $4 a pack. I&#x27;m set for a very long time 😉</li>
            <li> Terrible quality. you glue them on, and they pop right off unless you HOLD them in place for the entire time it takes for the glue to dry.  And then, they still might pop off.  they are made of some sort of plastic material, not even Hair!  Not happy with these.</li>
            <li> These work for my daughter&#x27;s dance team. It&#x27;s an economical way to assure they all have the same style. It is more difficult to save them for more than one performance since they don&#x27;t have cases but the girls figured out how. They get 2-3 performances out of each set.</li>
            <li> I need to purchase this again. Amazing. Great for stage makeup and drag.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!! for the price you cannot beat it! I bought these because I have a lot of wedding festivities and wanted to share with all my bridesmaids. They all loved playing with the different lashes... some were more adventurous than others, but there were lashes for everyone! I will buy these again!</li>
            <li> Love this bundle! I&#x27;ve bought from this seller several times and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed; product is made well, can be used multiple times, they look great. I wish you had the option of buying a bundle with your fave styles because I don&#x27;t really like the ultra full ones so I always have those left over. It would be great if this seller would let you custom build your bundle. I would pay extra for this feature.</li>
            <li> My daughter said she liked only a certain kind so I started using them, loved it, then she took them away. I need some more.</li>
            <li> Amazing deal!!! As described! :)</li>
            <li> Yes they&#x27;re cheap, but I&#x27;m a dancer and the girls and I go through tons of lashes and the price is great and these look great on stage. They also hold up well when performing</li>
            <li> This was pretty great.  For the Price i loved these. Granted they are not the best quaily if you are  a professional makeup artist and like the human hair ones but they are very good other wise.</li>
            <li> I love them because i have many options and they are good quality i can get wear them 2 or 3 times before they come apart! And I don&#x27;t hesitate to put them on clients because they are amazing and a better price then buying them at sally&#x27;s! Buy them&lt;br /&gt;right Meow!</li>
            <li> I ordered these with hesitance based on some of the reviews; however what I have found is they are exactly as described. They look and feel real. Just like the super expensive ones you get every where else. They are reusable and I feel definitely worth the cost. I don&#x27;t need them to be fancy. One think I do wish is that I could pick the ones I want. There are 2 or 3 out of the 7 strips that I may not use at all. Way too dramatic for me. Not sure what I will do with those. The other strips within themselves though are worth the comparable price they cost. I don&#x27;t need to cut them so I don&#x27;t have that to contend with. I have gotten pretty good with detecting which side is suppose to be or looks better at being the outer lash as opposed to the inner lash. That&#x27;s not readily apparent on the lashes. Overall, I&#x27;d say go for it. If you are one of those ladies who needs perfection and just LOVE the feel of the &amp;#34;human hair&amp;#34; lashes, then maybe not for you... but otherwise a great buy. Oh, and I like that the come in a that box and the strips are easy to get them off.</li>
            <li> Love the varity of styles even for synthetic lashes. I wish bundle monster had human hair for the same price. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Total junk..don&#x27;t waste your money..lashes look like they would be good on a puppet..poor quality.popped off my eyes and we&#x27;re causing stress and embarrassment at work..totally horrible</li>
            <li> I love these lashes. I make soft sculpted dolls and these lashes are inexpensive and beautiful.  I also use the on some stuffed giraffes and they really put the icing on the cake. Love them!</li>
            <li> The product came as expected, I like it but it is definitely not for all types of eyes.. The lashes run bug especially the thick full ones, you can start looking like a drag queen ... I am asian so I am not able to use this product to its full potential but I have done so with other friends who have big round eyes</li>
            <li> amazing value ---- great for photoshoots or adding flair to your look  glue sold separately</li>
            <li> I brought this product for my daughter and she just love the variety of lashes.  Yes we will be purchasing this product again!</li>
            <li> i really like the selection of the lashes.  they are also very real looking and blend in good with my lashes.</li>
            <li> This seemed too good to be true. I would say that half of the collection is too thick to use for realistic non-trashy make-up. I wish that I could have had that option when buying, but it is hard to see the thickness on the photographs. For those of you that like to use very thick heavy eyelashes, this product is perfect for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I had the issue with the glue or if it was the eyelashes. When I used these eyelashes with a glue I bought on here my eyes started to burn like crazy, so I took off the eyelashes and glue. I&#x27;m waiting on a new glue to see if I have the same problem again.</li>
            <li> The lash band is so hard ! To dramatic for me . If you&#x27;re the type of person that likes dramatic lashes and don&#x27;t mind cheap feeling of the lashes . These are for u.</li>
            <li> These lashes where so hard to remove from the plastic case. The glue was so thick you have to peel it off.. Very disappointed I ordered 2 boxes, I will be giving them away to whom ever will take them. There plastic by the way so they don&#x27;t look real at all not even close.</li>
            <li> great value for costumes or runway but they arent real hair</li>
            <li> Good value for the kind of lashes you get. And the variety is great! You can change up your look easily with these.</li>
            <li> the material is very plastic like and the lashes are cheap. uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time - may be good for a photoshoot but not for a long day of wear.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money they don&#x27;t stay on at all. HATED THEM. Do not buy them very cheaply made. &#x3D;S</li>
            <li> i like all the choices and they all fit perfectly right out of the box, no need for trimming. i am able to wear them a few times too.</li>
            <li> These came really fast, and I absolutely love them. Such great quality and variety, for an awesome price. I highly recommend these lashes to anyone.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lash pack and it is most used and favorite amazon.com purchase in a long time. I wear false lashes a lot and the quantity is part of what I love. I also like the variety of styles and the price is amazing! I would recommend this to anyone looking to buy lashes.</li>
            <li> I thought these were ok until I actually wore the first pair. I applied them with Duo lash adhesive. There is a THICK band of glue already on them which stuck to my natural lashes. I carefully tried to peel them off at the end of the night and they were stuck! I pulled and pulled as gently as I could and ended up ripping out a few of my own lashes in the process. I&#x27;m a makeup artist and I bought these to use on my clients....that won&#x27;t be happening! Don&#x27;t buy these, there are plenty of other websites that sell better lashes for cheap.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes they&#x27;re synthetic but they look so natural even when applied. This was a great buy I was pleased and they arrived on the exact date they were estimated to arrive on. This beats paying $2-$5 just for one set because I&#x27;ve seen lashes just like the ones in this bundle at the beauty supply shop that I work.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a great deal and the lashes are of a decent quality. They are not the greatest but will look good when going out, which is what I wanted them for in the first place. There is some glue to hold the lashes in the packaging, but it is not an excessive amount. It&#x27;s a good buy and I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> It was like Christmas in a box! The lashes are great and the price is unbelievable. I am going to order another box just for back up. If they are too long for your eyes, simply cut them.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t bend easy and the lashes almost look plastic. Also there&#x27;s only like 2-3 styles  of the lashes I would even use. I really don&#x27;t care for them. I&#x27;m a makeup artist and I would only use some of them for photoshoots but never NEVER for a wedding.</li>
            <li> Price was awesome, and the product was good.Lashes usually cost $3-$5 for a set. Many different kinds in the box.Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with how quickly the package arrived. I haven&#x27;t yet tried to apply them. I have never worn false eyelashes so I bought these to practice with. I did notice that they seem wider, from side to side than the eyelashes one can buy at the store (such as Ardell). I guess I will have to cut a bit from the end. Some of them are EXTREMELY thick, almost like costume eyelashes but all in all you really can&#x27;t go wrong for the price. I gave the product three stars because I will have to cut them, otherwise it would have been four.</li>
            <li> I wasnt sure of what to expect when this item arrived. I got to my location overseas within 5 days of purchasing it which is great. There was 7 sheets containing 10 sets of eye lashes. Some where very long and thick and other where natural and a bit spaced out. They were all very lovely and I can not wait to wear them. They also had cross crossed lashes in the pack as well. I would recommend this product to a friend!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> i got this product on time. i have not used them yet so i can not say anything about that.</li>
            <li> Crappy quality, spend the extra money and get better lashes.</li>
            <li> You get a variety of different lashes which is nice. When I first opened the box, I saw the more natural ones vs the more dramatic ones and I was thinking to myself I would probably never wear the more dramatic ones they just look much too fake. I&#x27;ve worn all of the different styles of lashes, and to my surprise the thicker lashes look a lot better. Although I love these lashes, I will explain why i only gave them a 3 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very picky about my lashes, I will explain to you my version of the perfect lashes. I like falsies that do not have a huge gap separation between each lash, because although my real lashes are fairly long they aren&#x27;t that full. I also like the lashes to have the invisible lash line ( the part that you put glue on) Because typically when I use false lashes, I ease up on the eye liner, and its very annoying to have that random black strip visibly making my thin eye liner so choppy looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the reason why they get a 3 star rating from me is because the more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking lashes, each individual lash is so thick and long and there&#x27;s a huge gap that separates each lash from the other, which doesn&#x27;t even make the lashes look natural. And the actually lash strip is just so thick that you can see the lash strip on your eyes so I almost never wear any of the more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why the thicker ones are better is because its fuller, and with the thick lash strip it blends in a little more because the lashes are thicker. So out of the whole box I only use the fuller ones. This is my first time buying this brand, I thought it was a good price for what you get, but if you&#x27;re expecting good quality lashes I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this. If you don&#x27;t mind it looking really un-natural then its a good bargain for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;here&#x27;s a tip for anyone who wears these lashes and doesn&#x27;t like the shiny black lash strip, I just take some really matte black eye shadow with an angled liner brush and add a little bit of eye drops to make it a little tacky and lightly dab it over the strip. Viola! no more shiny lash strip.</li>
            <li> Great lashes!! I get alot of compliments on them. The different styles are what I was looking for. Great price too!</li>
            <li> This is a great buy due to getting a great price on so many lashes as well as getting so many types and styles of lashes..... You can not go wrong with this purchase..... if you are a make up artist or just a lash wearer...... Great price for top quality lashes.... LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> Good eye lashes for the price. Some are a bit to dramatic for me but that&#x27;s okay. They are really good for the price. The only thing that bugs me is that it has a black band instead of clear.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat having 70+ pairs of falsies.  When used right, you can get multiple uses out of any one pair, and they&#x27;re not horrible quality.  Some of the thicker lashes can be a little bit stiffer so you&#x27;ll have to press them to your eyes until the glue is completely dry, but otherwise great.  As with any pair of falsies, you should trim the edges so that they fit your eyes (as they&#x27;re made long on purpose).</li>
            <li> Many different styles of lashes. Only complaint is that they are a bit on the cheap end, but can only be expected from the cost of the item.</li>
            <li> Love love love the choices of lashes. The price is right! They look great and stay on great with a little weave glue!</li>
            <li> Cant beat them for the price! Highly recommend. you receive a style for every occasion. They are easy to apply and work with.</li>
            <li> I thought if I bought bulk, I would wear lashes everyday. The wefts or whatever..are too, too thick. There is too much adhesive on the lashes for them to stick to the molding in their packaging. Many styles, but I will stick with what I know next time. Great for mass projects like theater makeup jobs or a dramatic photo shoot for an amateur..but other than that...ew.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes came earlier than expected and bubble wrapped. Everything was intact, and packaged in a cardboard box, with each layer being a different style. I LOVE THESE LASHES! I don&#x27;t know about where others got their lashes, but I have been buying individuals for $2-$5 dollars a pop. These are the same as any big chain eyelashes, and at a FRACTION of the price!! They do need glue, but that&#x27;s a cheap pickup compared to the expenses of the other lashes. WONDERFUL find and a great BUY!! I have used one pair now for 8 days in a row, without any problems. So they are reusable, if you take care of them and are gentle. :)</li>
            <li> Bought the lashes for meself and daughters (2). Variey in the box. Give as a gift, Truly enjoying. Fantastic quality!  Worth the price compared to a pair in retail stores 3.99 maybe more. Great fashion investment.</li>
            <li> Ok. to start of I used to neverrrr wear falsies, just was always impatient to learn and at 4 bucks a pop i would never want to spend the money. I bought these lashes to try em out and learned to use them and grew to LOVE them. Now I could never see myself going a night without falsies. These are the best you can get for the price you pay . I literally bought the box in november and it lasted me until mid april. now thats a pretty long time. Granted I didnt wear them everyday. but I did wear them ALOT. Also I found that if you cut the thicker lashes in half they and trim them a little, they make great \\&quot;winged\\&quot; lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definetly 4 out of 5!  Happy Shopping :)</li>
            <li> I kind of like that these are plastic, they last longer. The natural ones look very natural, and im able to reuse them without them being ruined. They have a nice gloss to them. I do wish that we could pick the styles that are in the bundle though, but ill find use for the very fake looking ones. Well worth the price, you cant beat it with a stick!</li>
            <li> As written before, they dont bend easy.. but they DO bend. The plus on this is that they dont rip apart like to store bought brands and you can re-use them several times. Even if they are too long, thats where scissors come in handy. I bought 70 for 15.00.... at the store I buy five pairs for ten bucks! Ill never buy them from the store again.</li>
            <li> The lashes are too stiff and they are hard to work with. They have this band along the lashes that doesn&#x27;t look that nice. You have to hide it with a really black eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;But i would buy the again though, cause the price its really really good and the designs are great. And they don&#x27;t look that bad on.</li>
            <li> They look super fake lol but I look cute in them so I can&#x27;t complain lol</li>
            <li> Live by these... On my 3rd box. Love the variety and quality. Easy to bend which means easy to apply and they stay on great.</li>
            <li> Lashes look good in the box but their poor quality makes them look as fake as it gets.  The lash line is too thick and therefore makes it very difficult for the lash to stick to your own eyelash line / eyelid.  I was tempted by the price and gave it a try but is definitely not worth it.  Better luck next time!</li>
            <li> I have a Youtube Channel ([...]) in which I review this and many other products! I love this product! I&#x27;d suggest to purchase the product. It is a great value! [...]</li>
            <li> for 70 lashes at this great price I believe I did good! yes they arent the best quality in fake lashes but they still look fab! I love them! definetly would by again!</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find these, I have a Galla ball i need to put about 50 eyelashes on clients for... The worest thing ever...My happeness went away very quickly.. in the box look AMAZING trying to put on not so much. I am fashion stylist/beauty school owner. I put fake lashes on each day. I couldnt get these thing to bend at all. Lashes must shape the eye.. please save your money.. to the makers keep working on it.</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the best items I&#x27;ve bought off Amazon ever!!! When I recieved my package, I couldnt believe the quality of the lashes. Its not everyday you get Quality with Quanity! Its really 70 pair of lashes contained in this box with seven different styles. I am a huge fan of false lashes. So when I saw this deal I had to have it. I&#x27;m guessing it will take me close to year to use all of them. I can get a 1 to 2 week wear off of one pair. They arent flimsy or cheap. The actual lash strip contains no gaps or shedding hairs. I think I&#x27;m going to buy another box before this product is no longer availiable!</li>
            <li> These have to be the worst eyelashes ever. They use sticky adhesive to affix them to the packaging and you can not get them off of the packaging without ruining them. If you do manage to get them off of the packaging they come in, you wont be able to use them because they will be so misshapen that they dont allign with the curve of your eyelid. This is a Bundle Monster FAIL. I have other products from them that are fantastic. These are so bad it makes me never want to purchase from them again. I dont know how they got so many great reviews!</li>
            <li> If you wear false lashes somewhat regularly, then this is a total steal for the quantity of lashes you get for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of these lashes are good quality and can be used several times if removed and cleaned properly. I will say that I don&#x27;t wear the thinner sets of lashes, but I can see how they may fall apart - they are extremely thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear these almost every day and receive compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> received these lashes in less than 2 days of ordering, they are in a nice package like the picture. each 7 sets can be used for different occasions. some for parties, and some for a regular day wear. can&#x27;t wait to try them on. highly recommend. :]</li>
            <li> I just received these yesterday. I wear lashes almost daily because I broadcast from a webcam as part of my job. They don&#x27;t need to be amazing quality to look fine on camera. So, I know how to apply lashes and have tried a lot of different kinds. These lashes are glued to the plastic with a very tacky, sticky substance that is impossible to remove. This makes it hard for the eyelash adhesive to work because it&#x27;s not being applied to a completely dry lash strip. ALSO- who the heck knows what&#x27;s in the packaging glue?! It could contain any number of harsh chemicals and the last place I want to put hazardous substances is right next to my eyeball! I&#x27;ve previously purchased a 50pack of assorted lashes and could only use 4 of the 5 styles. They too were covered in glue, but at least it was dry and could be picked off. Still not sure if I plan on returning these. Lashes at the store are really expensive and it would probably be cheaper for me to just reorder what I got before. A lot of reviews didn&#x27;t mention a glue issue, so maybe the stuff dries out eventually and is easier to remove.</li>
            <li> The set was nice. Of course who could turn down 70 LASHES FOR AN AWESOME PRICE LIKE THAT?! I would probably like to emphasize the FULLNESS of these lashes though. They definitely aren&#x27;t made of real hair, and up close you can definitely tell the lashes are synthetic. So I definitely wouldn&#x27;t use these lashes on a daily basis. They&#x27;re fun during special occasions of course since they look awesome in pictures. I would suggest the person wearing them also trim them down a great deal since they&#x27;re rather wide.</li>
            <li> this material could be hard, but i keep each lash on 1-3 weeks. you&#x27;ll start knowing how to take care of it, make sure you only put glue on the lines because if it drys up where the lashes start it will dry up and could fall easy because the material is hard. the best style that stay on the longest is the natural looking one. these are so worth it because the price and you can wear it more than once, in stores, one will be $3-$10, depending which one you like and material but they last about the same as these. they are hard material, so make sure when you curl them, hold it longer and use mascara to hold it. you&#x27;ll probably have to do this a few times til it stays, but its worth it, because you dont want to look like you have lazy eyes... : )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist and have been buying lashes separately for years. I found this great deal and was willing to give them a shot. Well, surprisingly enough, they are the best lashes I&#x27;ve used yet! Easy to cut and apply, long lasting, they hold their shape well, and the variety in the package makes for fabulous versatility!</li>
            <li> At stores you pay at least 4 bucks per pair if you are lucky, the amount you get for these and not to mention the variety, really makes me happy. This will last me a loooooong time. I love it. Not tacky or too heavy either.</li>
            <li> I am a newcomer to false lashes and I absolutely love this set.  You can&#x27;t beat it for the price. They make you feel very pretty, like your in one of those mascara commercials and actually have the effect they advertise. For the person who stated in another review that they look fake and plasticy, firstly, lashes like this don&#x27;t exist in reality...period. Of course it is going to look like you are wearing makeup. There are 2 hair type styles included that are very bold, but they have that hair type feathery feel to them. Secondly, I have worn each type and have not looked like a stripper or tranny as you put it. It is worth the money to try them out.  Worse case scenario you give them to a friend if you don&#x27;t like them and only spent $ 15. In fact I already bought another set to give as a Christmas gift for a friend.</li>
            <li> Love them second time I&#x27;ve order a set like these</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of false eyelashes and I wear different ones based on the occasion so I am very happy with this assortment. It is a lot for the price too. I am very happy with this purchase. They wear well and I get a lot of compliments on them. I was a little aprehensive because it was a cheap price, but the product exceeded my expectataions. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Wow I Really Like Them I Have A Choice Of Which Eyelashes I Want To To Put On My Client, OR On Myself</li>
            <li> Awesome lashes for the price.  Will definitely be ordering again, not for a while since I have so many now :)</li>
            <li> Feel real and looks like it too. I had complements on them and it made my skimpy looking lashes look great. the only problem is I use the wrong glue. Fast shipping and delivery.</li>
            <li> 1. It&#x27;s the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;2. How can you beat 5 bucks for so many lashes, I give them to my friends before we go out.</li>
            <li> So after reading other reviews I was a but sceptical but purchased anyway. Well, I was right! For the money this was an awesome purchase. I had been buying in the store as the lashes went on sale and they rarely last more than 2 uses. These do at least that much and I don&#x27;t know how much more than 2 applications because I have so many to try now! Yep that was a good buy!</li>
            <li> I must say that when I ordered this I thought I was going to receive something cheap and useless !, however I was amazed on how great  the lashes are ! I&#x27;ve been using fake lashes for years and always buy the expensive realistic ones but these babies are just as good hehe . And not to brag on how fast the arrived ! 3 days on regular shipping ! I&#x27;m ordering again:)</li>
            <li> The lashes are a little hard to work with, and feel heavy, but once they are on they look amazing, and it&#x27;s a great deal for the price, all of the different styles are really nice!</li>
            <li> Eyelashes are beautiful ! Kind of too long for my eyelids ( not the lash length) but the width of my eyelids . Maybe I have small eyes idk lol but these are still pretty good I guess I could trim them or pray no one is all up on my eyeball wonder why my eyelashes go way past my skin of the corner of my eye.</li>
            <li> There are soooo many choices and they look like professional quality. This will last me a while, definitely worth getting if you don&#x27;t want to continue purchasing lashes all the time.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this last week and I admit, I was a little scared since reading the other reviews about how the lashes were stuck to the tray.  I have had no problems SO FAR, I pulled a pair of lashes off of each tray and it came off pretty easy.  TO me,  they are adhered no different than lashes in the beauty store.  I&#x27;i ve only worn one pair of these lashes and I&#x27;ve reused them about 4 times, I&#x27;ve never been able to do that.  To me, buying this was an investment!  I&#x27;m so happy that I did, I think I will order another box soon.  These lashes are pretty good quality they hold up well for me.</li>
            <li> I knew I was recieving 70 pairs, but you dont realize exactly how many that is until you open the box! :-)  I really like the diversity of styles and lengths.  Wishing that it came with adhesive though.  They are very cute, but are pretty stiff and must be broken down before applying otherwise you will find the edges coming up.  All in all, I am pleased!</li>
            <li> This is a lot for a cheap price. Of course, it&#x27;s not the best quality but I like using a pair once or even twice and then throwing them away.</li>
            <li> I love them, such a great deal. Such a great variety if you have many clients that may desire lashes to complete the look.</li>
            <li> great lashes. Comes in 7 different stylish designs. Great for everyday use. Nice price. Nice if your just starting out to use lashes and need some to practice with.</li>
            <li> Lashes are very SOFT wasn&#x27;t expecting that from synthetic fibers.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m used to wearing human hair lashes there&#x27;s a slight difference. Human looks better.&lt;br /&gt;Band is VERY thick and stiff. nice variety of styles though &#x3D;) plus it was A GREAT DEAL!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again. they&#x27;re managable</li>
            <li> not the best selection of lashes they are not pretty stlyes. i have resumed buying them from sally&#x27;s they have the best these suck</li>
            <li> I love tthem and u can&#x27;t beat the price, they are more then i could hope for. it u like lashes u will love the Bundle Monster 70</li>
            <li> WOW! Alll these lashes..... I will have so much fun playing with alll the looks. I payed much more for much less product previously. Im glad I brought these...</li>
            <li> I was excited about these lashes when I received them. When I read the other reviews, quite a few people said they were great lashes for the price. I am an avid lash wearer. I love lashes that look great and are relatively inexpensive. When I applied the smaller, more natural lash, I thought they were ok. I had to cut them down quite a bit to fit my eye. When I bent the band to better fit my eye it didn&#x27;t stay and the shape i was trying to bend the lash. This is extremely important when applying lashes because you want to prevent the lash from lifting. The actual lash itself looked ok but didn&#x27;t give my eyes that flirty pretty look I usually get from other lashes. I would not purchase these again. This product proves true, you get what you pay for. Folks..i wouldn&#x27;t waste my time with these. Ardell lashes or the Salon Perfect lashes are your best bet.</li>
            <li> This is girly heaven in a box that is not expensive. Tons of eyelashes that will last you forever!! I would deff recommend and repurchase my self.</li>
            <li> i bought this product for my wife and she loves it. she thought the lashes were all the same then bing! theres more and different lashs. so if she&#x27;s happy i&#x27;m happy. great for people that want to try a new look every once in a while. mahalo nui!</li>
            <li> Great Price, Great Timing, Great Product; Will I order more in the future?, More than likely, Yes, P.S. my lashes came within two days of my purchase!</li>
            <li> so i got these eyelashes last week and let me just say that i am absolutly in love with this product!! it came with 70 pairs of lashes for about 16 dollars.. that is a great buy!! they do feel fake but when you put them on they look gorgeous!! (i dought anyone will go up to you and touch your lashes anyway!) now i wear lashes about 4 times a week and i think i will have these for a very long time! but when i run out i will repurchase for sure!! i strongly recomend this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;: Happy Customer</li>
            <li> THe lashes are absolutely beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They come very nicely organized and you can find the thinner ones at the top which if worn look totally natural but give an extra little push of elegance and beauty and delicacy!  And the lower heavier eyelashes are more glamourous, some totally extreme but they are all so beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 was because of this glue like thing on the lashes which can be rather uncomfortable. I read another review that said the same thing, but i took the risk and bought it anyway (totally worth it). The plastic-y/glue stuff can be removed with tweezers it just takes a while -_-  I try to look for lashes that are comfortable, but these are so inexpensive, and really made quite beautifully and with such a variety, it was totally worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy them they really are worth it. If you are concerned about discomfort just take the 2 extra minutes to take the glue off your lashes :)</li>
            <li> This item is a great value for the price, and I would definitely buy it again. Seventy pairs of eyelashes for $16--what an awesome deal! Thanks again! ;-)</li>
            <li> I actually really like these eyelash extension. They are great and flexible. I love the different styles for day and night. Thank you they work out perfect.</li>
            <li> My daughter performs in 6 to 7 competitions per year, in addition to a Showcase and Recital. These lashes are perfect for the stage and with 70 pairs, we can use a fresh pair every time. I will buy a box of these every season.</li>
            <li> Very good for the price&lt;br /&gt;Nice colori would recommend to 1 st timers  I don&#x27;t like that they are a bit heavy</li>
            <li> The product was received on time, good condition, great price, but I didn&#x27;t like the product quality...not soft, did not work well. I think is made too thick, it doesn&#x27;t glue like regulars lashes..:(</li>
            <li> Cann&#x27;t believe the variety for the price. Will be ordering again. Thanks. Cann&#x27;t believe they give you day and night versions of eyelashes, will be batting these cognac eyes at the fella very soon.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes are great. They have natural ones to dramatic ones. The thicker one are harder to put on since they have a more thick band also are synthetic hairs. Overall they are good for the price.</li>
            <li> So many eyelashes! Will I ever run out? Good buy if you are into costume or dramatic makeup, and I mean really into it. 70 pairs of eyelashes deep into it. Decent variety, kind of cheap and hard to bend, but hey for the price it&#x27;s worth. Con would be the lack of any glue, then again it didn&#x27;t advertise any so DUO works pretty well. Again, a good investment for costuming or MUA.</li>
            <li> I HAVE RECIEVED BETTER ONS BUT THEY ARE DEFINETLY THE CHEAP KIND IF YOU PULL A LITTLE TO HARD THEY WILL RIPE SO THINK TWICE!</li>
            <li> They are very cute lashes but they are almost like plastic and the edge stabbed your eye and really hurts. Also the plastic is so thick on the edge that they don&#x27;t stay on ...now I have 70 lashes floating around ;/</li>
            <li> These are nice eyelashes, well packed and presented. Only criticism I have is that they bend a little out of shape after you&#x27;ve used them once. So my advice would be to put them back in the tray once you have finished with them if you wish to rewear them</li>
            <li> This bundle of lashes comes as it says. I&#x27;m a freelance makeup artist &amp; do events where I&#x27;m applying lashes in large volumes. Here is what I observed:&lt;br /&gt;They tend to be larger and will need to be trimmed (most lashes need to be trimmed to size anyway) and they are not the quality that you can get at Sally&#x27;s or Walgreens. They don&#x27;t cost as much either. There are several choices in styles which is nice. You get what you pay for. Most of the lashes that I apply are used once and thrown away so, these work best for what I do.</li>
            <li> The best by far .... I would recommend these to many.... Really accents the eyes it make your make up pop .... Great but also</li>
            <li> Great value! I dont have to go to the mall to grab them every month. This will last me for a very long time!</li>
            <li> I think I will purchase this again, they really are reusable. I use all the styles they look very nice..and I get a lot of complements</li>
            <li> Bought some for my daughter and myself and we both love them.  What a great price for the amount of lashes.</li>
            <li> You can tell the lashes are cheap.  They are very shiny and plastic.  I use them for photoshoots and the sheen they set off is horrible.</li>
            <li> These are not the same quality as Ardell (which is a drug store fave of mine), BUT they are okay.  The bands are thick and slightly sticky so they are slightly more difficult to apply.  That being said, they are workable.  I used a lot of these around Halloween, when I knew the client wasn&#x27;t planning on reusing them again.  I typically use Ardell and Red Cherry but I just wanted to try something new.  However, given the price/quantity, I really can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the 50 lash set I few months ago and needed a new set so decided to go with this bundle since I got more for less.  I have to say some of the lashes are really thick and I would only use them at night or if I was going out.  The other lashes though are really nice.  I use them daily.  I also do recommend not buying these if your first time user of lashes because these lashes will probably be difficult to apply.  If you wear lashes everyday like I do or fairly often then these will be great for you.  I love them and it&#x27;s so nice to have so many so I don&#x27;t have to keep buying lashes every week.  Also, I like the fact I can wear each pair more then once.</li>
            <li> These are OK for the price. I used to get my lashes done professionally until my natural lashes started falling out. I wasn&#x27;t ready to give up that look so I bought these to give my lashes a break. The lashes are a little stiff and hard to manipulate but they are manageable. I find that I have to use more glue with these than other brands. Overall, the price is right and you get a ton of OK lashes. I will use this box of lashes up but I probably won&#x27;t buy another box. There&#x27;s better lashes out there and I&#x27;m willing to pay the extra money.</li>
            <li> So excited for this purchase!  This product arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  Very impressed with this seller! Lots of options with these lashes from thick to more length!!</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are great!  they&#x27;re conveniently packaged in a small box &amp; they&#x27;re in different styles.  I use the thiner ones to work because they easily blend in w/ my real eyelashes &amp; i use the more dramatic ones when I go out.  Definitely buying more!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but I just had to for this product. C&#x27;mon...70 pairs for 15 bucks?! Soo worth the price!! I was a little hesitate on purchasing these lashes because I bought some other lashes on amazon that looked similar to these but it had Asian writing on the outside of the package and they were HORRIBLE!! The band was wayy too thick to even get a good curve to stick on to the lash line. I thought these would be the same but I saw so many good reviews here on amazon and YouTube so I said what the heck it&#x27;s just 15 bucks. And I&#x27;m so glad I did! I will def be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> i love this bundle pack, it has a great variety of different sizes and looks. the packaging makes it easy to take care of the lashes for multiple uses.</li>
            <li> for the price i love this product! if you wiggle the lashes around they are a little more movable for gluing and i use duo glue wonderful! and for the plastic looks? a really thin layer of mascara will work and give it a real look</li>
            <li> I bought these lashes because sometimes I want to spice up my makeup but they are too long. I wanted lashes that I could easily wear during the day but these lashes are costume like. I have to cut a few mm off of them before wearing them so that I don&#x27;t look like a clown or drag queen. Other than that they are fine.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a bargain considering the price, but I guess you get what you pay for. These lashes are not easy to manipulate and they show up too thick on the lash line. Won&#x27;t but again.</li>
            <li> This product arrived sooner than expected and in Great condition. The lashes come in 7 different styles which gives you an option for every day...and every night.</li>
            <li> The choices were nice, but some of the lashes ripped because they were glued to the plastic. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I have worn lashes for many years - the quality is fantastic!  A little long for me so I snip some off of each lash.  I don&#x27;t always have to use my own glue - there is a good elastic glue on each lash.  They are a little longer than I normally wear - hits my glasses when I blink... however, they are perfect for nights out.</li>
            <li> Came in very handy with my line of work. Priced very affordable. I have recommended to others and will continue to recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for a lady-friend. She and her clients are quite satisfied. The lashes look good on her and draw attention to her face..</li>
            <li> Love these! So many options! You can use some of the thinner ones for bottom lashes or cut the thicker ones for your bottom lashes too depending on the style you are going for.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE!!!! I purchased them because I wear lashes on a daily basis and was so tired of buying expensive pairs because I hate wearing lashes more than once or twice before I toss them, these were the solution! You have to hold them to shape for a while longer than normal ones. But they are all beautiful styles and long enough to clip to the length that I need them to be! Going to purchase again when I run low.</li>
            <li> Ok so these are the best eyelashes on the market! I purchased these over a year ago and I am still using the same box! I wear fake eyelashes almost 7 days a week and I can honestly re-use one pair over ten times as long as you be careful when taking them off or peeling off old glue! The more you use one pair the easier they are to re-apply because they mold to your eye. I can now put my lashes on in less then 5 minutes. And if you&#x27;ve ever used false eye lashes before you know that is EXTREMELY fast. TIP: The best glue out there is Lash Grip Eyelash Adhesive. Purchase the CLEAR, it applies white but always dries clear. You don&#x27;t need a lot of glue btw and always focus on the inner corner first (keep a q-tip handy for eye watering) because once water touches the glue your screwed. When finished apply mascara to blend your real eyelshes with the false lashes. Oh And before putting on fake eyelashes always apply black eyeliner that way they appear much more realistic. One other great perk is you have such a wide variety of lashes to choose from, so you can have a natural everyday look or a very dramatic look for a night on the town.  Hope this review helps some of you :)</li>
            <li> Ok.. I am new at wearing lashes and after watching youtubers on how to put on falsies, I decided to try it by buying ardell lashes from the drug store for practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they were $4.99 a pack and for practice so I decided to get these... I loveeeeee them.  I have mastered the art after practicing consistently for a week and these are awesome.  The thin ones look au natural.  For dramatic days, I use dramatic ones.  The box should last me about 4-5 months since you can re-use an eyelash about for times.  Try it guys because its worth the money.</li>
            <li> I just love this product these lashes are my #1 go to in my beauty case even before I apply  my make up!! Wow I can wear one set for a very long time before I even think about switching to another pair. I highly recommend this product you will love it, I just love the wide band on the lash line and the natural look that it gives and how it bring out the beauty in your eyes!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the eyelashes!  They go from a more natural look to glamorous!  I love them! Would recommend to anyone who love to wear false lashes!</li>
            <li> Love them and people can&#x27;t even tell if they are real or fake</li>
            <li> Gave these as a Christmas gift to my sister and she absolutely LOVES them and has worn them all year. They definitely work better for those that are used to putting on falsies. They take a little maneuvering (trimming, bending) to get them really looking good. Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> These are so perfect in every way.  I am able to wear the thinner ones to work and they look like I have naturally thick and curled lashes without looking like I am wearing false eyelashes.  It makes my eyes appear more awake and more youthful.  I absolutely love them!  I highly recommend if you want the look of false eyelashes without screaming \\&quot;I am wearing false eyelashes...\\&quot;  this is the product to buy.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes arrived within four days. The packaging was not the best but the products were not damaged. They eyelashes are awesome, they are a little less quality than ARDELL false lashes. But they are worth the buck. You get 7 different varieties! They are not the easiest to apply but they do work well. If your not use to applying false eyelashes, this may be a LITTLE troublesome. But I&#x27;m not really good with lashes, but now I feel like Im pro. I&#x27;ve been playing with it all day and trying new looks. These lashes makes your eye make up stand out more. The lashes are a little longer than I thought, which is a plus. The only reason I am giving them a 4 is because the lashes are not \\&quot;great\\&quot; but Good. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> These are awesome, especially for someone who needs to be able to practice putting on lashes.  This is not only a great price but the lashes look so real.</li>
            <li> I recently started wearing false eyelashes on occasion and was shocked at how expensive they are at local retail shops. Considering they last maybe two or three applications, spending an average of $5 per pair seems like a lot of money. On top of that it took me a while to get the hang of it so I went through a few pairs experimenting. Finally, you don&#x27;t know what style will look best on your eyes until you try it. That&#x27;s why I am very happy with this purchase. I now have seven different styles to try and get ten of each style. I compared the quality side by side with my more expensive drug store lashes and I see no difference at all, nor in the feel of the lashes. The only difference would be if you compared them to human hair false lashes instead of synthetic. I only will probably wear four out of the seven styles but still have spent far less than if I bought them individually at $5 a pair!</li>
            <li> I love my lashes and love the variety. Great buy and will purchase more in the future. I beats buying 6 pairs of lashes at CVS for $10 a pack.</li>
            <li> Like why there are several models of artificial еѕеласхес and also the price is pretty solid in terms of what is offered ... I think everyone need to buy, and will certainly be satisfied</li>
            <li> So many lashes so many different looks to achieve. This babis are perfect! I have to say the range from medium to long.</li>
            <li> i just love my eye lashes.i can have a different dramatic eye look every day,they are very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> Diva! Diva! Diva! Now if you are serious about being a Diva this is IT! IF you are a LASH DIVA and you must wear your lashes- the motto is \\&quot;Can&#x27;t Leave Home Without Them!\\&quot;You just have to buy the Bundle Monster- you get 7 different styles,for 7 different days. Now for a true Diva that is 7 different looks.Hey!That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talking about!OH YEAH! And don&#x27;t even get me started on the price-which is Great!</li>
            <li> I have been doing makeup my whole life and recently got into the business. It if very expensive to start out but I was lucky enough to find this pack of lashes which I thought would be to good to be true but I ordered them anyways to try them out and they are AMAZINGGGGGG!! I highly recommend to everyone! I even showed them to my teacher at my makeup school and she ended up ordering a bunch for her school!!!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re of good quality, cheap (price), 70 PAIRS!!!, and always arrive within 4days max! I bought thses around the holidays 26December and recieved them before New years eve! I recommend them everythime I get compliments on my lashes!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s so much variety to choose from.  This bundle is really good for the price.</li>
            <li> band is a bit stiff but they&#x27;re sturdy and reusable.</li>
            <li> I purchased this box of false eyelashes after spending countless dollars on one pair packs. While these lashes are OK-- I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again. The quality is MUCH lower than what I am used to. (And I usually only buy pairs for something like $3-) They are pretty stiff, and lash glue works pretty poorly for some reason with them. I will probably only attempt to wear these for things like Halloween or something of the sorts. They definitely are not for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> A number of reviewers have commented on the thickness of the strip itself (the bit that adheres to your eyelid) and the rigidity of the lashes themselves...and I can understand how the average user would have a problem with this. But if you have no eyelashes at all, these are the way to go, not only for the price, but for the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a person with no eyelashes (trichotillomania) I love the thickness of the strip. First off, the thicker band gives more surface area to attach to your eyelids. Ardell brand lashes have rather thin bands that make them invisible on the normal user, but on someone without a natural lash line to act as secondary support, they have a tendency to start flopping into my eyes by mid-day. The profile of the strip itself is more oblong than circular, further helping with the eyelashes-should-go-up look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These lashes aren&#x27;t made from natural hair, which in my case, is awesome because you don&#x27;t get the same humidity and fragility problems that you would otherwise have with a natural lash product. This also makes them easier to clean and reuse if you put mascara on, or get any other product on them. They keep their curl and shape all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you wear all styles of the lashes for normal days? Probably not, unless you specialize in eyelash-based flight, but even if you can only wear 4-5 styles, it&#x27;s infinitely cheaper than buying retail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last thing - the best lash adhesive on the planet has to be this stuff: [[ASIN:B004UD02GK .Eyelash and Eyebrow (Ultimate Hold) Adhesive]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is extremely strong and not affected by humidity, so it&#x27;s awesome for the lash-less. (All other brands, in my experience, melt and become gummy within a few hours - this lasts over 24 hours if you don&#x27;t fuss with your eyes.)</li>
            <li> As far as getting a large amount of lashes go these will last you a while however they are straight up hard plastic. The more the lash is thick the harder it is to make it stay on your lid. Both ends will not stay due to no bending ability. Good price for as many as you get hopefully it will be dark where ever you are so people can&#x27;t see the ends popping up.</li>
            <li> I ordered these lashes on Saturday, 11/10 and received them today! Shipping was very quick considering that I ordered on a Saturday! The box was not damaged though it did seem it bit worn. When I took the lashes out, I simply fell in love! There was really seven different styles, ranging from thin to thick. No repeats. The glue they used to stick the lashes onto the plastic got a little messy and stuck some actual lashes (not just the band) to the plastic but if you&#x27;re very careful, taking them out shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. The bands are not stiff. They&#x27;re actually really flexible. I can understand why some people might think the thicker lashes are a bit dramatic but to me, they&#x27;re perfectly fine for a night out with the friends. Did I mention I&#x27;m new at falsies?! Hopefully, these last a while with careful handling and maintaining. Would definitely order these again!!!</li>
            <li> So, I have yet to wear the thick eyelashes but I love them so far! Come on, 70 pairs of eyelashes for that price is a steal! The thin eyelashes are basically only for one wear because they are so thin but they look natural and great for any day use! :) totally recommend these if you&#x27;re looking to buy some fake eyelashes!</li>
            <li> The false lashes are beautiful and sorry forgot to comment it. Still my sisters loved it and she used it all.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect much given the price, and I was shocked at how great these lashes look.  They are disposable, as trying to remove the glue from the day before tends to jack up the shape of the lash strip, but still a great purchase!  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Even better price. I am amazed at the price of these eyelashes while the product itself is very good. I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> I am revamping my makeup collection and this is just wonderful, cheap, and easy! My clients even love these.Great to buy for your makeup collection/ kit</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Couldn&#x27;t wear them bc they look so unnatural...</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t tried them all but so far I&#x27;m satisfied, going to a party soon so I will get to try a new look!</li>
            <li> I love em I do make up for a living and love eyelashes theses are great I  am very happy with them I woulde buy again</li>
            <li> Fun, Fun, Fun I love to mess with make up and I don&#x27;t have any Eyelashes anymore because I have Lupus and I lost most of my eye lashes so this will be fun!!  :)</li>
            <li> Wow wow wow, all I can say is ahhhhhhhmazing qualiyu, im in love! Ill be buying deveral boxes and sime as gifts</li>
            <li> Took a bit to get here as they had a long way to travel to me here in CO, but great deal for the price. They are certainly not high quality, and you need to be pretty good at eyelashes to apply them. I have a flat eyelid, so they are easy for me to use and wear, but I&#x27;ve found that they are pretty difficult to put on my friends with very round eyes - you want something that can hold a bend for that, which these definitely do not. If you are experienced and can put on cheap lashes easily, these are a very good bargain.</li>
            <li> cheap ! dont stick well</li>
            <li> i love there are several different looks in this affordable kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these lashes are all a bit long for me, and since there seems to be a little extra length at one end of each without lashes above, it seems natural to cut each down anyway. after i cut them down (always from the shorter inside part so i can maximize the length), i will stick them around a medium-sized makeup brush to give them a bit of a bend--otherwise they are very straight and can be hard to put on making both sides stick at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just a few tips for the way they work best for me... the little extra effort is well worth the price!!</li>
            <li> These lashes are quality.  I have ordered other lashes before, not from this seller, and was disappointed.  If you&#x27;re not careful, you&#x27;ll get those cheap, flimsy ones that look like they&#x27;re made out of reinforced sewing thread!  These, however, are great, and I love that there&#x27;s a selection of different lashes ranging from more modest to daring.</li>
            <li> Love these lashes! !! They are long and pretty. Perfect for going out and i even wear the smaller lashes during the week. they have lasted me months and its way cheaper to buy them this way. For the same price you get only 4 pairs at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> These are a great set of lashes and especially for the price! Very light on my clients eyes and very simple to apply.</li>
            <li> These fantastic eyelashes will draw attention to your  eyes making every blink a sweeping sensation. These are high quality and gorgeous!</li>
            <li> I would say these are great for the price. I got them for my airbrush kit so I could have a full look. I like how they have tones of different ones to choose from. One con is the bands are super thick and they look so fake. But they are great for practicing. Once you can master these you can master any. Great for practicing and I love using them on friends!</li>
            <li> Eyelashes are made of very hard plastic. They are really long and need to be cut down on the ends just to fit your eye. The hard plastic makes them hard to work with because they wont bend to follow your natural lash line</li>
            <li> Love this soooo much will be buying it again</li>
            <li> lashes are too hard.  Unable to get them to stick to my eyelid.  there to stiff.</li>
            <li> Although I am not crazy about all of the designs, For what I usually pay for lashes in individual packages, I found its still a GREAT DEAL even if I only use HALF of them</li>
            <li> Since most single drugstore eyelash falsies cost three dollars or more, this monster bundle...the price per eyelash strip is a joke... Same quality as every other eyelash sold everywhere.</li>
            <li> Very happy no complaints</li>
            <li> this is a great deal!  I was so worried that the lashes would be flimsy for this low price but the 1st pair I tried worked perfectly and lasted through a very long night.  I&#x27;ll buy these again, but its going to be a while because I have sooo many :)</li>
            <li> LOVEEE these lashes! I am a licensed cosmetologist/makeup artist. I bought these so my clients can have a variety of looks to choose from. They love them! They are easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Lots of sets but any makeup skilled/expert will find that the track to which the hairs are attached is wayyyyyyy too think. Its uncomfy. Otherwise theyre decent but hardly great.</li>
            <li> These are 50% eye lash, 50% rubber cement, or whatever it is they use to attach these things to they tray.  I ruined several pair trying to get the glue off the lash, which goes halfway down the lashes.  Glad I didn&#x27;t pay much for them, since I definitely won&#x27;t be able to use every pair.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th box...They look great and are an amazing bargain.</li>
            <li> All of these lashes are so DRAMATIC. It looks so unnatural. Perfect for costume parties and if your going for the \\&quot;drag queen\\&quot; look.  I couldn&#x27;t pull it off.  The part where the lashes are attached is way to thick.  The material is plastic or synthetic so it looks extra fake. But like I mentioned. You get what you pay for in these.</li>
            <li> My daughter requested this for Christmas and she&#x27;s still using it.  A lot of lashes with a variety of lengths.  She&#x27;s absolutely adores it</li>
            <li> I suggest buying these! I&#x27;ve had mine for about a year now &amp; I still love them. I&#x27;ll be ordering another box soon since I&#x27;m just now running out. I don&#x27;t wear them often. But if you take good care of the eyelashes you can reuse them a few times.</li>
            <li> I have 2 daughters in competition dance and show choir and we use LOTS of false eyelashes. I will never run out with these endless options that are perfect for the stage. I thought it was quite a find to find a bundle of 70 for this great price. Not only do we have plenty, we can freely loan (give) a pair to a teammate who forgot hers.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughters, they seem to enjoy it</li>
            <li> This bundle is amazing ! As someone who buys fake lashes every other week , because I ultimately lose them this is an amazing deal. My complaints are that the eyelash band is fairly long and thick. However I have found ways to make them work.</li>
            <li> So happy love product</li>
            <li> Although I purchased these lashes from another site, they are great. The styles are varied and you can create more natural looks to dramatic ones. A very versatile set of lashes for the price you pay. I do not wear lashes all the time so these are still lasting after almost a year, but when I do wear them, they look good. If you are hesitating, don&#x27;t. Get this from Amazon.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is that this is a wonderful deal. the eyelashes are great. I have been wearing this pair for about a week or so. so many compliments. its just great overall!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These lashes a great! If not for the mere fact that you can buy two pairs at Walgreens for the same price as 70 pairs! This is a no brainer. They are very nice quality. I trim them down a bit before I apply. There are a few funky looking lashes that I would probably never use but maybe for Halloween. I use lashes for special occasions and these have never let me down.&lt;br /&gt;Basically I&#x27;m set for the next 5-10 years for lashes.</li>
            <li> this is a great deal but most of the lashes are too long for me. i could only wear 30 of them and the rest i gave away. but still  a great deal. shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist and figured this would be a great buy. I didn&#x27;t like them at all. They look very unnatural. I know your thinking they are false eyelashes what do you expect. But I&#x27;ve used other brands that look like it would be your own lashes. Also, they don&#x27;t set easily, they don&#x27;t really bend to fit your eye, and you spend a minute stabbing it on to your eyelash. I&#x27;ll stick to my red cherry lashes from now on.</li>
            <li> These are cheap eyelashes, which are impossible to install due to their inability to bend &amp; be flexible to match an eye contour. This is the waste of time and money. The reason why I give it 1 star is only because this item was delivered on time. For anyone who considers buying this item, I would recommend spend more money,but buy a better quality product that you actually will be able to use.</li>
            <li> some of them are too bulky for me but for the price you get a lot of lashes. ill be buying more when i run out</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get these- all 7 of the styles are ones I could use.  Shipping was fast.  You will need your own glue, but overall for the price this is an absolute steal.</li>
            <li> I needed something to add to my order to get wig caps, so I decided to splurge on lots of lashes. There are many different styles in here, and they are relatively easy to put on and nice to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that they put -a lot- of glue on the lash to attach it to the base. It&#x27;s at least 1 cm long from the edge down the fibers. This made putting them on the first time very hard.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my niece.  She wanted these. She was happy to get them for Christmas. If I was crazy about lashes I&#x27;d probably get them too.</li>
            <li> Love them...easy to apply if you&#x27;re experienced with putting on lashes...also easy to clean and reuse</li>
            <li> The band is too stiff, I don&#x27;t know what to do with it! I think I&#x27;ll just use the ones I like and give the rest away. I ended up buying my usual brands in the store.</li>
            <li> Too many styles to choose from!!  There were two styles I really loved that were dramatic but not too scary.  There were a couple that added just a little more volume, and then there were some that looked like giant, plastic centipedes.  Be careful pulling these off, so you don&#x27;t accidentally rip the glue or the lash itself!! Pretty amazing set for such a cheap price.  was able to reuse a couple.</li>
            <li> I really like the variety of eyelashes that come with this bundle.&lt;br /&gt;Some of them are a bit more fake looking than others...and heavier.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great buy for the price you pay!</li>
            <li> Very plasticky , won&#x27;t stay on, what else is there to say waste of money. There is a reason they were cheep.</li>
            <li> Rarely in my past have I worn false eyelashes, as either they were too gaudy or too difficult to apply correctly. Today, those same reasons could be applicable; except that, these days, conspicuous is an accepted theme. For sure, when \\&quot;putting on my face,\\&quot; I am satisfied with shadow, eyeliner and mascara. Notwithstanding, when a gal seeks to \\&quot;challenge the eye,\\&quot; his, not her own, false eyelashes are an acceptable and desirable means. The Monster Bundle of seventy (70) pairs provides a nearly inexhaustible supply of that piece de resistance of eye makeup; whereas, the cost per pair is insignificant should I ruin a pair or two in learning proper application and care. I do not wear them often; but, when I do, they provide the satisfaction that, aye, \\&quot;the eyes have it!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I was looking for bulk lashes and I thought these would be ok. But even the lashes at the 99 cent store are better quality, 1/2 of them cant be used because the strip is to thick to bend with the curve of the eyes. They pop off because they are so stiff. Won&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> These are a rip off! They are not flexible, wont bend and were falling apart! I get the cheap ones at my local store and they were better! Dont buy! And yes ive been putting on eyelashes for years! Just dont get them.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box I was amazed. I love them. I had had the box for about a year and a half. Pretty good quality for their price. They can be used up to three times depending on how good you take care of them. Looking forward to finishing all of the box &amp; order a new one.</li>
            <li> Love this item! Would recommend to anyone. The variety is good. You can change to different styles at any type of occasion for day and night</li>
            <li> The stack was firmly and carefully placed. The styles were really awesome and it just makes you giddy that you have 70 pairs of it. REALLY WORTH IT FOR THE PRICE AND QUALITY!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Ive ordered this bundle plenty times already.  I love it!  They send it right away and I always get my package in 2 or 3 days.</li>
            <li> The lashes are too damn long and the pasty part of the lashes is to thick. Hard to glue on. Thumbs down.&lt;br /&gt;Should of never buy this. Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes! All of them! No doubt that I would repurchase:) a great price especially with the drug store kind exceeding 4 dollars.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start off by saying \\&quot;Amazing Value\\&quot;! It&#x27;s a great buy hands down 🙌! It&#x27;s perfect for all eyelash enthusiast. It comes with 7 different styles to fit all occasions and all looks. So why 3 stars? Because I am a professional make-up artist and I&#x27;ve used the product on several different clients and I&#x27;ve had to make alterations to every set of lashes used. While it is simple to trim the lash it can be a bit draining to do every time you need to apply. But overall it&#x27;s a great addition to any make-up kit</li>
            <li> these can be used and thrown away after each use but took me a little practice to get use to how stiff they are</li>
            <li> I really love my eyelashes every single pair Thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> Omg I love love love these lashes. They are a great money saver. You will not find these lashes anywhere else for this value. They are gorgeous &amp;&amp; hardly shed. Plus mine came early. Get them while you can!</li>
            <li> SUPER AWESOME buy for the money! Great quality! Can easily reuse! Love and would recommend to anyone!!!</li>
            <li> Good value! Bands are a little flimsy and I prefer Red Cherry or Ardell over these, but I got lots of compliments on these lashes :-)</li>
            <li> Arrived in just 3 days. I absolutely love it so far! There&#x27;s just the one fact that not all lashes are the same size. Even if it&#x27;s the same style, you&#x27;ll notice one side is either slightly longer and fuller but after you apply it, I&#x27;m sure no one really notices, so it still looks great! :)</li>
            <li> Order these all the time. Different variety.. Just break them in!</li>
            <li> I like this product. I don&#x27;t use one style but for the price it doesn&#x27;t matter.  I will order again.  I would never by from drug store again.  These are priced great and wear well.</li>
            <li> Nice lashes just a little long. But still great look just wish was a little shorter but that&#x27;s an easy fix</li>
            <li> If I knew I could purchase 70 pairs of lashes for $15 I would have kicked KISS, CHERRY, and ARDELL to the curb a long time ago! I didnt see any similar enough to my favorite style &amp;#34;Demi Wispies&amp;#34; but Im satisfied with what I purchased!!</li>
            <li> Love the many different styles that are included in the box.  I have worn them all!!!!!  Will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Such a great deal for the price! Will absolutely buy again and recommend it.</li>
            <li> really worth the cost</li>
            <li> Love all of them fast shipping</li>
            <li> These lashes feel like plastic and do not  stay well with any adhesive. I  would not purchase every again.  nor  recommend</li>
            <li> it is very stiff and difficult to use, and difficult to keep on. I know they are fake lashes, but they really, really look fake. it was a disappointing buy.</li>
            <li> Other lashes are too thick</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these!!! So much so that I have ordered more for another one of my daughters! They are working out perfect for them! I think you have a customer for life! Thanks again.</li>
            <li> I loved the style of the lashes. But it was really hard to put on and have it stay on. Not a fan.</li>
            <li> it was great to see lashes at such an affordable price, however it&#x27;d be good if the lash quality was better.</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician student and these lashes are gret to practice eyelash extentions on, play with or just wear out. At first, I was skeptical because they were so straight and I think they were made for more almond or Asian eyes. Im white and I just wrap them around my finger for a minute and they are ready to put on. Ive even sold some to my friends for a few bucks a pair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very good deal for the price&lt;br /&gt;some are so dramatic and so I dunno if I am going to use them</li>
            <li> My daughter has already worn some and is highly satisfied! They really look natural on her and we both highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> I only purchased these so I would have lashes on hand if I ever need them and so far, I don&#x27;t really NEED them. But I think I just need to play around with them a little.&lt;br /&gt;$15 for 70 pairs of lashes? Cant beat that anywhere, so I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li> The lashes I must say are GORGEOUS but the quality is what gave this a 3 star. The bands are thick and take time to soften up to fit for desired eye shapes. I used them on myself and clients that wanted to try these out. Although they take an excessive amount of time to bend and glue on, they look beautiful blended in with your lashes.</li>
            <li> If you are using them for costume , yes. But as part of enhancing your beautiful eyes, don&#x27;t buy them. They look so plastic and the thick band was so hard to glued and won&#x27;t stay in place even I am using a nice brand of glue. Most of them comes in exaggerated length and shape and only 2 comes in natural style and length  but still look so shiny plastic.</li>
            <li> I LOVE!! the monster bundle that are great quality and you have a variety of lashes for all occasions. I would highly recommend this affordable purchase you will have a great time changing your looks for beautiful lashes.&lt;br /&gt;cb of Palo Alto, CA</li>
            <li> Love this bundle deal so many lashes to choose from the only downside was that 3 out of the 7 different styles are exactly the same but i am satisfied none the less great buy!</li>
            <li> Love them. So awesome with so many different styles. Very happy!!</li>
            <li> I received this package two days after I ordered. Its exactly as pictured so look closely before ordering you just have to cut the lashes to adjust to your actual eyelid.</li>
            <li> Good product and Nice selection of different styles of eye lashes for all occasions. Amazing choice for the low price!</li>
            <li> I love these, and the different eyelashes. I can have the girls over and play dress up and have eyelashes to share that are not 15$ a pair!  I will be getting more of these for sure.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat this buy. It makes you realize what a rip off it is to buy like one pair in the drugstore for 5 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;You get a nice variety of lashes, from full, glam types, to the more natural daytime looks. Plus the bands are not thick and stiff like I was afraid they would be. Just make sure to use a quality glue and you are good to go!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok I find out I just don&#x27;t like wearing them</li>
            <li> Took these with me to Vegas and got several of my girlfriends buying their own eyelash bundle. Seriously saves so much money!  No more running to Walgreens to buy $6 pairs. Quality is alright- jusr put some mascara on the lashes to fluff them up and it&#x27;ll look great</li>
            <li> Saved me when I was in a pinch so many times!</li>
            <li> These lashes are very cheaply made - all plastic, not real human hair. The variety is nice, but like I said, very cheaply made. &#x27;You get what you pay for&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Love that there is such a variety. Everything came in nice packaging and nothing was damaged. Will order again.</li>
            <li> ! I love the variety that you get with this eyelashes, they look very nice on ! I&#x27;m very impressed with the fast delivery !</li>
            <li> The Product is great and I gave it a 5 because well look at them. You get 70 pair of lashes for a great price and the hairs dont feel heavy on your eyelids. one thing that i was not expecting was the fact that it came with no glue. all in all i would recommend this product</li>
            <li> Great variety of lashes for different occasions. Thick lashes, exotic lashes and thin lashes. Fast shipping as well. I would recommend these lashes to anyone!</li>
            <li> 70 LASHES FOR THIS GREAT PRICE? WHY NOT!! I AM IN LOVE ALL OVER AGAIN!! YOU CAN NOT LOSE WITH THIS BARGAIN!!</li>
            <li> Stiff and hurt on eyes. not high wuatlity but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> These lashes are quite cheap in quality.  The base is so stiff that they don&#x27;t contour to the lash line well, and the lashes are very stiff and fake looking.  I model, and they are ok for photo shoots.  But for everyday wear, or for going out, I would rather have goopy mascara than wear these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lol, not that I go out in goopy mascara, but you get my point:)</li>
            <li> Got these last year and still have a little over half of the box left. They&#x27;re very good for the price. Great for wearing a night out and throwing away after. Love &#x27;em!</li>
            <li> There is a set of lashes for almost every occasion from day at the office to clubbin. Love all of them. Will def buy again</li>
            <li> I loved the variety and most of all the price! I have never worn lashes before and was not ready to fork over $6 or more for 1 pair of false lashes. They looked great and stayed on and didn&#x27;t matter to me if they are made of &amp;#34;real hair&amp;#34; or not, I&#x27;m in LOVE!</li>
            <li> Great quality, many varieties.</li>
            <li> The lashes are nice, some are a little more dramatic and some a little less, but thats whats so good about them. I will buy more when i run out!(:</li>
            <li> So happy! Great price, high grade. I&#x27;ll be buying more!!! Awesome! Packed well. The variety is great. Very happy girl.</li>
            <li> So I was really looking forward to getting these in the mail and when they finally arrived, I was overcome with utmost disappointment. These lashes feel like paper and they are far too long/dramatic. They don&#x27;t bend on their own, so when you pull them off the white plastic case, they come off as a straight line. Also, there&#x27;s this clear silicone on the lash lines that hurt my eyes when I wear the lashes. There is just one set out of the seven that I can actually use without being mistaken for a cheap hooker. I would return these but it costs $5.41 just to return it...I don&#x27;t understand why they&#x27;re charging me money for a piece of crap product. It&#x27;s okay though, I&#x27;m giving them out as birthday presents to some frenemies.</li>
            <li> This was an amazing buy. Beautiful lashes. Great variety and mix. It nicely divided to service 3 females- Allowing Mom to have additional 10prs.</li>
            <li> Such a goof purchase.  The lashes lasted me for months.  Vast variety as well.  I wish they were softer but overall pretty good buy.</li>
            <li> I can work with these lashes to practice and for short term but I prefer human lashes. Good for the price though.</li>
            <li> I have trichtotrillomania and have never had a full set of eyelashes. I&#x27;m going to be 40 soon and have finally decided that wearing false lashes is how my life is going to be. However, spending $4.00 a pair was not in my budget. When I saw that I could get 70 pairs for $15.99 and free shipping with Prime, I couldn&#x27;t order fast enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They came in two days and when I opened the box, I was in love! There were 7 different styles and 10 pairs of each style. They are nicely organized on individual strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each style I&#x27;ve tried so far has been amazing. A few of them are quite dramatic and I more than likely won&#x27;t wear them to work but I just adore them. They make me feel beautiful on a budget!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use glue from Sephora, and at $8.00 a tube it is pricey but the tube lasts a long long time.[[ASIN:B003UZ35ZO DUO Eyelash Adhesive Black]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering these again. No question about it!</li>
            <li> The details about the box said there are a variety of lashes included. I only found one kind, but am stuck with 70 of them. They are worse than my real lashes. They are short and thin! The lash line is thick and hard plastic. They didn&#x27;t glue very well. They are just not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is such a steal. The price is fantastic. They are awesome and you get several choices which is neat. I would definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> They are very cheaply made not natural at all and very long almost all had to be cut down to size .. A few styles look okay but most I wont be able to use on anyone.. I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again</li>
            <li> these lashes were AWFUL. They already had a rubbery strip off glue on them and you cannot even apply them. the glue doesn&#x27;t come off either without destroying the lashes. too bad!!!</li>
            <li> These are so much fun to play with. Looks good on, easy to use, last long time, can use over and over again.</li>
            <li> this was the worse thing i have seen i thought the lashes looked nice in the picture when i got the product it was horrible some of the lashes were plastic and some felt real just a warning dont buy</li>
            <li> I would recomend to anyone. It is very easy to put on. The seven kinds just suit everyone&#x27;s taste. Thank you.</li>
            <li> About half of the lashes are well made and usable. The other half were REALLY thick and crazy looking. I don&#x27;t know anyone that would wear them, they didn&#x27;t even look like lashes, just a black clump of plastic. These break very easily. They&#x27;re good for fashion shows, something where photography isn&#x27;t close up. Looks great from far away, looks fake up close. Really fake. The ones that were good though were pretty darn good. Not amazing but good enough.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed the more conservative looking lashes. So far and I have gotten compliments on them. I plan on using the thicker ones for parties coming up but they are easy to use and apply. If you feel like the band is too wide (other reviewers said this was an issue), how &#x27;bout drawing a thicker line for your liner??? That has helped me. Great deal!</li>
            <li> The price was so cheap on these I was expecting to receive a lower end product - which I was fine with, I use them for dolls. Anyways, I think these are equal in quality to lashes that cost $3 - $4 per pair from the beauty supply store. Pleasantly surprised. Exceeded expectations for the price.</li>
            <li> For the price these lashes are awesome and last long. I&#x27;ve had them on for a week already and love them. At the store they are prices way higher. The price is great on these and shipping was fast. I got it in one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the length they were a bit long for my asian eyes but I cut them and they were fine. Will buy again if I ever use them all.</li>
            <li> Different style were great. Great quality fast delivery</li>
            <li> I received what I originally wanted, best pair of eyelashes!</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m definitely not the kind of girl to wear fake lashes often but I do enjoy them on occasion. Most of these were too dramatic for my own taste, but I really like them regardless. They are not as bendy as ones I&#x27;ve tried before and have thicker bands so they are a bit harder to put on and I usually do end up cutting off a good chunk of them because they&#x27;re way too long for my own eyes. Past the fussing around when trying to apply them though, they are great lashes for an amazing price. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to a beginner though, which is why I give them 4 stars.</li>
            <li> These rock! They&#x27;re very well made, don&#x27;t fall apart and look awesome. The only thing that is kind of annoying about them is that the strip that holds the lashes on is rather stiff, so you have to make sure you have a sufficient amount of glue to keep them on. Other than that, I like all the different shapes and styles. I haven&#x27;t tried the criss-cross ones yet, but they look pretty funky. Can&#x27;t wait to try those!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with product just wish all 70 pairs were all the same type as my favorite set of them all :)</li>
            <li> TOO THICK AND HARD TO KEEP ON</li>
            <li> Love the different styles of lashes. It is a great buy especially if you wear them all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Not pliable and very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Love these lashes I&#x27;m on my 3 box . I always get compliments on them . Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Love these absolutely a must have for me. So many different variety, great quality and quantity. Such a money saver. And always easy to put on and comfortable to wear, when placed correctly. Love the styles in the box. A lot of people complain saying some of the styles are too dramatic for them but I absolutely love the dramatic ones especially at night time. Recommend buying and have bought over and over again at least 4times this year alone.</li>
            <li> I bought these lashes about a year ago and I absolutely love them!! :)) I am going to keep buying them forever haha!!</li>
            <li> 70 lashes for $15 Is an amazing deal I just want to know if I should buy this product&lt;br /&gt;Should I buy this product ?</li>
            <li> This was a wonderful set.  It had a variety of lashes, so even though there were 70, you were not stuck with 70 of one that you don&#x27;t like, but rather 7 sets of 10 different ones.  It was affordable and it came in the mail quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> This product is not what i had expected it to be, i read these reviews and they all said great things about it. False! These Lashes werent great 60% of these lashes are crap. People! Do your studying before purchasing!</li>
            <li> Not all are the ones I like but still worth it. It would be nice to be able to order the ones I really like from this pack in bulk.</li>
            <li> i saw some reviews that these eyelashes were cheap and also some reviews that they were good quality so i was afraid to order them at first. i love wearing lashes and i would hate having to buy new ones 2 to 3 times a week (i wear them alot) so i ordered these, 70 pairs for $15, sounds to good to be true huh? but there are so many different varieties, i wear the long extreme ones when im going out, and the shorter ones to work or other profressional events. i love the lashes, and if you take good care of them, they usually last 2-3 days, at least for me they do.</li>
            <li> I think I am set for the year with so many eyelashes!  They get the job done, and if applied correctly with a good glue will last all day.&lt;br /&gt; But I do have some complaints.  I realize I only spent about 15 dollars on 70 pairs of lashes, but I think they should be better crafted.  So far I have lost 3 pairs of lashes because they were stuck to the cardboard, losing an additional pair for every pair I&#x27;ve put on so far.  I also wish that there would have been more natural looking lashes, as I can&#x27;t necessarily wear the big thick funky lashes to work and out during the day, because I look like Twiggy or like i&#x27;m from the sixties. Also, the clear plastic lash line is annoying.</li>
            <li> just got them today and i love them, there are seven cards with ten pairs of lashes ...seven different styles. their not cheao looking at all!</li>
            <li> These feel like plastic BUT the are nice and look nice. I usually add mascara to my lashes and it only enhances the look. The variety in this pack is also nice. Often times I reuse pairs and I&#x27;ve had these for Since October of 2014 and have only used 4 pairs, so they last!&lt;br /&gt;They for to the eye nice also. Overall very nice!</li>
            <li> Cheap looking, stiff and unusable.</li>
            <li> I personally am not a fan. I got these and I really tried to like them. They&#x27;re just so plastic and shiny looking. I feel like my money&#x27;s just so much better spent on mink lashes. I&#x27;ve tried each style twice  and I feel like they take away from my whole look instead of enhancing it. If you do choose to wear them I don recommend cutting the strip corners along with the ends of the lashes. It&#x27;s will make your eyeliner blend better.</li>
            <li> Had a great selection of lash styles, but on the down side they were really stiff and would not glue properly.&lt;br /&gt;Thinking it was just me, i gave pairs to friends and they all had the same problem.</li>
            <li> this item is good to use. i have to say, 70 pairs eyelashes are enough to use for a long tiem.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in a few days and I love them many different styles and a great price i will be buying this product again</li>
            <li> I got mine today. The packaging was great and all the lashes were in great condition. There is a good variety of different style lashes also. The thing I don&#x27;t like is that the lashes are plastic and feel plastic.  Which means you can&#x27;t put anything on them other then the glue. You probably won&#x27;t be able to curl them either.  So its a great product if your just starting out and want the practice.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and price!! The lashes are reusable and the seven different types allows for changing up your look, or having a variety for your clients to choose from when applying makeup/lashes!!! Excellent gift for college girls who must have their lashes!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister who loves to use false eye lashes. It comes in a different variety of styles but no glue, you&#x27;ll have to buy that on your own. She will have lashes to last her for a while.</li>
            <li> Have purchased this item at least 4 times. My makeup-obsessed daughter LOVES them. The bulk nature of the product really came in handy when she was asked to do the makeup for her entire dance troupe.</li>
