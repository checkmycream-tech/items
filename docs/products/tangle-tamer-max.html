            <li>This brush is the best brush for tangles money can buy.</li>
            <li>very great brush</li>
            <li>This brush is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>and it is incredible.  </li>
            <li>and I cant wait to try it on my 4a/4b fine strand hair that sheds a lot!!!</li>
            <li>Happy product.</li>
            <li>This is a great brush.</li>
            <li>This thing also gives a great scalp massage.</li>
            <li>This comb made for a pleasant experience with no tugging and helped speed up the time that it takes to finish his hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it did not work good for my hair</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>We are really glad to have found it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>They liked it so well</li>
            <li>but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Well with this one she never complains and always tell me it feels nice on her scalp :)</li>
            <li>I am going to purchase 6 more</li>
            <li>This brush does a okay job of smoothing out tangles</li>
            <li>With this brush she is more willing to brush her own hair.</li>
            <li>This little brush was perfect.  </li>
            <li>This brush made a huge difference in he amount of time it takes for me to brush her hair.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fairly easy to maintain and clean.</li>
            <li>It gets the hair tangle free and my daughter no longer complains that I am pulling her hair.</li>
            <li>Also, the unique shape of the Tangle Tamer is very ergonomical (i.e., it fits in your hand nicely).</li>
            <li>My daughter was so excited</li>
            <li>Way more than normal.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite comb that helped shave about 2 hours of detangling off wash day.  </li>
            <li>We just saw this brush at my local Sally and bought it for her, and I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>/&gt;She has shoulder length, sort of fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>She also has a sensitive scalpe and doesn&#x27;t like most brushes because they hurt.</li>
            <li>and it went right through hers as well.</li>
            <li>She looked at the brush and looked at me like really mom!</li>
            <li>used this for the first time on hair that was out for 2 weeks after I had done a bentonite clay treatment on his hair, I did not detangle his hair until I rinsed out the clay</li>
            <li>He normally does not lose a lot of hair and this stayed true while using this comb.  </li>
            <li>Now I have a lot less fall out throughout the day, and my hair is much more silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth ... Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Anyway this brush has been great both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li>It really does the trick on tangles, so I bought another one to keep at home.</li>
            <li>These days that doesn&#x27;t happen as much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also faster to brush with and doesn&#x27;t take as much effort to do.</li>
            <li>This item with handle is so much easier to use.</li>
            <li>You would have thought I was about to be bald with how much I had falling out.</li>
            <li>less than on Amazon), was a bit larger than the Teezer and the employees said they heard good things about it</li>
            <li>Her hair is very long and fine in the strand</li>
            <li>A normal hairbrush would just cause him too much pain</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>came fast and it dose work a little bit better them a regular brush</li>
            <li>We have long hair and my ten year old daughter loves it as well.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for tangly, fine hair.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old HATES brushing her hair and complains about it a lot.</li>
            <li>Not only does it work very well</li>
            <li>She combed her hair and was happily surprised.</li>
            <li>but I only notice it when I try to brush to fast.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product so that I could brush my 3 year old daughters hair without hurting her in the process.  </li>
            <li>We used it for the first time after her shower when her hair was wet and is the hardest to comb.</li>
            <li>Not so much with the daughter that has the thin fine hair though.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the brush to anyone who is dealing with long hair and a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>It goes through his thick hair easily and doesn&#x27;t cause him any pain as he brushes.  </li>
            <li>As a guy I am not well versed in the brushing of long hair and needed something that could get the tangles out while being gentle at the same time.  </li>
            <li>This is the only brush my 9 year old will use.</li>
            <li>This brush really works; it detangled my very long natural African American hair texture.</li>
            <li>She has very thick more coarse hair</li>
            <li>And not a single owww, wince, or tear.</li>
            <li>Overall, the Tangle Tamer works much better than a regular brush, especially with completely wet hair, but it still does pull a little and causes some breakage.</li>
            <li>One with super thick medium length wavy hair, one with super thin, fine hair and the other with very long wavy hair.</li>
            <li>(it is also available in several other colors--I believe red, blue and black--we got black).</li>

            <li> My 6 year old HATES brushing her hair and complains about it a lot. We just saw this brush at my local Sally and bought it for her, and I am so glad I did! She keeps picking it up and brushing her hair and telling me that it doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore. Hurray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has shoulder length, sort of fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to brush long hair of my granddaughters. They liked it so well, I let them take it home. It really does the trick on tangles, so I bought another one to keep at home. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the only brush my 9 year old will use. Everything else hurts her hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this brush it did not work good for my hair and I have curly wavy hair. It did not do anything for me.</li>
            <li> Bought two to give a granddaughter and to keep here to use for granddaughters.  Works so well with long, thick hair.  No more crying when I&#x27;m trying to untangle hair.</li>
            <li> My 10-year old daughter has medium length, thick wavy hair and has always had a problem combing through it completely due to all the tangles and knots caused by her (our) hectic lives. So I went looking for a brush that might help and saw the Tangle Teezer here on Amazon with rave reviews plus a mention that it could be purchased locally from Sally Beauty Supply so off I went. Sally&#x27;s did have the Teezers but also these Tangle Tamers which cost less ($8-10 range I think...less than on Amazon), was a bit larger than the Teezer and the employees said they heard good things about it so I gave it a shot (it is also available in several other colors--I believe red, blue and black--we got black). My daughter was so excited, she couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. We tested it with her hair completely wet, completely dry and dry but spritzed with water from a spray bottle. Overall, the Tangle Tamer works much better than a regular brush, especially with completely wet hair, but it still does pull a little and causes some breakage. Brushing through completely dry hair is the most difficult but spritzing dry hair with water helps a lot. Also, the unique shape of the Tangle Tamer is very ergonomical (i.e., it fits in your hand nicely). Recommended.</li>
            <li> came fast and it dose work a little bit better them a regular brush but it dose still tug a bit.</li>
            <li> This brush is the best brush for tangles money can buy. I have brushed my wife&#x27;s hair with &amp;#34;the wet brush&amp;#34; and a few others but this is by far the best. Not only does it work very well but it&#x27;s fairly easy to maintain and clean. My wife used to complain that her scalp was getting irritated from all the tugging I would do to get knots out. These days that doesn&#x27;t happen as much. It&#x27;s also faster to brush with and doesn&#x27;t take as much effort to do. For reference my wife has long, fairly thick hair. I ... For what it&#x27;s worth ... Highly recommend this product. Give it a try I don&#x27;t think it will let you down.</li>
            <li> Ordered small knot genie last year. They&#x27;re are hand held with no handle. This item with handle is so much easier to use. The head of brush is bigger too. Handle length could be an inch or so longer for easiest use.</li>
            <li> This arrived in time and it works wonders on my teenage daughters tangled hair.  We have looked for a long time for a brush or anything to detangle my daughters hair.  She looked at the brush and looked at me like really mom! I told her to just try it. She combed her hair and was happily surprised. It smoothed through her hair like nothing. We are really glad to have found it!</li>
            <li> I use this on my daughter&#x27;s hair since she always complains that I pull her hair everytime I brush it. Well with this one she never complains and always tell me it feels nice on her scalp :) very great brush</li>
            <li> I have three girls under the age of 8. One with super thick medium length wavy hair, one with super thin, fine hair and the other with very long wavy hair. Hair brushing was awful with my kids.Not so much with the daughter that has the thin fine hair though. Anyway this brush has been great both wet and dry hair. It does not hurt them at all. There is some breakage but I only notice it when I try to brush to fast. Which by the way it still does not hurt their hair even when i brush it fast and hard. Now any brush that can do that is a winner in my book. it has saved my sanity with all of my girls! It is carried in my local beauty supply store so no ship &amp; hand. charges either!</li>
            <li> My son has very thick hair and a sensitive scalp.  A normal hairbrush would just cause him too much pain so he would go for a very long time before he would brush his hair.  This brush is wonderful.  It goes through his thick hair easily and doesn&#x27;t cause him any pain as he brushes.  I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> My 6yo left me brush her hair!! And not a single owww, wince, or tear. This brush made a huge difference in he amount of time it takes for me to brush her hair. We used it for the first time after her shower when her hair was wet and is the hardest to comb. I am amazed! Her hair is very long and fine in the strand but she has medium thickness. My 5 yo also loves it! She has very thick more coarse hair and it went right through hers as well. I&#x27;m buying a bunch of these and giving them to my mom friends with daughters!</li>
            <li> This brush really works; it detangled my very long natural African American hair texture. I wish the handle was longer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product so that I could brush my 3 year old daughters hair without hurting her in the process.  As a guy I am not well versed in the brushing of long hair and needed something that could get the tangles out while being gentle at the same time.  This little brush was perfect.  It gets the hair tangle free and my daughter no longer complains that I am pulling her hair. I would highly recommend the brush to anyone who is dealing with long hair and a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> Happy product. It does all the things it advertise to do.  The brush is much bigger than it looks on tv.</li>
            <li> it is slippery and falls out of my hands</li>
            <li> My son has MBL 4a/4b very thick hair and normally detangling takes the longest.  This comb made for a pleasant experience with no tugging and helped speed up the time that it takes to finish his hair.&lt;br /&gt;I used this for the first time on hair that was out for 2 weeks after I had done a bentonite clay treatment on his hair, I did not detangle his hair until I rinsed out the clay and I only sptritzed his hair with water and conditioner mix before using this comb, then I applied the deep conditioner on detangled hair.  He normally does not lose a lot of hair and this stayed true while using this comb.  This is my new favorite comb that helped shave about 2 hours of detangling off wash day.  I am going to purchase 6 more and I cant wait to try it on my 4a/4b fine strand hair that sheds a lot!!! I will update in about 3 weeks on that.</li>
            <li> My daughter HATES brushing her hair! She gets a lot of knots in her long hair and it will take me an hour to brush through her hair at times. She also has a sensitive scalpe and doesn&#x27;t like most brushes because they hurt. With this brush she is more willing to brush her own hair. Also it works as claimed, detangles with ease!</li>
            <li> This brush does a okay job of smoothing out tangles but it is no miracle.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for my hair type too well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a couple dollars cheaper from Sally Beauty Supply. This is a great brush. I hate brushing my hair. I have very thick, long hair and have tried lots of different types of brushes but this has been hands down my favorite. Prior to using this I had lots of hair fall out, all the time. You would have thought I was about to be bald with how much I had falling out. Way more than normal. I started using this brush, ever day, and only washing my hair every three days. Now I have a lot less fall out throughout the day, and my hair is much more silky and smooth. Love it! This thing also gives a great scalp massage. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser turned me on to this and it is incredible.  We have long hair and my ten year old daughter loves it as well.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for tangly, fine hair.</li>
