            <li>Good</li>
            <li>My boyfriend has always loved my lips, but some days I don&#x27;t want to fiddle around with lining my lips with a pencil and taking all of the steps to balance out my lips.</li>

            <li>The costumer service is amazing, if the size isn&#x27;t working for you  </li>
            <li>This product works amazingly well at enhancing the pouty/round appearance of my lips without leaving any marks.</li>

            <li>These lip enhancers are nice</li>
            <li>Honestly, it works sometimes and doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>nice packaging and comes with instructions</li>
            <li>What a nice item&lt;br /&gt;Am</li>
            <li>so thankful for her for the nice gift</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t liked.</li>
            <li>Amazing customer service, extremely fast shipping/communication, and awesome product.</li>
            <li>Cannot believe how effective this is.</li>
            <li>I think I will just stick to Juvederm, to be honest.</li>
            <li>i bought all the sizes and the seller is so kind and helpfull</li>
            <li>Not as effective as I thought.</li>
            <li>There has to be a way to use these effectively, without having them bruise my lips or just not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was in a beautiful package and full instructions.</li>
            <li>I honestly think it just takes some getting used to for you and your body</li>
            <li>Does the job, I just honestly don&#x27;t feel like sucking on it every hour.</li>
            <li>I do it whenever I feel just to kind of &amp;#34;train&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I honestly wasn&#x27;t too happy with the actual plumping enhancer, but the sell was so wonderful they deserve 5 stars anyway.</li>
            <li>For me, these enhancers are great for special occasions.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad so many people got great result though :)</li>
            <li>It works and the owner is very sweet!</li>
            <li>I end up with very full lips!  </li>
            <li>and I received 2, one for free which made me so happy because ordering I wasn&#x27;t sure which size to get</li>
            <li>I gave it two stars because it came very quickly, made of good quality plastic and the packing</li>
            <li>The results lasted a couple of hours, but were very easy to touch up.  </li>
            <li>It makes my lips even more sexy!</li>
            <li>Love this company, love this product!</li>
            <li>I just got mine yesterday, but I have to say, so far, this is an excellent product!  </li>
            <li>I ALWAYS get asked if I get injections or how nice my lips are :)</li>
            <li>Wow, what a great company!</li>
            <li>and i just thought i should give it a try they work so good and make my lips looks nice and full</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a HUGE online shopper, and I can safely attest that Ms. Gomez (the founder and head of this excellent enterprise) is awesome beyond words, better than any other retailer with whom I&#x27;ve ever done business.  </li>
            <li>Easy, it works and you do get results!</li>
            <li>Over-all, it&#x27;s a fantastic product and unless you&#x27;re willing to commit to lip injections this is a great alternative! :)</li>
            <li>Worked great, did exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>The Fullips founder is really running her business in an efficient, beautiful manner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had good sized, full lips</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product and I strongly recommend these to anyone looking to enhance their lips.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this purchase and the help that I received from Brooklyn, she even threw in the medium size enhancer for free:)</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly and in nice packaging.</li>
            <li>It seems practice makes perfect really rings true with this product..</li>
            <li>The owner/founder Linda is SUPER SWEET!!!</li>
            <li>When I asked about the bonus size that comes with the purchase, she told me I could choose what gift size I wanted and to note it in the &amp;#34;notes/additional information&amp;#34; section on the order form which was a huge relief to me!</li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s works better for me.  </li>
            <li>You just look better.</li>
            <li>I may still be getting used to using them but they&#x27;re just okay.  </li>
            <li>I love it already .</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t sure on what size to get</li>
            <li>Honestly love them.</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow instructions</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>just okay.</li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;m giggling as I think of what I&#x27;m going to say.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought this plumper</li>
            <li>Plus after all the warnings about doing this type of lip plumping in my opinion injectables done by a Doctor are a better option.</li>
            <li>I find that the results last around 3 hours for me, however it&#x27;s perfect size to put in your make-up and take on the go.</li>
            <li>Love Fullips.</li>
            <li>It does work but it lasts for an hour at most...</li>
            <li>I tried the product numerous times and followed directions perfectly.</li>
            <li>I really love them and use them frecuently.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works better once you lips are moisturized.</li>
            <li>Yes, yes, and more yes.</li>
            <li>Obviously the results are temporary, but isn&#x27;t that the best part?</li>
            <li>Actually a better description would be the plastic stacking cups children use .  </li>
            <li>Creative idea though .</li>
            <li>and I got a bonus one for free!</li>
            <li>Packaging is adorable.</li>
            <li>This lasts about 40 minutes to an hour at the most and I think how hydrated you are makes a difference.</li>
            <li>The more time I spend the longer it lasts.</li>
            <li>Linda is simply the best  and the nicest person I have ever dealt with on line.  </li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t get any bruising or redness that lasts more than a minute</li>
            <li>Wonderful seller, would definitely do business anytime!!</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>However, after using this many times I am just not seeing the results I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>which is what I want to plump most) - when I use this it plumps mostly just my lower lip.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>but I am overall very impressed with this product!</li>
            <li>Ive seen videos od people that say it takes more than 20 minutes</li>
            <li>You can always pop onto the bathroom and fullen them!! :)</li>
            <li>Then wait about 10 minutes to make sure they don&#x27;t over swell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely in love with my products.</li>
            <li>this is magic i love it</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Recommended:)</li>
            <li>I have nothing but glowing things to say :)</li>
            <li>but they say the more you use it, in a sense you train your lips</li>
            <li>All are awesome and work different parts of your lips.</li>
            <li>I espescially love the &amp;#34;baby doll lip&amp;#34</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love the way my lips look.  </li>
            <li>So, it did bruise the top part of my lip, but, that doesn&#x27;t stop me from using it.</li>
            <li>but they also gave me one for free!</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Perhaps better videos would help?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for about an hour.</li>
            <li>I love how my lips look, even if it is just temporary.</li>
            <li>and you have to keep sucking and sucking and it bruises the top of your lip and bottom</li>
            <li>Should have known better though</li>
            <li>Linda, job well done:)</li>
            <li>More blood flow to the lips encourages faster cell rejuvenation and production.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it..</li>
            <li>It works like you just got lip injections :)</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>Does not plump top and bottom evenly.  </li>
            <li>They all love it too.</li>
            <li>I could not be more stoked on this.</li>
            <li>Such a great invention!!!!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product took me a couple trys to get the hang of it</li>
            <li>but once I did I fell in love</li>
            <li>Oh yes this is the product to have for making those lips more plump and sexy.</li>
            <li>I guess it would be better suited for pictures.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I make sure I put some lip balm on before I use it as well.</li>
            <li>I let it work its magic while I am applying my eye and face makeup.</li>
            <li>I love this lip enhancer because it gives me a sexy pout that lasts for hours, and I don&#x27;t have to risk looking like a fish by getting lip augmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>OK, so I literally bought these yesterday</li>
            <li>and I got to say I love love love what is does.</li>
            <li>Also love how they send you 2</li>
            <li>but It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>It came with a lovely personalized note.</li>
            <li>Make sure you watch the how to videos on the website.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast,packaging was too cute and most of all it works!</li>
            <li>But I would mostly recommend just your natural beautiful lips.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t find an easier, more reasonably priced and effective lip enhancer!</li>
            <li>Pretty cool, works better then any lip plumping gloss.&lt;br /&gt;also great customer service.</li>
            <li>and it also came super FAST!!!!!</li>
            <li>and I was so excited to get these today!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to use these on Thanksgiving before seeing my family!</li>

            <li>so I was so excited!</li>
            <li>So excited!</li>
            <li>Shipped VERY fast and arrived very quickly!!</li>
            <li>Dry worked best for me.</li>
            <li>When I finally felt like my lips were looking good, my man laughed and called me &amp;#34;blue lips&amp;#34; because of all the bruising.</li>
            <li>Product came quickly though in the mail with detailed instructions in very cute packaging.</li>
            <li>I would be fine with it if the result lasted more than a minute or 2.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, best beauty product I have purchased IN A LONG TIME!!!</li>
            <li>So I love that I received a medium oval with my order for free.  </li>
            <li>A lot of people use it for \\&quot;spot targeting\\&quot;, but I find it is the perfect size to give me the center fullness/</li>
            <li>and cover my whole mouth even part on my superior skin.</li>
            <li>Wow, I LOVE these!!</li>
            <li>Sweet owner!</li>
            <li>Gave the other one as a gift and they weren&#x27;t impressed with it either.</li>
            <li>and I have the full lips I&#x27;ve always wanted with out surgery!</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed my product every day with a smile!</li>
            <li>but overall loved it!</li>
            <li>These enhancers create full, natural-looking lips, as promised and my lip lines are disappearing!  </li>
            <li>You get what you want, full lips!</li>
            <li>Go really easy and follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>They work with suction that is painless and easy, unlike the glosses and creams I have tried before.</li>
            <li>The shipping was really fast and the packaging is really nice, and I love that it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Iys easy to use, its customizable and by that</li>
            <li>An easy, painless, not invasive way to achieve plumper lips.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re quite easy to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend you watch the tutorial videos as well.</li>
            <li>It is better than those special lip glosses.</li>
            <li>Just right!  :)</li>
            <li>I have full lips to begin with but wanted to see what I would look like with a bit more fullness and fullips</li>
            <li>My lips looked full and fabulous!</li>
            <li>The SELLER, the owner herself is an absolute doll- she wrote to me personally to explain which one I should order when I wasn&#x27;t sure what would be best.</li>
            <li>My lips are full and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>they will have gone down a bit to the perfect size that looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband loves my new look and I feel much more confident!</li>
            <li>Which is just fine.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions and you should be fine.</li>
            <li>At first I was hesitant and on top of that I wasn&#x27;t sure what size to order.</li>
            <li>but i got my perfect volume in less than 5.</li>
            <li>It is fairly comfortable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work  fine</li>
            <li>The shipping was also incredibly fast and the packaging is adorable!</li>
            <li>It is very fun and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I received a free one and the packaging is super cute.</li>
            <li>The quality of the plastic is good but the idea is just not realistic or effective</li>
            <li>I feel like the customer service is on the ball with this product, and that is a huge point for me.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>( I saw another one that had a plunger and was huge).</li>
            <li>When I get it to work my lips are too huge.</li>
            <li>I got a huge difference.</li>
            <li>but it made my lips huge</li>
            <li>Again not the fault of the product on piercing free lips.</li>
            <li>But the results are great if done properly</li>
            <li>OK, I ordered this product just for the fun of it.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the free gift included.</li>
            <li>they included a free am all oval fullips enhancer.</li>
            <li>I was looking to have fun with this and plump them up some more for going out/selfies</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit mouth too well</li>
            <li>Who knew something so cheap would work like a charm?</li>
            <li>Came with free gift (Medium Oval).</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t fit my lips in it.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic and does everything it says it does.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was also really fast and the packaging is really nice.</li>
            <li>, so happy I finally purchased!</li>
            <li>But the lip plumping usually last for about 40-50 minutes for me but the results are great with out the needle.</li>
            <li>The seller was extra nice and gave me an extra lip enhancer in another size, that was awesome!</li>
            <li>The big one gives my lips alot of fullness there great</li>
            <li>maybe it was free</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is amazing to me that this product costs as much as a lip-plumping gloss (that won&#x27;t work anyway)</li>
            <li>They are important.</li>
            <li>I got an extra one in the mail which was great because I ordered it as a gift</li>
            <li>and my lips look fabulous once I&#x27;m finished with the suction</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the results, from what I saw on Instagram to what I got after use wasn&#x27;t worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product but effects don&#x27;t last me more than an hour, if at all an hour.</li>
            <li>and the product works very well to plump your lips perfectly when correctly following instructions...</li>
            <li>Well I sure found the right</li>
            <li>It works great, gets the job done within minutes, extremely friendly service, just wish they would last fuller longer</li>
            <li>This takes practice and you really have to &amp;#34;train your lips&amp;#34;!!!</li>
            <li>The seller is very kind and included instructions and her personal email in case i had questions.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend - this is the real deal &amp; you don&#x27;t have to buy more every month or 3 months or year or EVER!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this seller and this amazing product</li>
            <li>Super fast and personalized, courteous response.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s if you are actually able to it to work in the first place.  </li>
            <li>This is a fun product, try it out!</li>
            <li>Great for selfies not for long wear</li>
            <li>Great product as long as you follow the directions.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I was deciding on getting lip injections but after seeing so many botched lips, I wanted to test it out first.</li>
            <li>I was excited about this product...</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>so glad i found this first</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, easy directions, and it works!</li>
            <li>Loving my new fullips lip enhancers.</li>
            <li>, I did it clean and all of the ways to do it.  </li>
            <li>voila, I now have amazing full lips that last most of the day.</li>
            <li>This product draws your blood to your lips thusly naturally plumping them while adding more color!</li>
            <li>So far the results are phenomenal!</li>
            <li>but if the large doesn&#x27;t work I&#x27;m sure the others won&#x27;t either.</li>
            <li>If these haven&#x27;t worked for you, you aren&#x27;t doing it right!</li>
            <li>Super fun!</li>
            <li>I bought full lips to use for those special evening</li>
            <li>Ladies, if you really want full plump lips temporarily, you&#x27;d do better with a lip liner and/or lip injections.</li>
            <li>so much &amp;#60;3 truely satisfied.</li>
            <li>That disappeared within 48 hours and now I&#x27;ve found the sweet spot.  </li>
            <li>I already have full lips.</li>
            <li>love my Fullips, and would highly recommend...between the customer service and product, 10 stars!</li>
            <li>full lips makes us all Kardashians.</li>
            <li>Overall a good investment.</li>
            <li>I have reasonably full lips now</li>
            <li>I have full lips to begin with</li>
            <li>Taking it slow, this product is awesome!</li>
            <li>Comes with a sweet handwritten card from the founder.</li>
            <li>I love the results this really works</li>
            <li>Love this product it really works.</li>
            <li>:) It really does work well, and does not hurt at all.</li>
            <li>but it was cool.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THESE SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>Its good but doesnt last and</li>
            <li>It takes a little getting used to, but is very easy to use and results come in a matter of seconds!!</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t fit my mouth right at all</li>
            <li>They send me a gift with my purchase and that was a plus and a super cool surprise.</li>
            <li>You can tell she really does care about her customers and wants you to love her product!</li>
            <li>Lol it&#x27;s cool but not worth</li>
            <li>The large is about right but using a shot glass has proven to be better.</li>
            <li>if I&#x27;m lucky?</li>
            <li>The item came really quick.</li>
            <li>Save your money, unless a super fleeting, quick fix is what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>but results fade too quickly.</li>
            <li>But then goes away quick.</li>
            <li>Company was awesome enough to ship this asap and send two different sizes of the device.</li>
            <li>New full lips in seconds, my husband loves them and was more shock that I was.</li>
            <li>Okay, okay, yes it&#x27;s a little bit of money to make your lips fuller, but it&#x27;s better than spending 600$ on collagen injections and have it be permanent, and regret it if you don&#x27;t like the way it looks.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much Linda!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get the nice full lips without having the red irritation around my mouth</li>
            <li>I was also sent the oval one as a free gift, which was awesome, and I think I like that one better than the larger one  because I really only need volume on my upper lip.</li>
            <li>They are made very well and shipped out very quickly.</li>
            <li>I got two of my friends who have smaller lips to try it out and they absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Seems to work pretty well!  </li>
            <li>It really works!!</li>
            <li>If you want bigger lips your better off sucking on a pill bottle/shot glass!</li>
            <li>This really works!!</li>
            <li>it really Works!!</li>
            <li>but it actually worked better than the medium!</li>
            <li>I would recommend when you first test it out to do it  after work or another time when you know you wont have to see anyone important right after, in case you accidentally bruise your lips.</li>
            <li>My item was shipped very quickly, along with a second fullips free!</li>
            <li>i ordered large but got medium for free as well ,..</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s a buy one get one free, I got both sizes medium and large together.</li>
            <li>The smaller one I think is a great because it could be used to plump up the center a bit more.</li>
            <li>Her customer service skills are amazing and after speaking to her personally, I was no longer hesitant to order.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how this is getting such amazing reviews?</li>
            <li>By the time I finish the rest of my face, my lips are plumped, hydrated, smooth, and ready for lipstick application.</li>
            <li>Again fun product and go for it if you want to have a bit of fun.</li>
            <li>We had so much fun experimenting with both sizes</li>
            <li>, SO worth the inexpensive cost.</li>
            <li>I had fun playing with this.  </li>
            <li>The effect is fun and temporary.  </li>
            <li>The value is so worth it.</li>
            <li>, I thought this would be fun to try.  </li>
            <li>she really goes Above &amp; Beyond to make sure you are completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s temporary but soo worth it</li>
            <li>Completely worth every penny..</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will do, and that is give you full, luscious lips.</li>
            <li>These things are soooo fun.</li>
            <li>Fun thing to play with once in a while</li>
            <li>but it deffently is worth it</li>
            <li>This product is fun.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Save up for that, it&#x27;s way worth it.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The enhancer comes in a mesh red drawstring baggie along with instructions that are underlined with the most important things.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last long (which it states, \\&quot;temporary\\&quot;) -- but WOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW to the seriously AMAZING customer service by this seller!!</li>
            <li>Thank you sooooo much Linda for inventing this much needed beauty tool!!!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Thanks for a fun harmless lip plumper!</li>
            <li>Works very well and fun to use!</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m not using it right</li>
            <li>She is doing everything right.</li>
            <li>I like it, it takes time to get used to it and find right way to use.</li>
            <li>Works right when you use it.</li>
            <li>My lips don&#x27;t look fuller, even though I&#x27;m using the cups the right way.</li>
            <li>so right out of the box</li>
            <li>If you do it right then it&#x27;ll work</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m not doing it right, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I Got The Right Size</li>
            <li>I think the most important thing with this product is making sure you are drinking enough water because it works by drawing the fluid in your lips forward to plump then.&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li>I have to say it&#x27;s pretty fun.</li>
            <li>but after a few minutes my lips swelled up so much I honestly got scared!</li>
            <li>Works perfectlyy for someone who wants full lips without  injections.</li>
            <li>My lips are already full but this really puffs them up.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast, personalized note and a sweet gesture was inside the package.  </li>
            <li>the small oval works great when I use it vertically.  </li>
            <li>The package came with full instructions and arrived so much sooner than I thought</li>
            <li>I bought the large one because my lips are already pretty full.</li>
            <li>for the shapes themselves, I am fuller-lipped naturally and found the large circle to be of more use.</li>
            <li>I got the large round and it worked great</li>
            <li>These little red thingies are wonderful.</li>
            <li>First of all, the packaging was so professional and nice with an added bonus inside, it came with very clear instructions as well.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast</li>
            <li>I received my Fullips super fast after ordering and immediately tore into my package.  </li>
            <li>The seller was super nice and included a handwritten note and her personal information to contact her and very clear instructions.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommended thus product for anyone who wants full lips!</li>
            <li>but I love how my lips look right after with some red lipstick!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use them again on my lunch break and I&#x27;m good for the second half of my day :)</li>
            <li>I love the enhancers I originally ordered the large round and got a medium oval for free.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to do and doesn&#x27;t take long at all.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to do a quick 30 second touch up in the car or restroom.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the large round and recieved the medium oval for free which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>The item arrived two days earlier than estimated, the cute red bags and cards with the founders hand written name and hearts around important tips makes it feel like a special gift from a friend.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>The best product for thin lips!</li>
            <li>I apply vaseline on my lips first and then.  </li>
            <li>My results lasted for about 2 hours my first try</li>
            <li>Was given an extra one for free!</li>
            <li>this product really does work and is well worth the money .</li>
            <li>These really do work!</li>
            <li>so maybe it works better for younger people.  </li>
            <li>It really does work!  </li>
            <li>I use buxom gloss sometimes and it most definitely makes a more obvious difference.</li>
            <li>I was interested and hesitant to try this product, but was really curious and I am not a filler or plastic surgery kind of girl.</li>
            <li>THEY REALLY WORK!</li>
            <li>Also, it says that the more you use it, the longer it will start lasting.</li>
            <li>Really Does work!</li>
            <li>product came fast !</li>
            <li>I would NOT recomend this product to absolutely anyone!</li>
            <li>I also think they are tricky to use at first</li>
            <li>Maybe I need more practice because it only lasted about an hour for me.</li>
            <li>However many people will tell you that this last 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I feel pretty</li>
            <li>I only used moisture lip balm for healthy lips.</li>
            <li>My lips look bigger and sexy.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m not doing it correctly or maybe it just works better on different people</li>
            <li>and I have pretty, plump lips for hours.</li>
            <li>Fullips also carries Lipgloss, Lipstick and lipsLiners in really pretty colors.</li>
            <li>She won&#x27;t need to get more injections again as this product brings the collagen back to the surface.</li>
            <li>sadly it didn&#x27;t get real good results.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>If you like that &amp;#34;Just had a hot make out session</li>
            <li>It does what it say , my tiny lips love it so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really does work and no issues yet!</li>
            <li>I had bruises on my lips the first time.</li>
            <li>Even when my lips are already pretty plumped</li>
            <li>It is delivered promptly and comes in a cute red bag with a card from the seller.</li>
            <li>BAM BIG SEXY LIPS</li>
            <li>so i will re do them in 3-4 hours like it suggests and see if they start to last longer as I use it more.</li>
            <li>did watch the informational video on how to use the fullips first...</li>
            <li>But, I will not say what the gift was, you must purchase this item yourself to see what it is ;).  </li>
            <li>So at first it didn&#x27;t give me results I wanted</li>
            <li>The enhancer really does work!</li>
            <li>If any of you ladies could give me some advice to make it last longer than 5-10 mins, please do tell! :)</li>
            <li>I first received this product</li>
            <li>The 2nd time using it, my results where 10x better.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my lips look only downside</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>but I purchased this first.</li>
            <li>It does work but it won&#x27;t last for more than 45 minutes</li>
            <li>This product really does work!</li>
            <li>I am buying this product again for my sister,, it really works!</li>
            <li>It comes in a cute red bag and the device in seperate plastic containers.</li>
            <li>Very helpful!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: does work, took me a good few times to learn how to use these babies but they are part of my makeup routine</li>
            <li>May be good for others, but I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my time or  money.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and all natural - Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I bought the large but they also included a small one which actually works great to get a pucker lips look!</li>
            <li>The large size is just so large!</li>
            <li>Many products are pure gimmicks, but Fullips definitely isn&#x27;t one of those products.</li>
            <li>That was really sweet and completely unexpected!</li>
            <li>so my lips go down after about an hour but still love it!</li>
            <li>I thought it was super nice to get personal note from the Owner of the company and extra lip enhancer.</li>
            <li>The Fullips really upped the game on suction lip plumping, and I&#x27;m super happy with my purchase!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and i pump them up pretty large</li>
            <li>This product came faster than expected, better than expected and the seller was just lovely!</li>
            <li>LOVE that I ordered the large round and also received the oval one for free.</li>
            <li>The small one is good for particular spots, the medium is good for individual lips and the round is good for both at the same time.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>OK sooo I have been wanting this to for so long and have done lots of research on this product and seller.</li>
            <li>They work very well, the first time I used it</li>
            <li>I first wake up before I put my makeup on and if I am going to an event I do it while I am prepping and getting ready.</li>
            <li>I have full lips naturally and read all the reviews and tips saying to get the large one</li>
            <li>Just need to start graddually, hold it for a little bit firstly and then U feel your own reaction.</li>
            <li>I already have full lips but just wanted a little more of a kick</li>
            <li>It feels so strange and we caught on real quick just how much suction to use.</li>
            <li>but I also received a small one which is a much better fit for me.</li>
            <li>This is epic and completely worthy of 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I do strongly recommend it for those that are wanting bigger fuller lips and do not want to get lip injections.</li>
            <li>It does take a few attempts to get the right &amp;#34;plump-age&amp;#34; and technique, but very easy to use after.</li>
            <li>I already have large lips, but was looking for that trout pout without going in for injections or fillers.</li>
            <li>I contacted Linda to see if I can exchange the large for a medium</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even get it to stay on because it&#x27;s so large.</li>
            <li>I ordered large</li>
            <li>After a certain age, I just don&#x27;t have time for this.</li>
            <li>I got the large as a complementary one after ordering the medium oval</li>
            <li>But they looked pretty decent to me before all the brusing but the fullness lasted like 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>This simple little suction tool is a great concept.</li>
            <li>Great little tool to have in your purse for those last minute presentations!</li>
            <li>So far I actually like the medium oval a bit more than the round as it really helped to target the upper lip, but both were easy to use and provided surprising plumping action, even for a newbie.</li>
            <li>It took a few mintues to get used to, and my results were amazing but went away within 30 mins.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, nice presentation &amp; so thankful for received two: the round &amp; the oval.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week straight now and my lips stay plump for about 2-3 hours</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking to get plump lips fast or someone who is trying to deciding if they want to get fillers.</li>
            <li>you can actually be hands free, let the plumper do</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>FREE GIFT (extra fullip )!</li>
            <li>because I only ordered one and received another size for free.</li>
            <li>I did not get much plumping</li>
            <li>I really am bummed because i wanted prefect and plump lips.</li>
            <li>However, be gentle and follow instructions otherwise</li>
            <li>shipping was extremely fast</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Plumps my lips gently.</li>
            <li>Fast forward a couple of months</li>
            <li>they do give me fuller but very temporary lips.</li>
            <li>Absolute rubbish.</li>
            <li>It fits around my whole mouth enlarging both lips simultaneously.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t do much of anything.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t get much of a suction on these to see my lip puff up.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I recommend using the gloss because it&#x27;s a lip plumper and really helps with the results.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t cover my whole lip.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t make much of a difference with my lips, followed instructions.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t do it every day, but the lip is much puffier.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li>Definitely makes lips smooth and plump.</li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>but it is VERY temporary .</li>
            <li>recommend to every girls who wants fullips:</li>
            <li>Still experimenting, fun experience so far.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate cause this really works.</li>
            <li>it came so fast and worked so well.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants fuller lips</li>
            <li>Too much suction</li>
            <li>they came fast</li>
            <li>THANKS.</li>
            <li>It really works though.</li>
            <li>I was ready to try it.  </li>
            <li>My lips were much, much fuller.  </li>
            <li>Really dissapointed</li>
            <li>This lip plumping enhancer really works and lasts for hours.  </li>
            <li>it plumps my lips for real</li>
            <li>I was really contemplating getting lip injections</li>
            <li>It can even be too much, if you&#x27;re not careful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s whatever honestly, I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on it again.</li>
            <li>I have fairly thin lips and using this gave me a rich, plump look I had desired for so many years!</li>
            <li>and it was kind of uneven.</li>
            <li>The more frequent you use them the longer the fullness will last.</li>
            <li>Also my top lip is smaller than my bottom and wanted to see them evened out, which was easy to make happen using the complimentary small oval one.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my daughter and she was SO excited to use them, but honestly she has only used them a few times because they do bruise your lips.  </li>
            <li>I used it with my home made sugar, cinnamon, and olive oil mixture applied with a stiff bristle toothbrush and the results were astounding.  </li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews for products, but the results this little plastic device gave to my lips was amazing</li>
            <li>It really works, however they sent an oval one for free and its too small, my lips don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>It works much more efficiently than other manual plumpers b/c</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m excited to keep using it and see how things go in the future!</li>
            <li>Since it works for so many other people, it might work for you too.</li>
            <li>nice, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but my lips don&#x27;t get any larger and the effect fades within half an hour to an hour for me at best.</li>
            <li>They WILL work, but you need to be patient at first and figure out how much pressure your sensitive lip tissues can take before bruising.</li>
            <li>My main interest in these was to plump my upper lip, and I get better results, and no bruise look by just sucking on my top lip without this &amp;#34;enhancer&amp;#34; (which is just a small plastic cup)</li>
            <li>She wrote me long detailed emails with helpful tips.</li>
            <li>I will post more in the near future to give a complete review</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing about 4 hours after my first run with it, and the effects are almost completely gone -  </li>
            <li>Linda was so sweet and writes personal messages on the instructions.</li>
            <li>It took a few practice runs to not give my chin a slight bruise, but after I figured the placement out, I can easily say I love it and am addictedd to it!</li>
            <li>I actually used it last night and when i woke up this am, my lips were still huge!</li>
            <li>THat being said I would totally recommend this for anyone who wants to have a bit of fun with your lips without the commitment of getting a botched lip job.</li>
            <li>received my Fullips in a cute red organza bag, with a hand-signed note and an extra Fullips!</li>
            <li>You will get the plumping for a short time once you start to use it, but the more you use it the longer it will last and the quicker your lips will respond.</li>
            <li>I tried 2 different sizes with many different variations on placement.  </li>
            <li>I just wanted to plump them even more, but this ended up making the outside of my lips red and that lasted longer than the plumping effect.</li>
            <li>They do what they are suppose to but only lasted not even 20 mins... super dissapointed, and yes I used them correctly</li>
            <li>so I use this mainly for photos and when im goin out.</li>
            <li>Sure enough I look in the mirror and the effects were totally gone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend theses if your not looking for anything permanent.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t super small, they&#x27;re just normal, but I&#x27;ve always wanted that filled out pout.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to enhance them a little bit more.</li>
            <li>does not mean it won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li>I love this little product.</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t expect it to enlarge your lips any more than a little puffy and &amp;#34;just kissed&amp;#34; looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li>so far I use the large round the most.</li>
            <li>;) I already have full lips, but I wanted that extra Cupid&#x27;s bow definition and a little more &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; factor and these totally deliver.</li>
            <li>Linda put her personal touches on the card by underling important things and gave her personal thanks and signature.</li>
            <li>The product was amazing, outdone my expectations, they definitely make the lips bigger and fuller with a lasting effect.</li>
            <li>(responsibly of course) ;)…..Oh and It looks like it could last forever…</li>
            <li>They sent me two shapes, and I find I&#x27;m using the oval shape more than the round.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to simulate an actual injection, but it plumps the shrinkage and lines to create a full lip in a natural way.  </li>
            <li>Before buying this product, I used a shot glass to achieve pretty much the same thing.</li>
            <li>A total lip plumper junkie, I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything on the market besides getting injections to plump my lips.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think its healthy to be doing this to your lips all the time, but a few times every now</li>
            <li>I figured my mouth was normal size, but I guess not.</li>
            <li>Long gone are the days where I took an ungodly amount of time to pile heaps of lip product to make them look more symmetrical only to have it wear or rub off in a couple hours.</li>
            <li>I am having lots of fun experimenting with the different shapes and techniques, but no matter how I do it</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have attached picture of how my lips are normally</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have attached picture of how my lips are normally</li>
            <li>I did watch a few videos to make sure I was doing it correctly.</li>
            <li>Especially if you&#x27;re a busy mom of three young ones, go to work and school full time.</li>
            <li>This is totally worth it if you want something quick for a picture or something that&#x27;ll last less then an hour because this is very temporary.</li>
            <li>I love these little things (you receive two when you buy them!)</li>
            <li>The founder of the company gave very clear directions on the videos and the included instructions on how to use the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very surprised with the results.</li>
            <li>It will not be as effective as lip fillers as it does go down pretty soon after you use it, usually an hour more or less.</li>
            <li>It really works and keeps your lips full for about a hour or alittle less</li>
            <li>but after numerous lip piercings in my teenage years my bottom lip was always a bit bigger than my top lip, which is why I asked for the &amp;#34;small oval&amp;#34; for my gift size.</li>
            <li>I will try to update with a video of how I use mine in the near future!ly recommend...between the customer service and product, 10 stars!</li>
            <li>First the &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; one isn&#x27;t very big at all</li>
            <li>but I got a small oval lip enhancer as a gift and it works much better</li>
            <li>Not worth the price, even if they were free.</li>
            <li>she even sent me the small one for free!</li>
            <li>Once you place the cup (for lack of a better word) over the lip area, take small sips of air till suction is acquired.</li>
            <li>Makes your lips look naturally luscious!  </li>
            <li>I wish I could love this product, I like how it instantly makes my lips bigger and fuller, but it is only temporary and lasts for maybe an hour.</li>
            <li>And then I ended up with the small oval as a free gift with my order!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Seriously, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Linda and</li>
            <li>I bought the large and received the small for free.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the whole reason I purchased the full round.  </li>
            <li>I was also surprised with an additional small plumper for free!</li>
            <li>They really do work but after 30 mins, they go back to normal.</li>
            <li>I use the large one-but for those with a smaller lip the small ones might work better.</li>
            <li>Oh, and btw, if you have an over producing saliva gland (like myself) get ready for a wet and wild ride ;)</li>
            <li>Other than that my lips are full 😚😗😙</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast, and I have been using it everyday.</li>
            <li>I naturally have full lips but was curious to see what all the hype was about !</li>
            <li>Linda (the seller of this product) sent an extra gift along with my large plumping enhancer.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first and wasn&#x27;t getting it right the first time but kept practicing and now see all the benefits to getting plump full lips that last.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t suck too hard or keep on your lips more than 12-15 seconds</li>
            <li>i was expecting be more soft, is really hard plastic, and make my lips so sore.  </li>
            <li>She said that if she uses them more often they will probably get more used to it and they should quit bruising her lips so bad.</li>
            <li>the ore frequent i do it.</li>
            <li>The preasure should be enough for you to feel it but not so much it hurts.</li>
            <li>They really work, it last up 3-6 hours.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve still only gotten minimal results (nothing more than what a regular lip plumper gloss hasn&#x27;t given me) that have lasted maybe 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>But have to use it frequently.</li>
            <li>I just go gentle and not to the point where it looks gross.</li>
            <li>plus I&#x27;m old like 60.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely sold..</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I am very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Everybody say they received a second piece as a gift, which I didn&#x27;t and was really upset, because this size didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li>When I initially used this item,the results that you see in the picture had me really happy &amp; I was expecting it to last at least 2 hours,OMG this did not even last 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>old son noticed the difference &amp;#34;Mom</li>
            <li>It really gives you that big lip!</li>
            <li>shipping was fast and I even got a extra plumper!</li>
            <li>I got this last week, and it bruised the hell out of my mouth and really didn&#x27;t do anything to my lips.</li>
            <li>But doesn&#x27;t last for more then a few minutes.</li>
            <li>but the effects do not last more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li>The effect on my lips just last for a few minutes but during that time i look sooo sexy.</li>
            <li>So if you have bigger lips gey the round one :)</li>
            <li>Take it slow and If you do bruise yourself, it went away within a day - enjoy!</li>
            <li>Now, i can get very full lips in less than a minute, and i think that over time, they get larger as well, and rounder looking.</li>
            <li>It took a bit of trial and error to get the suction just right, which left my mouth area a bit red, but I think that&#x27;s just beginner messiness.</li>
            <li>This product by far has done the best job in naturally plumping my lips without doing something crazy like using active bee venom.</li>
            <li>They are small and easy to take with you in your purse,</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re willing to shell out $20 to make your lips a little bigger then yes its worth it.</li>
            <li>I have medium-roundish lips, so I ordered the Large Round one; and received a second one ( smaller one) for free with my purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a little bit of playing with the product and getting used to it, I can have full pouty lips whenever I want.</li>
            <li>I love my new secret cosmetic tool</li>
            <li>This is a major upgrade for me!</li>
            <li>I have small lips and mouth and it doesn&#x27;t even fit over my lips.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and light weight</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll can suck on a small cup for free at home.</li>
            <li>Just be careful not to do it too much!</li>
            <li>and then my lips returned to their normal size, but they were red.</li>
            <li>A few days later it arrived in a cute packaging and a second Lip Enhancer as a gift!</li>
            <li>Did exactly what I expected it to do.</li>
            <li>not to sure if I order te right size, because this is small and my mouth&#x27;s small too.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product but after a while I realized several people were using this product to mimic other ethnical feature that were not white</li>
            <li>i was a bit scared to try this product at first but after following them on Instagram for a long time i decided to try it.</li>
            <li>Every time you use it, you are flushing fluids and nutrients through that delicate tissue, and the more you flush, the longer those channels will remain open and receptive to plumping and tissue building.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last long at first</li>
            <li>really works but only last an hour.</li>
            <li>Ordered the large round and received the small oval FOR FREE!</li>
            <li>This is fun for the short term, but regular use (2-3 times a day) will give you long term results that are semi-permanent.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>the results dont last very long as first</li>
            <li>and it makes it impossible for my top lip to get full without my mouth bruising.</li>
            <li>It does what it promised, the only bad thing is that for me it only las an hour at the most, but i still love it.</li>
            <li>I have relatively full lips for their size, but I&#x27;ve always been looking for a little extra &#x27;oomph&#x27; and fullness.</li>
            <li>so I bought the small oval, but the large round actually works a lot better for me.</li>
            <li>I have nothing against the seller, she was generous enough to send me the extra large round, but speaking in all honesty, this product isn&#x27;t worth the price tag as the results do not last.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Fullips, especially for us ladies of a certain age with slightly thinner lips.</li>
            <li>A couple times where I used them wrong and a hickey mark (my fault) but otherwise amazing product c:</li>
            <li>It clearly states that it can last for hours</li>
            <li>And I tried manyyyy times, three days straight, holding it for long periods of time, different ways etc.</li>
            <li>I only got a line around my mouth the first time, because of leaving it on too long and bursting some tiny blood vessels.  </li>
            <li>So it definitely made my lips larger initially because my family asked me if I got punched in my face because my lips look really swollen.</li>
            <li>I will try to update with a video of how I use mine in the near future!</li>
            <li>barely works.</li>
            <li>It does bruise, so be careful not to have too much suction</li>
            <li>As far as how long it lasts, it does really depend on how often and how long you use it.</li>
            <li>Results look natural and you&#x27;re in control of how big you&#x27;d like to go.</li>
            <li>I can definitely tell a difference,and the look is natural, not &amp;#34;ducklips&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>While it does make your lips full, the results are minimal and last only a short time</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this, but I was pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep at it, but it&#x27;s frustrating to not be able to have it work.</li>
            <li>This product was way to expensive for what it is, although the packaging and customer service is nice, and you get 2 for 1.  </li>
            <li>BUT I do feel they go down pretty faster than I thought.</li>
            <li>Technically these work, but unless you want to run to the bathroom every hour to re-plump, it&#x27;s not super exciting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally I like to over do my lips where they look kinda ridiculous, like I just got a fresh injection of juvederm (not the look I want in public) because by the time I&#x27;m ready to go out</li>
            <li>The large round actually feels too small for my lips and easily causes bruising (4 stars ), but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so exciting to see the difference in your lips and do a little everyday to see it does last a little longer the more you do it.</li>
            <li>… let&#x27;s say you can look pretty wild if you go overboard.</li>
            <li>they replied to me very fast within a few mins .</li>
            <li>This product barely did anything for me, I felt like my lips looked the same.</li>
            <li>I saw results in the first few minutes of trying.  </li>
            <li>I use the large round in the morning with my face routine.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASEPLEASEPLEASE be careful with how much pressure you apply when starting out with these.</li>
            <li>Left a little bruising the first time I used it but</li>
            <li>Too much can cause a slight bruising.</li>
            <li>I am most fond of the small round.  </li>
            <li>At first I tried out the big round cup.</li>
            <li>I have full (not big) lips, and leave the little &amp;#34;machine&amp;#34; on my lips for about 5-10 minutes, which seems like a lot, but it&#x27;s really not.</li>
            <li>I ended up ordering the large round after speaking to Linda, the founder.</li>
            <li>so I ordered the large round</li>
            <li>For the ones who get both of there lips into the large round one.</li>
            <li>I ordered the large round but was given a medium oval as a gift-</li>
            <li>I am using the large round</li>
            <li>but I went with the large round.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for almost a year now, ( the medium and the large round) and o have been doing it correctly</li>
            <li>The large round is too big for me</li>
            <li>This Large Round fullips is way too big for my mouth.</li>
            <li>I also got a complimentary small oval, as I ordered the large round!</li>
            <li>I usually have to sit down with my large round fullips enhancer for several minutes to get my lips nice and round.</li>

            <li> The costumer service is amazing, if the size isn&#x27;t working for you  </li>
            <li> This product works amazingly well at enhancing the pouty/round appearance of my lips without leaving any marks.</li>
            <li> It is amazing</li>
            <li> These are amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing dont have to get surgery.</li>

            <li> But this product is really amazing</li>
            <li> Also customer service is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> These make my lips look amazing.</li>
            <li> but once I did the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> Customer service is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> These lip enhancers are nice</li>
            <li> Honestly, it works sometimes and doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> nice packaging and comes with instructions</li>
            <li> What a nice item&lt;br /&gt;Am</li>
            <li> so thankful for her for the nice gift</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t liked.</li>
            <li> Amazing customer service, extremely fast shipping/communication, and awesome product.</li>
            <li> Cannot believe how effective this is.</li>
            <li> I think I will just stick to Juvederm, to be honest.</li>
            <li> i bought all the sizes and the seller is so kind and helpfull</li>
            <li> Not as effective as I thought.</li>
            <li> There has to be a way to use these effectively, without having them bruise my lips or just not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was in a beautiful package and full instructions.</li>
            <li> I honestly think it just takes some getting used to for you and your body</li>
            <li> Does the job, I just honestly don&#x27;t feel like sucking on it every hour.</li>
            <li> I do it whenever I feel just to kind of &amp;#34;train&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t too happy with the actual plumping enhancer, but the sell was so wonderful they deserve 5 stars anyway.</li>
            <li> For me, these enhancers are great for special occasions.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad so many people got great result though :)</li>
            <li> It works and the owner is very sweet!</li>
            <li> I end up with very full lips!  </li>
            <li> and I received 2, one for free which made me so happy because ordering I wasn&#x27;t sure which size to get</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because it came very quickly, made of good quality plastic and the packing</li>
            <li> The results lasted a couple of hours, but were very easy to touch up.  </li>
            <li> It makes my lips even more sexy!</li>
            <li> Love this company, love this product!</li>
            <li> I just got mine yesterday, but I have to say, so far, this is an excellent product!  </li>
            <li> I ALWAYS get asked if I get injections or how nice my lips are :)</li>
            <li> Wow, what a great company!</li>
            <li> and i just thought i should give it a try they work so good and make my lips looks nice and full</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a HUGE online shopper, and I can safely attest that Ms. Gomez (the founder and head of this excellent enterprise) is awesome beyond words, better than any other retailer with whom I&#x27;ve ever done business.  </li>
            <li> Easy, it works and you do get results!</li>
            <li> Over-all, it&#x27;s a fantastic product and unless you&#x27;re willing to commit to lip injections this is a great alternative! :)</li>
            <li> Worked great, did exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> The Fullips founder is really running her business in an efficient, beautiful manner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had good sized, full lips</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and I strongly recommend these to anyone looking to enhance their lips.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase and the help that I received from Brooklyn, she even threw in the medium size enhancer for free:)</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly and in nice packaging.</li>
            <li> It seems practice makes perfect really rings true with this product..</li>
            <li> The owner/founder Linda is SUPER SWEET!!!</li>
            <li> When I asked about the bonus size that comes with the purchase, she told me I could choose what gift size I wanted and to note it in the &amp;#34;notes/additional information&amp;#34; section on the order form which was a huge relief to me!</li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s works better for me.  </li>
            <li> You just look better.</li>
            <li> I may still be getting used to using them but they&#x27;re just okay.  </li>
            <li> I love it already .</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t sure on what size to get</li>
            <li> Honestly love them.</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow instructions</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> just okay.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m giggling as I think of what I&#x27;m going to say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this plumper</li>
            <li> Plus after all the warnings about doing this type of lip plumping in my opinion injectables done by a Doctor are a better option.</li>
            <li> I find that the results last around 3 hours for me, however it&#x27;s perfect size to put in your make-up and take on the go.</li>
            <li> Love Fullips.</li>
            <li> It does work but it lasts for an hour at most...</li>
            <li> I tried the product numerous times and followed directions perfectly.</li>
            <li> I really love them and use them frecuently.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works better once you lips are moisturized.</li>
            <li> Yes, yes, and more yes.</li>
            <li> Obviously the results are temporary, but isn&#x27;t that the best part?</li>
            <li> Actually a better description would be the plastic stacking cups children use .  </li>
            <li> Creative idea though .</li>
            <li> and I got a bonus one for free!</li>
            <li> Packaging is adorable.</li>
            <li> This lasts about 40 minutes to an hour at the most and I think how hydrated you are makes a difference.</li>
            <li> The more time I spend the longer it lasts.</li>
            <li> Linda is simply the best  and the nicest person I have ever dealt with on line.  </li>
            <li> and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get any bruising or redness that lasts more than a minute</li>
            <li> Wonderful seller, would definitely do business anytime!!</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> However, after using this many times I am just not seeing the results I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li> which is what I want to plump most) - when I use this it plumps mostly just my lower lip.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> but I am overall very impressed with this product!</li>
            <li> Ive seen videos od people that say it takes more than 20 minutes</li>
            <li> You can always pop onto the bathroom and fullen them!! :)</li>
            <li> Then wait about 10 minutes to make sure they don&#x27;t over swell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely in love with my products.</li>
            <li> this is magic i love it</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Recommended:)</li>
            <li> I have nothing but glowing things to say :)</li>
            <li> but they say the more you use it, in a sense you train your lips</li>
            <li> All are awesome and work different parts of your lips.</li>
            <li> I espescially love the &amp;#34;baby doll lip&amp;#34</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love the way my lips look.  </li>
            <li> So, it did bruise the top part of my lip, but, that doesn&#x27;t stop me from using it.</li>
            <li> but they also gave me one for free!</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Perhaps better videos would help?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for about an hour.</li>
            <li> I love how my lips look, even if it is just temporary.</li>
            <li> and you have to keep sucking and sucking and it bruises the top of your lip and bottom</li>
            <li> Should have known better though</li>
            <li> Linda, job well done:)</li>
            <li> More blood flow to the lips encourages faster cell rejuvenation and production.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it..</li>
            <li> It works like you just got lip injections :)</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> Does not plump top and bottom evenly.  </li>
            <li> They all love it too.</li>
            <li> I could not be more stoked on this.</li>
            <li> Such a great invention!!!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product took me a couple trys to get the hang of it</li>
            <li> but once I did I fell in love</li>
            <li> Oh yes this is the product to have for making those lips more plump and sexy.</li>
            <li> I guess it would be better suited for pictures.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> I make sure I put some lip balm on before I use it as well.</li>
            <li> I let it work its magic while I am applying my eye and face makeup.</li>
            <li> I love this lip enhancer because it gives me a sexy pout that lasts for hours, and I don&#x27;t have to risk looking like a fish by getting lip augmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> OK, so I literally bought these yesterday</li>
            <li> and I got to say I love love love what is does.</li>
            <li> Also love how they send you 2</li>
            <li> but It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> It came with a lovely personalized note.</li>
            <li> Make sure you watch the how to videos on the website.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast,packaging was too cute and most of all it works!</li>
            <li> But I would mostly recommend just your natural beautiful lips.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t find an easier, more reasonably priced and effective lip enhancer!</li>
            <li> Pretty cool, works better then any lip plumping gloss.&lt;br /&gt;also great customer service.</li>
            <li> and it also came super FAST!!!!!</li>
            <li> and I was so excited to get these today!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to use these on Thanksgiving before seeing my family!</li>

            <li> So excited!</li>
            <li> Shipped VERY fast and arrived very quickly!!</li>
            <li> Dry worked best for me.</li>
            <li> When I finally felt like my lips were looking good, my man laughed and called me &amp;#34;blue lips&amp;#34; because of all the bruising.</li>
            <li> Product came quickly though in the mail with detailed instructions in very cute packaging.</li>
            <li> I would be fine with it if the result lasted more than a minute or 2.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, best beauty product I have purchased IN A LONG TIME!!!</li>
            <li> So I love that I received a medium oval with my order for free.  </li>
            <li> A lot of people use it for \\&quot;spot targeting\\&quot;, but I find it is the perfect size to give me the center fullness/</li>
            <li> and cover my whole mouth even part on my superior skin.</li>
            <li> Wow, I LOVE these!!</li>
            <li> Sweet owner!</li>
            <li> Gave the other one as a gift and they weren&#x27;t impressed with it either.</li>
            <li> and I have the full lips I&#x27;ve always wanted with out surgery!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed my product every day with a smile!</li>
            <li> but overall loved it!</li>
            <li> These enhancers create full, natural-looking lips, as promised and my lip lines are disappearing!  </li>
            <li> You get what you want, full lips!</li>
            <li> Go really easy and follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> They work with suction that is painless and easy, unlike the glosses and creams I have tried before.</li>
            <li> The shipping was really fast and the packaging is really nice, and I love that it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Iys easy to use, its customizable and by that</li>
            <li> An easy, painless, not invasive way to achieve plumper lips.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re quite easy to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend you watch the tutorial videos as well.</li>
            <li> It is better than those special lip glosses.</li>
            <li> Just right!  :)</li>
            <li> I have full lips to begin with but wanted to see what I would look like with a bit more fullness and fullips</li>
            <li> My lips looked full and fabulous!</li>
            <li> The SELLER, the owner herself is an absolute doll- she wrote to me personally to explain which one I should order when I wasn&#x27;t sure what would be best.</li>
            <li> My lips are full and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> they will have gone down a bit to the perfect size that looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband loves my new look and I feel much more confident!</li>
            <li> Which is just fine.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions and you should be fine.</li>
            <li> At first I was hesitant and on top of that I wasn&#x27;t sure what size to order.</li>
            <li> but i got my perfect volume in less than 5.</li>
            <li> It is fairly comfortable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work  fine</li>
            <li> The shipping was also incredibly fast and the packaging is adorable!</li>
            <li> It is very fun and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I received a free one and the packaging is super cute.</li>
            <li> The quality of the plastic is good but the idea is just not realistic or effective</li>
            <li> I feel like the customer service is on the ball with this product, and that is a huge point for me.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> ( I saw another one that had a plunger and was huge).</li>
            <li> When I get it to work my lips are too huge.</li>
            <li> I got a huge difference.</li>
            <li> but it made my lips huge</li>
            <li> Again not the fault of the product on piercing free lips.</li>
            <li> But the results are great if done properly</li>
            <li> OK, I ordered this product just for the fun of it.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the free gift included.</li>
            <li> they included a free am all oval fullips enhancer.</li>
            <li> I was looking to have fun with this and plump them up some more for going out/selfies</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit mouth too well</li>
            <li> Who knew something so cheap would work like a charm?</li>
            <li> Came with free gift (Medium Oval).</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t fit my lips in it.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic and does everything it says it does.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was also really fast and the packaging is really nice.</li>
            <li> , so happy I finally purchased!</li>
            <li> But the lip plumping usually last for about 40-50 minutes for me but the results are great with out the needle.</li>
            <li> The seller was extra nice and gave me an extra lip enhancer in another size, that was awesome!</li>
            <li> The big one gives my lips alot of fullness there great</li>
            <li> maybe it was free</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is amazing to me that this product costs as much as a lip-plumping gloss (that won&#x27;t work anyway)</li>
            <li> They are important.</li>
            <li> I got an extra one in the mail which was great because I ordered it as a gift</li>
            <li> and my lips look fabulous once I&#x27;m finished with the suction</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the results, from what I saw on Instagram to what I got after use wasn&#x27;t worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but effects don&#x27;t last me more than an hour, if at all an hour.</li>
            <li> and the product works very well to plump your lips perfectly when correctly following instructions...</li>
            <li> Well I sure found the right</li>
            <li> It works great, gets the job done within minutes, extremely friendly service, just wish they would last fuller longer</li>
            <li> This takes practice and you really have to &amp;#34;train your lips&amp;#34;!!!</li>
            <li> The seller is very kind and included instructions and her personal email in case i had questions.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend - this is the real deal &amp; you don&#x27;t have to buy more every month or 3 months or year or EVER!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this seller and this amazing product</li>
            <li> Super fast and personalized, courteous response.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s if you are actually able to it to work in the first place.  </li>
            <li> This is a fun product, try it out!</li>
            <li> Great for selfies not for long wear</li>
            <li> Great product as long as you follow the directions.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was deciding on getting lip injections but after seeing so many botched lips, I wanted to test it out first.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this product...</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> so glad i found this first</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, easy directions, and it works!</li>
            <li> Loving my new fullips lip enhancers.</li>
            <li> , I did it clean and all of the ways to do it.  </li>
            <li> voila, I now have amazing full lips that last most of the day.</li>
            <li> This product draws your blood to your lips thusly naturally plumping them while adding more color!</li>
            <li> So far the results are phenomenal!</li>
            <li> but if the large doesn&#x27;t work I&#x27;m sure the others won&#x27;t either.</li>
            <li> If these haven&#x27;t worked for you, you aren&#x27;t doing it right!</li>
            <li> Super fun!</li>
            <li> I bought full lips to use for those special evening</li>
            <li> Ladies, if you really want full plump lips temporarily, you&#x27;d do better with a lip liner and/or lip injections.</li>
            <li> so much &amp;#60;3 truely satisfied.</li>
            <li> That disappeared within 48 hours and now I&#x27;ve found the sweet spot.  </li>
            <li> I already have full lips.</li>
            <li> love my Fullips, and would highly recommend...between the customer service and product, 10 stars!</li>
            <li> full lips makes us all Kardashians.</li>
            <li> Overall a good investment.</li>
            <li> I have reasonably full lips now</li>
            <li> I have full lips to begin with</li>
            <li> Taking it slow, this product is awesome!</li>
            <li> Comes with a sweet handwritten card from the founder.</li>
            <li> I love the results this really works</li>
            <li> Love this product it really works.</li>
            <li> :) It really does work well, and does not hurt at all.</li>
            <li> but it was cool.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> Its good but doesnt last and</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to, but is very easy to use and results come in a matter of seconds!!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t fit my mouth right at all</li>
            <li> They send me a gift with my purchase and that was a plus and a super cool surprise.</li>
            <li> You can tell she really does care about her customers and wants you to love her product!</li>
            <li> Lol it&#x27;s cool but not worth</li>
            <li> The large is about right but using a shot glass has proven to be better.</li>
            <li> if I&#x27;m lucky?</li>
            <li> The item came really quick.</li>
            <li> Save your money, unless a super fleeting, quick fix is what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> but results fade too quickly.</li>
            <li> But then goes away quick.</li>
            <li> Company was awesome enough to ship this asap and send two different sizes of the device.</li>
            <li> New full lips in seconds, my husband loves them and was more shock that I was.</li>
            <li> Okay, okay, yes it&#x27;s a little bit of money to make your lips fuller, but it&#x27;s better than spending 600$ on collagen injections and have it be permanent, and regret it if you don&#x27;t like the way it looks.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much Linda!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get the nice full lips without having the red irritation around my mouth</li>
            <li> I was also sent the oval one as a free gift, which was awesome, and I think I like that one better than the larger one  because I really only need volume on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> They are made very well and shipped out very quickly.</li>
            <li> I got two of my friends who have smaller lips to try it out and they absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well!  </li>
            <li> It really works!!</li>
            <li> If you want bigger lips your better off sucking on a pill bottle/shot glass!</li>
            <li> This really works!!</li>
            <li> it really Works!!</li>
            <li> but it actually worked better than the medium!</li>
            <li> I would recommend when you first test it out to do it  after work or another time when you know you wont have to see anyone important right after, in case you accidentally bruise your lips.</li>
            <li> My item was shipped very quickly, along with a second fullips free!</li>
            <li> i ordered large but got medium for free as well ,..</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s a buy one get one free, I got both sizes medium and large together.</li>
            <li> The smaller one I think is a great because it could be used to plump up the center a bit more.</li>
            <li> Her customer service skills are amazing and after speaking to her personally, I was no longer hesitant to order.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this is getting such amazing reviews?</li>
            <li> By the time I finish the rest of my face, my lips are plumped, hydrated, smooth, and ready for lipstick application.</li>
            <li> Again fun product and go for it if you want to have a bit of fun.</li>
            <li> We had so much fun experimenting with both sizes</li>
            <li> , SO worth the inexpensive cost.</li>
            <li> I had fun playing with this.  </li>
            <li> The effect is fun and temporary.  </li>
            <li> The value is so worth it.</li>
            <li> , I thought this would be fun to try.  </li>
            <li> she really goes Above &amp; Beyond to make sure you are completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s temporary but soo worth it</li>
            <li> Completely worth every penny..</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will do, and that is give you full, luscious lips.</li>
            <li> These things are soooo fun.</li>
            <li> Fun thing to play with once in a while</li>
            <li> but it deffently is worth it</li>
            <li> This product is fun.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Save up for that, it&#x27;s way worth it.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The enhancer comes in a mesh red drawstring baggie along with instructions that are underlined with the most important things.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long (which it states, \\&quot;temporary\\&quot;) -- but WOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW to the seriously AMAZING customer service by this seller!!</li>
            <li> Thank you sooooo much Linda for inventing this much needed beauty tool!!!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Thanks for a fun harmless lip plumper!</li>
            <li> Works very well and fun to use!</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not using it right</li>
            <li> She is doing everything right.</li>
            <li> I like it, it takes time to get used to it and find right way to use.</li>
            <li> Works right when you use it.</li>
            <li> My lips don&#x27;t look fuller, even though I&#x27;m using the cups the right way.</li>
            <li> so right out of the box</li>
            <li> If you do it right then it&#x27;ll work</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m not doing it right, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I Got The Right Size</li>
            <li> I think the most important thing with this product is making sure you are drinking enough water because it works by drawing the fluid in your lips forward to plump then.&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li> I have to say it&#x27;s pretty fun.</li>
            <li> but after a few minutes my lips swelled up so much I honestly got scared!</li>
            <li> Works perfectlyy for someone who wants full lips without  injections.</li>
            <li> My lips are already full but this really puffs them up.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast, personalized note and a sweet gesture was inside the package.  </li>
            <li> the small oval works great when I use it vertically.  </li>
            <li> The package came with full instructions and arrived so much sooner than I thought</li>
            <li> I bought the large one because my lips are already pretty full.</li>
            <li> for the shapes themselves, I am fuller-lipped naturally and found the large circle to be of more use.</li>
            <li> I got the large round and it worked great</li>
            <li> These little red thingies are wonderful.</li>
            <li> First of all, the packaging was so professional and nice with an added bonus inside, it came with very clear instructions as well.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast</li>
            <li> I received my Fullips super fast after ordering and immediately tore into my package.  </li>
            <li> The seller was super nice and included a handwritten note and her personal information to contact her and very clear instructions.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommended thus product for anyone who wants full lips!</li>
            <li> but I love how my lips look right after with some red lipstick!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use them again on my lunch break and I&#x27;m good for the second half of my day :)</li>
            <li> I love the enhancers I originally ordered the large round and got a medium oval for free.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to do and doesn&#x27;t take long at all.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to do a quick 30 second touch up in the car or restroom.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the large round and recieved the medium oval for free which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> The item arrived two days earlier than estimated, the cute red bags and cards with the founders hand written name and hearts around important tips makes it feel like a special gift from a friend.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> The best product for thin lips!</li>
            <li> I apply vaseline on my lips first and then.  </li>
            <li> My results lasted for about 2 hours my first try</li>
            <li> Was given an extra one for free!</li>
            <li> this product really does work and is well worth the money .</li>
            <li> These really do work!</li>
            <li> so maybe it works better for younger people.  </li>
            <li> It really does work!  </li>
            <li> I use buxom gloss sometimes and it most definitely makes a more obvious difference.</li>
            <li> I was interested and hesitant to try this product, but was really curious and I am not a filler or plastic surgery kind of girl.</li>
            <li> THEY REALLY WORK!</li>
            <li> Also, it says that the more you use it, the longer it will start lasting.</li>
            <li> Really Does work!</li>
            <li> product came fast !</li>
            <li> I would NOT recomend this product to absolutely anyone!</li>
            <li> I also think they are tricky to use at first</li>
            <li> Maybe I need more practice because it only lasted about an hour for me.</li>
            <li> However many people will tell you that this last 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I feel pretty</li>
            <li> I only used moisture lip balm for healthy lips.</li>
            <li> My lips look bigger and sexy.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not doing it correctly or maybe it just works better on different people</li>
            <li> and I have pretty, plump lips for hours.</li>
            <li> Fullips also carries Lipgloss, Lipstick and lipsLiners in really pretty colors.</li>
            <li> She won&#x27;t need to get more injections again as this product brings the collagen back to the surface.</li>
            <li> sadly it didn&#x27;t get real good results.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> If you like that &amp;#34;Just had a hot make out session</li>
            <li> It does what it say , my tiny lips love it so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really does work and no issues yet!</li>
            <li> I had bruises on my lips the first time.</li>
            <li> Even when my lips are already pretty plumped</li>
            <li> It is delivered promptly and comes in a cute red bag with a card from the seller.</li>
            <li> BAM BIG SEXY LIPS</li>
            <li> so i will re do them in 3-4 hours like it suggests and see if they start to last longer as I use it more.</li>
            <li> did watch the informational video on how to use the fullips first...</li>
            <li> But, I will not say what the gift was, you must purchase this item yourself to see what it is ;).  </li>
            <li> So at first it didn&#x27;t give me results I wanted</li>
            <li> The enhancer really does work!</li>
            <li> If any of you ladies could give me some advice to make it last longer than 5-10 mins, please do tell! :)</li>
            <li> I first received this product</li>
            <li> The 2nd time using it, my results where 10x better.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my lips look only downside</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> but I purchased this first.</li>
            <li> It does work but it won&#x27;t last for more than 45 minutes</li>
            <li> This product really does work!</li>
            <li> I am buying this product again for my sister,, it really works!</li>
            <li> It comes in a cute red bag and the device in seperate plastic containers.</li>
            <li> Very helpful!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: does work, took me a good few times to learn how to use these babies but they are part of my makeup routine</li>
            <li> May be good for others, but I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my time or  money.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and all natural - Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought the large but they also included a small one which actually works great to get a pucker lips look!</li>
            <li> The large size is just so large!</li>
            <li> Many products are pure gimmicks, but Fullips definitely isn&#x27;t one of those products.</li>
            <li> That was really sweet and completely unexpected!</li>
            <li> so my lips go down after about an hour but still love it!</li>
            <li> I thought it was super nice to get personal note from the Owner of the company and extra lip enhancer.</li>
            <li> The Fullips really upped the game on suction lip plumping, and I&#x27;m super happy with my purchase!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and i pump them up pretty large</li>
            <li> This product came faster than expected, better than expected and the seller was just lovely!</li>
            <li> LOVE that I ordered the large round and also received the oval one for free.</li>
            <li> The small one is good for particular spots, the medium is good for individual lips and the round is good for both at the same time.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> OK sooo I have been wanting this to for so long and have done lots of research on this product and seller.</li>
            <li> They work very well, the first time I used it</li>
            <li> I first wake up before I put my makeup on and if I am going to an event I do it while I am prepping and getting ready.</li>
            <li> I have full lips naturally and read all the reviews and tips saying to get the large one</li>
            <li> Just need to start graddually, hold it for a little bit firstly and then U feel your own reaction.</li>
            <li> I already have full lips but just wanted a little more of a kick</li>
            <li> It feels so strange and we caught on real quick just how much suction to use.</li>
            <li> but I also received a small one which is a much better fit for me.</li>
            <li> This is epic and completely worthy of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I do strongly recommend it for those that are wanting bigger fuller lips and do not want to get lip injections.</li>
            <li> It does take a few attempts to get the right &amp;#34;plump-age&amp;#34; and technique, but very easy to use after.</li>
            <li> I already have large lips, but was looking for that trout pout without going in for injections or fillers.</li>
            <li> I contacted Linda to see if I can exchange the large for a medium</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even get it to stay on because it&#x27;s so large.</li>
            <li> I ordered large</li>
            <li> After a certain age, I just don&#x27;t have time for this.</li>
            <li> I got the large as a complementary one after ordering the medium oval</li>
            <li> But they looked pretty decent to me before all the brusing but the fullness lasted like 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> This simple little suction tool is a great concept.</li>
            <li> Great little tool to have in your purse for those last minute presentations!</li>
            <li> So far I actually like the medium oval a bit more than the round as it really helped to target the upper lip, but both were easy to use and provided surprising plumping action, even for a newbie.</li>
            <li> It took a few mintues to get used to, and my results were amazing but went away within 30 mins.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, nice presentation &amp; so thankful for received two: the round &amp; the oval.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week straight now and my lips stay plump for about 2-3 hours</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking to get plump lips fast or someone who is trying to deciding if they want to get fillers.</li>
            <li> you can actually be hands free, let the plumper do</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> FREE GIFT (extra fullip )!</li>
            <li> because I only ordered one and received another size for free.</li>
            <li> I did not get much plumping</li>
            <li> I really am bummed because i wanted prefect and plump lips.</li>
            <li> However, be gentle and follow instructions otherwise</li>
            <li> shipping was extremely fast</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Plumps my lips gently.</li>
            <li> Fast forward a couple of months</li>
            <li> they do give me fuller but very temporary lips.</li>
            <li> Absolute rubbish.</li>
            <li> It fits around my whole mouth enlarging both lips simultaneously.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t do much of anything.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t get much of a suction on these to see my lip puff up.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I recommend using the gloss because it&#x27;s a lip plumper and really helps with the results.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t cover my whole lip.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make much of a difference with my lips, followed instructions.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t do it every day, but the lip is much puffier.</li>
            <li> IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes lips smooth and plump.</li>
            <li> I really like the product.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> but it is VERY temporary .</li>
            <li> recommend to every girls who wants fullips:</li>
            <li> Still experimenting, fun experience so far.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate cause this really works.</li>
            <li> it came so fast and worked so well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who wants fuller lips</li>
            <li> Too much suction</li>
            <li> they came fast</li>
            <li> THANKS.</li>
            <li> It really works though.</li>
            <li> I was ready to try it.  </li>
            <li> My lips were much, much fuller.  </li>
            <li> Really dissapointed</li>
            <li> This lip plumping enhancer really works and lasts for hours.  </li>
            <li> it plumps my lips for real</li>
            <li> I was really contemplating getting lip injections</li>
            <li> It can even be too much, if you&#x27;re not careful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s whatever honestly, I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on it again.</li>
            <li> I have fairly thin lips and using this gave me a rich, plump look I had desired for so many years!</li>
            <li> and it was kind of uneven.</li>
            <li> The more frequent you use them the longer the fullness will last.</li>
            <li> Also my top lip is smaller than my bottom and wanted to see them evened out, which was easy to make happen using the complimentary small oval one.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter and she was SO excited to use them, but honestly she has only used them a few times because they do bruise your lips.  </li>
            <li> I used it with my home made sugar, cinnamon, and olive oil mixture applied with a stiff bristle toothbrush and the results were astounding.  </li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews for products, but the results this little plastic device gave to my lips was amazing</li>
            <li> It really works, however they sent an oval one for free and its too small, my lips don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> It works much more efficiently than other manual plumpers b/c</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m excited to keep using it and see how things go in the future!</li>
            <li> Since it works for so many other people, it might work for you too.</li>
            <li> nice, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but my lips don&#x27;t get any larger and the effect fades within half an hour to an hour for me at best.</li>
            <li> They WILL work, but you need to be patient at first and figure out how much pressure your sensitive lip tissues can take before bruising.</li>
            <li> My main interest in these was to plump my upper lip, and I get better results, and no bruise look by just sucking on my top lip without this &amp;#34;enhancer&amp;#34; (which is just a small plastic cup)</li>
            <li> She wrote me long detailed emails with helpful tips.</li>
            <li> I will post more in the near future to give a complete review</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing about 4 hours after my first run with it, and the effects are almost completely gone -  </li>
            <li> Linda was so sweet and writes personal messages on the instructions.</li>
            <li> It took a few practice runs to not give my chin a slight bruise, but after I figured the placement out, I can easily say I love it and am addictedd to it!</li>
            <li> I actually used it last night and when i woke up this am, my lips were still huge!</li>
            <li> THat being said I would totally recommend this for anyone who wants to have a bit of fun with your lips without the commitment of getting a botched lip job.</li>
            <li> received my Fullips in a cute red organza bag, with a hand-signed note and an extra Fullips!</li>
            <li> You will get the plumping for a short time once you start to use it, but the more you use it the longer it will last and the quicker your lips will respond.</li>
            <li> I tried 2 different sizes with many different variations on placement.  </li>
            <li> I just wanted to plump them even more, but this ended up making the outside of my lips red and that lasted longer than the plumping effect.</li>
            <li> They do what they are suppose to but only lasted not even 20 mins... super dissapointed, and yes I used them correctly</li>
            <li> so I use this mainly for photos and when im goin out.</li>
            <li> Sure enough I look in the mirror and the effects were totally gone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend theses if your not looking for anything permanent.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t super small, they&#x27;re just normal, but I&#x27;ve always wanted that filled out pout.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to enhance them a little bit more.</li>
            <li> does not mean it won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> I love this little product.</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t expect it to enlarge your lips any more than a little puffy and &amp;#34;just kissed&amp;#34; looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li> so far I use the large round the most.</li>
            <li> ;) I already have full lips, but I wanted that extra Cupid&#x27;s bow definition and a little more &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; factor and these totally deliver.</li>
            <li> Linda put her personal touches on the card by underling important things and gave her personal thanks and signature.</li>
            <li> The product was amazing, outdone my expectations, they definitely make the lips bigger and fuller with a lasting effect.</li>
            <li> (responsibly of course) ;)…..Oh and It looks like it could last forever…</li>
            <li> They sent me two shapes, and I find I&#x27;m using the oval shape more than the round.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to simulate an actual injection, but it plumps the shrinkage and lines to create a full lip in a natural way.  </li>
            <li> Before buying this product, I used a shot glass to achieve pretty much the same thing.</li>
            <li> A total lip plumper junkie, I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything on the market besides getting injections to plump my lips.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think its healthy to be doing this to your lips all the time, but a few times every now</li>
            <li> I figured my mouth was normal size, but I guess not.</li>
            <li> Long gone are the days where I took an ungodly amount of time to pile heaps of lip product to make them look more symmetrical only to have it wear or rub off in a couple hours.</li>
            <li> I am having lots of fun experimenting with the different shapes and techniques, but no matter how I do it</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have attached picture of how my lips are normally</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have attached picture of how my lips are normally</li>
            <li> I did watch a few videos to make sure I was doing it correctly.</li>
            <li> Especially if you&#x27;re a busy mom of three young ones, go to work and school full time.</li>
            <li> This is totally worth it if you want something quick for a picture or something that&#x27;ll last less then an hour because this is very temporary.</li>
            <li> I love these little things (you receive two when you buy them!)</li>
            <li> The founder of the company gave very clear directions on the videos and the included instructions on how to use the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very surprised with the results.</li>
            <li> It will not be as effective as lip fillers as it does go down pretty soon after you use it, usually an hour more or less.</li>
            <li> It really works and keeps your lips full for about a hour or alittle less</li>
            <li> but after numerous lip piercings in my teenage years my bottom lip was always a bit bigger than my top lip, which is why I asked for the &amp;#34;small oval&amp;#34; for my gift size.</li>
            <li> I will try to update with a video of how I use mine in the near future!ly recommend...between the customer service and product, 10 stars!</li>
            <li> First the &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; one isn&#x27;t very big at all</li>
            <li> but I got a small oval lip enhancer as a gift and it works much better</li>
            <li> Not worth the price, even if they were free.</li>
            <li> she even sent me the small one for free!</li>
            <li> Once you place the cup (for lack of a better word) over the lip area, take small sips of air till suction is acquired.</li>
            <li> Makes your lips look naturally luscious!  </li>
            <li> I wish I could love this product, I like how it instantly makes my lips bigger and fuller, but it is only temporary and lasts for maybe an hour.</li>
            <li> And then I ended up with the small oval as a free gift with my order!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Seriously, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Linda and</li>
            <li> I bought the large and received the small for free.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the whole reason I purchased the full round.  </li>
            <li> I was also surprised with an additional small plumper for free!</li>
            <li> They really do work but after 30 mins, they go back to normal.</li>
            <li> I use the large one-but for those with a smaller lip the small ones might work better.</li>
            <li> Oh, and btw, if you have an over producing saliva gland (like myself) get ready for a wet and wild ride ;)</li>
            <li> Other than that my lips are full 😚😗😙</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast, and I have been using it everyday.</li>
            <li> I naturally have full lips but was curious to see what all the hype was about !</li>
            <li> Linda (the seller of this product) sent an extra gift along with my large plumping enhancer.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first and wasn&#x27;t getting it right the first time but kept practicing and now see all the benefits to getting plump full lips that last.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t suck too hard or keep on your lips more than 12-15 seconds</li>
            <li> i was expecting be more soft, is really hard plastic, and make my lips so sore.  </li>
            <li> She said that if she uses them more often they will probably get more used to it and they should quit bruising her lips so bad.</li>
            <li> the ore frequent i do it.</li>
            <li> The preasure should be enough for you to feel it but not so much it hurts.</li>
            <li> They really work, it last up 3-6 hours.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve still only gotten minimal results (nothing more than what a regular lip plumper gloss hasn&#x27;t given me) that have lasted maybe 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> But have to use it frequently.</li>
            <li> I just go gentle and not to the point where it looks gross.</li>
            <li> plus I&#x27;m old like 60.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely sold..</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I am very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Everybody say they received a second piece as a gift, which I didn&#x27;t and was really upset, because this size didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> When I initially used this item,the results that you see in the picture had me really happy &amp; I was expecting it to last at least 2 hours,OMG this did not even last 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> old son noticed the difference &amp;#34;Mom</li>
            <li> It really gives you that big lip!</li>
            <li> shipping was fast and I even got a extra plumper!</li>
            <li> I got this last week, and it bruised the hell out of my mouth and really didn&#x27;t do anything to my lips.</li>
            <li> But doesn&#x27;t last for more then a few minutes.</li>
            <li> but the effects do not last more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li> The effect on my lips just last for a few minutes but during that time i look sooo sexy.</li>
            <li> So if you have bigger lips gey the round one :)</li>
            <li> Take it slow and If you do bruise yourself, it went away within a day - enjoy!</li>
            <li> Now, i can get very full lips in less than a minute, and i think that over time, they get larger as well, and rounder looking.</li>
            <li> It took a bit of trial and error to get the suction just right, which left my mouth area a bit red, but I think that&#x27;s just beginner messiness.</li>
            <li> This product by far has done the best job in naturally plumping my lips without doing something crazy like using active bee venom.</li>
            <li> They are small and easy to take with you in your purse,</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re willing to shell out $20 to make your lips a little bigger then yes its worth it.</li>
            <li> I have medium-roundish lips, so I ordered the Large Round one; and received a second one ( smaller one) for free with my purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a little bit of playing with the product and getting used to it, I can have full pouty lips whenever I want.</li>
            <li> I love my new secret cosmetic tool</li>
            <li> This is a major upgrade for me!</li>
            <li> I have small lips and mouth and it doesn&#x27;t even fit over my lips.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and light weight</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll can suck on a small cup for free at home.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to do it too much!</li>
            <li> and then my lips returned to their normal size, but they were red.</li>
            <li> A few days later it arrived in a cute packaging and a second Lip Enhancer as a gift!</li>
            <li> Did exactly what I expected it to do.</li>
            <li> not to sure if I order te right size, because this is small and my mouth&#x27;s small too.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product but after a while I realized several people were using this product to mimic other ethnical feature that were not white</li>
            <li> i was a bit scared to try this product at first but after following them on Instagram for a long time i decided to try it.</li>
            <li> Every time you use it, you are flushing fluids and nutrients through that delicate tissue, and the more you flush, the longer those channels will remain open and receptive to plumping and tissue building.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long at first</li>
            <li> really works but only last an hour.</li>
            <li> Ordered the large round and received the small oval FOR FREE!</li>
            <li> This is fun for the short term, but regular use (2-3 times a day) will give you long term results that are semi-permanent.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> the results dont last very long as first</li>
            <li> and it makes it impossible for my top lip to get full without my mouth bruising.</li>
            <li> It does what it promised, the only bad thing is that for me it only las an hour at the most, but i still love it.</li>
            <li> I have relatively full lips for their size, but I&#x27;ve always been looking for a little extra &#x27;oomph&#x27; and fullness.</li>
            <li> so I bought the small oval, but the large round actually works a lot better for me.</li>
            <li> I have nothing against the seller, she was generous enough to send me the extra large round, but speaking in all honesty, this product isn&#x27;t worth the price tag as the results do not last.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Fullips, especially for us ladies of a certain age with slightly thinner lips.</li>
            <li> A couple times where I used them wrong and a hickey mark (my fault) but otherwise amazing product c:</li>
            <li> It clearly states that it can last for hours</li>
            <li> And I tried manyyyy times, three days straight, holding it for long periods of time, different ways etc.</li>
            <li> I only got a line around my mouth the first time, because of leaving it on too long and bursting some tiny blood vessels.  </li>
            <li> So it definitely made my lips larger initially because my family asked me if I got punched in my face because my lips look really swollen.</li>
            <li> I will try to update with a video of how I use mine in the near future!</li>
            <li> barely works.</li>
            <li> It does bruise, so be careful not to have too much suction</li>
            <li> As far as how long it lasts, it does really depend on how often and how long you use it.</li>
            <li> Results look natural and you&#x27;re in control of how big you&#x27;d like to go.</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell a difference,and the look is natural, not &amp;#34;ducklips&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> While it does make your lips full, the results are minimal and last only a short time</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this, but I was pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep at it, but it&#x27;s frustrating to not be able to have it work.</li>
            <li> This product was way to expensive for what it is, although the packaging and customer service is nice, and you get 2 for 1.  </li>
            <li> BUT I do feel they go down pretty faster than I thought.</li>
            <li> Technically these work, but unless you want to run to the bathroom every hour to re-plump, it&#x27;s not super exciting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally I like to over do my lips where they look kinda ridiculous, like I just got a fresh injection of juvederm (not the look I want in public) because by the time I&#x27;m ready to go out</li>
            <li> The large round actually feels too small for my lips and easily causes bruising (4 stars ), but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so exciting to see the difference in your lips and do a little everyday to see it does last a little longer the more you do it.</li>
            <li> … let&#x27;s say you can look pretty wild if you go overboard.</li>
            <li> they replied to me very fast within a few mins .</li>
            <li> This product barely did anything for me, I felt like my lips looked the same.</li>
            <li> I saw results in the first few minutes of trying.  </li>
            <li> I use the large round in the morning with my face routine.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASEPLEASEPLEASE be careful with how much pressure you apply when starting out with these.</li>
            <li> Left a little bruising the first time I used it but</li>
            <li> Too much can cause a slight bruising.</li>
            <li> I am most fond of the small round.  </li>
            <li> At first I tried out the big round cup.</li>
            <li> I have full (not big) lips, and leave the little &amp;#34;machine&amp;#34; on my lips for about 5-10 minutes, which seems like a lot, but it&#x27;s really not.</li>
            <li> I ended up ordering the large round after speaking to Linda, the founder.</li>
            <li> so I ordered the large round</li>
            <li> For the ones who get both of there lips into the large round one.</li>
            <li> I ordered the large round but was given a medium oval as a gift-</li>
            <li> I am using the large round</li>
            <li> but I went with the large round.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for almost a year now, ( the medium and the large round) and o have been doing it correctly</li>
            <li> The large round is too big for me</li>
            <li> This Large Round fullips is way too big for my mouth.</li>
            <li> I also got a complimentary small oval, as I ordered the large round!</li>
            <li> I usually have to sit down with my large round fullips enhancer for several minutes to get my lips nice and round.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to warn people, it is LARGE, so if you suspect at all that your mouth might be on the smaller side, just go with the Medium Oval or Small Oval.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought I had a big mouth but apparently not.</li>
            <li> My friend and I sat down and read the instructions clearly and set out on a mission to plump these lips!</li>
            <li> I recommend if you have had Restylane (I can&#x27;t speak about other fillers) that you start slowly, only a few seconds at a time and be very gentle.</li>
            <li> The only reason it&#x27;s not a 5 star is because it doesn&#x27;t last as long as it claims.</li>
            <li> but results dont last long enough.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long enough though.</li>
            <li> Only reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars is because the effect doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> now I use before applying a plumper and love how my lips look even if it&#x27;s just very temporary :(  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a bit disappointed it doesn&#x27;t last longer than 2 hours id like to go out and look good not just in my selfies you know..</li>
            <li> I got the large and the small.</li>
            <li> I received my Fullips large round in the mail today along with the sweetest handwritten note from the seller AND a bonus medium oval!</li>
            <li> looks like I received the small instead of the large.  </li>
            <li> In my case the large and small Fullips.</li>
            <li> The effect on me isn&#x27;t Kylie Jenner crazy big, but makes my lips look noticeably fuller and draws more attention to my lips - especially with lip balm or lip gloss on.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> (just doesn&#x27;t last as long....</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last necessarily as long as I&#x27;d like, but it&#x27;s so portable that touch ups are a breeze.</li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T LAST LONG AS I THOUGHT.</li>
            <li> it does not last long</li>
            <li> And then the plumping doesn&#x27;t last for long at all.</li>
            <li> Did bruise a lil but doesn&#x27;t last long..</li>
            <li> I followed instructions and it left my lips &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; aka swollen for maybe 20 minutes, but the tingling and strange feeling in my lips lasted 2 days.</li>
            <li> Obviously, this isn&#x27;t a long term thing, but it lasted a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> Does not last long.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a shame that it doesn&#x27;t last as long for me as it does for others.</li>
            <li> does not last long at all...</li>
            <li> If you have normal or thicker lips you should buy the round circle shape.</li>
            <li> It did plump my lips slightly, for a couple minutes, but it left a very noticeable dark (bruise?</li>
            <li> I received a small oval enhancer as a little added gift, which was so sweet, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend spending money on it.</li>
            <li> but it did not last very long.</li>
            <li> and then they will send you a random second one for free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using this product several different ways but not really convinced it works.  </li>
            <li> I kinda bought this as a novelty to see if it actually works, it doesn&#x27;t, complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> My natural lips are not that thin but very wrinkled &amp; Fullips helped stretch out the wrinkles and give my lips the appearance of being smoother.  </li>
            <li> I find myself using it only about twice a day, once during makeup application and the other time about 4 hours later</li>
            <li> you are considering this product, or have tried it with disappointing results, please consider this: This product is more than just temporary plumping.</li>
            <li> but really you should hold it to your lips for at least a minute or two in my oppinion</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job for however long you prefer, while you do the rest of your makeup.</li>
            <li> Customer service went above and beyond what is expected.</li>
            <li> Got the package earlier than expected and don&#x27;t go a day without using my lip enchancer</li>
            <li> The effects last for about an hour with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> The day before I received it I was curious and decided to try and get the same effect using the cap of my hairspray.</li>
            <li> My lips dont even stay &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> 20 minutes is about as long as it lasts.</li>
            <li> WARNING: don&#x27;t leave on too long or over</li>
            <li> so if you have a long night out you may need to redo it before reapplying your lipstick.</li>
            <li> it stay not that long maybe</li>
            <li> The large round adds overall fullness to both lips at the same time but the small oval targets areas that need a little extra oomph and spot treating, like my upper lip.</li>
            <li> It takes a minute or less and the effect last several hours.</li>
            <li> I really like the Small Oval though!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it will work for people with very thin lips, but for me already having full lips, the results were so instant!</li>
            <li> Only way I can see anyone being bruised, is if they created too tight of suction or left it on too long.</li>
            <li> I used the large round one to get overall fullness but used the small oval one to make the sides of my lips fuller.</li>
            <li> it takes several tries to get these things to plump your lips and the effects only last a few minutes</li>
            <li> I ordered a large round and she sent a few extras in return.</li>
            <li> I gave the other one to a friend and she said the same.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy the other styles as well.</li>
            <li> The other thing is that when I used this product, the skin around my lips get red and irritated.</li>
            <li> Also, the plumper doesn&#x27;t maintain its suction for very long on my lips - and I tried and tried and tried to make it stay</li>
            <li> To my disappointment it didn&#x27;t do much for me and what results it Did give me, faded fast.</li>
            <li> It says it may last only a few hours</li>
            <li> Use them every single time i go out</li>
            <li> I see myself using these every single day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy at first, but after a few times you will see the difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty shocked by the amount of positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I saw several videos on YouTube about the Lip Enhancer and was curious, so I ordered the big round one.</li>
            <li> Not as long as I expected</li>
            <li> These are a little hard to figure out at first, but once I got the hang of it, I became an addict.</li>
            <li> but it always comes loose.  </li>
            <li> I iced them and the swelling went down by the next morning.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have known about this a long time ago!!</li>
            <li> Purchased the large round and received a small oval as a gift.</li>
            <li> My before picture and my after picture is after using the large round and small oval.</li>
            <li> I bought the large round and also received the small oval.</li>
            <li> Take it little by little to get a very natural looking plump.</li>
            <li> It can even help to treat chronically dry lips!</li>
            <li> ever don&#x27;t even bother gave my lips black and blue</li>
            <li> use lips will turn black and blue and be bruised</li>
            <li> I emailed company asking for any tips after my first failed use, and to my surprise, Linda the owner of the company personally responded!</li>
            <li> BLACK AND BLUE.</li>
            <li> What little change I do see doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> It really works, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t last for too long.</li>
            <li> : If you have thin lips, I recommend you buy the large oval shape.</li>
            <li> This time I sucked a little bit longer (probably 5 x 30 seconds) but the only difference is that the area around my mouth is bruised.</li>
            <li> , the straw should be an inch long, put half the straw in your mouth while the other half is out of your mouth, put the large Fullips Enhancer to your lips and thru the straw suck in slowly and hold.</li>
            <li> The large round + small oval &#x3D; perfection for my lips!</li>
            <li> Now that the piercing has been removed im curious to see how well it works.</li>
            <li> For me I didn&#x27;t need to wet my lips.</li>
            <li> I received my order sooner than i expected</li>
            <li> Be careful when plumping your lips.....</li>
            <li> and I was careful after the 1st try).  </li>
            <li> It just works for few minutes ( 5- 10 min only )</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a real thing.</li>
            <li> It works as expected and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all to use.  </li>
            <li> I was curious to try this</li>
            <li> I tried it only 3 times for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I will definitly be reordering for my bridesmaids in the next few months.</li>
            <li> but it gave my severe dark purple bruising on my entire top lip :(</li>
            <li> Give it a try if you are curious.</li>
            <li> , however, a few minutes later my lips begin to deflate.</li>
            <li> does make your lips bigger for a few min</li>
            <li> and I used it everyday for 3 days just to see if it would last longer</li>
            <li> I really does work the only thing that I hate is if you use it too much your lips turn purple and bruised if it didn&#x27;t bruise my lips</li>
            <li> Very hard to get a decent suction.</li>
            <li> I ordered the large round and received the small round.</li>
            <li> Ordered a large round and received a small oval round with it.</li>
            <li> The edge of the cap was thin and not very comfortable, unlike the Fullips, I don&#x27;t know if it was too much suction</li>
            <li> Plus they turn purple, no matter how long or little you do it.</li>
            <li> You can just give yourself a little boost or you can turn your lips into Angelina Jolie&#x27;s depending on how long and how you use your enhancer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With other plumpers I have to use both hands to operate them.</li>
            <li> However, it did take some getting used to and can be slightly difficult to use for the first time.</li>
            <li> I usually use them while applying my eye make-up, they do leave a temporary red mark around your lips, but it goes aways in five minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other products, but was unimpressed with the shape and depth of the cup (you need a lot of depth for your lips to be pulled into to see a difference).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other products, but was unimpressed with the shape and depth of the cup (you need a lot of depth for your lips to be pulled into to see a difference).</li>
            <li> Awesome product, without having to get expensive and painful procedures!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not willing to spend $20 plus shipping to find out.</li>
            <li> Give it a try if you&#x27;ve explored all other options.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t lasted more than an hour:(</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s only &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; if you have really small lips.</li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> You also get a small lip brush to exfoliate lips and there was a handwritten note from Linda and her personal number from which you can text or call her.</li>
            <li> Just be really careful with over doing it!</li>
            <li> i have such small lips</li>
            <li> At first, I was a bit skeptical</li>
            <li> I bought these on a whim, and now they are going under the bathroom sink with my other impulse beauty buys.</li>
            <li> is that it only lasts for no more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I use the small oval occasionally if I feel like having my lips 100% on point.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had lip fillers in the past, and this gives the SAME look.  </li>
            <li> will get a little bit of a red mark around your lips where the cup has rested, but that goes away in a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was very careful and checked my lips every 15 seconds.</li>
            <li> Besides, even if this products effects were to actually last &amp;#34;a few hours&amp;#34; up to &amp;#34;all day,&amp;#34; what happens after that few hours when people say, &amp;#34;what happened to your lips?</li>
            <li> Last but not least, when I opened up the package I was shocked to see that there was not only one Fullips</li>
            <li> That would be the only negative thing about it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> so its not worth it.</li>
            <li> Bruising and tingling, with an uncomfortable feeling that lasts much longer than the intended results.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is I have to reapply my makeup when I use it.</li>
            <li> Now i have to walk around with bruising that is too dark to even cover with coverup and lipstick</li>
            <li> Would give it 5 stars if it would at least last for an hour.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work and I even gave it a few tries...</li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I was super doubtful of this actually working.  </li>
            <li> Just threw 20 bucks plus shipping down the drain.</li>
            <li> i mean, if you want it for a photo or something I guess,but Im not gonna be walking around sucking on this red thing all day.</li>
            <li> It is very small and only servers to enhance the shape of your cupid&#x27;s bow.</li>
            <li> You see a dramatic result and it isn&#x27;t permanent so you don&#x27;t have to worry losing your natural lip look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black woman with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; sized lips.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately ai didnt see a big difference and my lips looked blue after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking that the plumping effect would last at least for a few hours.</li>
            <li> The item came promptly in the mail, less than a week.</li>
            <li> I got a maximum of 20 minutes if that and that while I wasn&#x27;t eating or drinking anything hot or cold.</li>
            <li> and after is so red... not good to see.</li>
            <li> My lips go down after a few hours</li>
            <li> All these folks saying that this product bruised their lips might be true because they sucked too hard!!!!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll end up bruised and it hurts a little</li>
            <li> and yeah, I saw a little difference..</li>
            <li> I use a little coconut oil before I use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have little lips, and let me tell ya</li>
            <li> It does work, just takes a little bit of a learning curve.</li>
            <li> No it did not, and the little that it plumpt my lips</li>
            <li> I assume that I need to suck a little bit longer, but that way my lips get bruised.    </li>
            <li> Too little suction, no effect.</li>
            <li> , looks a little bruised or discolored</li>
            <li> I lucked out and lasts a very long time !!!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> product was a waste did not work</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t not suck onto lips, waste of money</li>
            <li> I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> If the effects lasted all day or a few hours thats one thing, but before I get up from my makeup table</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> you have to use it a few times throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions that came in the packaging along with watching the demos on Youtube, and within a few minutes I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money buying this</li>
            <li> Just a few seconds.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had my eye on this product for a while, a few months it just sat in my shopping cart</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> and I did watch a few reviews on youtube</li>
            <li> My advice, don&#x27;t waste your $$.</li>
            <li> It took me a few try&#x27;s to get the hang of it</li>
            <li> waste your money on this</li>
            <li> How is this product not a huge deal yet??</li>
            <li> My sisters use to suck bottles when they were younger as a joke, but this has the same effect, just not as exaggerated!</li>
            <li> Be very careful not to suck too hard</li>
            <li> They really do work...if you&#x27;re having a difficult time making it work...practice, practice, practice!</li>
            <li> and it bruises your lips pretty bad.</li>
            <li> it came with a small oval which did not fit on my lips.</li>
            <li> This little thing is a miracle!</li>
            <li> This little plastic device does what it says!</li>
            <li> And voila this little sucker works.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t received my package yet, but when I had complications they were extremely helpful!!!</li>
            <li> They give you a subtle plump that lasts a few hours, I use mine everyday.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure how well it works with lip piercings.</li>
            <li> It does take some practice but after a few hours today (off and on, of course!)</li>
            <li> Not sure why</li>
            <li> I get a small result</li>
            <li> bruising will occur and it&#x27;s not cute.</li>
            <li> It was too small for my lips</li>
            <li> I ordered the round one, and received another as a gift!</li>
            <li> To small</li>
            <li> The small is WAY too small for my mouth.</li>
            <li> I received this in addition to the small oval.</li>
            <li> Waste of money do not buy!</li>
            <li> I usually pull as I apply to avoid the weird ring above the lip.</li>
            <li> I find it really difficult to plump my upper lip (</li>
            <li> I have a small warning for those who have had lip fillers.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and was sent the small oval enhancer as a bonus.</li>
            <li> mediocre for those who have regular lips.</li>
            <li> I guess I have a small mouth???</li>
            <li> ; effect you get from the small oval when you use it diagnally.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s small and you can bring it with you.</li>
            <li> And if I don&#x27;t mind carrying around lipstick to reapply then you probably won&#x27;t mind carrying this small contraption around for some retouching through out the day.</li>
            <li> I have never had particularly small lips per say.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on the fence about this product and think its gimmicky, I promise it is not!</li>
            <li> I was not sure which size</li>
            <li> I was not sure whether to order this or the small oval</li>
            <li> not sure if it works or not</li>
            <li> Then I used the small oval cup.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my lips didn&#x27;t look different afterwards.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s simply not healthy.</li>
            <li> I had debated purchasing the small oval</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed and wish I could send this back and get a different one</li>
            <li> the size you choose and the small one.</li>
            <li> BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE NEXT DAY MY LIPS WERE BRUISED</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little too big and awkward to use.</li>
            <li> I had bruised lips from a previous product and I used this before it healed and it made it worse again, but thats my fault.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t suction too hard or</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to stay on the lips ..</li>
            <li> Really hard to use.  </li>
            <li> While using this do not do it too hard because it will bruise and be a bit sore.</li>
            <li> I think those we were bruised may have sucked too hard.</li>
            <li> , I thought they were going to be rubbery but there not, just hard plastic</li>
            <li> The instructions say not to suck too hard, since you can bruise your lips and the area around your lips.</li>
            <li> i was sucking so hard</li>
            <li> Just do not suck too hard as it will cause bruising on your lips.</li>
            <li> I went a bit crazy when I got it just to see how enormous I could go</li>
            <li> but I would like if it lasted for at least an hour.</li>
            <li> If U use with common sense &amp; follow directions your lips look for hours (my case-round).</li>
            <li> I like to have it on for at least 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> ( i didn&#x27;t let my lips slip into the cup) and began to create suction slowly.</li>
            <li> Go slow, move up from there.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve watched the videos, including the annoying one of the daughter smacking her lips non-stop, but nothing is working very well for me.</li>
            <li> I mean i can create the fullness I am looking to achieve</li>
            <li> Seriously who needs Botox or any other expensive lip treatment.</li>
            <li> very small.</li>
            <li> I have very small lips</li>
            <li> As someone with a small mouth and thin lips, this thing is a blessing.</li>
            <li> I have small mouth, thin lips.</li>
            <li> and you would look a bit ridiculous leaving the table if you were on a date to run the the ladies room to suction your lips because they were gradually shrinking in front of his eyes.</li>
            <li> And if you find it doesn&#x27;t work, you are either doing it wrong or may have gotten the wrong size, so check out the Youtube video on how to use properly!</li>
            <li> I was seriously contemplating lip injections</li>
            <li> It also leaves a weird ring around my mouth for a little while.</li>
            <li> ( and I&#x27;m 39), not a good look.</li>
            <li> and when I received them I sucked really really hard, like, maximum suckage!</li>
            <li> The product is A WASTE OF MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> As some one born with fairly thin lips but a tall cupids bow I have always wanted a product that will evenly plump my lips.</li>
            <li> And the worst part is it did not even make much difference in my lips.</li>
            <li> This product is a game changer.</li>
            <li> Since I have thin lips like Julia Roberts, I experimented using both sizes.</li>
            <li> I find that the combination of this and lipstick is a bit too dramatic for my liking.</li>
            <li> The seller is a total sweetheart, unfortunately the product is crap.</li>
            <li> if you suck to hard you can bruise but nothing crazy just don&#x27;t assume you are going to have gigantic lips in 1 day.</li>
            <li> Its extremely awkward (and uncomfortable) to suck on the hard plastic.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong, idk.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have the wrong size</li>
            <li> I had Restylane injections about 2 months ago and sadly the effect had already worn off.</li>
            <li> Lame.</li>
            <li> otherwise you&#x27;ll get weird bruises around your mouth.</li>
            <li> Did not work not happy!</li>
            <li> Get a very thin straw</li>
            <li> Not effective for me, kinda disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was curious to try and was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I prefer that over expensive and painful lip injections.</li>
            <li> I was really sad and disappointed, because it seems to work for everyone else.    </li>
            <li> That don&#x27;t work well and is Very expensive.</li>
            <li> Not meant for people who needed their lips plumped up that bad.  </li>
            <li> The bruising is not that bad, and sometimes you have to learn what &amp;</li>
            <li> it looks really ugly</li>
            <li> so you have to keep doing it, which is annoying and inconvenient at moments.</li>
            <li> horrible  false advertising</li>
            <li> Disappointed......</li>
            <li> and I wish I could try another shape :(</li>
            <li> Stupid.</li>
            <li> and then shouldn&#x27;t be that bad!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s awful, dose not make any change in my lips</li>
            <li> Horrible!!</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> the product is horrible.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s awful, dose not make any change in my lips</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fufil my expectations</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve bought this year! I have full lips to begin with but wanted to see what I would look like with a bit more fullness and fullips gave me just that! It becomes addicting! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week straight now and my lips stay plump for about 2-3 hours but they have lasted through the night a couple times. I got two of my friends who have smaller lips to try it out and they absolutely love it! I would recommend this to anyone looking to get plump lips fast or someone who is trying to deciding if they want to get fillers. This is a great way to see what you will look like with your lips fuller! Amazing product!!! I ordered mine on a saturday night and recieved my fullips that following Monday! Super fast shipping! I used the large round one to get overall fullness but used the small oval one to make the sides of my lips fuller.</li>
            <li> I had a medusa (upper lip) piercing that seemed to get in the way of the device so I am not sure how well it works with lip piercings. From the times I could get it to work for me it did work well. Again not the fault of the product on piercing free lips. Now that the piercing has been removed im curious to see how well it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very surprised with the results. It took me a while to get used to it &amp; learn how to use it but as soon as I did, it became one of my favourite &amp;#34;gadgets&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery! Excellent customer service! And it works! It works much more efficiently than other manual plumpers b/c you can actually be hands free, let the plumper do it&#x27;s job for however long you prefer, while you do the rest of your makeup. With other plumpers I have to use both hands to operate them. This is a major upgrade for me! Yay! I have been playing with all three styles but so far I use the large round the most. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Stupid. Does not last....and that&#x27;s if you are actually able to it to work in the first place.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It was alright it works for awhile.</li>
            <li> Love them! Shipping was super fast,packaging was too cute and most of all it works! Bought one got one free!&lt;br /&gt;Ty so much &amp;#60;3 truely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I really does work the only thing that I hate is if you use it too much your lips turn purple and bruised if it didn&#x27;t bruise my lips I would give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. It totally works to plump your lips. I&#x27;d say the plumpness lasts a couple hours or so. I carry in my purse and plump them up throughout the day if needed. I only use this product for a short period of time before realizing I probably shouldn&#x27;t use it because I have had lip injections. And I think it might miss shape my lips and move around the addict I have injected. Customer service went above and beyond what is expected. A seller who truly cares about her customers and satisfaction. Super fast and personalized, courteous response. Highly recommend this seller and this amazing product</li>
            <li> These lip enhancers are nice the only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t last the hour 😔 But the results are great if done properly</li>
            <li> The best product for thin lips! Its worth every cent!!!!</li>
            <li> OK, I ordered this product just for the fun of it. I have to say it&#x27;s pretty fun. I have medium-roundish lips, so I ordered the Large Round one; and received a second one ( smaller one) for free with my purchase. AWESOME!! THis product does plump your lips up for a short period of time. The max for me was about 45 minutes with a bit of plump in my lips left after that. Which is just fine. If you get great suction on it you will be able to get your lips to the desired fullness and beyond. I went a bit crazy when I got it just to see how enormous I could go… let&#x27;s say you can look pretty wild if you go overboard. THat being said I would totally recommend this for anyone who wants to have a bit of fun with your lips without the commitment of getting a botched lip job. For me I didn&#x27;t need to wet my lips. Dry worked best for me. I pressed my lips ON THE RIM ( i didn&#x27;t let my lips slip into the cup) and began to create suction slowly. Follow the directions and you should be fine. The smaller one that I also received works just as well as the bigger one. The smaller one I think is a great because it could be used to plump up the center a bit more. Again fun product and go for it if you want to have a bit of fun. (responsibly of course) ;)…..Oh and It looks like it could last forever… just try not to drop it on tile so often.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it works sometimes and doesn&#x27;t work.  It depends how you do it.  I apply vaseline on my lips first and then.  I would recommend you to choose this than lip plumpers.  But I would mostly recommend just your natural beautiful lips.  That is how God created us! You are beautiful in every way.</li>
            <li> the results dont last very long as first BUT i am seeing them last longer the ore frequent i do it. nice packaging and comes with instructions - DONT IGNORE THE INSTRUCTIONS! you&#x27;ll end up bruised and it hurts a little</li>
            <li> I ordered these from the website (www.fullips.com). At first I was hesitant and on top of that I wasn&#x27;t sure what size to order. I ended up ordering the large round after speaking to Linda, the founder. When I asked about the bonus size that comes with the purchase, she told me I could choose what gift size I wanted and to note it in the &amp;#34;notes/additional information&amp;#34; section on the order form which was a huge relief to me! Her customer service skills are amazing and after speaking to her personally, I was no longer hesitant to order. Shipping was super fast and I was so excited to get these today! I tried them out immediately after exfoliating my lips, and was BLOWN AWAY. My lips look amazing! It does take some practice but after a few hours today (off and on, of course!) I&#x27;m getting the hang of it. My results lasted for about 2 hours my first try but I&#x27;m going to keep practicing with them throughout the day to get longer results - LIKE YOU&#x27;RE SUPPOSED TO. I&#x27;ve always had good sized, full lips but after numerous lip piercings in my teenage years my bottom lip was always a bit bigger than my top lip, which is why I asked for the &amp;#34;small oval&amp;#34; for my gift size. The large round + small oval &#x3D; perfection for my lips! The large round adds overall fullness to both lips at the same time but the small oval targets areas that need a little extra oomph and spot treating, like my upper lip. I&#x27;m so excited to use these on Thanksgiving before seeing my family! This is an amazing product and I strongly recommend these to anyone looking to enhance their lips. Just remember to practice throughout the day to find what works for you and to increase the length of your results!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It works so well! The customer service is exceptional as well! Was given an extra one for free! Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> What a nice item&lt;br /&gt;Am so thankful for her for the nice gift</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work made my lips bruised</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well!  You do have to find your method--newbies might end up with a line around their mouths.  But it does work and I&#x27;m happy with it, and happy to have something on hand if I am in the mood to dial it up.    Update:  Still like it.  They sent me two shapes, and I find I&#x27;m using the oval shape more than the round.  Not sure why--it&#x27;s works better for me.  I will stick this thing on my face as I&#x27;m putting on my eyeliner or something, then pop it off and I&#x27;m good to go.  I only got a line around my mouth the first time, because of leaving it on too long and bursting some tiny blood vessels.  That disappeared within 48 hours and now I&#x27;ve found the sweet spot.  It&#x27;s not going to simulate an actual injection, but it plumps the shrinkage and lines to create a full lip in a natural way.  I would never want anyone to look at me and be like, \\&quot;Whoa, lip balloons!\\&quot; so I&#x27;m happy to have something that fixes things in a way nobody can pinpoint.  You just look better.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool, works better then any lip plumping gloss.&lt;br /&gt;also great customer service.</li>
            <li> I may still be getting used to using them but they&#x27;re just okay.  I get a small result but it doesn&#x27;t last long.  But the person who fills these orders sent me another one in a different size to try so that was nice!</li>
            <li> As some one born with fairly thin lips but a tall cupids bow I have always wanted a product that will evenly plump my lips. This product by far has done the best job in naturally plumping my lips without doing something crazy like using active bee venom. The item arrived two days earlier than estimated, the cute red bags and cards with the founders hand written name and hearts around important tips makes it feel like a special gift from a friend. Not to mention the free gift included. I used it with my home made sugar, cinnamon, and olive oil mixture applied with a stiff bristle toothbrush and the results were astounding.  Five stars and two thumbs up! Changed my beauty regime forever!</li>
            <li> awesome awesome product . I love it already . wasn&#x27;t sure on what size to get so I emailed for some info and they sent me and extra different size than I ordered . really great customer service . they replied to me very fast within a few mins . my products shipped fast got in few days . this product really does work and is well worth the money . I give 10 stars ..</li>
            <li> Horrible!! Follow directions to the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;. My bottom lip is bruised and hurts, and upper lip looks like I have hickeys all over it&lt;br /&gt; ( and I&#x27;m 39), not a good look. See pictures. Disappointed......</li>
            <li> Great item! Fast shipping. Product came as described. Sweet owner!</li>
            <li> This product couldn&#x27;t come any quicker! It truly works!! I applied the suction and within seconds I saw result!! I have been repeating for several minutes! I also used my plumper gel with it for extra plump and suction! What a beautiful hand written note I received too!! And a extra goodie!!! I will be ordering for my sister!!!</li>
            <li> So it definitely made my lips larger initially because my family asked me if I got punched in my face because my lips look really swollen. It also leaves a weird ring around my mouth for a little while. When I finally felt like my lips were looking good, my man laughed and called me &amp;#34;blue lips&amp;#34; because of all the bruising. But they looked pretty decent to me before all the brusing but the fullness lasted like 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> These really do work! They give you a subtle plump that lasts a few hours, I use mine everyday. This is a fun product, try it out!</li>
            <li> Lol it&#x27;s cool but not worth it I don&#x27;t think</li>
            <li> i like this item&lt;br /&gt;see my review on my blog&lt;br /&gt;http://whattobuytoday.weebly.com</li>
            <li> Works good. I thought it was super nice to get personal note from the Owner of the company and extra lip enhancer. Thank you</li>
            <li> Amazing piece of plastic! Didn&#x27;t think it would work but it does !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using this product several different ways but not really convinced it works.  I&#x27;ll keep trying to see if I can get the desired results that others have gotten.  What little change I do see doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I&#x27;m in my forties so maybe it works better for younger people.  I gave it two stars because it came very quickly, made of good quality plastic and the packing was very cute!</li>
            <li> I received my order sooner than i expected and I received 2, one for free which made me so happy because ordering I wasn&#x27;t sure which size to get but now I have 2 to work with.  Very happy customer. Thank you</li>
            <li> Worked great, did exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Don&#x27;t suction too hard or bruising will occur and it&#x27;s not cute. I loved opening the box and finding a surprise gift..they included a free am all oval fullips enhancer. It was too small for my lips so I gave it to my friend and she loves it. Thanks for a fun harmless lip plumper!</li>
            <li> Honestly love them. A couple times where I used them wrong and a hickey mark (my fault) but otherwise amazing product c:</li>
            <li> Well.. I was really excited when it came in! But I&#x27;m still trying to get ahold of how it works I guess.. I can&#x27;t seem to just keep it on my lips. I bought the largest one and I got it to stay on once and yeah, I saw a little difference.. if any of you have tips email me please! Selenazombiex@gmail.com thanks x</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t seem to work it perfect but I love it!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s whatever honestly, I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on it again.</li>
            <li> It really works!! I&#x27;m so happy that I made this purchase. Make sure you follow instructions and I would definitely recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, easy directions, and it works!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon!  It really does work!  Be careful when plumping your lips.....don&#x27;t suck too hard or keep on your lips more than 12-15 seconds or you might bruise your lips (I did....and I was careful after the 1st try).  But, this was my fault, not the product&#x27;s.  Excellent product and great invention!  It&#x27;s almost as good as getting lip injections (just doesn&#x27;t last as long....only a couple of hours).</li>
            <li> i was a bit scared to try this product at first but after following them on Instagram for a long time i decided to try it. my lips are so much bigger and pumper. FREE GIFT (extra fullip )!</li>
            <li> okay. just okay. not a fan. This can HURT. and a bit yucky. i&#x27;m not using them anymore. Don&#x27;t be fooled with all the hype.</li>
            <li> I ordered the round one, and received another as a gift! They definitely do what they are supposed to do. I&#x27;ve notced about 1-2 hours of fuller lips. Works for me!</li>
            <li> Got them for my daughter as a stocking stuffer and she loves them. She says their amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to stay on the lips .. To small and I don&#x27;t have big lips ...a rip off ...</li>
            <li> This product works! I bought the large one because my lips are already pretty full. I was looking to have fun with this and plump them up some more for going out/selfies/what have you. Also my top lip is smaller than my bottom and wanted to see them evened out, which was easy to make happen using the complimentary small oval one. I&#x27;d say this product will put your lips somewhere between lip injections and those lip glosses. It will not be as effective as lip fillers as it does go down pretty soon after you use it, usually an hour more or less. It is better than those special lip glosses. I use buxom gloss sometimes and it most definitely makes a more obvious difference. If you&#x27;re willing to shell out $20 to make your lips a little bigger then yes its worth it.The shipping was also incredibly fast and the packaging is adorable!</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m giggling as I think of what I&#x27;m going to say. I was interested and hesitant to try this product, but was really curious and I am not a filler or plastic surgery kind of girl. My friend and I sat down and read the instructions clearly and set out on a mission to plump these lips! It feels so strange and we caught on real quick just how much suction to use. We had so much fun experimenting with both sizes and I say &amp;#34;both&amp;#34; because I only ordered one and received another size for free. How great is that? Linda put her personal touches on the card by underling important things and gave her personal thanks and signature. I am completely impressed by this company! Here&#x27;s the bottom line: THEY REALLY WORK! It&#x27;s so exciting to see the difference in your lips and do a little everyday to see it does last a little longer the more you do it. I&#x27;m so glad I bought this plumper, SO worth the inexpensive cost. Have fun!!!!</li>
            <li> May work for some just not for me.. Was used correctly got some results. And keep in mind results are temporary but  If miss used can leave lips discolored.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t received my package yet, but when I had complications they were extremely helpful!!! Very good!!! 😁😁😁😁😁 thank you can&#x27;t wait to try them still!!!!!</li>
            <li> It definitely works, but it only lasts for about 45 minutes, vs the 1-3 hours it claims to last. Also, it says that the more you use it, the longer it will start lasting. Uh... no. I&#x27;ve used it quite a bit now. I already have full lips. I just wanted to enhance them a little bit more. I don&#x27;t know how it will work for people with very thin lips, but for me already having full lips, the results were so instant! It makes my lips even more sexy! The only reason it&#x27;s not a 5 star is because it doesn&#x27;t last as long as it claims. But I don&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li> Results are temp. Great for selfies not for long wear</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all. Gave the other one as a gift and they weren&#x27;t impressed with it either. Does not keep your lips plumped for any length of time and you would look a bit ridiculous leaving the table if you were on a date to run the the ladies room to suction your lips because they were gradually shrinking in front of his eyes. Plus after all the warnings about doing this type of lip plumping in my opinion injectables done by a Doctor are a better option. The quality of the plastic is good but the idea is just not realistic or effective</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but effects don&#x27;t last me more than an hour, if at all an hour. That would be the only negative thing about it.</li>
            <li> Really Does work! Go really easy and follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I have fairly thin lips and using this gave me a rich, plump look I had desired for so many years! However, it did take some getting used to and can be slightly difficult to use for the first time. Also, it is temporary. I find that the results last around 3 hours for me, however it&#x27;s perfect size to put in your make-up and take on the go. I purchased the large round and recieved the medium oval for free which was a nice surprise. Really great customer service! Over-all, it&#x27;s a fantastic product and unless you&#x27;re willing to commit to lip injections this is a great alternative! :)</li>
            <li> I did not get much plumping but I did get bruising. It says on the website that some people may get this and to stop using until bruises go away and then start use up again. The website also says that with use your lips and skin will get used to it and eventually it will stop bruising. I am finding that not to be true.&lt;br /&gt;I can not in good conscience recommend this product.</li>
            <li> They work!!!!! Could not believe my eyes. New full lips in seconds, my husband loves them and was more shock that I was.</li>
            <li> I just got mine yesterday, but I have to say, so far, this is an excellent product!  I will post more in the near future to give a complete review</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! Use them every single time i go out</li>
            <li> I ordered the large round and received the small round. It won&#x27;t stay put on my mouth and it doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Love Fullips. The seller is great! She included a another size of fullips as a gift. I have bought twice from this seller and never had a problem.</li>
            <li> It just works for few minutes ( 5- 10 min only )</li>
            <li> this company Linda is amazing . product came fast ! i ordered large but got medium for free as well ,.. but it does work if you suck short intervals  .. i have no sign of pain and no brusing ..</li>
            <li> product was a waste did not work</li>
            <li> Horrible product. No matter how I use them, my lips bruise and turn purple. I would NOT recomend this product to absolutely anyone!</li>
            <li> Love it! Got the package earlier than expected and don&#x27;t go a day without using my lip enchancer</li>
            <li> It kinda works.. But doesn&#x27;t last for more then a few minutes. Turns your lips purple/blue.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do it. It will bruise your lips I rather spend 600$ and get lip injections this is the dumbest invention ever don&#x27;t even bother gave my lips black and blue</li>
            <li> It does work but it lasts for an hour at most... and i pump them up pretty large so don&#x27;t  think it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t!  I also think they are tricky to use at first but maybe I need a different size or type of cup. I really am bummed because i wanted prefect and plump lips.</li>
            <li> Love the product! It actually works. I just wish it lasted longer.  Maybe I need more practice because it only lasted about an hour for me.</li>
            <li> OK sooo I have been wanting this to for so long and have done lots of research on this product and seller. Costumer service it AMAZING and the product works very well to plump your lips perfectly when correctly following instructions...However many people will tell you that this last 2-3 hours. ITS DOSENT! I got a maximum of 20 minutes if that and that while I wasn&#x27;t eating or drinking anything hot or cold. So if you don&#x27;t mind doing this 40+ times a day to maintain your pout than it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do ANYTHING!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty shocked by the amount of positive reviews. I tried the product numerous times and followed directions perfectly. I even watched YouTube videos in hopes of making this product work for me. My lips looked full and fabulous! For about 3 minutes. The outline left around my mouth from the product lasted longer than the actual fullness of my lips. Product came quickly though in the mail with detailed instructions in very cute packaging. It just wasn&#x27;t for me. I&#x27;m glad so many people got great result though :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black woman with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; sized lips. Worked for me sometimes</li>
            <li> It makes your lips fuller. However, be gentle and follow instructions otherwise you may end up with bruises around your mouth. The preasure should be enough for you to feel it but not so much it hurts. These little red thingies are wonderful. I usually use them while applying my eye make-up, they do leave a temporary red mark around your lips, but it goes aways in five minutes. I really love them and use them frecuently. When ordering chose the one you want and then they will send you a random second one for free.</li>
            <li> Not meant for people who needed their lips plumped up that bad.  These should be taken off shelves.</li>
            <li> Before buying this product, I used a shot glass to achieve pretty much the same thing. The bonus to the shot glass is that you can see what&#x27;s happening through the glass, however, not something I want to keep in my purse ;) The Fullips really upped the game on suction lip plumping, and I&#x27;m super happy with my purchase!&lt;br /&gt;I received my Fullips in a cute red organza bag, with a hand-signed note and an extra Fullips! Yay! I feel like the customer service is on the ball with this product, and that is a huge point for me.&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering this product, or have tried it with disappointing results, please consider this: This product is more than just temporary plumping. You will get the plumping for a short time once you start to use it, but the more you use it the longer it will last and the quicker your lips will respond. This is because you are TRAINING your lips to retain the plumpness. Every time you use it, you are flushing fluids and nutrients through that delicate tissue, and the more you flush, the longer those channels will remain open and receptive to plumping and tissue building. You are encouraging collagen growth and retention. This is fun for the short term, but regular use (2-3 times a day) will give you long term results that are semi-permanent.&lt;br /&gt;As for the shapes themselves, I am fuller-lipped naturally and found the large circle to be of more use. The Medium oval is great for more targeted plumping, so I throw that one in the car and plump while I&#x27;m driving. I use the large round in the morning with my face routine.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASEPLEASEPLEASE be careful with how much pressure you apply when starting out with these. They WILL work, but you need to be patient at first and figure out how much pressure your sensitive lip tissues can take before bruising. Go slow, move up from there.&lt;br /&gt;You will get a little bit of a red mark around your lips where the cup has rested, but that goes away in a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I love my Fullips, and would highly recommend...between the customer service and product, 10 stars! I&#x27;ve seen other products, but was unimpressed with the shape and depth of the cup (you need a lot of depth for your lips to be pulled into to see a difference). I will try to update with a video of how I use mine in the near future!ly recommend...between the customer service and product, 10 stars!

            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t work.  I tried 2 different sizes with many different variations on placement.  It&#x27;s not a real thing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t liked. That don&#x27;t work well and is Very expensive.</li>
            <li> It works! I use a little coconut oil before I use it.&lt;br /&gt;It works better once you lips are moisturized.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! It takes a little getting used to, but is very easy to use and results come in a matter of seconds!! My item was shipped very quickly, along with a second fullips free! The seller included a lovely handwritten note and it was packaged very nicely. So easy to use and all natural - Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Dislike!They only last about 5 minuts</li>
            <li> I got the large and the small. The small is WAY too small for my mouth. The large is about right but using a shot glass has proven to be better.</li>
            <li> This product is great! It doesn&#x27;t last necessarily as long as I&#x27;d like, but it&#x27;s so portable that touch ups are a breeze. Kylie Jenner move along... full lips makes us all Kardashians.</li>
            <li> Yes, yes, and more yes. Amazing customer service, extremely fast shipping/communication, and awesome product. Purchased the large round and received a small oval as a gift. My lips are fuller than they&#x27;ve ever been. Many products are pure gimmicks, but Fullips definitely isn&#x27;t one of those products. It truly works. Obviously the results are temporary, but isn&#x27;t that the best part? I&#x27;m also a newbie and experienced no bruising. This is everything I&#x27;ve been searching for. The Fullips founder is really running her business in an efficient, beautiful manner. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Very similar to Childs sippy cup ...  Actually a better description would be the plastic stacking cups children use .  Creative idea though .</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work and I even gave it a few tries... Very disappointed! Waste of money.</li>
            <li> They really work, it last up 3-6 hours. Depends on your lips! I use it almost daily, it makes my lips look like the bratz dolls lol</li>
            <li> I bought full lips to use for those special evening but now I keep it with me in my make up bag for daily use.  I use it every time I reapply my lip stick.  Its simple. I feel pretty and I have the full lips I&#x27;ve always wanted with out surgery! I would highly recommended thus product for anyone who wants full lips!</li>
            <li> Really hard to use.  Doesn&#x27;t fit mouth too well</li>
            <li> For me it works for about an hour. So you have to keep reapplying every hour. It works great if you&#x27;re feeling sassy! I bought the large but they also included a small one which actually works great to get a pucker lips look!</li>
            <li> love love love love!!! I didn&#x27;t have the smallest lips in the world before... But I did want more plump lips !! This did the job! My before picture and my after picture is after using the large round and small oval. And also 2 hours later. I love this product and I&#x27;m telling every girl I know!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working. I&#x27;m a guy but i don&#x27;t wear lipsticks. I only used moisture lip balm for healthy lips. My lips look bigger and sexy.</li>
            <li> It works!!  -Temporary of course.  Good novelty item. 👄</li>
            <li> Works well. Left a little bruising the first time I used it but shipping was extremely fast and I got a bonus one for free! Great seller and product!</li>
            <li> The product was amazing, outdone my expectations, they definitely make the lips bigger and fuller with a lasting effect. I absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as good as I thought it was going to be</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t not suck onto lips, waste of money</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter and she was SO excited to use them, but honestly she has only used them a few times because they do bruise your lips.  She said that if she uses them more often they will probably get more used to it and they should quit bruising her lips so bad.</li>
            <li> I had fun playing with this.  For me, these enhancers are great for special occasions.  I have never overdone the techniques, but these enhancers do make my lips look fuller.  The effect is fun and temporary.  If you wear lipstick and wanted to touch up the enhancement, I would only do so before reapplying lipstick/gloss.</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;m a beginner so my lips go down after about an hour but still love it!</li>
            <li> Love it! It does what it promised, the only bad thing is that for me it only las an hour at the most, but i still love it. I just have to keep excusing myself to run to the bathroom to retouch lol!! Other than that my lips are full 😚😗😙</li>
            <li> Cannot believe how effective this is. Plumps my lips gently. Comes with instructions so you know what you&#x27;re doing and how to do it. Packaging is adorable. The SELLER, the owner herself is an absolute doll- she wrote to me personally to explain which one I should order when I wasn&#x27;t sure what would be best. The value is so worth it. HIGHLY recommend. My lips have never looked better!</li>
            <li> This product barely did anything for me, I felt like my lips looked the same. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product came faster than expected, better than expected and the seller was just lovely! I have enjoyed my product every day with a smile!</li>
            <li> First of all, the packaging was so professional and nice with an added bonus inside, it came with very clear instructions as well. Great customer service! And if you find it doesn&#x27;t work, you are either doing it wrong or may have gotten the wrong size, so check out the Youtube video on how to use properly! Awesome product, without having to get expensive and painful procedures!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this, but I was pretty disappointed. A total lip plumper junkie, I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything on the market besides getting injections to plump my lips. They aren&#x27;t super small, they&#x27;re just normal, but I&#x27;ve always wanted that filled out pout. I received this in addition to the small oval. I tried it immediately and got nothing. Fast forward a couple of months and I&#x27;ve still only gotten minimal results (nothing more than what a regular lip plumper gloss hasn&#x27;t given me) that have lasted maybe 10 minutes. I&#x27;ve used it countless times hoping each time it would work. Maybe the one I never bought was the one that would do the trick (medium oval) but I&#x27;m not willing to spend $20 plus shipping to find out. Interestingly enough, I used the opening of a pill bottle to see if that gave me any results yesterday and voila, I now have amazing full lips that last most of the day. Who knew something so cheap would work like a charm? Anyway, I am usually one to be pretty forgiving when I rate things so I will say this - just because it didn&#x27;t work for me does not mean it won&#x27;t work for you. There are hundreds of happy customers with amazing results that I&#x27;ve seen so I can&#x27;t say that you&#x27;d be wasting your money. Give it a try if you&#x27;ve explored all other options.</li>
            <li> I like this because yes it helps to plump up my lips! BUT I do feel they go down pretty faster than I thought. About one hour, maybe 2 if I&#x27;m lucky? they do give me fuller but very temporary lips. I would recommend watching the video and instructions, they do help a lot.</li>
            <li> very small. I have small lips and mouth and it doesn&#x27;t even fit over my lips.  that&#x27;s the whole reason I purchased the full round.  lasts no longer than an hour or so. requested refund and still haven&#x27;t heard back</li>
            <li> It actually works. The effects last for about an hour with minimal effort. Overall a good investment.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well once you get the hang of it. I suggest ordering smaller than you would think, I though I had a big mouth so I ordered the large round and it&#x27;s a little too big and awkward to use. Thank god the seller also sent a medium oval because that one works perfectly. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the product is that it says it last 1-3 hours, mine lasts about 30 mins. Maybe I&#x27;m not doing it correctly or maybe it just works better on different people but I would like if it lasted for at least an hour.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all! It wouldn&#x27;t hold suction and didn&#x27;t make any difference. I WOULD NOT recommend this product. Absolute rubbish.</li>
            <li> I love it!  It works as expected and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all to use.  I find myself using it only about twice a day, once during makeup application and the other time about 4 hours later if I&#x27;m still out.  It does take a few attempts to get the right &amp;#34;plump-age&amp;#34; and technique, but very easy to use after.</li>
            <li> This does work but there are things you should know about this. I have very small lips so I bought the small oval, but the large round actually works a lot better for me. It fits around my whole mouth enlarging both lips simultaneously. The small one is good for particular spots, the medium is good for individual lips and the round is good for both at the same time. This lasts about 40 minutes to an hour at the most and I think how hydrated you are makes a difference. While using this do not do it too hard because it will bruise and be a bit sore. I have shown before and after photos. I usually have to sit down with my large round fullips enhancer for several minutes to get my lips nice and round. The more time I spend the longer it lasts. Overall I like it a lot but it is kinda pricey.</li>
            <li> Linda is simply the best  and the nicest person I have ever dealt with on line.  I was curious to try this and I am glad I did.  I saw results in the first few minutes of trying.  I am most fond of the small round.  It seems to work best for me regarding shape and size to suction around my lips.  I would definitely purchase again and I think it would be a great gift too.  xoxo, Thank you!  Happy Customer Mary Lynn</li>
            <li> Wow, I LOVE these!! They really do work...if you&#x27;re having a difficult time making it work...practice, practice, practice! Go back to the directions. I&#x27;ve found that everyone is different. I leave mine on for longer than suggested and I don&#x27;t get any bruising or redness that lasts more than a minute (just pat it to get the circulation going and it will speed up the redness going away) I ALWAYS get asked if I get injections or how nice my lips are :) In addition, I received a note from the owner thanking me for my purchase. The transaction was so pleasant, I received it ASAP and the company really is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Perfect item!! Just as described!! Wonderful seller, would definitely do business anytime!!</li>
            <li> Not effective for me, kinda disappointed. I have reasonably full lips now, I thought this would be fun to try.  It really didn&#x27;t do much of anything.  Eh...</li>
            <li> The seller is a total sweetheart, unfortunately the product is crap. it takes several tries to get these things to plump your lips and the effects only last a few minutes and it bruises your lips pretty bad. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product as long as you follow the directions. Customer service was exceptional as well.</li>
            <li> My package came with 2. I keep one in my make up kid and another in my purse. I love them. I use them everyday. My lips go down after a few hours but I love how my lips look right after with some red lipstick! I would buy again.</li>
            <li> They do plump your lips</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t function!&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my lips blue!!</li>
            <li> It did plump my lips but it did not last very long. It hasn&#x27;t lasted more than an hour:(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product, save your money. Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong, idk.</li>
            <li> I give it one star only because Linda answered my emails. This product did not work for me. I gave the other one to a friend and she said the same.</li>
            <li> Lasts approx. 30-60 seconds. I have full lips to begin with I just wanted to plump them even more, but this ended up making the outside of my lips red and that lasted longer than the plumping effect. Plus they turn purple, no matter how long or little you do it. If the effects lasted all day or a few hours thats one thing, but before I get up from my makeup table the effects are already worn off....so its not worth it.</li>
            <li> This product does work. It took me a few tries to get the hang of it. But, once I did I did notice a plumping effect!</li>
            <li> The item came really quick. I would never recommend this to anyone! This does not work. If you want bigger lips your better off sucking on a pill bottle/shot glass! Waste of money do not buy!</li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T LAST LONG AS I THOUGHT.</li>
            <li> barely works. don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Came with free gift (Medium Oval). Easy to use. I usually pull as I apply to avoid the weird ring above the lip. Doesn&#x27;t hurt. Effect lasts for about 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li> They do what they are suppose to but only lasted not even 20 mins... super dissapointed, and yes I used them correctly but results dont last long enough.</li>
            <li> First the &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; one isn&#x27;t very big at all and I couldn&#x27;t fit my lips in it. I guess it&#x27;s only &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; if you have really small lips. I used the medium one per lip. It works and lasted me about 30 minutes. It&#x27;s small and light weight so you could just keep it in your purse and reapply like lipstick when you&#x27;re out &amp; about. I think those we were bruised may have sucked too hard. Be careful!</li>
            <li> it does not last long</li>
            <li> This actually works! I purchased this because I was deciding on getting lip injections but after seeing so many botched lips, I wanted to test it out first. This is totally worth it if you want something quick for a picture or something that&#x27;ll last less then an hour because this is very temporary. I still think I could find something around my house to suck on instead of paying $25 for 2 pieces of plastic, I thought they were going to be rubbery but there not, just hard plastic but they work so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> This simple little suction tool is a great concept. After seeing this product on the instagrams of makeup artist, I anticipated this would produce long-lasting fuller lips.  While it does make your lips full, the results are minimal and last only a short time 15-30minutes.  I think I will just stick to Juvederm, to be honest. Save your money, unless a super fleeting, quick fix is what you&#x27;re looking for. Not for me.</li>
            <li> So I love that I received a medium oval with my order for free.  However, after using this many times I am just not seeing the results I was hoping for.  I find it really difficult to plump my upper lip (which is what I want to plump most) - when I use this it plumps mostly just my lower lip.  Also, the plumper doesn&#x27;t maintain its suction for very long on my lips - and I tried and tried and tried to make it stay but it always comes loose.  And then the plumping doesn&#x27;t last for long at all.</li>
            <li> is a good, product. i was expecting be more soft, is really hard plastic, and make my lips so sore.  not to sure if I order te right size, because this is small and my mouth&#x27;s small too. and cover my whole mouth even part on my superior skin. and after is so red... not good to see.</li>
            <li> They have great customer serivce, and included a free one that came with! It doesn&#x27;t keep your lips plumped all day like I had hoped though..you have to use it a few times throughout the day. Finally I just got lost interest &amp; stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waist your time I&#x27;ll can suck on a small cup for free at home. Refund please!</li>
            <li> I am in love! I already have large lips, but was looking for that trout pout without going in for injections or fillers. Taking it slow, this product is awesome! Only way I can see anyone being bruised, is if they created too tight of suction or left it on too long. LOVE that I ordered the large round and also received the oval one for free. Great incentive to order from this company again!</li>
            <li> Maybe I have the wrong size but I don&#x27;t get much of a suction on these to see my lip puff up.  I watched the videos, I did it clean and all of the ways to do it.  It&#x27;s okay.  I&#x27;ll buy lip plumper.</li>
            <li> I received my Fullips large round in the mail today along with the sweetest handwritten note from the seller AND a bonus medium oval! Even if this product didn&#x27;t work, that is some excellent customer service! I read the instructions that came in the packaging along with watching the demos on Youtube, and within a few minutes I got the hang of it. So far I actually like the medium oval a bit more than the round as it really helped to target the upper lip, but both were easy to use and provided surprising plumping action, even for a newbie. It took a bit of trial and error to get the suction just right, which left my mouth area a bit red, but I think that&#x27;s just beginner messiness. I&#x27;m writing about 4 hours after my first run with it, and the effects are almost completely gone -  but I am overall very impressed with this product!</li>
            <li> This works great. Linda was so sweet and writes personal messages on the instructions. I would definatley recommend. Ive seen videos od people that say it takes more than 20 minutes but i got my perfect volume in less than 5. It only lasts about an hour or so on me but I prefer that over expensive and painful lip injections. I like my lip size so I use this mainly for photos and when im goin out. You can always pop onto the bathroom and fullen them!! :)</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic and does everything it says it does.  It takes a minute or less and the effect last several hours. You can toss it in your purse for touch ups ( I saw another one that had a plunger and was huge). I had Restylane injections about 2 months ago and sadly the effect had already worn off. I saw this product on YouTube and was so happy to find it on Amazon plus buy 1 get one free. The shipping was super fast, and I have been using it everyday. It&#x27;s kind of addicting! I have a small warning for those who have had lip fillers. The day before I received it I was curious and decided to try and get the same effect using the cap of my hairspray. I tried it only 3 times for a few seconds. The edge of the cap was thin and not very comfortable, unlike the Fullips, I don&#x27;t know if it was too much suction but after a few minutes my lips swelled up so much I honestly got scared! It was as if my filler had been reactivated times 10!  I iced them and the swelling went down by the next morning. Thankfully I have not had this happen with the Fullips. I recommend if you have had Restylane (I can&#x27;t speak about other fillers) that you start slowly, only a few seconds at a time and be very gentle. Then wait about 10 minutes to make sure they don&#x27;t over swell. You will not regret buying this. Plus you won&#x27;t have to spend hundreds of dollars on fillers again!</li>
            <li> It works and the owner is very sweet!</li>
            <li> Great costumer service but the product is horrible. Please don&#x27;t waste your money buying this</li>
            <li> Makes lips plump for a short period of time, but does what it says it does!</li>
            <li> I tried Fullips and loved the results!  The founder of the company gave very clear directions on the videos and the included instructions on how to use the product.  My lips were fuller and I had a younger look to them.  I will recomend this product to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product but after a while I realized several people were using this product to mimic other ethnical feature that were not white so I decided to discontinue use so I would no longer be part of the problem.</li>
            <li> great product wish the results were permanent. they sent me an extra in a different size even...................</li>
            <li> My lips dont even stay &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; for a long period of time. 20 minutes is about as long as it lasts.</li>
            <li> I love my new secret cosmetic tool ;) I already have full lips, but I wanted that extra Cupid&#x27;s bow definition and a little more &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; factor and these totally deliver. I just leave it on my lips while I do my eyebrows, put my lipstick on when I&#x27;m done and I have pretty, plump lips for hours. I&#x27;ll use them again on my lunch break and I&#x27;m good for the second half of my day :)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. And they threw in an extra one. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great product! But have to use it frequently.</li>
            <li> I love this little product. Why didn&#x27;t I think of it?! The owner/founder Linda is SUPER SWEET!!! The costumer service is amazing, if the size isn&#x27;t working for you  she really goes Above &amp; Beyond to make sure you are completely satisfied. Fullips also carries Lipgloss, Lipstick and lipsLiners in really pretty colors. I recommend using the gloss because it&#x27;s a lip plumper and really helps with the results.</li>
            <li> Great company! Great service! Great product! Love it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this and was sent the small oval enhancer as a bonus. This product works amazingly well at enhancing the pouty/round appearance of my lips without leaving any marks. Comes with a sweet handwritten card from the founder. Fast shipping. Great product. Amazing customer service! :)</li>
            <li> This really works!! I just got it today and I&#x27;m still learning how to use it but I can see a difference. The large round is too big for me but I got a small oval lip enhancer as a gift and it works much better but it doesn&#x27;t cover my whole lip. I contacted Linda to see if I can exchange the large for a medium and she replied immediately and told me she will ship it out today. They have the best customer service I have ever experienced and the products work. The shipping was also really fast and the packaging is really nice. You also get a small lip brush to exfoliate lips and there was a handwritten note from Linda and her personal number from which you can text or call her. This is a great company and products. Wishing them best of luck.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make much of a difference with my lips, followed instructions. Did bruise a lil but doesn&#x27;t last long.. Just a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Was curious to try and was very disappointed. I followed instructions and it left my lips &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; aka swollen for maybe 20 minutes, but the tingling and strange feeling in my lips lasted 2 days. And the worst part is it did not even make much difference in my lips. This is a product for someone who would use it compulsively to constantly keep their lips plump... but at what cost? Bruising and tingling, with an uncomfortable feeling that lasts much longer than the intended results. Lame.</li>
            <li> I like the owner, she is the best. Very nice. But the product is tricky to me. When I get it to work my lips are too huge. and not shapely. I don&#x27;t think its healthy to be doing this to your lips all the time, but a few times every now and then shouldn&#x27;t be that bad! I just go gentle and not to the point where it looks gross.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely in love with my products. I received a free one and the packaging is super cute. Thank you</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference with mine. However, I know someone else who used it and she saw a difference.</li>
            <li> Product does make lips fuller and the lines around mouth appear smaller as a result. However the effect is equal to that of a liquid lip plumper and it&#x27;s effects do not last longer than 20 min. I bought one for my sister though who has had collagen injections in her lips before and this product brought out the plumpness again. She won&#x27;t need to get more injections again as this product brings the collagen back to the surface. mediocre for those who have regular lips.</li>
            <li> Honestly a great product and the seller is a wonderful person!</li>
            <li> It plumps them for about an hour.  I need a longer term solution.</li>
            <li> It really works and keeps your lips full for about a hour or alittle less</li>
            <li> It is amazing I like it thanks</li>
            <li> I was excited about this product...sadly it didn&#x27;t get real good results. Customer service was wonderful. Maybe I&#x27;m not using it right plus I&#x27;m old like 60. I will keep them &amp;  keep trying.  👄👄👄👄👄</li>
            <li> YES ! girls it wooooorks ! this is magic i love it i bought all the sizes and the seller is so kind and helpfull</li>
            <li> It really works. I have little lips, and let me tell ya, I did it on my slimmest lip (upper) don&#x27;t do it every day, but the lip is much puffier. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Not as effective as I thought.</li>
            <li> lips plump for a bit, but haven&#x27;t seen any lasting results yet</li>
            <li> Think Kylie Jenner lip challenge... all these things do is pull the blood to your lips. I would be fine with it if the result lasted more than a minute or 2. Not worth the price, even if they were free.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. It just made my lips sore and bruised..It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This Large Round fullips is way too big for my mouth. I can&#x27;t even get it to stay on because it&#x27;s so large. I guess I have a small mouth??? I figured my mouth was normal size, but I guess not. Just wanted to warn people, it is LARGE, so if you suspect at all that your mouth might be on the smaller side, just go with the Medium Oval or Small Oval.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can get the Medium Oval to work, but it&#x27;s still too big for my taste, as it makes the sides/corners of my mouth pouf out in a way that is not flattering for my face. I really like the Small Oval though! A lot of people use it for \\&quot;spot targeting\\&quot;, but I find it is the perfect size to give me the center fullness/pouty-ness that I want without making the outside corners of my mouth stick out in a way that looks unnatural on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great company, and products!  :)</li>
            <li> It does work, just takes a little bit of a learning curve. And it does last longer than I would&#x27;ve thought! The packaging is really nice!  Recommended:)</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely sold.. I ordered Saturday and it came Monday, watched one how to video and got the hang of it immediately. Works perfectlyy for someone who wants full lips without  injections. Yes it&#x27;s temporary but soo worth it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long (which it states, \\&quot;temporary\\&quot;) -- but WOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW to the seriously AMAZING customer service by this seller!! Handwritten thank-you note plus a freebie plus tips!! WOW!! She is doing everything right. Keep up the excellent work!</li>
            <li> Wow, what a great company! I&#x27;m a HUGE online shopper, and I can safely attest that Ms. Gomez (the founder and head of this excellent enterprise) is awesome beyond words, better than any other retailer with whom I&#x27;ve ever done business.  Great product, great idea, and an all-over wonderful experience!  I have nothing but glowing things to say :)</li>
            <li> Wow. I was super doubtful of this actually working.  I had my eye on this product for a while, a few months it just sat in my shopping cart and I couldn&#x27;t get myself to buy it because I doubted. But SURPRISE IT REALLY WORKS. I am very pleasantly surprised. It doesn&#x27;t last long at first but they say the more you use it, in a sense you train your lips and they start lasting longer. So I&#x27;m excited to keep using it and see how things go in the future!</li>
            <li> Product came in TWO days!! I also got a complimentary small oval, as I ordered the large round! I love the results this really works, so happy I finally purchased! Don&#x27;t hesitate!</li>
            <li> These are amazing. They work with suction that is painless and easy, unlike the glosses and creams I have tried before. I ordered a large round and she sent a few extras in return. All are awesome and work different parts of your lips. I espescially love the &amp;#34;baby doll lip&amp;#34; effect you get from the small oval when you use it diagnally. I will definitly be reordering for my bridesmaids in the next few months. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Ordered a large round and received a small oval round with it. Works very well and fun to use! Definitely makes lips smooth and plump. Wish I would have known about this a long time ago!! My lips are already full but this really puffs them up. :) Great Product.</li>
            <li> Great product! Highly recommend - this is the real deal &amp; you don&#x27;t have to buy more every month or 3 months or year or EVER!! And it works!!!</li>
            <li> I really like the product.I ordered large but I also received a small one which is a much better fit for me.You have to get used to using it properly but when you do,wow..what a difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed! I bought the large round and also received the small oval. It does last a while but it&#x27;s small and you can bring it with you. The shipping was really fast and the packaging is really nice, and I love that it is easy to use. Great product :)</li>
            <li> Wow. If you want big lips, get these. It&#x27;s a temporary fix, but your lips will noticeably get bigger. Just be careful not to do it too much! I use this baby before I go out, especially on the weekends haha.</li>
            <li> Does everything it says it does. I love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE these! Completely worth every penny.. Only complaint is I have to reapply my makeup when I use it.</li>
            <li> Takes a minute to get the hang of it but overall loved it! Great results she even sent me the small one for free!</li>
            <li> Good but results fade too quickly. 30 mins and its back</li>
            <li> It  made  my  lips  blue  and  didn&#x27;t make  them  plump</li>
            <li> really works but only last an hour.</li>
            <li> works like a charm! I love the way my lips look.  Just right!  :)</li>
            <li> Okay, okay, yes it&#x27;s a little bit of money to make your lips fuller, but it&#x27;s better than spending 600$ on collagen injections and have it be permanent, and regret it if you don&#x27;t like the way it looks. With that being said, these are great! Yes, I am an over achiever and when I received them I sucked really really hard, like, maximum suckage! So, it did bruise the top part of my lip, but, that doesn&#x27;t stop me from using it. I have full (not big) lips, and leave the little &amp;#34;machine&amp;#34; on my lips for about 5-10 minutes, which seems like a lot, but it&#x27;s really not. My photos are before, suckage for 1 minute vs. suckage for 10 minutes. You be the judge! Oh, and btw, if you have an over producing saliva gland (like myself) get ready for a wet and wild ride ;)</li>
            <li> I love these little things (you receive two when you buy them!) They work very well, the first time I used it I couldn&#x27;t stop laughing because of the big difference it made. Obviously, this isn&#x27;t a long term thing, but it lasted a couple of hours. And if I don&#x27;t mind carrying around lipstick to reapply then you probably won&#x27;t mind carrying this small contraption around for some retouching through out the day.</li>
            <li> I recieved this [rpduct , and was so excited to try it! I naturally have full lips but was curious to see what all the hype was about ! Let me start off my saying you do see a result but it is VERY temporary . Not only that but it gave my severe dark purple bruising on my entire top lip :( Now i have to walk around with bruising that is too dark to even cover with coverup and lipstick</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this is getting such amazing reviews? This does not work and not only does it not work, it popped blood vessels in my lips and bruised them. I followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY THIS!~  I kinda bought this as a novelty to see if it actually works, it doesn&#x27;t, complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews for products, but the results this little plastic device gave to my lips was amazing dare I say revolutionary! I have never had particularly small lips per say. But I did have a some what noticeably smaller upper lip compared to the bottom. My boyfriend has always loved my lips, but some days I don&#x27;t want to fiddle around with lining my lips with a pencil and taking all of the steps to balance out my lips. Some times I just want to run out the door and not worry about how they look, ya know? This product is a game changer. Long gone are the days where I took an ungodly amount of time to pile heaps of lip product to make them look more symmetrical only to have it wear or rub off in a couple hours. It only takes me 1 minute. YES I SAID 1 MINUTE, to get the lips I wished I was genetically blessed with. I also love how discreet it is, I can just toss it in my purse and go! Last but not least, when I opened up the package I was shocked to see that there was not only one Fullips but they also gave me one for free! That was really sweet and completely unexpected! If you&#x27;re on the fence about this product and think its gimmicky, I promise it is not! It does exactly what it says it will do, and that is give you full, luscious lips. Thank you very much Linda!</li>
            <li> I use the large one-but for those with a smaller lip the small ones might work better. Once you place the cup (for lack of a better word) over the lip area, take small sips of air till suction is acquired. Works great did it last night-a minuate or two and have fewer lip lines this morning! Easy, it works and you do get results! Love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve watched the videos, including the annoying one of the daughter smacking her lips non-stop, but nothing is working very well for me. I&#x27;ll keep at it, but it&#x27;s frustrating to not be able to have it work. Perhaps better videos would help? There has to be a way to use these effectively, without having them bruise my lips or just not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m open to assistance here.</li>
            <li> If you like that &amp;#34;Just had a hot make out session, bruised kissed lips&amp;#34; look, this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;But don&#x27;t expect it to enlarge your lips any more than a little puffy and &amp;#34;just kissed&amp;#34; looking.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but my lips don&#x27;t get any larger and the effect fades within half an hour to an hour for me at best. Sometimes faster.</li>
            <li> It does what it say , my tiny lips love it so much.&lt;br /&gt;One of the best costumer service ever.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to every girls who wants fullips:</li>
            <li> It made my lips spotty and purple. It enhanced them maybe for 30 seconds and then my lips returned to their normal size, but they were red.</li>
            <li> I like it, it takes time to get used to it and find right way to use. Just need to start graddually, hold it for a little bit firstly and then U feel your own reaction. It works and I am happy I have it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for about an hour. After that it goes to your regular size lips. Everybody say they received a second piece as a gift, which I didn&#x27;t and was really upset, because this size didn&#x27;t work for me and I wish I could try another shape :(</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Still experimenting, fun experience so far. Thank you-</li>
            <li> They do make your lips bigger</li>
            <li> No it did not, and the little that it plumpt my lips it really only lasted about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Love this product it really works. Amazing dont have to get surgery.</li>
            <li> These are a little hard to figure out at first, but once I got the hang of it, I became an addict. I love how my lips look, even if it is just temporary.</li>
            <li> Works right when you use it. But then goes away quick. Great for pics</li>
            <li> Company was awesome enough to ship this asap and send two different sizes of the device. Unfortunately ai didnt see a big difference and my lips looked blue after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: does work, took me a good few times to learn how to use these babies but they are part of my makeup routine now I use before applying a plumper and love how my lips look even if it&#x27;s just very temporary :(  WARNING: don&#x27;t leave on too long or over use lips will turn black and blue and be bruised</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have this product. I use it daily as part of my make up routine, it gives my lips a noticeable plumping fuller effect. I do strongly recommend it for those that are wanting bigger fuller lips and do not want to get lip injections.</li>
            <li> Be very careful not to suck too hard otherwise you&#x27;ll get weird bruises around your mouth. But otherwise, if you apply correctly, it works amazingly!</li>
            <li> It really does work and no issues yet!</li>
            <li> So it only lasts for like 10 min and you have to keep sucking and sucking and it bruises the top of your lip and bottom it looks really ugly I have to keep covering it with foundation.. Waste of money</li>
            <li> Who has time to do this? Especially if you&#x27;re a busy mom of three young ones, go to work and school full time. Obviously you cannot do this outside of your private time. The longest I did it for was like 45 minutes, and yes, it plumped my lips, but the effect was gone in under an hour and it was kind of uneven. Should have known better though, that&#x27;s my fault. That I need something that does it for me, preferably invisibly. Maybe some type of lip gloss or lip balm. May be good for others, but I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my time or  money. *Sigh* oh well, you learn from your mistakes. Besides, even if this products effects were to actually last &amp;#34;a few hours&amp;#34; up to &amp;#34;all day,&amp;#34; what happens after that few hours when people say, &amp;#34;what happened to your lips? they&#x27;re smaller than they were 5 hours ago&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These things are soooo fun. They last a couple hours so if you have a long night out you may need to redo it before reapplying your lipstick. I got a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Works well after daily use for about a week. You have to be patient and practice with it before your body starts to respond to the treatment.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast, personalized note and a sweet gesture was inside the package.  Used it  immediately after opening the package.  It works!!!  Great product and the best part is you can take it with you anywhere.  In a clutch a makeup bag ect.  I have already sent out the word with some pics for proof to my friends.  Will try her lip gloss/tint next.  Thanks Linda, job well done:)</li>
            <li> Shipped VERY fast and arrived very quickly!! It shipped out the night I ordered it and it arrived 2 days later! The seller was super nice and included a handwritten note and her personal information to contact her and very clear instructions. I was not sure which size I wanted to order because I have pretty small lips, but I heard this one worked well so I tried it and it does work!! I was not sure whether to order this or the small oval but the seller actually included both for me to try so I was so excited! :) It really does work well, and does not hurt at all. It is very easy to do and doesn&#x27;t take long at all. I&#x27;m so glad I decided to order!! :)</li>
            <li> How is this product not a huge deal yet?? This is epic and completely worthy of 5 stars. This product draws your blood to your lips thusly naturally plumping them while adding more color! More blood flow to the lips encourages faster cell rejuvenation and production. It can even help to treat chronically dry lips! The instructions say hold it for 15 to 30 seconds but really you should hold it to your lips for at least a minute or two in my oppinion (everybody is different). I am very impressed and satisfied with my purchase. Don&#x27;t hesitate cause this really works.</li>
            <li> These things are amazing. Just be really careful with over doing it! I had bruises on my lips the first time. But the lip plumping usually last for about 40-50 minutes for me but the results are great with out the needle.</li>
            <li> It really works, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t last for too long. The seller was extra nice and gave me an extra lip enhancer in another size, that was awesome! And I loved that she says &amp;#34;thank you&amp;#34; handwritten</li>
            <li> Great product, Owners are SOOO nice too!!!!!!</li>
            <li> i have such small lips but it made my lips huge i love it! it came so fast and worked so well.</li>
            <li> I like the smaller size oval but it is the only one I can use. The large size is just so large! Even when my lips are already pretty plumped I&#x27;ll try to use it and nope. Just too big. Fun thing to play with once in a while but the effects do not last more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li> absolutely love it! It took a few practice runs to not give my chin a slight bruise, but after I figured the placement out, I can easily say I love it and am addictedd to it!</li>
            <li> I love it! Doesn&#x27;t last long enough though. I got the large round and it worked great it came with a small oval which did not fit on my lips. But this product is really amazing I really love it!</li>
            <li> So happy with this i cant figure out how to post my pic but it deffently is worth it&lt;br /&gt;Love this !</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.. it really Works!! I recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> not sure if it works or not</li>
            <li> I loved theis ive always wanted fuller lips but just too nervouse about lip injections i came across this and i just thought i should give it a try they work so good and make my lips looks nice and full i thought i would only get 1 but 2 came in the pack. The big one gives my lips alot of fullness there great</li>
            <li> I saw several videos on YouTube about the Lip Enhancer and was curious, so I ordered the big round one. A few days later it arrived in a cute packaging and a second Lip Enhancer as a gift! So cute!    The instructions say not to suck too hard, since you can bruise your lips and the area around your lips. At first I tried out the big round cup. I was very careful and checked my lips every 15 seconds. Then I used the small oval cup. Unfortunately my lips didn&#x27;t look different afterwards. I was really sad and disappointed, because it seems to work for everyone else.    I tried the cups out again this morning, but still no results. This time I sucked a little bit longer (probably 5 x 30 seconds) but the only difference is that the area around my mouth is bruised. My lips don&#x27;t look fuller, even though I&#x27;m using the cups the right way. I assume that I need to suck a little bit longer, but that way my lips get bruised.    Give it a try if you are curious. Since it works for so many other people, it might work for you too. Also, if you have problems with it, just contact Linda. She is the sweetest person ever and has a great customer service!</li>
            <li> This is a very interesting product. At first, I was a bit skeptical and I did watch a few reviews on youtube and I was convinced to buy it. I thought it would be something I would use every now and then but I just use it on a daily basis. I ordered it the 29th of december and got it on the 2nd of January! It was in a beautiful package and full instructions. I would definitely buy the other styles as well.</li>
            <li> Works great! I would recommend it to anyone who wants fuller lips</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d recommend this product for anyone over 25. Too little suction, no effect. Too much suction, you get a ring around your lips. You&#x27;re supposed to use it until you can figure out what works for you. After a certain age, I just don&#x27;t have time for this. I will say the packaging is adorable and the seller has a great concept. It is delivered promptly and comes in a cute red bag with a card from the seller. Very nice touch.</li>
            <li> I had bruised lips from a previous product and I used this before it healed and it made it worse again, but thats my fault. they came fast and I also revived an oval one? maybe it was free but it was cool. I got a hand written note it was so nic</li>
            <li> I like using this when I use lip stain rather than lipstick. Makes your lips look naturally luscious!  I find that the combination of this and lipstick is a bit too dramatic for my liking.</li>
            <li> This is great, My lips looks sooo sexy. For the ones who get both of there lips into the large round one. Get a very thin straw the size of an ink pen tube, the straw should be an inch long, put half the straw in your mouth while the other half is out of your mouth, put the large Fullips Enhancer to your lips and thru the straw suck in slowly and hold. BAM BIG SEXY LIPS</li>
            <li> This product is fun. Does not last long. It gave me pimples around my lips. If you&#x27;ve ever seen botched it means irritation. I followed directions but it&#x27;s simply not healthy. I don&#x27;t recommend and I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Nice service, so personalized! They send me a gift with my purchase and that was a plus and a super cool surprise. The effect on my lips just last for a few minutes but during that time i look sooo sexy. Thank you for the excellent service!</li>
            <li> Definitely works! Arrived very quickly and in nice packaging. I was also surprised with an additional small plumper for free! Only reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars is because the effect doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> The large round actually feels too small for my lips and easily causes bruising (4 stars ), but the small oval works great when I use it vertically.  This takes practice and you really have to &amp;#34;train your lips&amp;#34;!!! They are going to feel weird and tingly for a while after using,  but the more you use,  the easier it gets,  and the tingles diminish.</li>
            <li> I cannot even describe how great this product is AND how effective!! It works like you just got lip injections :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is, you have to use it multiple times per day and sometimes it irritates my lips but I just use some lip balm afterwards and Im good. I have been asked multiple times what I have been doing to my lips because they look so plump!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, best beauty product I have purchased IN A LONG TIME!!!</li>
            <li> It does bruise, so be careful not to have too much suction</li>
            <li> I am def. Loving my new fullips lip enhancers. Iys easy to use, its customizable and by that I mean i can create the fullness I am looking to achieve and it also came super FAST!!!!! It took a few mintues to get used to, and my results were amazing but went away within 30 mins. I honestly think it just takes some getting used to for you and your body so i will re do them in 3-4 hours like it suggests and see if they start to last longer as I use it more. THANKS. I included a before and after shot for this review as well.</li>
            <li> I wish I could love this product, I like how it instantly makes my lips bigger and fuller, but it is only temporary and lasts for maybe an hour. The other thing is that when I used this product, the skin around my lips get red and irritated. I can&#x27;t get the nice full lips without having the red irritation around my mouth</li>
            <li> This product was way to expensive for what it is, although the packaging and customer service is nice, and you get 2 for 1.  It did plump my lips slightly, for a couple minutes, but it left a very noticeable dark (bruise? hickey?) ring around my lips which lasted longer than the plumping effect, that just wont do for me. I bought these on a whim, and now they are going under the bathroom sink with my other impulse beauty buys. My advice, don&#x27;t waste your $$. My main interest in these was to plump my upper lip, and I get better results, and no bruise look by just sucking on my top lip without this &amp;#34;enhancer&amp;#34; (which is just a small plastic cup)</li>
            <li> I love these. I bought the large and received the small for free. Thank you</li>
            <li> The Fullips work great and I&#x27;m amazed by the results. I was skeptical at first and wasn&#x27;t getting it right the first time but kept practicing and now see all the benefits to getting plump full lips that last. I literally use it for about 10 seconds and  notice results for the rest of the day. Also customer service is AMAZING. You will not be disappointed! I was seriously contemplating lip injections and now I don&#x27;t feel like I need to go that route!</li>
            <li> Very hard to get a decent suction. It really works though. Alot of work for something so temporary. End of review.</li>
            <li> Does not plump top and bottom evenly.  What fullness I did get only lasted 25-30 minutes.</li>
            <li> If U use with common sense &amp; follow directions your lips look for hours (my case-round). Fast shipping, nice presentation &amp; so thankful for received two: the round &amp; the oval.</li>
            <li> great for when you want to add a bit of color as well as a plump to your lips. I do it wen I first wake up before I put my makeup on and if I am going to an event I do it while I am prepping and getting ready. I like to have it on for at least 20 minutes. if you suck to hard you can bruise but nothing crazy just don&#x27;t assume you are going to have gigantic lips in 1 day.</li>
            <li> Does the job, I just honestly don&#x27;t feel like sucking on it every hour.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely worth every penny!  I am so happy with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I received my order several days before estimated.  I ordered the large round but was given a medium oval as a gift- and they were in the nicest packaging with a handwritten note from the company owner.  Very nice ordering experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did watch the informational video on how to use the fullips first...so right out of the box I was ready to try it.  After using it for a couple of minutes, I already had great results.  My lips were much, much fuller.  The results lasted a couple of hours, but were very easy to touch up.  I am having lots of fun experimenting with the different shapes and techniques, but no matter how I do it I end up with very full lips!  It is fairly comfortable and easy to use.  They are small and easy to take with you in your purse, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing to me that this product costs as much as a lip-plumping gloss (that won&#x27;t work anyway) and yet is so incredibly effective!  I am very pleased with this product!!</li>
            <li> If i could give this 10 stars I would! This little thing is a miracle! I actually used it last night and when i woke up this am, my lips were still huge! It says it may last only a few hours but mine lasted overnight! So excited! Had appt for lip injections today, Im so glad i found this first so now i don&#x27;t have to go through the pain of the needles! Thank you sooooo much Linda for inventing this much needed beauty tool!!! I bought it under my husbands account so this is not Dan, its his wife! lol! BIG XXXXXX now with BIG lips! Joy</li>
            <li> If you do it right then it&#x27;ll work but I haven&#x27;t gotten the hang of it yet. It&#x27;s worth the buy.</li>
            <li> All these folks saying that this product bruised their lips might be true because they sucked too hard!!!! This product works 100% !!!!!!!!!! Watch my video on Instagram @ednadoll !!! for everybody it will last a different time from 1-4 hours for me I lucked out and lasts a very long time !!!!! Plus you use this product as if it is a lip plumper gloss !! You touch up when you go to the ladies room !!!! It&#x27;s brilliant it&#x27;s genius and I love it !!</li>
            <li> Does it &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; yes! Does it last? No! I have been doing this correctly for 2 days,followed instructions &amp; watched the you tube videos. to be honest,this was a last resort before I would consider juvederm lip injections.When I initially used this item,the results that you see in the picture had me really happy &amp; I was expecting it to last at least 2 hours,OMG this did not even last 20 minutes.I was with friends and they said my lips were &amp;#34;deflating&amp;#34; before their eyes! Sure enough I look in the mirror and the effects were totally gone. i mean, if you want it for a photo or something I guess,but Im not gonna be walking around sucking on this red thing all day. Just threw 20 bucks plus shipping down the drain. Really dissapointed 👎👎</li>
            <li> I only use it occasionally.  Seems to work  fine, all depends upon how often you use it.  Too much can cause a slight bruising.</li>
            <li> I love this! I&#x27;ve ordered them for my Mom and sisters. They all love it too. My mom said it made the wrinkles around her mouth vanish- BONUS! Yet, pay attention to the directions. They are important. I would recommend when you first test it out to do it  after work or another time when you know you wont have to see anyone important right after, in case you accidentally bruise your lips. But don&#x27;t let that scare you. The bruising is not that bad, and sometimes you have to learn what &amp;#34;too hard&amp;#34; means by bruising yourself to establish that baseline. Take it slow and If you do bruise yourself, it went away within a day - enjoy! This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Finally, something that actually works!  An easy, painless, not invasive way to achieve plumper lips.  I am using the large round and I&#x27;m delighted with the results.  These enhancers create full, natural-looking lips, as promised and my lip lines are disappearing!  My lips stay plumped for hours and it&#x27;s easy to do a quick 30 second touch up in the car or restroom.  You won&#x27;t find an easier, more reasonably priced and effective lip enhancer! LOVE It!</li>
            <li> It really works, however they sent an oval one for free and its too small, my lips don&#x27;t fit. So if you have bigger lips gey the round one :)</li>
            <li> I could not be more stoked on this. I had debated purchasing the small oval but I went with the large round. And then I ended up with the small oval as a free gift with my order! These make my lips look amazing. You just have to play with them and figure out what works best for you. If these haven&#x27;t worked for you, you aren&#x27;t doing it right! There are tons of videos on YouTube to help you get the hang of it.  I LOVE THESE SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> horrible  false advertising</li>
            <li> I made a mistake of ordering the large size but customer service here is the best. Since it&#x27;s a buy one get one free, I got both sizes medium and large together. Since I have thin lips like Julia Roberts, I experimented using both sizes. And voila this little sucker works. Seriously who needs Botox or any other expensive lip treatment. My 11 yrs. old son noticed the difference &amp;#34;Mom what happened to your lips&amp;#34;. Why are you making yourself look good all the time&amp;#34; so it works Ladies!!!</li>
            <li> Totally works! I would give five stars, but, the effect really only lasts for about an hour for me. I was also sent the oval one as a free gift, which was awesome, and I think I like that one better than the larger one  because I really only need volume on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> This product is great and easy to use! All the instructions were included and not only that but the customer service is so so wonderful!  Linda (the seller of this product) sent an extra gift along with my large plumping enhancer.  But, I will not say what the gift was, you must purchase this item yourself to see what it is ;).  She also gives you her personal number and email so you can contact her with any problems or questions you may have.  This lip plumping enhancer really works and lasts for hours.  If you&#x27;re looking for a lip plumper without the surgery this product is for you!</li>
            <li> it plumps my lips for real but it left red spot cause i was sucking so hard</li>
            <li> So at first it didn&#x27;t give me results I wanted.. DONT PANIC.. You have to continue to use this in order to achieve maximum results. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now and I love it!!!! I do it whenever I feel just to kind of &amp;#34;train&amp;#34; my lips. I would recommened this to anyone, it works amazing!!!! As far as how long it lasts, it does really depend on how often and how long you use it. Such a great invention!!!!</li>
            <li> I received my Fullips super fast after ordering and immediately tore into my package.  Within 3 minutes I had amazing, luscious, pouty lips! My natural lips are not that thin but very wrinkled &amp; Fullips helped stretch out the wrinkles and give my lips the appearance of being smoother.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  And my plumped up lips lasted about 3 hours!! Thank you for this great product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product took me a couple trys to get the hang of it but once I did I fell in love</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m not doing it right, but it didn&#x27;t work for me. I watched YouTube videos and all...</li>
            <li> The product is A WASTE OF MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> I got an extra one in the mail which was great because I ordered it as a gift so I got to use it myself! My sisters use to suck bottles when they were younger as a joke, but this has the same effect, just not as exaggerated! It also doesn&#x27;t leave a ring around the lips like the bottle did! Super fun!</li>
            <li> The enhancer really does work! Very pleased with this purchase and the help that I received from Brooklyn, she even threw in the medium size enhancer for free:)</li>
            <li> Oh yes this is the product to have for making those lips more plump and sexy. I carry it everywhere. Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> looks like I received the small instead of the large.  But I don&#x27;t know since it did not say so on the packaging.  I cant get a good seal for it to work.  They are made very well and shipped out very quickly.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! Dumbest product ever!! Swells your lips for 2 minutes. Its extremely awkward (and uncomfortable) to suck on the hard plastic. My lips were purple for 2 days after. It literally bruised my lips.</li>
            <li> I love the Fullips lip enhancers! I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference it makes. My lips are full and healthy looking. Love it!</li>
            <li> Works great- jus don&#x27;t overdue it -- I did and my lips were sore the next day</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking that the plumping effect would last at least for a few hours. I&#x27;ve had this for almost a year now, ( the medium and the large round) and o have been doing it correctly and my lips look fabulous once I&#x27;m finished with the suction, however, a few minutes later my lips begin to deflate. Ladies, if you really want full plump lips temporarily, you&#x27;d do better with a lip liner and/or lip injections. Save up for that, it&#x27;s way worth it. I have nothing against the seller, she was generous enough to send me the extra large round, but speaking in all honesty, this product isn&#x27;t worth the price tag as the results do not last. If any of you ladies could give me some advice to make it last longer than 5-10 mins, please do tell! :)</li>
            <li> I TOTALLY love this item! It really gives you that big lip! I&#x27;m just a bit disappointed it doesn&#x27;t last longer than 2 hours id like to go out and look good not just in my selfies you know..</li>
            <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t too happy with the actual plumping enhancer, but the sell was so wonderful they deserve 5 stars anyway. Thank you for everything.</li>
            <li> Wow! This is such a neat product! I have relatively full lips for their size, but I&#x27;ve always been looking for a little extra &#x27;oomph&#x27; and fullness. Well I sure found the right product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The enhancer comes in a mesh red drawstring baggie along with instructions that are underlined with the most important things. They&#x27;re quite easy to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first received this product I was so excited to try it out. To my disappointment it didn&#x27;t do much for me and what results it Did give me, faded fast. Well I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t give up! It seems practice makes perfect really rings true with this product.. The 2nd time using it, my results where 10x better. I emailed company asking for any tips after my first failed use, and to my surprise, Linda the owner of the company personally responded! How often do you see that with a product?! She wrote me long detailed emails with helpful tips. You can tell she really does care about her customers and wants you to love her product! I would give the customer service alone 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a little bit of playing with the product and getting used to it, I can have full pouty lips whenever I want. I think the most important thing with this product is making sure you are drinking enough water because it works by drawing the fluid in your lips forward to plump then.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that I love about this product is that you can customize your results! You can just give yourself a little boost or you can turn your lips into Angelina Jolie&#x27;s depending on how long and how you use your enhancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I like to over do my lips where they look kinda ridiculous, like I just got a fresh injection of juvederm (not the look I want in public) because by the time I&#x27;m ready to go out they will have gone down a bit to the perfect size that looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is truly a great product and if you have any troubles Linda is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I would suggest doing this product before makeup because the foundation can rub off into the enhancer. Another thing is that the enhancer can sometimes leave lines around your mouth so if you put makeup on after you can cover those if they haven&#x27;t faded by then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have attached picture of how my lips are normally (I just cropped a picture of myself) and then after using the enhancer for a while to achieve maximum results.because the foundation can rub off into the enhancer. Another thing is that the enhancer can sometimes leave lines around your mouth so if you put makeup on after you can cover those if they haven&#x27;t faded by then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have attached picture of how my lips are normally (I just cropped a picture of myself) and then after using the enhancer for a while to achieve maximum results.</li>
            <li> shipping was fast and I even got a extra plumper! I love the way it makes my lips look only downside is that it only lasts for no more than 5 minutes. Ive followed instructions, seen the videos and it&#x27;s a shame that it doesn&#x27;t last as long for me as it does for others. Would give it 5 stars if it would at least last for an hour.</li>
            <li> S&amp;uacute;per easy to use!! And For some reason I got two! Thanks!</li>
            <li> This works so well. I was really contemplating getting lip injections but I purchased this first. It took me a few try&#x27;s to get the hang of it but once I did the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> It works great, gets the job done within minutes, extremely friendly service, just wish they would last fuller longer but everyone is different. Will post a before and after picture</li>
            <li> It does work but it won&#x27;t last for more than 45 minutes so you have to keep doing it, which is annoying and inconvenient at moments.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the results, from what I saw on Instagram to what I got after use wasn&#x27;t worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> As someone with a small mouth and thin lips, this thing is a blessing. The effect on me isn&#x27;t Kylie Jenner crazy big, but makes my lips look noticeably fuller and draws more attention to my lips - especially with lip balm or lip gloss on. I got the large as a complementary one after ordering the medium oval - I thought it&#x27;d be too big but it actually worked better than the medium!</li>
            <li> these didnt work for my lips specifically but the product is great! so is the customer service I would recommend these to anyone that wanted fuller lips</li>
            <li> This actually works!! The seller is very kind and included instructions and her personal email in case i had questions. I did watch a few videos to make sure I was doing it correctly. Now, i can get very full lips in less than a minute, and i think that over time, they get larger as well, and rounder looking.</li>
            <li> Works well. Not as long as I expected</li>
            <li> does make your lips bigger for a few min, looks a little bruised or discolored</li>
            <li> Lasts all of ten minutes. It clearly states that it can last for hours but it doesn&#x27;t. And I tried manyyyy times, three days straight, holding it for long periods of time, different ways etc. it does get bigger with each suction but the results do NOT last hours as stated. I guess it would be better suited for pictures.</li>
            <li> Did exactly what I expected it to do. I love them. The more frequent you use them the longer the fullness will last.</li>
            <li> This product really does work! Just do not suck too hard as it will cause bruising on your lips. Take it little by little to get a very natural looking plump. I make sure I put some lip balm on before I use it as well. It is now a part of my beautify routine! I let it work its magic while I am applying my eye and face makeup. By the time I finish the rest of my face, my lips are plumped, hydrated, smooth, and ready for lipstick application. I strongly recommend you watch the tutorial videos as well. I love this lip enhancer because it gives me a sexy pout that lasts for hours, and I don&#x27;t have to risk looking like a fish by getting lip augmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: If you have thin lips, I recommend you buy the large oval shape. If you have normal or thicker lips you should buy the round circle shape. I received a small oval enhancer as a little added gift, which was so sweet, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend spending money on it. It is very small and only servers to enhance the shape of your cupid&#x27;s bow. I use the small oval occasionally if I feel like having my lips 100% on point.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like they make it seem&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this</li>
            <li> It was for my wife, fits the requirement and she was so happy.  Good quality and swift shipping on time.</li>
            <li> Unless you are Jay Z do not get the &amp;#34;Large&amp;#34;. I thought I had a big mouth but apparently not. I still use it since I purchased it but its too big for my mouth.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have lasting results. Plump lips for maybe 5 mins tops.</li>
            <li> Great little tool to have in your purse for those last minute presentations!</li>
            <li> You get what you want, full lips!</li>
            <li> Did not work not happy!</li>
            <li> I returned them it was not what I thought it would,be</li>
            <li> OK, so I literally bought these yesterday and I got to say I love love love what is does. I already have full lips but just wanted a little more of a kick and It&#x27;s perfect. Also love how they send you 2 so you get 2 for the price of 1. I highly recommend theses if your not looking for anything permanent. Have to also add that you may have to do it a couple times through out the day but It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I am buying this product again for my sister,, it really works!</li>
            <li> Ugh. I got this last week, and it bruised the hell out of my mouth and really didn&#x27;t do anything to my lips. I have full lips naturally and read all the reviews and tips saying to get the large one so I did and it doesn&#x27;t fit my mouth right at all and it makes it impossible for my top lip to get full without my mouth bruising. I&#x27;m so disappointed and wish I could send this back and get a different one but if the large doesn&#x27;t work I&#x27;m sure the others won&#x27;t either.</li>
            <li> It works really good&lt;br /&gt;But it stay not that long maybe 1hour?&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why i keep using that when i go out.</li>
            <li> I Got The Right Size But Did Not Like The Way My Lips Looked Afterwards</li>
            <li> Works great ! In love with this i go nowhere without this :D</li>
            <li> This works, but you need to practice! It&#x27;s not easy at first, but after a few times you will see the difference! I love it!</li>
            <li> 1. Fullips works.  Even if you use it the night before, in the morning your lips are still fuller.  I&#x27;ve had lip fillers in the past, and this gives the SAME look.  It can even be too much, if you&#x27;re not careful.&lt;br /&gt;2. Customer service is amazing.  Seriously, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Linda and how prompt and helpful she is.  Amazing.</li>
            <li> Ordered the large round and received the small oval FOR FREE! These things are amazing! I have small mouth, thin lips. Not anymore! Easy to use. Carry mine with me everywhere I go. My husband loves my new look and I feel much more confident!</li>
            <li> This little plastic device does what it says! It is very fun and so easy to use. It comes in a cute red bag and the device in seperate plastic containers. You also get two (which I wasn&#x27;t expecting yet a delightful surprise) the size you choose and the small one. In my case the large and small Fullips. In all, I recommend this product to anyone who uses lip plumper gloss or any lip enhancer of any sort. You see a dramatic result and it isn&#x27;t permanent so you don&#x27;t have to worry losing your natural lip look.</li>
            <li> I love the enhancers I originally ordered the large round and got a medium oval for free. It came with a lovely personalized note. So far the results are phenomenal! I see myself using these every single day. Results look natural and you&#x27;re in control of how big you&#x27;d like to go. The package came with full instructions and arrived so much sooner than I thought</li>
            <li> Technically these work, but unless you want to run to the bathroom every hour to re-plump, it&#x27;s not super exciting. I will say it&#x27;s great for photos.</li>
            <li> Its good but doesnt last and It totalmy bruises. I still havent gotten the hang of it</li>
            <li> This product really works. I&#x27;m still getting the hang of it but I will tell all my friends about it loved it.</li>
            <li> This product does work!!!&lt;br /&gt;But does not last long at all...&lt;br /&gt;It only lasted 10 minutes and I used it everyday for 3 days just to see if it would last longer😁😁😁&lt;br /&gt;I feel ripped off&lt;br /&gt;Not even 1 hour</li>
            <li> IT DOES PLUMP AS PROMISED, BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE NEXT DAY MY LIPS WERE BRUISED BLACK AND BLUE.</li>
            <li> Love this company, love this product!</li>
            <li> Amazing! Super fast shipping, thank you so much! This product definitely makes my lips look fuller and plumper. I am overall ecstatic about this purchase!</li>
            <li> The BEST customer service! Linda, the owner, helped me to find the best size for my needs, was absolutely wonderful when I changed my order and answered my emails very promptly, unheard of in this day and age. The item came promptly in the mail, less than a week. I&#x27;m still getting the hang of it, but it lasts for a couple of hours. I can definitely tell a difference,and the look is natural, not &amp;#34;ducklips&amp;#34;. I highly recommend Fullips, especially for us ladies of a certain age with slightly thinner lips. Now I have the same volume to my lips that I had 20 years ago. Make sure you watch the how to videos on the website. Very helpful!</li>
            <li> They really do work but after 30 mins, they go back to normal.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Never wrote an online review until now! So simple. I was nervous bc anytime I try a &amp;#34;miracle product&amp;#34; it doesn&#x27;t work,  but this truly does!</li>
            <li> Definetly works! Loved this product</li>
