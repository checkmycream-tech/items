    <ol>
            <li> I bought my first pair of these at Bed Bath and Beyond. These shears are AWESOME.</li>
            <li> As described and served their temporary purpose</li>
            <li> You know how you can just tell when you have a quality product in your hands. This is it.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality, sharp and a good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tweezerman tweezers for years, so when I needed salon scissors I was glad to see they had a product available. These are lightweight and feel comfortable in my hand. Great product!</li>
            <li> Very nice feel and excellent quality.  These are also a very good size for personal use, one feature I like is the tip isn&#x27;t too sharp incase you accidentally stab yourself :-) while trimming your self in the mirror.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The scissors are sharp but very stiff. May improve with time but it made cutting more difficult.</li>
            <li> work well for at home hair cuts. nothing too amazing but worth the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent great product &amp; fairly priced.</li>
            <li> Perfect cut, perfect size. I love it.</li>
            <li> The Tweezerman 2000 scissors are a great value for the price on Amazon.com.  I have paid much more for comparable  quality scissors in past.</li>
            <li> I love this scissors - just the right size for cutting hair and really sharp.</li>
            <li> Good quality and as advertised</li>
            <li> Finally, a sharp shear!</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice clean cut for trimming my hair. Bring a lefty they feel comfortable in by hand.</li>
            <li> I bought these needing a pair of quality shears to trim off my split ends. Since I don&#x27;t plan on doing any major haircutting, these are wonderful. They feel very strong, sturdy, heavy, and have a nice smooth open-close. (I also have small hands so these work well for me)</li>
            <li> High quality.  As described.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> These are SHARP and well made.  Their tweezers have gone downhill over the years but the scissors are fine.</li>
            <li> Great first pair of scissors ! They are sharp and precise! Love them.</li>
            <li> These are very sharp scissors that leave my hair with blunt, healthy ends.</li>
            <li> Did my own haircut and worked wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Very terrific scissors. Best I have tried!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these before and I use them on my dog who has fine hair and they cut so effortlessly, no snagging and makes it easier to make precise cuts. Is super sharp. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> These scissors are very sharp and were exactly what I was looking for. It is perfect for trimming my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> good product, prompt delivery</li>
            <li> So disappointed receiving these scissors only to find them old and worn with a total faded patina.&lt;br /&gt;Not shiny, and they appear to be used and VERY old,&lt;br /&gt;even the logo printed is faded and older style than pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had no idea Amazon would fulfill USED, OLD Scissors for Hair.&lt;br /&gt;Very disgusting and even if sterilized, they don&#x27;t flow well.  They are too old &amp; used, it looks like I&#x27;ve had them for 20 years.</li>
            <li> Very good scissors. I use them to cut my son&#x27;s hair... yes I know, still they do the magic and his hair cuts are great. They one I have is made in Italy it is not heavy and easy to handle. I tried some 6+ inches made in China and I couldn&#x27;t get used to them. Worth the money invested.</li>
            <li> Perfect item. I cut my families hair and these are the best that I have found.&lt;br /&gt;Good price for the quality.</li>
            <li> Absolutely superb quality and sharpness. I&#x27;d give them 5 stars except the loops are so small, I really have to concentrate to keep my fingers properly in them. For slender-fingered people, these will be a wonderful tool. For sausage-fingered dudes like me, they are worth buying but a little finicky to use.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product.  Precision stainless steel.  Very well made.</li>
            <li> I use these to cut my bangs and do monthly microtrims.&lt;br /&gt;They work great.&lt;br /&gt;Not much else to say, they&#x27;re shears.</li>
            <li> love the size of the blades -(Length_) and clean cut and just what I needed to do self trimming of hair..My first hair cutting scissors and will so enjoy using them</li>
            <li> These are great scissors for my purposes. Used them several times, haven&#x27;t started rusting or anything.</li>
            <li> I use these these to groom my Yorkie :) They&#x27;re perfect. Nice clean cuts and the dull tip helps to prevent injury.</li>
            <li> packaged very well. Very sharp. Nice weight to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a couple years now and they are still very sharp.  Love these.  They feel like quality.</li>
            <li> Keeps me from the salon every couple of weeks to trim my bangs!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a scissor like any other scissor, the only reason i got this one rather rather than paying $7 for a normal one, is Quality. you can get this and don&#x27;t worry about replacing for the next decade, &amp;#34;unless they came out with robotic scissors that trim the hair automatically while you are sleeping&amp;#34; lol,</li>
            <li> Used this to replace aging scissors that we use for glooming our Standard Schnauzer show dogs couldn&#x27;t be happer with the service highly recommended</li>
            <li> These shears are very sharp and do the job well  9/2/2016 Update:  After 1 year they still are sharp and work great.  One thing I found is that they cut dry hair much better than wet.  There are some applications that necessitate cutting dry hair; these sheers are perfect.</li>
            <li> These are the best shears for haircutting that we have come across.  They stay sharp, are small enough to stay precise, and are very durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Bought two pair of these sheers...One for my own use and one to give away...I use them for haircuts for myself and also to trim up our two Shih Tzu pups...They are sharp and smooth...The cut is so clean and precise....Makes pup haircuts go much faster...They are the perfect size to use around the face of pups where safety is a concern...They are the best scissors I have ever used and I highly recommend them...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good quality and really easy to use even for me, as such a clumsy person. The scissors are really sharp as well. I use it to trim my fringe, then I accidentally cut my finger. The point is even the point can cut hair nicely. Definitely love it.</li>
            <li> Best ones that she has tried.  doesn&#x27;t slip while cutting hair.  Here are the 9 more words that are required.</li>
            <li> For little fairies. These are TINY</li>
            <li> These work better for blunt cuts or hacks lol. They need to be lighter and more pointy at the end for precision hair cutting but they do do the job. If you are looking for some that are easily handled and lightweight these are NOT the ones. But they will get the job done.</li>
            <li> Great quality in this pair of scissors.  The fit nice in the hand, are sharp and  do what I required for keeping my beard trimmed well.</li>
            <li> Best scissors for hair. They stay sharp a long time. This is my second pair. First pair still work after 15yrs and no sharpening! I am a retired hairdresser and use these for mine and my husbands&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something better than drug-store cheapie hair scissors.  These do well.  The blades shear closely, and the sharpened metal surfaces are precise.  The pivot movement is nice.  All-in-all a good pair of scissors.</li>
            <li> For some reason, these popped up in a search for left-handed scissors, and I didn&#x27;t read the description closely enough to see that they weren&#x27;t. Not to worry, the customer service response was excellent! I would buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> Extremely sharp and do the job perfectly.  Just what I expected from Tweezerman. I use their tweezers and their scissors fit the bill.</li>
            <li> Love these shears, they work great, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and easy to use, but only if you have small fingers.</li>
            <li> I really like these shears, I use them to cut my children&#x27;s hair, I would recommend this item, thank you.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with how these cut. I think they are a good value and would try some of this brands offerings</li>
            <li> These are super nice, cut smooth and precise.</li>
            <li> Got these to replace my old tweezerman scissors that I had bought 10 or so years ago, they were nearly identical and lasted a super long time. Totally worth every cent.</li>
            <li> These shears are a great buy for such a quality and sharp-cutting product. They fit my hand great and get every last hair cut.</li>
            <li> Just purchase these shears and for the price I am very satisfied.  Good quality and sharp.  Can you pay more and get more . . . yes, but if you are not a professional these should work just fine.  My seller had retail package . . .. would purchase again.  Enough said . . . if you need a pair of shears at a good price point . . . then buy these . . . no need to wait . . . if you need more you&#x27;re going to have to pay a lot more.</li>
            <li> I have always liked the Tweezerman products. They are high quality and ship in very sturdy storage cases. The Stainless 2000 Shears are ideal for family hair cutting. They are extremely sharp and built to last. They come with a plastic storage case. I tried a couple of cheaper scissors from Amazon in the past, and they don&#x27;t compare with this model. Scissors are so rarely purchased, I figured it made sense to spend a little more and get something that would last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written by Arthur Bradley, author of The Handbook to Practical Disaster Preparedness for the Family.</li>
            <li> Not sharp at all.  I will return the scissors.</li>
            <li> Super sharp. I use for my hair and to trim hairs close to my face. They work great!</li>
            <li> I was so surprised how sharp and clip hair piece of cake.  Really feel professional quality.</li>
            <li> I would like them better if the tip was more pointed. It&#x27;s like a very dull pencil. But the blades are sharp.</li>
            <li> Work effectively.  Came in nice little storage case (if needed).  Are a bit smaller than I expected.  I realize the dimensions are provided, but never know if the size given is the length of the blade or overall length or some other dimension.  Great for trimming.  Not intended for heavier cuts.</li>
            <li> verry nice was real pleased with it shipped fast in good time boxed good will buy some more in future</li>
            <li> Great Scissors. Met all my expectations.</li>
