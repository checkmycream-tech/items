    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I have arthritis in my hands and find that these finger sleeves are excellent to relieve pain when just one or two finger joints are swollen and achy.  </li>
            <li>But great value!  </li>
            <li>They did a great job of protecting the skin during this time!</li>
            <li>These finger sleeves are amazing!!</li>
            <li>THESE WORK BEAUTIFULLY.</li>
            <li>Work great at reducing swelling, just wish they were about a 1/2&amp;#34; longer.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I have a fractured joint, and these protectors have been a great camouflage of my swollen knuckle from surgery.  </li>
            <li>Great for unstable fingers that spend a lot of time on the computer</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>She is very happy and when the wife is good, life is good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of a germaphobe!</li>
            <li>Good try but</li>
            <li>This works and it is also looks good with matching uniform.</li>
            <li>Not a cure by any means just good support.  </li>
            <li>I will order more of these for my mom - she is so happy with them.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>These keep very nice compression on my fingers, and keep shape better than anything I had used.</li>
            <li>if you know someone with mild arthritis this is very good for them.</li>
            <li>bought them to keep my finger joints warm and somewhat immobilized in my sleep, they did not work.</li>
            <li>for the softness of it, gave a surprisingly stable fitness so it eliminated stress and made the hand/finger feel better in the way it promised.</li>
            <li>These finger support help warma and keep my fingers warm and gives some support...</li>
            <li>These are good quality and fit well.</li>
            <li>My cats absconded with most of them, and I used one as a makeup applicator in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;Useless for fingers, entertaining for cats.</li>
            <li>DONT feel that safe with it on</li>
            <li>I thought they would be more compression-like</li>
            <li>These are okay.</li>
            <li>and I need something semi-flexible to be able to do things with my hands.</li>
            <li>This was more comfortable than the metallic finger splints I was suppose to wear whilst recovering from trigger fingers.  </li>
            <li>They provide support as stated but they easy get snagged...also it should state what length and size are recommended.</li>
            <li>They may suit your needs just fine, but not mine.</li>
            <li>They are very comfortable and offer just the right amount of support.</li>
            <li>They really worked to keep finger warm and kept me from bending it all the way while healing.</li>
            <li>Light support but still free movement</li>
            <li>and I wanted something that was comfortable and may reduce the chances of me spraining my fingers.</li>
            <li>I have advanced arthritis.  </li>
            <li>Cheap..very cheap..</li>
            <li>These sleeves pull on and off easily, and they look fairly decent (good enough to wear to work if needed), but they tend to shred fairly quickly, so don&#x27;t expect to be able to wear them more than once or twice.</li>
            <li>I originally thought there&#x27;s no way I need or use 10 of these</li>
            <li>My calluses work better than these ;-)</li>
            <li>It works great for a week or so - then it&#x27;s not so effective (loses its stretchability/elasticity in my experience).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient to have some where ever I am. :)</li>
            <li>Its surprising that these finger sleeves actually provide some stability and protection for the finger.</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t had a chance to use them in order to give a true evaluation.</li>
            <li>It was easy to fit over the knuckle, was soft and flexible, and camouflaged soiling.  </li>
            <li>and it keeps my fingers from popping and snapping as well as extra warm underneath gloves.  </li>
            <li>They fit me ok, but they are Nylon material which is kinda slick causing some gripping issues.</li>
            <li>I ordered these after finger surgery when my fingers were very sensitive to pressure as well as a light touch.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my strained index finger warm and loose.</li>
            <li>I loved these for everyday use while I was healing from a broken/dislocated finger.</li>
            <li>they work good but wear down fast</li>
            <li>However, the knit can come apart very quickly if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>After stretched out was some better</li>
            <li>Way too large for my fingers &amp; slide off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll most likely buy a new set when my others have worn out.&lt;br /&gt;Side</li>
            <li>Thanks anyway.  </li>
            <li>No compression, even on very swollen finger joint.</li>
            <li>However, when I don&#x27;t have these splints on, I needed some support to help keep my fingers straight.</li>
            <li>These supports are very helpful.</li>
            <li>When I ordered I really didn&#x27;t think they would help.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>More like little finger sweaters.</li>
            <li>I like the fabric and compression, although I would prefer a little denser fabric that would provide more compression on the joint.</li>
            <li>They handled my issue professionally, would absolutely buy from them again.</li>
            <li>I used these for a reptitive motion injury at work where I had strained several tendons in my right hand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried the black neoprene finger supports and those tend to get worn and tear easily.</li>
            <li>Even with a minimal amount of loose threads, I love these things.</li>
            <li>Much nicer than the medical ones, because there is no chafing from a seam.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They&#x27;ve lasted much longer than the white elastic ones I had from Asics and don&#x27;t stretch out over time...</li>
            <li>I gave them away to young basketball player,you did&#x27;t show a larger finger sleeve support for me.  </li>
            <li>Not tight enough for my fingers, I&#x27;m a woman with relatively small hands and while the sleeves were comfortable they didn&#x27;t compress enough to either stay on or provide support.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am a very active person main sport is basket ball</li>
            <li> the large is to small.</li>
            <li> Too smooth to improve grip, too flexible to stabilize joints, I guess they could be a weird alternative to wearing gloves.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so be careful when you have them next to anything with velcro.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are working out great for my finger with very bad arthritis.</li>
            <li> My other blue ones had shrunk since I tossed them in the dryer as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> throw them in the washer and let them air dry...</li>
            <li> Seriously, they do absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Compression was a bit tight for what I wanted it for, actually gave me a purple finger tip.</li>
            <li> These were not what I expected but the vender is who gets 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve got just enough pressure and support to help when my fingers get stiff.</li>
            <li> So I just have to be careful that the two shall not meet !!</li>
            <li> Bought these to protect a wounded thumb after stitches were removed, seem to be working pretty well to keep wound from getting dirty during work.</li>
            <li> It is like putting little sweaters on your fingers.</li>
            <li> Not very supportive.  </li>
            <li> There was sufficient padding to protect, yet was not stiff or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> As with any product used all day and everyday it will wear out.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money and my time.</li>
            <li> I had purchased other finger sleeves that stretched too quickly, or looked absolutely disgusting after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> Fabric is thick knit, so if you are looking for &#x27;sweaters&#x27; for your fingers, these may work.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to protect a painful arthritic finger joint that was constantly getting bumped and banged around.</li>
            <li> They are so thin that I have no idea</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re big, floppy, and worthless.</li>
            <li> it is too soft and useless!!!  </li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but functional.</li>
            <li> that I had to keep cutting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that I bought these.</li>
            <li> but I find it annoying to wear around the house since I have to remove it every time I wash my hands...</li>
            <li> Horrible product!</li>

            <li> Good try but the large is to small.I gave them away to young basketball player,you did&#x27;t show a larger finger sleeve support for me.  Thanks anyway.  Mike</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my hands and find that these finger sleeves are excellent to relieve pain when just one or two finger joints are swollen and achy.  The gray color finger sleeves do not seem to call attention to my hands when going out in public the way wearing compression gloves does.</li>
            <li> They are working out great for my finger with very bad arthritis. It cushions it and protects it.</li>
            <li> Much nicer than the medical ones, because there is no chafing from a seam.  I will order more of these for my mom - she is so happy with them.</li>
            <li> Not tight enough for my fingers, I&#x27;m a woman with relatively small hands and while the sleeves were comfortable they didn&#x27;t compress enough to either stay on or provide support.</li>
            <li> No compression, even on very swollen finger joint. Fabric is thick knit, so if you are looking for &#x27;sweaters&#x27; for your fingers, these may work.</li>
            <li> I am a Letter Carrier for USPS and I use these daily.  As with any product used all day and everyday it will wear out.  I use athletic tape at the ends of these and it keeps my fingers from popping and snapping as well as extra warm underneath gloves.  I have bought several packs of these....</li>
            <li> I loved these for everyday use while I was healing from a broken/dislocated finger. They really worked to keep finger warm and kept me from bending it all the way while healing.</li>
            <li> Work great at reducing swelling, just wish they were about a 1/2&amp;#34; longer.</li>
            <li> Light support but still free movement</li>
            <li> They are so thin that I have no idea what purpose they&#x27;re supposed to serve. Too smooth to improve grip, too flexible to stabilize joints, I guess they could be a weird alternative to wearing gloves.&lt;br /&gt;I bought them to keep my finger joints warm and somewhat immobilized in my sleep, they did not work. I could still make a fist etc. My cats absconded with most of them, and I used one as a makeup applicator in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;Useless for fingers, entertaining for cats.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product. I am a very active person main sport is basket ball and I wanted something that was comfortable and may reduce the chances of me spraining my fingers. This works and it is also looks good with matching uniform.</li>
            <li> if you know someone with mild arthritis this is very good for them. It is like putting little sweaters on your fingers.</li>
            <li> These were not what I expected but the vender is who gets 5 stars.  They handled my issue professionally, would absolutely buy from them again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something with a snug, but this will work.</li>
            <li> I have carpal tunnel in both hands.  These finger sleeves seem to help them whenever I&#x27;m using my ipad or computer.</li>
            <li> it is too soft and useless!!!  Don&#x27;t know why it is manufactured and for what?  Just throw away and put it into the garbage can now.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 sets and did receive 2 but the 2nd one does not have the NINJA logo and is obviously different. The 2nd set was a gift for a friend so I hope it holds up well. I bought these for arthritis not sports. I HA a couple fingers that the warmth seems to help. With these I don&#x27;t have to wear the compression gloves that I bought unless my entire hand is hurting. Seems like it may unravel on the edges. We will see.</li>
            <li> Bought these to protect a wounded thumb after stitches were removed, seem to be working pretty well to keep wound from getting dirty during work.</li>
            <li> I had Cubital Tunnel Syndrome (ulnar nerve entrapment) which caused pain and loss of feeling in my hand and severe clawing in my pinky and ring finger.  After surgery, I began occupational therapy. I have several \\&quot;rigid\\&quot; finger splints that my therapists designed which I wear at night and at various times during the day. However, when I don&#x27;t have these splints on, I needed some support to help keep my fingers straight. THESE WORK BEAUTIFULLY. They are very comfortable and offer just the right amount of support. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  Way too large for my fingers &amp; slide off.  Not very supportive.  More like little finger sweaters.</li>
            <li> I have a fractured joint, and these protectors have been a great camouflage of my swollen knuckle from surgery.  I wish they lasted a bit longer....they do get soiled and start to unravel after 3-4 days wear.  But great value!  I will order again</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all! It does not provide any type of support to your fingers. Horrible product!</li>
            <li> I use them for a finger (DIP) joint which has been ravaged my osteoarthritis.  It protects it some from bumping but I find it annoying to wear around the house since I have to remove it every time I wash my hands...I&#x27;m kind of a germaphobe!</li>
            <li> Great for unstable fingers that spend a lot of time on the computer</li>
            <li> they work good but wear down fast</li>
            <li> I WISH IT WAS TIGHTER ON MY FINGER.&lt;br /&gt;I DONT feel that safe with it on so what i do it put tape over it.</li>
            <li> This was more comfortable than the metallic finger splints I was suppose to wear whilst recovering from trigger fingers.  If I wore two sleeves on each of the finger it restricted my movements enough but left it functional.  Also whilst sleeping the metallic splint kept coming off whereas these stayed on.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be more compression-like and they are not. They are very big too. They are being returned.</li>
            <li> Purchase for spouse needs. She is very happy and when the wife is good, life is good. It is just what she needed/wanted and fulfills its purpose well.</li>
            <li> Even with a minimal amount of loose threads, I love these things. My fingers have just started having issues with arthritis so these guards are just what I need. They&#x27;ve got just enough pressure and support to help when my fingers get stiff. Not a cure by any means just good support.  I&#x27;ll most likely buy a new set when my others have worn out.&lt;br /&gt;Side Note: I originally thought there&#x27;s no way I need or use 10 of these but I was wrong. I&#x27;ve got some at work, in my purse, downstairs and by my bed. It&#x27;s very convenient to have some where ever I am. :)</li>
            <li> I have advanced arthritis.  Especially in my fingers. These supports are very helpful. But the problem that I have is that I must also wear wrist supports that have velcro closures. And the material from the finger support always gets hung up on the Velcro. So I just have to be careful that the two shall not meet !!</li>
            <li> I got these for making paracord stuff because I was getting blisters on my blisters. They fit me ok, but they are Nylon material which is kinda slick causing some gripping issues. Plus, they all had threads coming off everywhere that I had to keep cutting. They may suit your needs just fine, but not mine. My calluses work better than these ;-)</li>
            <li> no miracle cure for the finger.. but this product did just as promised until the surgery came up. for the softness of it, gave a surprisingly stable fitness so it eliminated stress and made the hand/finger feel better in the way it promised. i would recommend it for joint pains from typing, etc.</li>
            <li> These sleeves pull on and off easily, and they look fairly decent (good enough to wear to work if needed), but they tend to shred fairly quickly, so don&#x27;t expect to be able to wear them more than once or twice.</li>
            <li> This item was purchased to protect an arthritic finger knuckle.  It was easy to fit over the knuckle, was soft and flexible, and camouflaged soiling.  There was sufficient padding to protect, yet was not stiff or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I suffer from severe arthritis in my fingers. These finger sleeves are amazing!! When I ordered I really didn&#x27;t think they would help. Instant pain relief!!! Great product.</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but functional. It keeps my strained index finger warm and loose. Plus it matches my basketball gear.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to protect a painful arthritic finger joint that was constantly getting bumped and banged around. Its surprising that these finger sleeves actually provide some stability and protection for the finger. I will keep a supply of these on hand.</li>
            <li> These are okay. My biggest gripe is that they need to be in sizes. Compression was a bit tight for what I wanted it for, actually gave me a purple finger tip. After stretched out was some better</li>
            <li> Bought for my husbands sprained/strained ring finger so he could return to the golf coarse. Hasn&#x27;t had a chance to use them in order to give a true evaluation.</li>
            <li> I play volleyball 3-4 times a week. I&#x27;m an outside hitter. These finger support help warma and keep my fingers warm and gives some support... It also helps with ball handling since they help absorb the sweat and also helps with impact against the floor when I pancake the  ball... I&#x27;m so used to them psychologically that I feel I don&#x27;t play as well without them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I throw them in the washer and let them air dry... My other blue ones had shrunk since I tossed them in the dryer as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;ve lasted much longer than the white elastic ones I had from Asics and don&#x27;t stretch out over time... I&#x27;ve also tried the black neoprene finger supports and those tend to get worn and tear easily. These seem durable but the thread has started to fray so be careful when you have them next to anything with velcro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I&#x27;ve had a bunch of setters ask me where I got them and a couple have ended up purchasing them as well.</li>
            <li> Cheap..very cheap..no support at all..the are unravelled in package and come apart the stitching on finger..and my finger fits it..no access stretching..wast of money</li>
            <li> They provide support as stated but they easy get snagged...also it should state what length and size are recommended.</li>
            <li> It works great for a week or so - then it&#x27;s not so effective (loses its stretchability/elasticity in my experience).</li>
            <li> The ones that I received fell apart in short order, and did not have the Ninja logo.  I suspect that these are inferior imitations.</li>
            <li> I like the fabric and compression, although I would prefer a little denser fabric that would provide more compression on the joint. I am using them for finger joints that lock and I need something semi-flexible to be able to do things with my hands. I did notice that the edge started fraying after one use. We&#x27;ll see how the rest of them do after awhile.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re big, floppy, and worthless. Seriously, they do absolutely nothing. I&#x27;m disappointed that I bought these. Waste of money and my time.</li>
            <li> These are good quality and fit well. I wear a size 8 ring so you can judge by that.</li>
            <li> I used these for a reptitive motion injury at work where I had strained several tendons in my right hand. I had purchased other finger sleeves that stretched too quickly, or looked absolutely disgusting after a couple uses. These keep very nice compression on my fingers, and keep shape better than anything I had used. However, the knit can come apart very quickly if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> I ordered these after finger surgery when my fingers were very sensitive to pressure as well as a light touch.  They did a great job of protecting the skin during this time! Highly recommend!</li>
