            <li>Nice case.</li>
            <li>nice case</li>
            <li>So if you don&#x27;t know what a tool is for you are kind of out of luck.</li>
            <li>The case to keep the stuff in is nice.</li>
            <li>excellent experience, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This is a nice kit</li>
            <li>Nice set for toenails.</li>
            <li>It was perfect and fast delivery</li>
            <li>The carrying pouch is a nice quality, and I like having a place to store all my nail-care supplies.  </li>
            <li>The clippers are good but not as easy to use as I hoped.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the excellent quality of this set.  </li>
            <li>The carrying case is really nice since these are exactly the kind of tools that I lose all the time!  </li>
            <li>Good set of tools in one convenient case, adequate quality from Pakistan.</li>
            <li>But with this contraption it really alleviated my stress</li>
            <li>You have to exert more pressure than you should for clippers like these.</li>
            <li>I love the carry case</li>
            <li>But clipping your toenails should be a DIY project for most people.  </li>
            <li>Drug store Revlon nippers work much better.</li>
            <li>I am sure there are Doctors that can get their hands on better quality, but I can&#x27;t find it on the internet.  </li>
            <li>So glad I did.</li>
            <li>it seems that I got a used one, all in dust, many scrathes, and guys</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying that this will cure your ingrown toe nail, but it will sure help you take it out while you go to the doctor to find a more permanent solution.</li>
            <li>Glad to have it then a visit to the doctor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>Works best on the big toe.</li>
            <li>For the money, it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>Has eliminated a visit to the doc because I was able to take care of it myself.</li>
            <li>but sure it&#x27;ll work well when I do.  </li>
            <li>Has everything needed to do a nice, clean job.</li>
            <li>Not Bad, best I have found thus far for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the tools provided in here are pretty good.</li>
            <li>Only thing good is the nail lifter is a good ear pick though,.....</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a gift for a relative with  ingrown Toe Nail and have been told this is a very good product.</li>
            <li>Got the set on time and so far happy with using it.</li>
            <li>Since I bought this set primarily for the clippers - I am satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>Really felt good.  </li>
            <li>and it was so easy to fix.  </li>
            <li>The pouch keeps them organized and easy to find.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use tools to help with an ingrown toenail.  </li>
            <li>Great product - worth the $$$ to get the whole kit.</li>
            <li>Good high quality steel construction for all of the tools.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic</li>
            <li>I have my wife help me hold the light</li>
            <li>Shotty, cheap tools.</li>
            <li>The clippers are the most useful tool in the kit.</li>
            <li>Yes, you can figure it out, but a few best practices might be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>nothing in the kit is cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Works great and the only thing I&#x27;d add to it is a pair of splinter tweezers.</li>
            <li>Arrived in a timely manner and works great, especially of big toe nails.  </li>
            <li>However, the kit does not come with instructions or detailed descriptions.  </li>
            <li>they dont look cheap.</li>
            <li>well made kit tools are sharp and cut well, the lift tools work well also, over all a very good set</li>
            <li>The tools are durable and very useful.  </li>
            <li>Ideal for ingrown toenails and other foot care problems.  </li>
            <li>but this kit is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I got everything I need to clean and trim my ingrown toe nail in this kit.  </li>
            <li>The file is coming in handy to maintain a stubborn nail and the other tools, which I&#x27;ve never owned before, are also coming in handy.  </li>
            <li>A nice colelcitons of tools to help solve an old issue--those nails on the toes that just dig in and hurt.</li>
            <li>The case is not of a good quality, but not a big deal!</li>
            <li>The nippers do not cut, but the other tools are great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s done the best job out of most of the random cutters and tools I&#x27;ve tried over the years.  </li>
            <li>A very worthwhile present for him.&lt;br /&gt;Lois.</li>
            <li>A really odd addition to an otherwise great kit.</li>
            <li>The toenail lifter is somewhat useful.</li>
            <li>I get ingrown toenails frequently and I am glad to have these tools to remove them.</li>
            <li>and I was able to completely fix my toe like never before.</li>
            <li>This product is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it for just the curved file alone.</li>
            <li>Tools were easy to use and highly recommend to anyone with nail issues.</li>
            <li>The lifting tool is amazing at getting the nail cleaned properly and allowing to use the large clippers to cut to ingrown part of the nail away.</li>
            <li>the little scissors are perfect for getting deep in there.</li>
            <li>The large clippers work like nothing else before!</li>
            <li>I have a high tolerance level for pain as it is, but dealing with this issue in the same spot for many years, I dont feel it at all anymore!</li>
            <li>This product is exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>The clipper is very stout!</li>
            <li>This is first kit I ever seen for ingrown nails.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really use anything else in the set, but the clipper is worth the price alone.</li>
            <li>After soaking my foot in Epsom salt, I was able to finally correct it.  </li>
            <li>but I am still looking for longer handled clippers which are more accommodating to a man&#x27;s larger hand.</li>
            <li>It has worked well on my first attempt.</li>
            <li>The clippers are really strong and the added tools allows him to trim, file and complete the whole process.  </li>
            <li>the only thing it does not contain that would be useful is a pair of tweezers, but those are easy to find anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Over priced given the quality, suggest you look elsewhere to see if you can buy the large clippers separate as the rest can be tossed.  </li>
            <li>The large clippers worked and did their job.</li>
            <li>The Scissors were too large for me.  </li>
            <li>I bought these for my husband who has used other brand &amp;#34;toenail clippers&amp;#34; over the past years, and these ones seemed to be the best yet.  </li>
            <li>The clippers, toenail lifter and file in this set are very high quality and cut through my manky toenails with ease.</li>
            <li>Tools are very high quality, as well.</li>
            <li>It really grinds my gears.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>to much money for this kit, can buy these at the dollar store for well a buck or two, does the trick but just to much money</li>
            <li>It is too big and doesn&#x27;t fit in between the edge of the nail and your skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks, J</li>
            <li>Item as described with really fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>They are very helpful for my ingrown toe nail</li>
            <li>this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Got the kit relatively fast and works miracles.</li>
            <li>Very well made.  </li>
            <li>Scissors do not cut very well.  </li>
            <li>could cut the toe nail without too much difficulty.</li>
            <li>They performed much better than I expected and resolved issues for which I needed to use them.</li>
            <li>The toenail holder works very well for holding out the nail while filing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not getting those straight lines I wanted, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the clipper&#x27;s fault.  </li>
            <li>As advertised real helpful ...</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I went straight to work.  </li>
            <li>Really has helped me manage my ingrown toe nails.  </li>
            <li>That being said, they&#x27;re so precise and sharp, that they&#x27;re worth the price alone.</li>
            <li>No more stealing my wife;s girly nail clippers and files, I now have my own sadistic / manly looking nail kit to cut out ingrown toenails.</li>
            <li>and I was able to cut it out and file it down using this kit.</li>
            <li>The case is decent as well, but again, the nippers do not cut.</li>
            <li>And if you do manage to jam the filer into the area of discomfort, it&#x27;s so tight you won&#x27;t be able to move / file any part of the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>high quality.</li>
            <li>The clippers are the only thing worth having out of this kit.</li>
            <li>These are very professionally packaged, high quality items.  </li>
            <li>and now I feel like a new man.</li>
            <li>New Zealand.  </li>
            <li>The two clipping tools are made slim and strong to get into tight places.</li>
            <li>The only decent item you receive is the large cutter.  </li>
            <li>Combination of these products seem to work well for me so far.!</li>
            <li>Was much better than using the usual toe nail cutter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using these tools I was able to finally get the last bits of nail out and have instant pain relief.</li>
            <li>I love the dull lever it came with, it had a flat edge and one with a right angle</li>
            <li>The little case is cheap but it comes with all the tools you need.</li>
            <li>My goal was to get something that was better than the nailcutter that could help me with my hard nails.</li>
            <li>There are clearly professional tools and they did the trick for me.  </li>
            <li>I was about to go to a doctor and get my ingrown toenail fixed.</li>
            <li>Face it, dudes like myself will probably never go to one of those salons and have their toenails professionally manicured.  </li>
            <li>and you have a complete kit.  </li>
            <li>I called the company in Nevada but it was probably too early ( 8am EDST )</li>
            <li>the kit is well designed but the probes are soft and bend too easely to do the job that they need to do.</li>
            <li>Clippers can only do so much.</li>
            <li>Sharp and veru useful.</li>
            <li>the nail cutter is slightly sharper than it should be, but over all the other 3 can not  be found alone easily and they are absolutely good.&lt;br /&gt;The nail cutter (largest tool)</li>
            <li>Seems ok so far with limited use, but the clippers feel a little flimsy.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, comes close to a miracle :)</li>
            <li>The sharp pointy scissors are dangerously sharp that requires surgeon skilled hands which I do not possess.</li>
            <li>A few thing that could be added would be a small instruction booklet describing how to use each tool (what the intended purpose is), and a good set of toenail clippers.  </li>
            <li>Really helps if you are used to clipping down the sides not just straight across.</li>
            <li>Not as high quality as the German made instruments I&#x27;m used to from surgery, but seem to get the job done.</li>
            <li>The large clippers (on the left in the picture) are strong enough to cut any nail, but small enough to fit in the tight space on the side of the nail.  </li>
            <li>One of the other tools is like a mini prying bar that lets you get under the nail to remove the pressure or lift the nail so you can clip it, but the price of admission is the double ended one sided file which lets you get right under the nail and file it without damaging the skin, even if it is sensitive.</li>
            <li>The clips and scissors are not sharp</li>
            <li>They are cheap and dull, an will not cut your nails or help with ingrown toenails.</li>
            <li>They can go all the way back along the side of my toe without causing any real pain, so I can cut out the entire side in one step rather than hacking away at it for several minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but the quality is not great.</li>
            <li>Consider the larger set if you need other instruments for nail care, these are definitely well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is sharp and doesn&#x27;t require much force to cut the toenail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not too much to complain about other than it not having any instructions.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used any of the other tools just because I have my way of doing things..</li>
            <li>When it grew back about a year later, I had developed an ingrown nail problem.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just difficult to come in on the right side of the toe when you&#x27;re right handed.  </li>
            <li>Both the clippers and scissors are very sharp and the two lifters are very sturdy.</li>
            <li>The other tools&#x27; edges are no thin enough  - perhaps they work for folks with larger feet and toenails.</li>
            <li>positive there is a right way and a wrong way to maintain your nails with these tools.</li>

            <li> clipper is good.</li>
            <li> lifter is good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Filer was not so good for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a good product.</li>

            <li> nice case</li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t know what a tool is for you are kind of out of luck.</li>
            <li> The case to keep the stuff in is nice.</li>
            <li> excellent experience, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a nice kit</li>
            <li> Nice set for toenails.</li>
            <li> It was perfect and fast delivery</li>
            <li> The carrying pouch is a nice quality, and I like having a place to store all my nail-care supplies.  </li>
            <li> The clippers are good but not as easy to use as I hoped.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the excellent quality of this set.  </li>
            <li> The carrying case is really nice since these are exactly the kind of tools that I lose all the time!  </li>
            <li> Good set of tools in one convenient case, adequate quality from Pakistan.</li>
            <li> But with this contraption it really alleviated my stress</li>
            <li> You have to exert more pressure than you should for clippers like these.</li>
            <li> I love the carry case</li>
            <li> But clipping your toenails should be a DIY project for most people.  </li>
            <li> Drug store Revlon nippers work much better.</li>
            <li> I am sure there are Doctors that can get their hands on better quality, but I can&#x27;t find it on the internet.  </li>
            <li> So glad I did.</li>
            <li> it seems that I got a used one, all in dust, many scrathes, and guys</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying that this will cure your ingrown toe nail, but it will sure help you take it out while you go to the doctor to find a more permanent solution.</li>
            <li> Glad to have it then a visit to the doctor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> Works best on the big toe.</li>
            <li> For the money, it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> Has eliminated a visit to the doc because I was able to take care of it myself.</li>
            <li> but sure it&#x27;ll work well when I do.  </li>
            <li> Has everything needed to do a nice, clean job.</li>
            <li> Not Bad, best I have found thus far for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the tools provided in here are pretty good.</li>
            <li> Only thing good is the nail lifter is a good ear pick though,.....</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for a relative with  ingrown Toe Nail and have been told this is a very good product.</li>
            <li> Got the set on time and so far happy with using it.</li>
            <li> Since I bought this set primarily for the clippers - I am satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> Really felt good.  </li>
            <li> and it was so easy to fix.  </li>
            <li> The pouch keeps them organized and easy to find.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use tools to help with an ingrown toenail.  </li>
            <li> Great product - worth the $$$ to get the whole kit.</li>
            <li> Good high quality steel construction for all of the tools.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic</li>
            <li> I have my wife help me hold the light</li>
            <li> Shotty, cheap tools.</li>
            <li> The clippers are the most useful tool in the kit.</li>
            <li> Yes, you can figure it out, but a few best practices might be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> nothing in the kit is cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Works great and the only thing I&#x27;d add to it is a pair of splinter tweezers.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner and works great, especially of big toe nails.  </li>
            <li> However, the kit does not come with instructions or detailed descriptions.  </li>
            <li> they dont look cheap.</li>
            <li> well made kit tools are sharp and cut well, the lift tools work well also, over all a very good set</li>
            <li> The tools are durable and very useful.  </li>
            <li> Ideal for ingrown toenails and other foot care problems.  </li>
            <li> but this kit is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I got everything I need to clean and trim my ingrown toe nail in this kit.  </li>
            <li> The file is coming in handy to maintain a stubborn nail and the other tools, which I&#x27;ve never owned before, are also coming in handy.  </li>
            <li> A nice colelcitons of tools to help solve an old issue--those nails on the toes that just dig in and hurt.</li>
            <li> The case is not of a good quality, but not a big deal!</li>
            <li> The nippers do not cut, but the other tools are great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s done the best job out of most of the random cutters and tools I&#x27;ve tried over the years.  </li>
            <li> A very worthwhile present for him.&lt;br /&gt;Lois.</li>
            <li> A really odd addition to an otherwise great kit.</li>
            <li> The toenail lifter is somewhat useful.</li>
            <li> I get ingrown toenails frequently and I am glad to have these tools to remove them.</li>
            <li> and I was able to completely fix my toe like never before.</li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it for just the curved file alone.</li>
            <li> Tools were easy to use and highly recommend to anyone with nail issues.</li>
            <li> The lifting tool is amazing at getting the nail cleaned properly and allowing to use the large clippers to cut to ingrown part of the nail away.</li>
            <li> the little scissors are perfect for getting deep in there.</li>
            <li> The large clippers work like nothing else before!</li>
            <li> I have a high tolerance level for pain as it is, but dealing with this issue in the same spot for many years, I dont feel it at all anymore!</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> The clipper is very stout!</li>
            <li> This is first kit I ever seen for ingrown nails.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really use anything else in the set, but the clipper is worth the price alone.</li>
            <li> After soaking my foot in Epsom salt, I was able to finally correct it.  </li>
            <li> but I am still looking for longer handled clippers which are more accommodating to a man&#x27;s larger hand.</li>
            <li> It has worked well on my first attempt.</li>
            <li> The clippers are really strong and the added tools allows him to trim, file and complete the whole process.  </li>
            <li> the only thing it does not contain that would be useful is a pair of tweezers, but those are easy to find anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Over priced given the quality, suggest you look elsewhere to see if you can buy the large clippers separate as the rest can be tossed.  </li>
            <li> The large clippers worked and did their job.</li>
            <li> The Scissors were too large for me.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband who has used other brand &amp;#34;toenail clippers&amp;#34; over the past years, and these ones seemed to be the best yet.  </li>
            <li> The clippers, toenail lifter and file in this set are very high quality and cut through my manky toenails with ease.</li>
            <li> Tools are very high quality, as well.</li>
            <li> It really grinds my gears.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> to much money for this kit, can buy these at the dollar store for well a buck or two, does the trick but just to much money</li>
            <li> It is too big and doesn&#x27;t fit in between the edge of the nail and your skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks, J</li>
            <li> Item as described with really fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> They are very helpful for my ingrown toe nail</li>
            <li> this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Got the kit relatively fast and works miracles.</li>
            <li> Very well made.  </li>
            <li> Scissors do not cut very well.  </li>
            <li> could cut the toe nail without too much difficulty.</li>
            <li> They performed much better than I expected and resolved issues for which I needed to use them.</li>
            <li> The toenail holder works very well for holding out the nail while filing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not getting those straight lines I wanted, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the clipper&#x27;s fault.  </li>
            <li> As advertised real helpful ...</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I went straight to work.  </li>
            <li> Really has helped me manage my ingrown toe nails.  </li>
            <li> That being said, they&#x27;re so precise and sharp, that they&#x27;re worth the price alone.</li>
            <li> No more stealing my wife;s girly nail clippers and files, I now have my own sadistic / manly looking nail kit to cut out ingrown toenails.</li>
            <li> and I was able to cut it out and file it down using this kit.</li>
            <li> The case is decent as well, but again, the nippers do not cut.</li>
            <li> And if you do manage to jam the filer into the area of discomfort, it&#x27;s so tight you won&#x27;t be able to move / file any part of the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> high quality.</li>
            <li> The clippers are the only thing worth having out of this kit.</li>
            <li> These are very professionally packaged, high quality items.  </li>
            <li> and now I feel like a new man.</li>
            <li> New Zealand.  </li>
            <li> The two clipping tools are made slim and strong to get into tight places.</li>
            <li> The only decent item you receive is the large cutter.  </li>
            <li> Combination of these products seem to work well for me so far.!</li>
            <li> Was much better than using the usual toe nail cutter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using these tools I was able to finally get the last bits of nail out and have instant pain relief.</li>
            <li> I love the dull lever it came with, it had a flat edge and one with a right angle</li>
            <li> The little case is cheap but it comes with all the tools you need.</li>
            <li> My goal was to get something that was better than the nailcutter that could help me with my hard nails.</li>
            <li> There are clearly professional tools and they did the trick for me.  </li>
            <li> I was about to go to a doctor and get my ingrown toenail fixed.</li>
            <li> Face it, dudes like myself will probably never go to one of those salons and have their toenails professionally manicured.  </li>
            <li> and you have a complete kit.  </li>
            <li> I called the company in Nevada but it was probably too early ( 8am EDST )</li>
            <li> the kit is well designed but the probes are soft and bend too easely to do the job that they need to do.</li>
            <li> Clippers can only do so much.</li>
            <li> Sharp and veru useful.</li>
            <li> the nail cutter is slightly sharper than it should be, but over all the other 3 can not  be found alone easily and they are absolutely good.&lt;br /&gt;The nail cutter (largest tool)</li>
            <li> Seems ok so far with limited use, but the clippers feel a little flimsy.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, comes close to a miracle :)</li>
            <li> The sharp pointy scissors are dangerously sharp that requires surgeon skilled hands which I do not possess.</li>
            <li> A few thing that could be added would be a small instruction booklet describing how to use each tool (what the intended purpose is), and a good set of toenail clippers.  </li>
            <li> Really helps if you are used to clipping down the sides not just straight across.</li>
            <li> Not as high quality as the German made instruments I&#x27;m used to from surgery, but seem to get the job done.</li>
            <li> The large clippers (on the left in the picture) are strong enough to cut any nail, but small enough to fit in the tight space on the side of the nail.  </li>
            <li> One of the other tools is like a mini prying bar that lets you get under the nail to remove the pressure or lift the nail so you can clip it, but the price of admission is the double ended one sided file which lets you get right under the nail and file it without damaging the skin, even if it is sensitive.</li>
            <li> The clips and scissors are not sharp</li>
            <li> They are cheap and dull, an will not cut your nails or help with ingrown toenails.</li>
            <li> They can go all the way back along the side of my toe without causing any real pain, so I can cut out the entire side in one step rather than hacking away at it for several minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but the quality is not great.</li>
            <li> Consider the larger set if you need other instruments for nail care, these are definitely well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is sharp and doesn&#x27;t require much force to cut the toenail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too much to complain about other than it not having any instructions.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used any of the other tools just because I have my way of doing things..</li>
            <li> When it grew back about a year later, I had developed an ingrown nail problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just difficult to come in on the right side of the toe when you&#x27;re right handed.  </li>
            <li> Both the clippers and scissors are very sharp and the two lifters are very sturdy.</li>
            <li> The other tools&#x27; edges are no thin enough  - perhaps they work for folks with larger feet and toenails.</li>
            <li> positive there is a right way and a wrong way to maintain your nails with these tools.</li>
            <li> high quality very sharp...</li>
            <li> The file is less useful, so far, as is the small pointy scissors.  </li>
            <li> The clippers are sharp and connect evenly along the complete edge.</li>
            <li> So for a few extra dollars you also get the  carry case, the small scissors, the 2 files and the nail lifter, none of which were available at Target.  </li>
            <li> These tools make it possible to not see a podiatrist every single time.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> I have an ongoing problem with ingrown toe nails and this product really helps get them hard to get nails out.</li>
            <li> As a long time ingrown toenail sufferer this kit is a godsend.  </li>
            <li> Tends to rust a little unless you dry these completely after sterilizing.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp enough, though.</li>
            <li> The scissors were flimsy and the cuticle nippers weren&#x27;t sharp enough to cut cuticles.</li>
            <li> The tools are very sharp and area specific.</li>
            <li> I wish they had some that had some curvature to them and were a little smaller.</li>
            <li> I can only use the little file.</li>
            <li> It was way nicer than expected.  </li>
            <li> but that was to be expected</li>
            <li> You could not cut a wet tissue with these.</li>
            <li> How about pink case for girls?</li>
            <li> so you need to be careful not to stab yourself</li>
            <li> either you use it carefully or buy another from Walmart or Amazon,&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;don&#x27;t know what to do with the other 3 and no instructions as to how to use them.</li>
            <li> The other tools are just so-so.</li>
            <li> I found the rest of the items to be pretty useless despite sounding helpful.</li>
            <li> Other than that it arrived timely.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s never really cared what his feet looked like, but now he loves them!</li>
            <li> I was in a lot of pain due to th eingrown toe nail.</li>
            <li> point in ingrowing toe nail is how to get it out to cut it and that what the other 3 tools does,&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had problems cutting fresh air with them.</li>
            <li> well... it at least in the short term took care of the issue for me.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know what the little scissors are for.</li>
            <li> This little kit works miracles.</li>
            <li> Made the job of cutting out the ingrown toenail so much easier.</li>
            <li> so they won&#x27;t be misplaced.</li>
            <li> Very sharp clippers and small scissors worked well.</li>
            <li> Not having much experience with tools of this type I was really disappointed when I realized there were absolutely no directions included with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re not very nice to me when they get all ingrown and what not.  </li>
            <li> all quality can cut through thick nails &amp; VERY SHARP.</li>
            <li> As other reviewer mentioned, the scissors is not usable, it is way too thick to cut nails!  </li>
            <li> We are usually DIY or put it off until a Dr, has to pull out the grinder and chisel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for the past couple of months and it has helped me take control of those pesky ingrown toenails.  </li>
            <li> If you have ingrown toenail trouble as I have had for all my lift, you need this!</li>
            <li> I have used the small pick file to get under the nail and file away the ingrown part.  </li>
            <li> One of biggest problem with small tools like this is you can never find them when you need them.</li>
            <li> I was fighting with a very painful ingrown toe nail that I just could not seem to cut out with my normal methods, which left the nail sort of messed</li>
            <li> The tools are very heavy duty.</li>
            <li> Finally broken down and researched the internet for Podiatrist grade nail cutter.  </li>
            <li> The lifters and clippers help make it less painful to cut back the nail, and the file helps make a &#x27;V&#x27; groove to help flatten out my toenail.</li>
            <li> Got the painful hunk out before it could become completely imbedded and infected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid the case will be damaged before too long.</li>
            <li> They are allot less expensive than having a doctor repair it.</li>
            <li> I had lost my big toe-nail playing basketball where it was badly bruised and eventually fell off.</li>
            <li> If I am careful, I use the pic to pry up and hold the nail and start cutting with the snips.</li>
            <li> Not good quality.</li>
            <li> They are not made well and this was not a good value.</li>
            <li> Rest are of poor quality and the small scissors are useless and poor quality.  </li>

            <li> Everything to make your toes feel wonderful on those not so good ingrown toe days.</li>
            <li> I can cut out my own ingrown toenails now. No more stealing my wife;s girly nail clippers and files, I now have my own sadistic / manly looking nail kit to cut out ingrown toenails.</li>
            <li> Really felt good.  Like...  Really good.  I hate my toes,  they&#x27;re not very nice to me when they get all ingrown and what not.  It really grinds my gears.  But with this contraption it really alleviated my stress and now I feel like a new man.</li>
            <li> Worked as described. Good quality, well plated and packaged. The case is nice for travelling too. Very sharp clippers and small scissors worked well.</li>
            <li> well made kit tools are sharp and cut well, the lift tools work well also, over all a very good set</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the excellent quality of this set.  It was way nicer than expected.  There are clearly professional tools and they did the trick for me.  I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My husband suffers from ingrown toenails. So I saw this. It works really good for him. And its really great quality. If your looking for a good product because you suffer from ingrown toenails this is the kit for you.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as advertised and I am happy with it.  I would recommend it to anyone with nail problems.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Sharp and veru useful.</li>
            <li> scary tools.......will get those nagging toe nails removed for sure</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this! I was about to go to a doctor and get my ingrown toenail fixed. I used this after I soaked my bad toe real good and it was so easy to fix.  Hurt for a couple days but that was to be expected but its 100% gone for now. Great buy!</li>
            <li> You could not cut a wet tissue with these. They are cheap and dull, an will not cut your nails or help with ingrown toenails.</li>
            <li> I got everything I need to clean and trim my ingrown toe nail in this kit.  Good one to have.  How about pink case for girls?</li>
            <li> The handles are WAY too short. You have to exert more pressure than you should for clippers like these. The blades are sharp enough, though.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for a relative with  ingrown Toe Nail and have been told this is a very good product.</li>
            <li> This is a great toe nail kit. The tools are very heavy duty.</li>
            <li> This kit is great, no nonsense care for problem feet with ingrown toenails. Totally recommend this for anyone. I&#x27;ve had surgeries for chronically ingrown toenails because nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried before helped. With this kit, my toenails are once again happy!</li>
            <li> Nice case, packaging was great. I only use one of the tools, the clipper. I&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t know what to do with the other 3 and no instructions as to how to use them.</li>
            <li> Good set of tools in one convenient case, adequate quality from Pakistan. Not as high quality as the German made instruments I&#x27;m used to from surgery, but seem to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Fantastic I love the carry case helps to keep everything where i need it when i need it every thing works great</li>
            <li> I like these tools when combined with outgro.  They are very effective for repairing ingrown toenails. They are allot less expensive than having a doctor repair it.</li>
            <li> These are very professionally packaged, high quality items.  Ideal for ingrown toenails and other foot care problems.  The large clippers (on the left in the picture) are strong enough to cut any nail, but small enough to fit in the tight space on the side of the nail.  The file is less useful, so far, as is the small pointy scissors.  The toenail lifter is somewhat useful.</li>
            <li> to much money for this kit, can buy these at the dollar store for well a buck or two, does the trick but just to much money</li>
            <li> As other reviewer mentioned, the scissors is not usable, it is way too thick to cut nails!  However, the nipper works well.</li>
            <li> Wish I knew about this kit sooner. Definitely helps with chronic ingrown toenails.</li>
            <li> Face it, dudes like myself will probably never go to one of those salons and have their toenails professionally manicured.  We are usually DIY or put it off until a Dr, has to pull out the grinder and chisel.  Joking.  But clipping your toenails should be a DIY project for most people.  I&#x27;ve used this for the past couple of months and it has helped me take control of those pesky ingrown toenails.  This is a good starter kit for trimming thickened toenails and ingrown toenails.  Add a smaller clipper, and a file and you have a complete kit.  Good price, excellent quality.  Nice case.</li>
            <li> The scissors were flimsy and the cuticle nippers weren&#x27;t sharp enough to cut cuticles. Drug store Revlon nippers work much better.</li>
            <li> I get ingrown toenails frequently and I am glad to have these tools to remove them. If I am careful, I use the pic to pry up and hold the nail and start cutting with the snips. I have my wife help me hold the light and this seems to work for me.</li>
            <li> Best tool I have ever purchased that gets the job done.</li>
            <li> great product!  My toenails were in BAD shape.  Embarrassed to let anyone see my nails.  Not anymore.  The clipper is very stout!</li>
            <li> The dual toenail file in amazing!  I had one before and had it taken from my bag on a cruise ship, so I had to have another.  The nail snippers do a great job also!  If you have ingrown toenail trouble as I have had for all my lift, you need this!</li>
            <li> Not having much experience with tools of this type I was really disappointed when I realized there were absolutely no directions included with this.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m positive there is a right way and a wrong way to maintain your nails with these tools. You&#x27;d think the manufacturer would have thought to provide instructions for proper use. Not in my package! I called the company in Nevada but it was probably too early ( 8am EDST ) so I left a message.</li>
            <li> This is first kit I ever seen for ingrown nails.  I use and my grandson.  He gets them so bad. Great product good quality @n has everything in it.</li>
            <li> The clippers are sharp and connect evenly along the complete edge. They are pointy so you need to be careful not to stab yourself BUT the reason they are pointy is to pry up the ingrown nail. I love the dull lever it came with, it had a flat edge and one with a right angle and I was able to completely fix my toe like never before. The relief is amazing, this is a great product!</li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny.  I have had problems with my two big toes for over 20 years and I have always hacked out with regular clippers.  What a dummy I am.  Finally broken down and researched the internet for Podiatrist grade nail cutter.  My search lead me here and to this product.  I am sure there are Doctors that can get their hands on better quality, but I can&#x27;t find it on the internet.  All the medical equipment sites had about the same product for about the same price.  I haven&#x27;t really use anything else in the set, but the clipper is worth the price alone.</li>
            <li> great tool set for ingrwn toe nails, It used to be very painful to cut them out but with the clippers in this set its no pain and no problem removing them.</li>
            <li> The quality of these tools are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper is good. It is sharp and doesn&#x27;t require much force to cut the toenail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lifter is good. It does what it is meant to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filer was not so good for me. It is too big and doesn&#x27;t fit in between the edge of the nail and your skin. And if you do manage to jam the filer into the area of discomfort, it&#x27;s so tight you won&#x27;t be able to move / file any part of the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what the little scissors are for. They are not powerfully enough to cut the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a good product.</li>
            <li> Terrible set. Shotty, cheap tools. Don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Wish I had know about this product sooner!</li>
            <li> Absolutely awesome set.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Arrived in great shape. Thanks, J</li>
            <li> The toenail cutters themselves are very good. The other tools are just so-so. Never use them .Has nice case so they won&#x27;t be misplaced.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit for my spouse and he loves it.  Prior to my purchasing it, he had tried to find one locally without any luck.</li>
            <li> Item as described with really fast shipping. Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used two of the tools but they work as advertised.  The clippers are the most useful tool in the kit.</li>
            <li> I have an ongoing problem with ingrown toe nails and this product really helps get them hard to get nails out.</li>
            <li> If you have ever had an ingrown toenail and tried to work on it with regular personal grooming tools, you will appreciate this kit. The two clipping tools are made slim and strong to get into tight places. One of the other tools is like a mini prying bar that lets you get under the nail to remove the pressure or lift the nail so you can clip it, but the price of admission is the double ended one sided file which lets you get right under the nail and file it without damaging the skin, even if it is sensitive. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The nippers do not cut, but the other tools are great. The case is decent as well, but again, the nippers do not cut.</li>
            <li> Has everything needed to do a nice, clean job. Would recommend to anyone. My nails never felt as good as they do now.</li>
            <li> I was hoping the clipper was thinner and sharper but overall this kit is agreat product and I would recommend this product .</li>
            <li> It had everything I needed and has saved me a couple of trips to the doctors.  It was a investment for me.  It&#x27;s done the best job out of most of the random cutters and tools I&#x27;ve tried over the years.  Not too much to complain about other than it not having any instructions.  So if you don&#x27;t know what a tool is for you are kind of out of luck.</li>
            <li> I bought two sets. So glad I did. These are very nice.  Good quality. Now my son will leave my stuff alone and I won&#x27;t have to hunt for my things when I need them.</li>
            <li> Oh my.  I have toenail issues.  My toenails grow in a circular pattern, and I am always dealing with ingrown.  These tools make it possible to not see a podiatrist every single time.&lt;br /&gt;Your toes will thank you.</li>
            <li> Used this well made set after treating with Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Ingrown Toenail Pain Reliever.  Wished I had purchased it sooner.  Made the job of cutting out the ingrown toenail so much easier.</li>
            <li> it seems that I got a used one, all in dust, many scrathes, and guys, it&#x27;s not a German product&#x27;s quality, trivially made in Pakistan</li>
            <li> Poor me. I have Hobbit feet and always have. The clippers, toenail lifter and file in this set are very high quality and cut through my manky toenails with ease. I&#x27;m not about to get a job as a foot model, but I can look at my feet without barfing now which is quite an achievement. The case to keep the stuff in is nice. I&#x27;m knocking off a star though because there are no instructions on how to use the things. Yes, you can figure it out, but a few best practices might be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the scissors, why are they here? I had problems cutting fresh air with them. A really odd addition to an otherwise great kit.</li>
            <li> They are very helpful for my ingrown toe nail</li>
            <li> excellent experience, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Got the set on time and so far happy with using it. My goal was to get something that was better than the nailcutter that could help me with my hard nails. Combination of these products seem to work well for me so far.!</li>
            <li> This little kit works miracles. I had an ingrown toe nail and I was able to cut it out and file it down using this kit. I&#x27;m not saying that this will cure your ingrown toe nail, but it will sure help you take it out while you go to the doctor to find a more permanent solution.</li>
            <li> Had an ingrown toenail for months.  After soaking my foot in Epsom salt, I was able to finally correct it.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> this is the real deal. nothing in the kit is cheaply made. all quality can cut through thick nails &amp; VERY SHARP.</li>
            <li> Awesome kit for all my toe nail care!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband who has used other brand &amp;#34;toenail clippers&amp;#34; over the past years, and these ones seemed to be the best yet.  The clippers are really strong and the added tools allows him to trim, file and complete the whole process.  The pouch is also a bonus as he doesn&#x27;t have to go searching through cabinet drawers to find the clippers.  A very worthwhile present for him.&lt;br /&gt;Lois. New Zealand.  March 2014.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised-I especially like the probes for cleaning under the nail.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from ingrown toenails for over twenty years.  I have never found a tool that reliably cuts the nail out before it gets infected without a lot of bleeding and pain.  The toe nail nippers in this kit combined with the nail lifter were *amazing*.  Got the painful hunk out before it could become completely imbedded and infected.  Seriously, comes close to a miracle :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a nice kit but I am still looking for longer handled clippers which are more accommodating to a man&#x27;s larger hand.</li>
            <li> the kit is well designed but the probes are soft and bend too easely to do the job that they need to do.</li>
            <li> Got the kit relatively fast and works miracles. I&#x27;ve had this pain off/on for six weeks and got instant relief after about 2 minutes. Tools were easy to use and highly recommend to anyone with nail issues.</li>
            <li> The clippers are the only thing worth having out of this kit. That being said, they&#x27;re so precise and sharp, that they&#x27;re worth the price alone. I found the rest of the items to be pretty useless despite sounding helpful.</li>
            <li> Works great and the only thing I&#x27;d add to it is a pair of splinter tweezers. Other than that it arrived timely.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used all the utensils yet, but they are a good quality and the case is a good quality also.</li>
            <li> Very well made.  Consider the larger set if you need other instruments for nail care, these are definitely well worth the money.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has ingrown toenails and I&#x27;ve struggled to do his toes with regular nail kits. This kit is life changing. It&#x27;s worth it for just the curved file alone. He&#x27;s never really cared what his feet looked like, but now he loves them!</li>
            <li> The only decent item you receive is the large cutter.  Rest are of poor quality and the small scissors are useless and poor quality.  Doubt I could even cut paper with them.  Over priced given the quality, suggest you look elsewhere to see if you can buy the large clippers separate as the rest can be tossed.  The large clippers worked and did their job.</li>
            <li> The tools are very sharp and area specific. The removal and insertion of the clipper into the case is a bit tricky. I&#x27;m afraid the case will be damaged before too long.</li>
            <li> Nippers cut well and lifters work great. Scissors do not cut very well.  Tends to rust a little unless you dry these completely after sterilizing.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner and works great, especially of big toe nails.  Really helps if you are used to clipping down the sides not just straight across.</li>
            <li> Used judiciously, these tools may save you from having to shell out for the podiatrist.  However, the kit does not come with instructions or detailed descriptions.  Tools are very high quality, as well.</li>
            <li> The Scissors were too large for me.  I wish they had some that had some curvature to them and were a little smaller.</li>
            <li> Seems ok so far with limited use, but the clippers feel a little flimsy.  Would recommend for occasional use, but not regular/daily use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but the quality is not great.</li>
            <li> the tools provided in here are pretty good. they dont look cheap. I was in a lot of pain due to th eingrown toe nail. I dont think this is a replacement for going to a podiatrist, but well... it at least in the short term took care of the issue for me. could cut the toe nail without too much difficulty. Was much better than using the usual toe nail cutter.</li>
            <li> Good high quality steel construction for all of the tools.  The angled ingrown nail cutter is of particularly good construction and feels very good in hand.</li>
            <li> The tools are excellent quality!  They performed much better than I expected and resolved issues for which I needed to use them.</li>
            <li> the little scissors are perfect for getting deep in there. the only thing it does not contain that would be useful is a pair of tweezers, but those are easy to find anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has a ingrown toenail and doesn&#x27;t want to go to the doctor, needs one of these. The little case is cheap but it comes with all the tools you need.</li>
            <li> Ive been dealing with ingrown toenails for a while now, and Ive always used regular nail clippers and tweezers to get them out with! I have a high tolerance level for pain as it is, but dealing with this issue in the same spot for many years, I dont feel it at all anymore! (Like getting your eyebrows waxed..) anyways. The large clippers work like nothing else before! They can go all the way back along the side of my toe without causing any real pain, so I can cut out the entire side in one step rather than hacking away at it for several minutes. I haven&#x27;t really used any of the other tools just because I have my way of doing things.. but this kit is worth every penny! Both the clippers and scissors are very sharp and the two lifters are very sturdy. high quality. I am very pleased with this set!! Why pay someone to do something I can do myself with practically the same set of tools!?</li>
            <li> The tools are durable and very useful.  I have used the small pick file to get under the nail and file away the ingrown part.  It has worked well on my first attempt.</li>
            <li> Great kit in a quality case. One of biggest problem with small tools like this is you can never find them when you need them. The pouch keeps them organized and easy to find.  I had lost my big toe-nail playing basketball where it was badly bruised and eventually fell off. When it grew back about a year later, I had developed an ingrown nail problem. Let it go, and it becomes very painful. Clippers can only do so much. The lifting tool is amazing at getting the nail cleaned properly and allowing to use the large clippers to cut to ingrown part of the nail away. Immediate  relief.  Great tools.</li>
            <li> Just what I need to keep from getting in grown toe nails when I lose a nail from my obstacle runs...highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Not good quality. They are not made well and this was not a good value. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not Bad, best I have found thus far for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for the ingrown nail enthusiast.</li>
            <li> Relief!  Easy to use tools to help with an ingrown toenail.  Glad to have it then a visit to the doctor.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the quality of the instruments.</li>
            <li> Well This product has 4 tools, 3 perfect and the nail cutter is slightly sharper than it should be, but over all the other 3 can not  be found alone easily and they are absolutely good.&lt;br /&gt;The nail cutter (largest tool) either you use it carefully or buy another from Walmart or Amazon,&lt;br /&gt;The point in ingrowing toe nail is how to get it out to cut it and that what the other 3 tools does,&lt;br /&gt;So overall 5+ stars to this product and to Amazon</li>
            <li> Great product - worth the $$$ to get the whole kit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Not what I expected at all.  The sharp pointy scissors are dangerously sharp that requires surgeon skilled hands which I do not possess. I can only use the little file. Needless to say, my ingrown toe nail is still painful.</li>
            <li> Nice set for toenails. The pieces are well made. The files work well. The toenail holder works very well for holding out the nail while filing. Good investment .</li>
            <li> I like this toolkit.  The file is coming in handy to maintain a stubborn nail and the other tools, which I&#x27;ve never owned before, are also coming in handy.  The clippers are good but not as easy to use as I hoped. I&#x27;m not getting those straight lines I wanted, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the clipper&#x27;s fault.  It&#x27;s just difficult to come in on the right side of the toe when you&#x27;re right handed.  I would recommend this kit for anyone who has chronic ingrown nails.  Works best on the big toe.</li>
            <li> As advertised real helpful ... thanks</li>
            <li> This kit really is a great value.  I priced out the larger nail clippers alone at anywhere from $9-$13 at Target.  So for a few extra dollars you also get the  carry case, the small scissors, the 2 files and the nail lifter, none of which were available at Target.  The carrying case is really nice since these are exactly the kind of tools that I lose all the time!  My toe was hurting a lot, so as soon as this package arrived I went straight to work.  Now it feels 100% better!</li>
            <li> I got this to do my mother&#x27;s toenails since she is a diabetic. The clips and scissors are not sharp so I had to take them to be sharpened. It might work if sharpened in a knife sharpener. They files and nail cleaners are awesome for easy lift on ingrown nails, dirt and not digging in like with the pointed file.</li>
            <li> FINALLY. I was fighting with a very painful ingrown toe nail that I just could not seem to cut out with my normal methods, which left the nail sort of messed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using these tools I was able to finally get the last bits of nail out and have instant pain relief.</li>
            <li> It was perfect and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I like the curved nail file, it has revolutionized ingrown toenail care for me</li>
            <li> Since I bought this set primarily for the clippers - I am satisfied with it.  The scissors are also good.  The other tools&#x27; edges are no thin enough  - perhaps they work for folks with larger feet and toenails.</li>
            <li> Affordable set. Seems durable.</li>
            <li> A nice colelcitons of tools to help solve an old issue--those nails on the toes that just dig in and hurt.</li>
            <li> For the money, it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> It does not help my ingrown nail at all. The scissors cant reach in my nail to cut it. Only thing good is the nail lifter is a good ear pick though,.....</li>
            <li> So needed this was what I was looking for great shaped everything I needed to get the job done yes I would recommend  it to friends</li>
            <li> high quality very sharp...</li>
            <li> Really has helped me manage my ingrown toe nails.  Has eliminated a visit to the doc because I was able to take care of it myself.</li>
            <li> The carrying pouch is a nice quality, and I like having a place to store all my nail-care supplies.  For the price all of the tools are a good quality and do what I need.  A few thing that could be added would be a small instruction booklet describing how to use each tool (what the intended purpose is), and a good set of toenail clippers.  As a long time ingrown toenail sufferer this kit is a godsend.  The lifters and clippers help make it less painful to cut back the nail, and the file helps make a &#x27;V&#x27; groove to help flatten out my toenail.</li>
            <li> This kit has all you need for regular and ingrown nail grooming! The case is not of a good quality, but not a big deal!</li>
            <li> i like this kit but...I wish it came with instructions on how to use it.</li>
            <li> Good quality, good price.  Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but sure it&#x27;ll work well when I do.  No similar products to compare it to.</li>
