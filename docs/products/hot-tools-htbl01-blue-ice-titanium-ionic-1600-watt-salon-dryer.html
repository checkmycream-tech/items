    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s an awesome dryer!!</li>
            <li>so when drying it I use the concentrator which works great!!</li>
            <li>This one fits the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li>Great product!!!</li>
            <li>Best blow dryer I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>I have wavy-to-curly hair that  needs some encouragement to curl, and this dryer is PERFECT.  </li>
            <li>The best part of this dryer is the diffuser.</li>
            <li>She loved it!  </li>
            <li>This hairdryer is great.  </li>
            <li>Another product I used, the attachments slipped on and was great ergonomically.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works great, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Overall, great product for an excellent price.</li>
            <li>She got it for Christmas and when she used it, she loved it even more.</li>
            <li>Good price, great results without too much noise and</li>
            <li>The higher watt dryers are great for straightening my hair but even with a diffuser, they will ruin the curl.</li>
            <li>Very light weight.</li>
            <li>It is fairly lightweight and dries the hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>more often than the concentrator does.</li>
            <li>Seems like most driers out there now are 1845 watts.</li>
            <li>I suggest you review more products before purchasing this one.</li>
            <li>Love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Plus I love the color.</li>
            <li>I love the price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this blowdryer.</li>
            <li>Someone mentioned jn a review that the attachments snap off easily in her hair, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem with that, I make sure to snap them on in place correctly.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, less power consumption than many alternatives.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s easy to transition over to.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and it dries my hair very quick.</li>
            <li>My hair has thinned a lot over the years and although I color it from time to time, I don&#x27;t need a high end, fancy unit to get good results.</li>
            <li>It is HUGE, bowl-shaped so it cups the hair, and</li>
            <li>Honest advertising is too much to ask?</li>
            <li>It also is light weight and comes with a straighting comb and diffuser.</li>
            <li>I think the title says it all: this is a really great blowdryer, sleek nice design, modern technology, and it definitely gets the job done.</li>
            <li>great and dry&#x27;s my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>The buttons are easy to \\&quot;thumb\\&quot; operate without looking and the cool blast really makes a difference to set the curl.</li>
            <li>We are very satisfied, and are using it regularly.</li>
            <li>I use the low setting with the high heat and my curls look great.</li>
            <li>Hot Tools dryer rocks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, gets hot but not too hot, and leaves my hair feeling smooth and straight after.</li>
            <li>Nice lightweight, simple hair drier</li>
            <li>$20.&lt;br /&gt;I had to buy a travel size hair dryer with the same attachment that I am now using in place of what I thought would be a nice hair dryer</li>
            <li>it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>it is really something extraordinary.</li>
            <li>Also, the first time I used the add-ons</li>
            <li>And everytime it fell off, the piece was so hot</li>
            <li>spending almost $50 on a hair dryer, you&#x27;d think the attachment would last more than 7 months.  </li>
            <li>I bought this dryer to replace another Hot Tools model that stopped working.</li>
            <li>I liked the way it dried my hair quickly without frying it</li>
            <li>besides my blow dryer was due to be upgraded, kind of.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer replaced one I&#x27;d had for way too long and was no longer safe to use.</li>
            <li>It dries pretty well, I usually like my dryers to have a little more kick, but this one is still a pretty good dryer.</li>
            <li>I have short, fine hair and my stylist recommended this dryer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hard to find a low wattage hair dryer that isn&#x27;t travel sized so this is perfect.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>and luckily I found the exact same one.</li>
            <li>It is 1600 watts, so it is not as powerful as the more common 1875 wattage, but that is exactly what I need.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and shiny and not dry and frizzy, though my hair is fine.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a light weight, professional hair dryer!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say though that it is SO much faster than my old one of that</li>
            <li>Recommend this to anyone who wants to dry their hair beautifully straight or curly!</li>
            <li>and then you have to use a towel to put back on since it is hot.  </li>
            <li>Does not get as hot or have the same fan power.</li>
            <li>takes me longer than my last dryer but the attachment is better than my other one</li>
            <li>My curls came out soft, shiny, and defined in a modest amount of time.  </li>
            <li>This is a professional hair product yet it completely destroys my hair.</li>
            <li>This product was rated 3 stars because it is a good product, but difficult to attach the attachments.</li>
            <li>I purchased a different Hot Tools dryer from a store and it crapped out on me the next day</li>
            <li>love the attachment but the heating is weak.</li>
            <li>I recently replaced this for the old one I had for 3 years that I purchased from overstock.com, however the price on here is affordable and with the prime account 2 day shipping</li>
            <li>It is okay but not great by any means.</li>
            <li>Ordered this one to replace the previous Hot Tools blow dryer we had.  </li>
            <li>It literally creates a warm \\&quot;cloud\\&quot; of soft air to dry the curls without disturbing them.  </li>
            <li>the \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; are actually hollow and have openings on their inner vertical surfaces so the airflow is directed toward the middle of the diffuser, surrounding the curls, instead of straight out.  </li>
            <li>It worked great with my long thick hair and cut drying time in half then my previous one.</li>
            <li>I have super thick and wavy hair</li>
            <li>and it takes me only 20 minutes to have everything perfectly dry and straight, even when my hair is soaking wet.</li>

            <li> It is somewhat large and a little heavy.</li>
            <li> I got my package quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> The cool/cold setting is not very cool/cold compared to others that I&#x27;ve used with this feature.</li>
            <li> She has very long hair and usually has to use a flat iron after drying her hair</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for how this dryer will work for other hair types, but if you are looking for a dryer for curls that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune and won&#x27;t give you an unwanted blow-out, this is the one.  </li>
            <li> I put a little bit of product in my hair before I dry it,  which takes care of my frizz too.</li>
            <li> And it is sort of hard to put back on.</li>
            <li> The trap on the end falls off constantly while drying my hair so that it sucks my hair in and knots it which I have to rip out then.</li>
            <li> I have slightly frizzy, wavy hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Styling my hair less than 4-5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a lower wattage unit (1600)that wasn&#x27;t too heavy.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few months</li>
            <li> I had one for a few years before it just quit working.  </li>
            <li> It took 5minutes of serious effort and pulling (I&#x27;m not that weak of a person) to finally get them off!</li>
            <li> Not a good travel dryer.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical when purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> I have never been so disappointed with one of their products as this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of their products but for the price I paid for this and for the quality, it&#x27;s horrible.</li>

            <li> I got my package quicker than expected. I purchased a different Hot Tools dryer from a store and it crapped out on me the next day so I needed to purchase another one. I found this on here and after reading the reviews I decided to get it. It&#x27;s an awesome dryer!! It&#x27;s light weight, gets hot but not too hot, and leaves my hair feeling smooth and straight after. I have slightly frizzy, wavy hair so when drying it I use the concentrator which works great!! Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a light weight, professional hair dryer!</li>
            <li> Like the drying power but it has 3 negatives:&lt;br /&gt;1.  It is somewhat large and a little heavy. Not a good travel dryer.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The concentrator attachment sometimes pops off when you are using the dryer and then you have to use a towel to put back on since it is hot.  Doesn&#x27;t happen often, just now and then.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The lint screen pops off the back of the dryer sometimes too- more often than the concentrator does. And it is sort of hard to put back on.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer replaced one I&#x27;d had for way too long and was no longer safe to use. I wanted a lower wattage unit (1600)that wasn&#x27;t too heavy. Seems like most driers out there now are 1845 watts. This one fits the bill perfectly. Good price, great results without too much noise and no breaker popping! My hair has thinned a lot over the years and although I color it from time to time, I don&#x27;t need a high end, fancy unit to get good results. The buttons are easy to \\&quot;thumb\\&quot; operate without looking and the cool blast really makes a difference to set the curl. Nice lightweight, simple hair drier that&#x27;s easy to transition over to. Been using it for a few months and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I think the title says it all: this is a really great blowdryer, sleek nice design, modern technology, and it definitely gets the job done. I wouldn&#x27;t say though that it is SO much faster than my old one of that it is really something extraordinary. Also, the first time I used the add-ons I could not get them off of the nozzle afterwards! It took 5minutes of serious effort and pulling (I&#x27;m not that weak of a person) to finally get them off!</li>
            <li> it lasted me 2 years,  works well but the filter/screen in the back wasn&#x27;t stable and kept falling off, works a lot faster then Walmart dryers.</li>
            <li> The blow dryer itself works great and dry&#x27;s my hair quickly. THe problem I have is with getting the different nozzles to stay on. Just by tilting the dryer to one side, they come flying off. I suggest you review more products before purchasing this one.</li>
            <li> Does what we wanted. Excellent product, less power consumption than many alternatives. Rapid delivery. We are very satisfied, and are using it regularly.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer. It worked great with my long thick hair and cut drying time in half then my previous one.</li>
            <li> After only 7 months, this hair dryer became useless.&lt;br /&gt;I use the concentrator everytime I dry my hair and after only 7 months, it just started to fall off while I was drying my hair with every move I made.  Now it won&#x27;t even attach to the dryer, I&#x27;ll put it back on and it falls off.  And everytime it fell off, the piece was so hot, I had to grab a towel to pick it up and try and attach it back on.&lt;br /&gt;For spending almost $50 on a hair dryer, you&#x27;d think the attachment would last more than 7 months.  I had a conair hair dryer with a concentrator attachment that lasted me almost 2 years and those hair dryers only cost $20.&lt;br /&gt;I had to buy a travel size hair dryer with the same attachment that I am now using in place of what I thought would be a nice hair dryer just so I&#x27;m not constantly picking that piece up off the floor because it keeps falling off.</li>
            <li> I recently replaced this for the old one I had for 3 years that I purchased from overstock.com, however the price on here is affordable and with the prime account 2 day shipping I couldn&#x27;t beat that! this dryer produces a balance amount of hair to blowdry your hair within seconds. A MUST HAVE PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Recommend this to anyone who wants to dry their hair beautifully straight or curly! Great product!!! RECOMMEND!! Hot Tools dryer rocks!</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is great.  It is fairly lightweight and dries the hair quickly.  I recommend this hair dryer to anyone.</li>
            <li> The cool/cold setting is not very cool/cold compared to others that I&#x27;ve used with this feature.</li>
            <li> This product was rated 3 stars because it is a good product, but difficult to attach the attachments. I used the product 1 day.  Another product I used, the attachments slipped on and was great ergonomically. The functions worked well and met my expectations.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find a low wattage hair dryer that isn&#x27;t travel sized so this is perfect. I have curly hair and I use the diffuser. I use the low setting with the high heat and my curls look great. The higher watt dryers are great for straightening my hair but even with a diffuser, they will ruin the curl. I had taken this hair dryer overseas and even with a converter, I fried the dryer so when I got home, I immediately went on the search to find a replacement and luckily I found the exact same one.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer! I have super thick and wavy hair and it takes me only 20 minutes to have everything perfectly dry and straight, even when my hair is soaking wet. I put a little bit of product in my hair before I dry it,  which takes care of my frizz too. Someone mentioned jn a review that the attachments snap off easily in her hair, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem with that, I make sure to snap them on in place correctly. Overall, great product for an excellent price.</li>
            <li> This blowdryer is amazing! Plus I love the color.</li>
            <li> I had one for a few years before it just quit working.  I liked the way it dried my hair quickly without frying it so I bought another one.  It leaves my hair soft and shiny and not dry and frizzy, though my hair is fine.</li>
            <li> I knew the label before stumbling across this blow dryer. When I saw the price, I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I had to get it, besides my blow dryer was due to be upgraded, kind of. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great brand!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Ordered this one to replace the previous Hot Tools blow dryer we had.  This one does not seem to work as well.  Does not get as hot or have the same fan power. It is okay but not great by any means.</li>
            <li> It dries pretty well, I usually like my dryers to have a little more kick, but this one is still a pretty good dryer.</li>
            <li> Best blow dryer I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I have short, fine hair and my stylist recommended this dryer.  I love the price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Styling my hair less than 4-5 minutes.  At the end of this time my arm feels like it is going to fall off.  Nevertheless, I&#x27;m  happy with it.  Ionic dryers are the only way to go.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer to replace another Hot Tools model that stopped working. I have wavy-to-curly hair that  needs some encouragement to curl, and this dryer is PERFECT.  It is 1600 watts, so it is not as powerful as the more common 1875 wattage, but that is exactly what I need.  The best part of this dryer is the diffuser. It is HUGE, bowl-shaped so it cups the hair, and the \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; are actually hollow and have openings on their inner vertical surfaces so the airflow is directed toward the middle of the diffuser, surrounding the curls, instead of straight out.  It literally creates a warm \\&quot;cloud\\&quot; of soft air to dry the curls without disturbing them.  My curls came out soft, shiny, and defined in a modest amount of time.  I can&#x27;t speak for how this dryer will work for other hair types, but if you are looking for a dryer for curls that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune and won&#x27;t give you an unwanted blow-out, this is the one.  I would give it six stars if I could!</li>
            <li> She loved it!  She got it for Christmas and when she used it, she loved it even more. She has very long hair and usually has to use a flat iron after drying her hair she didn&#x27;t have to after using this dryer.</li>
            <li> I have never been so disappointed with one of their products as this hair dryer. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of their products but for the price I paid for this and for the quality, it&#x27;s horrible. The trap on the end falls off constantly while drying my hair so that it sucks my hair in and knots it which I have to rip out then. This is a professional hair product yet it completely destroys my hair. Yes, I could probably put tape on it so it stays on but for the price and name brand, I should not have to. It&#x27;s the principle of the matter.</li>
            <li> love the attachment but the heating is weak. takes me longer than my last dryer but the attachment is better than my other one so I use it anyway. Very light weight.</li>
            <li> I ended up losing over five bucks for this because I ordered it because it said that it was a quiet hair dryer. It was actually louder than the blower that I already had - so I sent it back. Honest advertising is too much to ask?</li>
            <li> I love this blowdryer. I was skeptical when purchasing this item. I have curly hair and it dries my hair very quick. It also is light weight and comes with a straighting comb and diffuser. I would recommend this product to anyone...it was worth every penny.</li>
