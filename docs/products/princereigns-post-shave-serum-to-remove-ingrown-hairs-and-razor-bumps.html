            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s another great thing about this product; you don&#x27;t need to use a lot to see results.     </li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t so great for me.</li>
            <li>I already got rid of a couple of ingrown hairs that had been hanging out under my skin for a couple of weeks which made me really happy.     </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll get great results.  </li>
            <li>I decided to give it a shot, because it felt great when she rubbed it in.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>I am really happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Give it a shot, I truely am a happy customer and am about to reorder another bottle.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know how great</li>
            <li>I am proud to say \\&quot;I can&#x27;t wait to go to the beach this summer!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>it works great</li>
            <li>after hearing all the great reviews about this product i decided to try it.</li>
            <li>and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is very nice.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t work miracles, but if you&#x27;re taking good care of your skin already, this will do a great job topping that off.  </li>
            <li>It smells good, and feels good going on.</li>
            <li>Really good stuff.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t delay a smooth and perfect face</li>
            <li>Product in good condition.  </li>
            <li>Loved the results.  </li>
            <li>it is a good product</li>
            <li>It felt good after shaving, but did not do waht it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I also read some reviews of people saying it smelt good.</li>
            <li>I paid good money for this based on a magazine&#x27;s recommendation.  </li>
            <li>I think that her complexion is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>All and all a good product</li>
            <li>should be a good gauge as to where i&#x27;d like my face to be.</li>
            <li>This is the best after shave product I have ever purchased it gives you a smooth feeling after every shave and leave you with that elegant and brilliant look</li>
            <li>So good</li>
            <li>It smells nice and feels good on the skin, but I thought maybe my skin needs to breath</li>
            <li>and I started to feel great about myself and more confident it is remarkable.</li>
            <li>my primary purpose of buying this was to get rid of my ingrowns, it soothes the ingrown spots when its hurting, but I haven&#x27;t experienced anything the good reviews told me.</li>
            <li>I am buying more for my friends and family!</li>
            <li>I wonder if you&#x27;re better off not using anything at all than to use Princereigns(to save money!)</li>
            <li>The results are fantastic!!</li>
            <li>more to come!</li>
            <li>I found this item almost by accident, but am so glad I did!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>product came in handy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product to apply just after shaving as it soothes the area</li>
            <li>Maybe is works for those lil annoyances that go away on their own anyway</li>
            <li>But yeah, this stuff really works great!  </li>
            <li>No relief from ingrown hairs either for my husband&#x27;s beard or my own eyebrow wax.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s nice stuff.</li>
            <li>It is an effective product to throw $ 30 in the trash</li>
            <li>I brought this product and to be honest</li>
            <li>Allow me to explain, I give it the 4 stars because it is awesome if my legs are really itchy from all the hair trying to regrow, but I don&#x27;t feel that it prevents the ingrowns</li>
            <li>For the price, Tend Skin is much more effective and lasts a lot longer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more effective then Tend Skin</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t say that I love it -</li>
            <li>It was the best product that I have found so far for the problem.</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for over a year now and love, love, love it!  </li>
            <li>time was good, adequate packaging to protect the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works ok for the most part.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that I am not getting as many ingrown hairs as I used to</li>
            <li>But now that my husband is using it, I may have to buy more.  </li>
            <li>(perhaps it would work better on the face?).  </li>
            <li>its many, tons of them.</li>
            <li>this works ok, but doesn&#x27;t do all it promises, tend skin works way better but stings, whereas princereigns does not sting.</li>
            <li>and I find Princereigns to be the best to help control and eliminate ingrown facial hair on my neck.</li>
            <li>This product was okay.  </li>
            <li>His skin responds much better to Billy Jealousy Hydroplane and Shaved Ice.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This one works the best out of all that ive tried but it doesnt remove all the razor bumps and the redness comes back after 4 hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have better results out of beauty supply products.</li>
            <li>I stopped and started using it again 3 times before I was sure it was the product.</li>
            <li>I. LOVE.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never written a review before! :-)</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I noticed results after 3 or 4 days of use, but when I applied more (2 pumps instead of 1)</li>
            <li>I saw even better results.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the product and service.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d tried alternatives, like Bump patrol and bikinizone which didn&#x27;t work that well, and pfb vanish which worked slightly better.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I have ingrown hairs on my bikini line and have suffered from them from many years.</li>
            <li>For something that costs so much and has had so many great reviews</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product now for about 3 weeks, and have already ordered three more bottles.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>and it was worked much better.</li>
            <li>I have never had so many ingrown hair in my life.</li>
            <li>Even my husband who uses Tend Skin on his face got more ingrowns while using Princereigns.</li>
            <li>I have suffered for many many years from ingrown hairs (ever since I started shaving).</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Most stuff has alcohol in it which stings and seems inefficient/abrasive.</li>
            <li>I suspect that it could work better on some than others just by the nature of the product.</li>
            <li>but him more...</li>
            <li>is more better, i don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>the smell was absolutley acceptable and not so overwhelming that it would wash out ones cologne or parfume.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I know I gave this product 4 stars</li>
            <li>Based on the glowing reviews, I was hoping the bumps would reduce more, but do think this product is helping.</li>
            <li>Still looking for a better cure to the damage of in grown hairs and bumbs</li>
            <li>Love the stuff</li>
            <li>For $30 I&#x27;d be better off saving it and putting it towards laser hair removal.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products, and this one that i dont use anymore.</li>
            <li>I bought this for myself and my husband ended using it more than me.  </li>
            <li>He asked me to buy more.</li>
            <li>i am enjoying this.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I was very excited and praying for this product to work.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good</li>
            <li>The product is great and does the job, but you do have to use it regularly in order for it to be 100% effective.  </li>
            <li>Three months ago, as I was looking for good deals for Tend Skin, I came across Princereigns on Amazon and read all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>for now i would say so far so good - this product is better than most.</li>
            <li>But overall good quality product!</li>
            <li>Best of luck to other purchasers, but I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know it compares, but I have no interest in any other products because this one works great!</li>
            <li>or so is not bad for the relief!</li>
            <li>This stuff easily replaced the tend skin in my opinion, remember they both work</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wirey and strong.</li>
            <li>When I wash my face with cleanser, I use a warm wash cloth, and very gently massage it over my face.</li>
            <li>ALSO, another reason why I liked it, it really helps reduce the redness from epilating!</li>
            <li>Most people seemed to have a positive outcome, plus it was gentle and had pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>it has a great smell too and is very easy to apply unlike other creams or after shave products.</li>
            <li>, I always had a huge bump</li>
            <li>Some reviews say the product didn&#x27;t work as great as expected; I suggest they be more liberal with the application.</li>
            <li>i ended up with huge lumps and bumps.</li>
            <li>, it is light.  </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions religiously and experienced no changes/ improvements.</li>
            <li>My husband loves it ...keeps his face smooth &amp; free</li>
            <li>while somewhat costly my goal was to find the lowest price and free shipping.</li>
            <li>, I jumped on amazon.com and eureka I found the wonder gel and here comes the great part I have only used it for two days now and the itching has stopped and the bumps are shrinking</li>
            <li>Use this in any area that you shave to ensure smooth, bump-free skin.</li>
            <li>WORTH TRYING for sure.</li>
            <li>By this time I&#x27;d used my fair share of serums, natural and chemical.</li>
            <li>even directly after shaving and liberalling rubbing it in good</li>
            <li>and I very rarely get any bumps or boils at all.   </li>
            <li>Did not completly erase the bumps and dark spots as good as I would of liked.</li>
            <li>Deserved a five star this product got me sold from the first time I used it, will be buying more in the future for sure!!</li>
            <li>It helped my ingrown hairs some, however I still had a significant amount.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the serum for about a week and can see a significant difference.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a good month or 2 and there are barely any results.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>So I was excited to see it was sold at a cheaper price w/ a reliable source.</li>
            <li>The investment of a good epilator and this gel, saves hundreds a year we used to spend on waxing, with the same smooth results.</li>
            <li>If you need something for a very large surface area, you might want to try something more economical.</li>
            <li>It is soothing to the skin (no burning) and has a nice scent, which is nice compared to other products</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s more than that you&#x27;re probably using too much.</li>
            <li>and if you only use it once a day it seems just as good.</li>
            <li>and it really works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool and soothing and goes on</li>
            <li>no problem with burning and princereigns did a rather good job of soothingly - big plus.</li>
            <li>would i have liked my skin to be like my 8yr old son&#x27;s skin, yes</li>
            <li>and I always shave my head and the bumps are here again in all their pain full glory.  </li>
            <li>It worked okay, didn&#x27;t get rid of 100% of the ingrown hairs, maybe 60%, but it made my skin very oily.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly, and has soothing aloe which is good especially if you have razor burn.</li>
            <li>My son was home for a visit from the Navy and thought it was so great, he took it with him to share with the other officers on his ship.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly.</li>
            <li>after reading hundreds of posts on various products i chose princereigns because many people were getting results and it didn&#x27;t denote many \\&quot;burns like hell comments\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, I&#x27;ve gone to many-a-really high end spa in hopes of finding professionals who are more \\&quot;clean\\&quot; than your downtown nail shop.</li>
            <li>First review I have written because I was just so happy that it was the first product that has actually worked on the ingrown hairs as well as the scars!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, goes on fine, dries quickly, and as near as I can tell is scent-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks pretty that&#x27;s about the only thing good about it.</li>
            <li>This product Princereigns worked exactly as described!</li>
            <li>Try this stuff, it&#x27;s not expensive so give it a shot!</li>
            <li>recv&#x27;d quickly - under 5 days and shipping was free - that was reasonable.</li>
            <li>I also like that the scent is not too powerful</li>
            <li>This product also helps to soothe and heal ingrown hairs, so I find it really useful when I get my legs waxed.       </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth not having to deal with ingrown hairs</li>
            <li>WOW, living in LA I am ofetn in a bikini or top with sarong</li>
            <li>I tried them, it hurt like hell, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t burn, AT ALL, even though my skin was screaming from being freshly</li>
            <li>&quot; I was never unhappy with Tend Skin</li>
            <li>it is so worth it.      </li>
            <li>But overall I liked the product and it was well worth the money.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes seeing as there are so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>This product smells nice, goes on easily, and when applied 2-3 times a day, it did help the bumps go down.  </li>
            <li>Any one who has had these kind of bumps on the back of their scalps and their faces can tell you how pain full and how much these bumps itch.      </li>
            <li>After you shave don&#x27;t apply it right away,</li>
            <li>i used it twice a day in the morning right after shaving and at night before bed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the consistency of the product, but it&#x27;s worth it since it works very well!</li>
            <li>I thought without alcohol it would just be sticky and clog more pores, but it actually goes on so smooth and really soothes.</li>
            <li>But yes its really soothing ..and helps to reduce Razor Bumps so quickly ....</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn, sting, or have a strong smell, etc., and is made from aloe and natural fruit ingredients.</li>
            <li>But, it did leave my skin feeling very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I will not use this particular reseller again since it is not convenient to make a special trip to the USPS office to sign and pickup the package.</li>
            <li>and it works very fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks Prince Reigns for keeping us pretty!</li>
            <li>Up until this product I pretty much avoided tanks and swim suits, which is fine for the area I live in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just used up my first bottle.  </li>
            <li>I most often see results the next day, and sometimes after two days of use.</li>
            <li>I also love that you don&#x27;t have to use it all the time, only when you need it!</li>
            <li>It seems to help make deep ingrown hairs visible but it does a better job at preventing and making your skin feel a bit softer.</li>
            <li>I tried Tend Skin first and that did help some, but nothing like Princereigns.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life I have a smooth, clear, bikini line.</li>
            <li>The product didn&#x27;t exactly work for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend using it with the brush, and being consistent.</li>
            <li>In fact, I don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;ll  have to even wear foundation pretty soon.</li>
            <li>Currently, I have so many bumps and ingrowns</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sure to use extra moisturizing lotion when I use Tend Skin.</li>
            <li>This product really works!  </li>
            <li>I used this product exactly how i should</li>
            <li>my plan of attack was first to see if my face would tolerate the product or the burn test.</li>
            <li>the first week i noticed my skin smoothing a bit.</li>
            <li>with about 1-2 weeks left of the first bottle i am convinced and satisfied it worked.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY product on the market (and I have tried SO many) that works to get rid of in-grown hairs.  </li>
            <li>But it has not made my ingrown hairs better at all, and actually makes me break out.  </li>
            <li>or what appears to be nothing more that sugar, water and food coloring mixed together.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend this product to friends.</li>
            <li>Save your money and do not buy this product or be fooled by these positive ratings.</li>
            <li>When I do get an ingrown hair the gel seems to clear the skin up quickly.</li>
            <li>The product works really well on ingrown hair as well as pretty much any irritated skin.</li>
            <li>I picked up this product at a store that I work at and was pretty excited to try something that might actually work.  </li>
            <li>I often had one or two on my stomach that would be there for months as a huge inflamed red thing that wouldn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li>I really adore this product, I use it all the time.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice much difference when hubby used this.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for over 2 months now and it really does reduce the bumps and irritation.</li>
            <li>so I really needed something that would help with my ingrown hairs</li>
            <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t really smell.     </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really say, but there is an improvement</li>
            <li>Also, did not see much improvement otherwise.</li>
            <li>and I cant tell you how much of a pain ingrowns were to my skin.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what to say,...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It really helps the ingrowns grow out.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t do much for me.  </li>
            <li>Since removing the hair depends on how fast your hair grows, it&#x27;s effectiveness as a \\&quot;remover\\&quot; can vary.  </li>
            <li>Not because TendSkin doesn&#x27;t work, because it does work very well,</li>
            <li>This does work, but you gotta be really consistant.</li>
            <li>Turns out, I get ingrowns no matter where I go or how much I spend for my brazilians.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>Really works.  </li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to using this stuff and really had faith in it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even really have a noticeable smell</li>
            <li>I have seen much improvement in the bikini line area with the use of Princereigns Ingrown Hair Gel.</li>
            <li>Been great will definitely keep product on hand in growns have really disappeared after just a few uses of product</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair, so I get ingrowns everywhere.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it as much as it says I should, though..</li>
            <li>None really worked, but</li>
            <li>, I recommend this product to any one who wants to get rid of the bumps caused by ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>this product did work,just not as fast  </li>
            <li>I was really hopeful that this can help me to get rid of them</li>
            <li>this product did absolutely nothing for my ingrown hairs in my bikini area.</li>
            <li>but if you can find it at a reasonable price</li>
            <li>I bought this years ago and find that it still works very well on zits as well as irritated skin.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>Second only to coconut oil, so for the price, C-oil might win in the future.</li>
            <li>It really works for me.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>This stuff really is better than Tend Skin or other anti-ingrown gels.</li>
            <li>Oh and P.S. I also tried all the other BS out there like \\&quot;Tend Skin\\&quot; aka liquid Fire and Magic Shave, Min roller and even Nads</li>
            <li>Maybe it works better for other people.  </li>
            <li>This stuff does not dry me out, has no unpleasant smell, and can be used on acne</li>
            <li>This just simply isn&#x27;t strong enough to completely get rid of the ingrown hairs and razor bumps.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me, a new brazilian wax salon opened up near where I live.</li>
            <li>Neither the amazon.com listing nor the product website provides a full list of ingredients, which should have been a red flag</li>
            <li>However, I was glad that it sort of lightened the dark spots.</li>
            <li>Way cheaper than buying directly from the supplier and ships really fast!  </li>
            <li>Now maybe it&#x27;s just me because I come from a German-Italian background and have rich thick black hair and fair skin, but it really didn&#x27;t do much of anything to stop ingrowns.</li>
            <li>Then I apply the Princereigns, and let it dry before I put my foundation, which goes on smoothly over this.</li>
            <li>the pores on my legs appear smaller and overall my legs are always smoother and the skin looks better when I use this product.  </li>
            <li>i do agree with some posts that it does a somewhat decent job of evening out ones skin tone.</li>
            <li>This stuff does a decent job</li>
            <li>I was expecting a lot more than it making ingrown spots a little less noticeable and feel slightly better.</li>
            <li>I bought it at the spa where I get my Brazilians - it was highly recommended, so I had high hope for it...plus, for the price I figured it must work.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this stuff for all the girls out there.</li>
            <li>Definitely highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend both the product and seller.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend,</li>
            <li>I was recommended by my specialist to use this but they sold it at a high price at their location &amp; I always went through them in a month.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve held back on reviewing this for a while because I wanted to make sure it worked over the long term.  </li>
            <li>but realistically my face appeared to get smoother certaining better that it was before a few weeks of this application.</li>
            <li>Although I think it&#x27;s good, its not great.</li>
            <li>While I did see immediate improvement within the first few days, it was closer to 2 weeks that I&#x27;d be comfortable saying my skin was completely cured.  </li>
            <li>Since the new year 2007 started I&#x27;ve already bought 2 bottle&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I am sort of rationing it until my new bottles come in.</li>
            <li>The other thing is that it leaves a kind of film on your leg, which isn&#x27;t noticable when it&#x27;s dry, but when you shower, it gets kinda slimy.</li>
            <li>I still have a few brown spots but am by far pleased with the results i have had.</li>
            <li>I have HORRIBLE skin that can&#x27;t \\&quot;push things through\\&quot; on it&#x27;s own, including acne, scars easily, and I have even more stubborn hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if i&#x27;m just convincing myself</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li>but it still fixed my problems!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Worked pretty well, I definitely saw results in about a month.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is necessarily any better than any of the other ingrown hair products I&#x27;ve tried (eg.</li>
            <li>The material and color are very well chosen for a serious and elegant presentation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The level of excitement I have at the results is almost ridiculous really, but I&#x27;ve NEVER been confident wearing a tank or swimsuit</li>
            <li>I used this for full leg bikini application and it only lasted about 3 weeks with daily use.</li>
            <li>Quite a few of these ingredients are highly toxic according to the Skin Deep Safe Cosmetics database.  </li>
            <li>so I was open to trying something new and Princereigns seemed promising.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t the total answer I had hoped for - but it certainly has helped.</li>
            <li>After just a couple of applications, I was completely clear of problems.</li>
            <li>Some of the bumps that had been there for years were just gone, and my skin looked so clear.</li>
            <li>This is slightly scented, but it&#x27;s a clean smell, not flowery or masculine, so anyone can use it.</li>
            <li>I just received Tend Skin in the mail, and hopefully, it&#x27;ll help my waxed area clear up before I take my vacation in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>It helps my neck stay clear and prevents ingrown hair.  </li>
            <li>And now it lasts me several months since I dont use it as much,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve so far tried everything from AHA to glycolic on my legs after I&#x27;ve shaved and so far no luck.</li>
            <li>, I was surprised that after 2 days of usage I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I do not have what I would consider sensitive skin either.</li>
            <li>I like the fact it is natural and doesn&#x27;t leave a burning sensation, but it does tingle</li>
            <li>(it might in fact burn if you have sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li>After a few visits, I got comfortable with my wax lady</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and the ingrown hair problem has decrease so far.</li>
            <li>It has not- waste of time and money.</li>
            <li>The hair grew back straight rather than curling.</li>
            <li>The answer for me was the later, it did absolute nothing to help my ingrown hair issue when shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li>wait 5-10 minutes before apply to ensure that no bumps will arrive because they area could be sensitive after shaving.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>total price w/shipping $20.00 - reasonable.</li>
            <li>I have been plagued with ingrown hairs in recent years and this has really alleviated/prevented them.</li>
            <li>(who knows maybe if I did my condition would be completely gone)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so many problems with my skin the last few years that I&#x27;ve been going to a spa and having lactic acid peels and facials.</li>
            <li>So with a careful eye I monitored the difference in my skin after using 3 bottles worth &amp; to no surprise nothing changed like how it was suppose to work.</li>
            <li>in fact, I kind of think it may have made them worse.  </li>
            <li>I bought this based on the success reported by other reviewers.</li>
            <li>in general, this product is no where near 5 stars.</li>
            <li>to all who have complimented my slick and smooth face.</li>
            <li>That, combined with princereigns has gotten my skin back close to normal.</li>
            <li>It helps with bumps, irritation, the little hairs that are stuck underneath quickly peak out.</li>
            <li>when you have severe ingrown hair problems at least for me my goal is to be open and try most everything.</li>
            <li>For those of you who do care, beware that the \\&quot;only all natural ingredients\\&quot; advertised on the Prince Reigns website aren&#x27;t that natural at all.</li>
            <li>After reading all of the good reviews, I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li>It is a little more money than other products</li>
            <li>while i applauded previous posts for warning away from this product because it was not 100% natural as stated, costly or plain didn&#x27;t perform, when you have severe/painful ingrown hairs, again you try most anything once.</li>
            <li>It arrived before expected and works really well.</li>
            <li>Barely any improvement.</li>
            <li>i never wasted a drop rubbing it in - big plus.</li>
            <li>I really gets rid of the red bumps on my legs that I get from shaving and also just from dry skin.</li>
            <li>She applied some of the soothing green Prince Reigns gel for me right then and there, and recommended that I purchase a bottle from the front.</li>
            <li>When I first used it there was a slight improvement (I used it every day).</li>
            <li>I tried a lot of things but find this is really helping reduce in grown and marks on my skin due to waxing.</li>
            <li>I have introduced it to my brother, cousin and boyfriend who shave their faces and deal with major razor bumps regularly.</li>
            <li>The shipping cost seems to be higher than the actual cost of having it shipped, I noticed the tag on my package was less than $2, but I was charged around $4.</li>
            <li>Its very soothing to your skin and brings down redness and swelling.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other products which work much better like Tend Skin and Min New York Solution two, both just as pricy as this product, but the other ones at least do what they say.</li>
            <li>there are slight results or there really just aren&#x27;t any.</li>
            <li>I was skeptic at first thinking I would waste money buying this shaving gel, but it actually work.  </li>

            <li> That&#x27;s another great thing about this product; you don&#x27;t need to use a lot to see results.     </li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t so great for me.</li>
            <li> I already got rid of a couple of ingrown hairs that had been hanging out under my skin for a couple of weeks which made me really happy.     </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll get great results.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give it a shot, because it felt great when she rubbed it in.</li>

            <li> This stuff works great.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how great</li>
            <li> I am proud to say \\&quot;I can&#x27;t wait to go to the beach this summer!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> it works great</li>
            <li> after hearing all the great reviews about this product i decided to try it.</li>
            <li> and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very nice.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t work miracles, but if you&#x27;re taking good care of your skin already, this will do a great job topping that off.  </li>
            <li> It smells good, and feels good going on.</li>
            <li> Really good stuff.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t delay a smooth and perfect face</li>
            <li> Product in good condition.  </li>
            <li> Loved the results.  </li>
            <li> it is a good product</li>
            <li> It felt good after shaving, but did not do waht it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I also read some reviews of people saying it smelt good.</li>
            <li> I paid good money for this based on a magazine&#x27;s recommendation.  </li>
            <li> I think that her complexion is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> All and all a good product</li>
            <li> should be a good gauge as to where i&#x27;d like my face to be.</li>
            <li> This is the best after shave product I have ever purchased it gives you a smooth feeling after every shave and leave you with that elegant and brilliant look</li>
            <li> So good</li>
            <li> It smells nice and feels good on the skin, but I thought maybe my skin needs to breath</li>
            <li> and I started to feel great about myself and more confident it is remarkable.</li>
            <li> my primary purpose of buying this was to get rid of my ingrowns, it soothes the ingrown spots when its hurting, but I haven&#x27;t experienced anything the good reviews told me.</li>
            <li> I am buying more for my friends and family!</li>
            <li> I wonder if you&#x27;re better off not using anything at all than to use Princereigns(to save money!)</li>
            <li> The results are fantastic!!</li>
            <li> more to come!</li>
            <li> I found this item almost by accident, but am so glad I did!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> product came in handy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product to apply just after shaving as it soothes the area</li>
            <li> Maybe is works for those lil annoyances that go away on their own anyway</li>
            <li> But yeah, this stuff really works great!  </li>
            <li> No relief from ingrown hairs either for my husband&#x27;s beard or my own eyebrow wax.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s nice stuff.</li>
            <li> It is an effective product to throw $ 30 in the trash</li>
            <li> I brought this product and to be honest</li>
            <li> Allow me to explain, I give it the 4 stars because it is awesome if my legs are really itchy from all the hair trying to regrow, but I don&#x27;t feel that it prevents the ingrowns</li>
            <li> For the price, Tend Skin is much more effective and lasts a lot longer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more effective then Tend Skin</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t say that I love it -</li>
            <li> It was the best product that I have found so far for the problem.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for over a year now and love, love, love it!  </li>
            <li> time was good, adequate packaging to protect the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works ok for the most part.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that I am not getting as many ingrown hairs as I used to</li>
            <li> But now that my husband is using it, I may have to buy more.  </li>
            <li> (perhaps it would work better on the face?).  </li>
            <li> its many, tons of them.</li>
            <li> this works ok, but doesn&#x27;t do all it promises, tend skin works way better but stings, whereas princereigns does not sting.</li>
            <li> and I find Princereigns to be the best to help control and eliminate ingrown facial hair on my neck.</li>
            <li> This product was okay.  </li>
            <li> His skin responds much better to Billy Jealousy Hydroplane and Shaved Ice.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This one works the best out of all that ive tried but it doesnt remove all the razor bumps and the redness comes back after 4 hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have better results out of beauty supply products.</li>
            <li> I stopped and started using it again 3 times before I was sure it was the product.</li>
            <li> I. LOVE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before! :-)</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I noticed results after 3 or 4 days of use, but when I applied more (2 pumps instead of 1)</li>
            <li> I saw even better results.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the product and service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried alternatives, like Bump patrol and bikinizone which didn&#x27;t work that well, and pfb vanish which worked slightly better.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have ingrown hairs on my bikini line and have suffered from them from many years.</li>
            <li> For something that costs so much and has had so many great reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product now for about 3 weeks, and have already ordered three more bottles.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> and it was worked much better.</li>
            <li> I have never had so many ingrown hair in my life.</li>
            <li> Even my husband who uses Tend Skin on his face got more ingrowns while using Princereigns.</li>
            <li> I have suffered for many many years from ingrown hairs (ever since I started shaving).</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Most stuff has alcohol in it which stings and seems inefficient/abrasive.</li>
            <li> I suspect that it could work better on some than others just by the nature of the product.</li>
            <li> but him more...</li>
            <li> is more better, i don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> the smell was absolutley acceptable and not so overwhelming that it would wash out ones cologne or parfume.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I know I gave this product 4 stars</li>
            <li> Based on the glowing reviews, I was hoping the bumps would reduce more, but do think this product is helping.</li>
            <li> Still looking for a better cure to the damage of in grown hairs and bumbs</li>
            <li> Love the stuff</li>
            <li> For $30 I&#x27;d be better off saving it and putting it towards laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products, and this one that i dont use anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself and my husband ended using it more than me.  </li>
            <li> He asked me to buy more.</li>
            <li> i am enjoying this.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I was very excited and praying for this product to work.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good</li>
            <li> The product is great and does the job, but you do have to use it regularly in order for it to be 100% effective.  </li>
            <li> Three months ago, as I was looking for good deals for Tend Skin, I came across Princereigns on Amazon and read all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> for now i would say so far so good - this product is better than most.</li>
            <li> But overall good quality product!</li>
            <li> Best of luck to other purchasers, but I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know it compares, but I have no interest in any other products because this one works great!</li>
            <li> or so is not bad for the relief!</li>
            <li> This stuff easily replaced the tend skin in my opinion, remember they both work</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wirey and strong.</li>
            <li> When I wash my face with cleanser, I use a warm wash cloth, and very gently massage it over my face.</li>
            <li> ALSO, another reason why I liked it, it really helps reduce the redness from epilating!</li>
            <li> Most people seemed to have a positive outcome, plus it was gentle and had pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> it has a great smell too and is very easy to apply unlike other creams or after shave products.</li>
            <li> , I always had a huge bump</li>
            <li> Some reviews say the product didn&#x27;t work as great as expected; I suggest they be more liberal with the application.</li>
            <li> i ended up with huge lumps and bumps.</li>
            <li> , it is light.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions religiously and experienced no changes/ improvements.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it ...keeps his face smooth &amp; free</li>
            <li> while somewhat costly my goal was to find the lowest price and free shipping.</li>
            <li> , I jumped on amazon.com and eureka I found the wonder gel and here comes the great part I have only used it for two days now and the itching has stopped and the bumps are shrinking</li>
            <li> Use this in any area that you shave to ensure smooth, bump-free skin.</li>
            <li> WORTH TRYING for sure.</li>
            <li> By this time I&#x27;d used my fair share of serums, natural and chemical.</li>
            <li> even directly after shaving and liberalling rubbing it in good</li>
            <li> and I very rarely get any bumps or boils at all.   </li>
            <li> Did not completly erase the bumps and dark spots as good as I would of liked.</li>
            <li> Deserved a five star this product got me sold from the first time I used it, will be buying more in the future for sure!!</li>
            <li> It helped my ingrown hairs some, however I still had a significant amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for about a week and can see a significant difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a good month or 2 and there are barely any results.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> So I was excited to see it was sold at a cheaper price w/ a reliable source.</li>
            <li> The investment of a good epilator and this gel, saves hundreds a year we used to spend on waxing, with the same smooth results.</li>
            <li> If you need something for a very large surface area, you might want to try something more economical.</li>
            <li> It is soothing to the skin (no burning) and has a nice scent, which is nice compared to other products</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s more than that you&#x27;re probably using too much.</li>
            <li> and if you only use it once a day it seems just as good.</li>
            <li> and it really works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool and soothing and goes on</li>
            <li> no problem with burning and princereigns did a rather good job of soothingly - big plus.</li>
            <li> would i have liked my skin to be like my 8yr old son&#x27;s skin, yes</li>
            <li> and I always shave my head and the bumps are here again in all their pain full glory.  </li>
            <li> It worked okay, didn&#x27;t get rid of 100% of the ingrown hairs, maybe 60%, but it made my skin very oily.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly, and has soothing aloe which is good especially if you have razor burn.</li>
            <li> My son was home for a visit from the Navy and thought it was so great, he took it with him to share with the other officers on his ship.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly.</li>
            <li> after reading hundreds of posts on various products i chose princereigns because many people were getting results and it didn&#x27;t denote many \\&quot;burns like hell comments\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, I&#x27;ve gone to many-a-really high end spa in hopes of finding professionals who are more \\&quot;clean\\&quot; than your downtown nail shop.</li>
            <li> First review I have written because I was just so happy that it was the first product that has actually worked on the ingrown hairs as well as the scars!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, goes on fine, dries quickly, and as near as I can tell is scent-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks pretty that&#x27;s about the only thing good about it.</li>
            <li> This product Princereigns worked exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Try this stuff, it&#x27;s not expensive so give it a shot!</li>
            <li> recv&#x27;d quickly - under 5 days and shipping was free - that was reasonable.</li>
            <li> I also like that the scent is not too powerful</li>
            <li> This product also helps to soothe and heal ingrown hairs, so I find it really useful when I get my legs waxed.       </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth not having to deal with ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> WOW, living in LA I am ofetn in a bikini or top with sarong</li>
            <li> I tried them, it hurt like hell, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t burn, AT ALL, even though my skin was screaming from being freshly</li>
            <li> &quot; I was never unhappy with Tend Skin</li>
            <li> it is so worth it.      </li>
            <li> But overall I liked the product and it was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes seeing as there are so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> This product smells nice, goes on easily, and when applied 2-3 times a day, it did help the bumps go down.  </li>
            <li> Any one who has had these kind of bumps on the back of their scalps and their faces can tell you how pain full and how much these bumps itch.      </li>
            <li> After you shave don&#x27;t apply it right away,</li>
            <li> i used it twice a day in the morning right after shaving and at night before bed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the consistency of the product, but it&#x27;s worth it since it works very well!</li>
            <li> I thought without alcohol it would just be sticky and clog more pores, but it actually goes on so smooth and really soothes.</li>
            <li> But yes its really soothing ..and helps to reduce Razor Bumps so quickly ....</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn, sting, or have a strong smell, etc., and is made from aloe and natural fruit ingredients.</li>
            <li> But, it did leave my skin feeling very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I will not use this particular reseller again since it is not convenient to make a special trip to the USPS office to sign and pickup the package.</li>
            <li> and it works very fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks Prince Reigns for keeping us pretty!</li>
            <li> Up until this product I pretty much avoided tanks and swim suits, which is fine for the area I live in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just used up my first bottle.  </li>
            <li> I most often see results the next day, and sometimes after two days of use.</li>
            <li> I also love that you don&#x27;t have to use it all the time, only when you need it!</li>
            <li> It seems to help make deep ingrown hairs visible but it does a better job at preventing and making your skin feel a bit softer.</li>
            <li> I tried Tend Skin first and that did help some, but nothing like Princereigns.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life I have a smooth, clear, bikini line.</li>
            <li> The product didn&#x27;t exactly work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend using it with the brush, and being consistent.</li>
            <li> In fact, I don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;ll  have to even wear foundation pretty soon.</li>
            <li> Currently, I have so many bumps and ingrowns</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be sure to use extra moisturizing lotion when I use Tend Skin.</li>
            <li> This product really works!  </li>
            <li> I used this product exactly how i should</li>
            <li> my plan of attack was first to see if my face would tolerate the product or the burn test.</li>
            <li> the first week i noticed my skin smoothing a bit.</li>
            <li> with about 1-2 weeks left of the first bottle i am convinced and satisfied it worked.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product on the market (and I have tried SO many) that works to get rid of in-grown hairs.  </li>
            <li> But it has not made my ingrown hairs better at all, and actually makes me break out.  </li>
            <li> or what appears to be nothing more that sugar, water and food coloring mixed together.</li>
            <li> I would most definitely recommend this product to friends.</li>
            <li> Save your money and do not buy this product or be fooled by these positive ratings.</li>
            <li> When I do get an ingrown hair the gel seems to clear the skin up quickly.</li>
            <li> The product works really well on ingrown hair as well as pretty much any irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I picked up this product at a store that I work at and was pretty excited to try something that might actually work.  </li>
            <li> I often had one or two on my stomach that would be there for months as a huge inflamed red thing that wouldn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> I really adore this product, I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much difference when hubby used this.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 2 months now and it really does reduce the bumps and irritation.</li>
            <li> so I really needed something that would help with my ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t really smell.     </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really say, but there is an improvement</li>
            <li> Also, did not see much improvement otherwise.</li>
            <li> and I cant tell you how much of a pain ingrowns were to my skin.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what to say,...</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It really helps the ingrowns grow out.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do much for me.  </li>
            <li> Since removing the hair depends on how fast your hair grows, it&#x27;s effectiveness as a \\&quot;remover\\&quot; can vary.  </li>
            <li> Not because TendSkin doesn&#x27;t work, because it does work very well,</li>
            <li> This does work, but you gotta be really consistant.</li>
            <li> Turns out, I get ingrowns no matter where I go or how much I spend for my brazilians.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> Really works.  </li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this stuff and really had faith in it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even really have a noticeable smell</li>
            <li> I have seen much improvement in the bikini line area with the use of Princereigns Ingrown Hair Gel.</li>
            <li> Been great will definitely keep product on hand in growns have really disappeared after just a few uses of product</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, so I get ingrowns everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it as much as it says I should, though..</li>
            <li> None really worked, but</li>
            <li> , I recommend this product to any one who wants to get rid of the bumps caused by ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> this product did work,just not as fast  </li>
            <li> I was really hopeful that this can help me to get rid of them</li>
            <li> this product did absolutely nothing for my ingrown hairs in my bikini area.</li>
            <li> but if you can find it at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> I bought this years ago and find that it still works very well on zits as well as irritated skin.</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> Second only to coconut oil, so for the price, C-oil might win in the future.</li>
            <li> It really works for me.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff really is better than Tend Skin or other anti-ingrown gels.</li>
            <li> Oh and P.S. I also tried all the other BS out there like \\&quot;Tend Skin\\&quot; aka liquid Fire and Magic Shave, Min roller and even Nads</li>
            <li> Maybe it works better for other people.  </li>
            <li> This stuff does not dry me out, has no unpleasant smell, and can be used on acne</li>
            <li> This just simply isn&#x27;t strong enough to completely get rid of the ingrown hairs and razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Lucky for me, a new brazilian wax salon opened up near where I live.</li>
            <li> Neither the amazon.com listing nor the product website provides a full list of ingredients, which should have been a red flag</li>
            <li> However, I was glad that it sort of lightened the dark spots.</li>
            <li> Way cheaper than buying directly from the supplier and ships really fast!  </li>
            <li> Now maybe it&#x27;s just me because I come from a German-Italian background and have rich thick black hair and fair skin, but it really didn&#x27;t do much of anything to stop ingrowns.</li>
            <li> Then I apply the Princereigns, and let it dry before I put my foundation, which goes on smoothly over this.</li>
            <li> the pores on my legs appear smaller and overall my legs are always smoother and the skin looks better when I use this product.  </li>
            <li> i do agree with some posts that it does a somewhat decent job of evening out ones skin tone.</li>
            <li> This stuff does a decent job</li>
            <li> I was expecting a lot more than it making ingrown spots a little less noticeable and feel slightly better.</li>
            <li> I bought it at the spa where I get my Brazilians - it was highly recommended, so I had high hope for it...plus, for the price I figured it must work.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this stuff for all the girls out there.</li>
            <li> Definitely highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend both the product and seller.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend,</li>
            <li> I was recommended by my specialist to use this but they sold it at a high price at their location &amp; I always went through them in a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve held back on reviewing this for a while because I wanted to make sure it worked over the long term.  </li>
            <li> but realistically my face appeared to get smoother certaining better that it was before a few weeks of this application.</li>
            <li> Although I think it&#x27;s good, its not great.</li>
            <li> While I did see immediate improvement within the first few days, it was closer to 2 weeks that I&#x27;d be comfortable saying my skin was completely cured.  </li>
            <li> Since the new year 2007 started I&#x27;ve already bought 2 bottle&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I am sort of rationing it until my new bottles come in.</li>
            <li> The other thing is that it leaves a kind of film on your leg, which isn&#x27;t noticable when it&#x27;s dry, but when you shower, it gets kinda slimy.</li>
            <li> I still have a few brown spots but am by far pleased with the results i have had.</li>
            <li> I have HORRIBLE skin that can&#x27;t \\&quot;push things through\\&quot; on it&#x27;s own, including acne, scars easily, and I have even more stubborn hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if i&#x27;m just convincing myself</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li> but it still fixed my problems!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Worked pretty well, I definitely saw results in about a month.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is necessarily any better than any of the other ingrown hair products I&#x27;ve tried (eg.</li>
            <li> The material and color are very well chosen for a serious and elegant presentation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The level of excitement I have at the results is almost ridiculous really, but I&#x27;ve NEVER been confident wearing a tank or swimsuit</li>
            <li> I used this for full leg bikini application and it only lasted about 3 weeks with daily use.</li>
            <li> Quite a few of these ingredients are highly toxic according to the Skin Deep Safe Cosmetics database.  </li>
            <li> so I was open to trying something new and Princereigns seemed promising.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t the total answer I had hoped for - but it certainly has helped.</li>
            <li> After just a couple of applications, I was completely clear of problems.</li>
            <li> Some of the bumps that had been there for years were just gone, and my skin looked so clear.</li>
            <li> This is slightly scented, but it&#x27;s a clean smell, not flowery or masculine, so anyone can use it.</li>
            <li> I just received Tend Skin in the mail, and hopefully, it&#x27;ll help my waxed area clear up before I take my vacation in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> It helps my neck stay clear and prevents ingrown hair.  </li>
            <li> And now it lasts me several months since I dont use it as much,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve so far tried everything from AHA to glycolic on my legs after I&#x27;ve shaved and so far no luck.</li>
            <li> , I was surprised that after 2 days of usage I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I do not have what I would consider sensitive skin either.</li>
            <li> I like the fact it is natural and doesn&#x27;t leave a burning sensation, but it does tingle</li>
            <li> (it might in fact burn if you have sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li> After a few visits, I got comfortable with my wax lady</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and the ingrown hair problem has decrease so far.</li>
            <li> It has not- waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> The hair grew back straight rather than curling.</li>
            <li> The answer for me was the later, it did absolute nothing to help my ingrown hair issue when shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> wait 5-10 minutes before apply to ensure that no bumps will arrive because they area could be sensitive after shaving.</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> total price w/shipping $20.00 - reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have been plagued with ingrown hairs in recent years and this has really alleviated/prevented them.</li>
            <li> (who knows maybe if I did my condition would be completely gone)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so many problems with my skin the last few years that I&#x27;ve been going to a spa and having lactic acid peels and facials.</li>
            <li> So with a careful eye I monitored the difference in my skin after using 3 bottles worth &amp; to no surprise nothing changed like how it was suppose to work.</li>
            <li> in fact, I kind of think it may have made them worse.  </li>
            <li> I bought this based on the success reported by other reviewers.</li>
            <li> in general, this product is no where near 5 stars.</li>
            <li> to all who have complimented my slick and smooth face.</li>
            <li> That, combined with princereigns has gotten my skin back close to normal.</li>
            <li> It helps with bumps, irritation, the little hairs that are stuck underneath quickly peak out.</li>
            <li> when you have severe ingrown hair problems at least for me my goal is to be open and try most everything.</li>
            <li> For those of you who do care, beware that the \\&quot;only all natural ingredients\\&quot; advertised on the Prince Reigns website aren&#x27;t that natural at all.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the good reviews, I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> It is a little more money than other products</li>
            <li> while i applauded previous posts for warning away from this product because it was not 100% natural as stated, costly or plain didn&#x27;t perform, when you have severe/painful ingrown hairs, again you try most anything once.</li>
            <li> It arrived before expected and works really well.</li>
            <li> Barely any improvement.</li>
            <li> i never wasted a drop rubbing it in - big plus.</li>
            <li> I really gets rid of the red bumps on my legs that I get from shaving and also just from dry skin.</li>
            <li> She applied some of the soothing green Prince Reigns gel for me right then and there, and recommended that I purchase a bottle from the front.</li>
            <li> When I first used it there was a slight improvement (I used it every day).</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of things but find this is really helping reduce in grown and marks on my skin due to waxing.</li>
            <li> I have introduced it to my brother, cousin and boyfriend who shave their faces and deal with major razor bumps regularly.</li>
            <li> The shipping cost seems to be higher than the actual cost of having it shipped, I noticed the tag on my package was less than $2, but I was charged around $4.</li>
            <li> Its very soothing to your skin and brings down redness and swelling.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products which work much better like Tend Skin and Min New York Solution two, both just as pricy as this product, but the other ones at least do what they say.</li>
            <li> there are slight results or there really just aren&#x27;t any.</li>
            <li> I was skeptic at first thinking I would waste money buying this shaving gel, but it actually work.  </li>
            <li> I had my hopes set really high based on the previous reviews.</li>
            <li> After two days of using this gel, all of the sudden, a long hair emerged from this bump in my skin and the bump finally went away!</li>
            <li> The lady that does my peels and facials is going to be disappointed that I don&#x27;t have to come back, but my complexion has not looked this good in years.</li>
            <li> There was some minor improvement, but I concluded that it was due to the body&#x27;s natural healing process, as the same amount of healing was visible in the leg where no solution was used.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t use it for legs), so one bottle will last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> I still get a lot of ingrowns, and it gets a little sticky right after you apply it, gotta wait a little before putting on clothes.</li>
            <li> After having read all of the fantastic reviews on this product I decided to try it after having tried a few other products specifically aimed at combating ingrown hairs (including Tend Skin which I found pretty useless).</li>
            <li> but this product is very expensive starting at $20 and more online and only get 2 oz</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t get rid of all of my ingrown hairs but has definitely helped!i will definitely keep using this as it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like some other products do.</li>
            <li> but I took a chance because the price compared favorably to my usual choice, the ingrown hair serum sold by European Wax Center which actually comes in a nearly identical bottle.</li>
            <li> What a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have had an ingrown hair for, I don&#x27;t even know how long - probably years</li>
            <li> Im a long time tend skin user and</li>
            <li> One bump just went away, leaving a long hair that had been clogged in it.</li>
            <li> Tend Skin didn&#x27;t work at all for me, Bikini Zone was a joke and complete waste of my money.</li>
            <li> but it is just about that for me, someone suffering for so long.</li>
            <li> I went to a dermatologist years ago and got a shot in my scalp and took some ointments that helped for a long time</li>
            <li> The gel is surprisingly thick and spreads very well.  </li>
            <li> my skin gets pretty bad razor bumps and ingrowns right along my jawbone.</li>
            <li> I figured maybe I was just having a \\&quot;dry spell\\&quot; but kept using it.  </li>
            <li> : It takes a couple of seconds to dry after application</li>
            <li> it would dry me out all the time and cause me to have an itchy face.</li>
            <li> I wash my face, and then let it dry.</li>
            <li> but it did dry out my skin</li>
            <li> My skin is clear and free of painful bumps.  </li>
            <li> I still get ingrown hairs and the dark spots definitely take some time to go away or fade away would be the correct phrase.</li>
            <li> However, after applying this for a few weeks my chronic ingrowns disappeared (leaving an inch long hair coming out) and didn&#x27;t come back (or if i did get another big one, it only lasted for a few days).</li>
            <li> other say its a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> the bumps appear once in awhile dark spots are the only problem now..</li>
            <li> I have multiple dark spots from ingrown hairs and it did not lighten them at all.  </li>
            <li> As an African American female it is very hard for me to get rid of ingrown hairs around my private area.</li>
            <li> I recently bought tend skin and that only helped a little bit!    </li>
            <li> Less red bumps and hair that comes in is sticking out straighter</li>
            <li> It works like it claims and teases out a lot of ingrown hairs, and tones down the red spots, but it does not entirely remove blemishes and dark spots from previous cases of ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> that was too long!!!</li>
            <li> I have had issues with bumps caused by ingrown hairs from my late teens to my early thirties.  </li>
            <li> So I spent the $ to buy it.</li>
            <li> but It was never available to us regular folk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all ingrown hair product&#x27;s since 1985 beleive me Ive&#x27; spent thousand of dollars, nothing comes close to it \\&quot;forget about it\\</li>
            <li> I had used Bump Patrol, which is about one third the price, but it dried my skin, causing peeling and took weeks to notice any difference.</li>
            <li> Product was missing the tube inside to allow it to pump out properly.</li>
            <li> The bottle says to apply twice a day, but I&#x27;m so forgetful</li>
            <li> during the 4-5week, i still plucked a few really deep stubborn ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> I mentioned it to my specialist &amp; she told me to be careful</li>
            <li> Some people have said in other reviews that the product is a little bit sticky after use, but that only lasts for a minute or so...</li>
            <li> and I also had those little dark dots where hair is starting to grow</li>
            <li> However, this product unfortunately contains parabens, and it seems disingenuous to advertise it as \\&quot;natural.\\&quot; While there is still question around just how dangerous parabens are, there are enough other endocrine disrupters I&#x27;m potentially exposed to every day that I don&#x27;t need to voluntarily add another one, especially when I have alternatives readily available.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I apply this to the area after I shave and no more red bumps or ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> At first when I bought this product I thought that it wouldn&#x27;t work, another over expensive thing.</li>
            <li> and I would put lotion on it and other things</li>
            <li> I do it every other day-ish, and I have not had an ingrown since.</li>
            <li> of course i am still researching other products (like anthony&#x27;s logistics,min ny solutions2) and will keep you posted after 3 months (12/31/2009)of princereigns.</li>
            <li> but I will continue to try other products.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend your time and money on this lame product do your research first on something else.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least 10 other products and the same thing.</li>
            <li> The product is a little costly, but for small areas like face and bikini it will last a while.</li>
            <li> I began to notice a difference in my complexion the second day, which is hard to believe, even for me.</li>
            <li> I have noticed it has cleared up some of the dark spots, but others are still visible</li>
            <li> I still have dark spots, none of that improved</li>
            <li> However, my only complaint is the shipping method this reseller decided to use.</li>
            <li> I have dark marks from picking at hair.</li>
            <li> I also have dark scars from them.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> While expensive, I find that I don&#x27;t use that much (</li>
            <li> It does sooth the skin, but for the price it is definetly not worth it.</li>
            <li> so I cut back to just using it after I shave and the results changed to not effective at all.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to remove bumps on your face, as well as dark spots &amp; ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> and it has always kept the irritation down as well as reduced the bumps.</li>
            <li> I can go 3 days without shaving or trimming down there now and its not noticeable.</li>
            <li> in another post i gave thumbs down to tendskin</li>
            <li> I decided to try a different product (fyi - Tend Skin) and seriously - no more ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only slightly (but barely) negative thing I would say...is that for me, it has not removed the scars from previous ingrowns.</li>
            <li> I have used TendSkin in the past but it burns and leaves my skin really dry, With the wedding coming up and the itching driving me nuts</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m just trying to figure out how I can get rid of my half used bottles of Prince Reigns...</li>
            <li> Which of course means I&#x27;m switching because of the slight cost difference.  </li>
            <li> but this has a lot less of the drawbacks that tend skin has.</li>
            <li> After using Princereigns for 1 week half of my bumps were gone and in 2 weeks it all cleared up</li>
            <li> I shave less and the bumps and whatnot were gone after 4 days.</li>
            <li> i would like to see this product in a roller bottle none the less as another method of applying the gel.</li>
            <li> In reading the few negative reviews I wonder if people didn&#x27;t give the product enough time?  </li>
            <li> After a couple weeks of steady use I failed to see an improvement on a chronic ingrown hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also started using an exfoliating brush, one that is very stiff and you use when dry.</li>
            <li> but I spent a lot on this small bottle and it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this stuff goes along way.</li>
            <li> I think it has helped a little bit with ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product and have seen little to no improvement.</li>
            <li> I bought this product not expecting a miracle, but atleast a little change.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit of this stuff and the hairs unwind &amp; come to the surface.  </li>
            <li> I prefer PFB Vanish, maybe because it&#x27;s a little harsher.</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> and I became a little bit panicked.</li>
            <li> it was like the little pores in my face were closing.</li>
            <li> When I got them I realized that the cap was a little lose but thought it was cause of shipping &amp; thought nothing of it.</li>
            <li> Very, very disappointed, it should at least smell good for the price I payed</li>
            <li> This product is the same as all the other less expensive products that claim to be a miracle cure.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid my ingrown hairs haven&#x27;t improved much at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday though.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it everyday</li>
            <li> is just a few days away.</li>
            <li> Also, I find that only 1 thin layer massaged in</li>
            <li> I had to pour it out which made for messy application.</li>
            <li> But they are not as harsh as they were before using the product.</li>
            <li> It also hasn&#x27;t helped to fade the dark spots from past ingrown hairs (which others had mentioned).  </li>
            <li> what you put on your skin, then this review is not relevant for you.  </li>
            <li> I basicallyy wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This made it VERY inconvenient because I had to make a special trip to the post office to SIGN and pickup this package.</li>
            <li> Even with occasional use I&#x27;ve seen a dramatic reduction in ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Years have past and the bumps came back to make matters worse, I was invited to a wedding</li>
            <li> for starts the little bottle is small and lasted me about 6-7 weeks.</li>
            <li> The dark spots I do have are slowly disappearing, takes time though.</li>
            <li> $25 total is sooo worth it to get rid of those horrible bumps!  </li>
            <li> TendSkin makes my skin look crazy; it peels and turns an ashy grey, and it is so dry that it&#x27;s brittle to the touch.</li>
            <li> but there has been very little change.</li>
            <li> I was wary about trying another product that would supposedly solve my ingrown hair problems especially with the cost and the seemingly small amount you get.     </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure if that is a pro or a con</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s just me, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything over the counter even some old fashioned home remedies and they were all sadly disappointing.     </li>
            <li> I purchased it to use based on the past reviews after purchasing a depilatory device.  </li>
            <li> No more bumps, no more razor burns and no more ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> while it is a small bottle because it is a gel</li>
            <li> I have tried every shaving technique and have had no luck in the past.</li>
            <li> You do have to be patient and apply it as directed for at least a few days, but it did work.</li>
            <li> I tend to use it parsimoniously only on really difficult spots.</li>
            <li> Product did not seem to work as I had expected and felt that it was expensive for the little amount of product I received.</li>
            <li> I found that hard to believe since some would end up on the inside of my thigh where there is no hair.</li>
            <li> It seemed like once I hit my late 30s,  </li>
            <li> well lets just say it not nice to the touch.  </li>
            <li> It did take away some of the redness but the bumps it left were so awful that it took about 10 day for them to clear up.</li>
            <li> the plans are to keep using the product at least another 2 months.</li>
            <li> At least for me it does.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to curl and hide under my skin, plus it&#x27;s usually thick hair.</li>
            <li> and although I still get a few, this product has exponentially decreased them.  </li>
            <li> slowly</li>
            <li> and i mean slowly one ingrown here</li>
            <li> It was a disappointment and a waste of money, totally not worth $20-$35.</li>
            <li> I was also disappointed with their \\&quot;all natural ingredients\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> However, the peels are very expensive, and I&#x27;ve noticed only a very small improvement.</li>
            <li> Works as stated and all though it is a tad on the expensive side it works and works well, no burning or stinging at all and helped get rid of my dark spots too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it if you don&#x27;t want nasty ingrown hairs or razor bumps to show!</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s so expensive, I don&#x27;t want to waste it</li>
            <li> what a waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s really not that bad.</li>
            <li> I have been tired of shaving my legs and having problems with ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> thick, sticky and useless.</li>
            <li> but if you have serious ingrown hair issues like me then save your money!</li>
            <li> I noticed a dramatic improvement.</li>
            <li> I waxed my bikini area and got several very bad ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not perfect.</li>
            <li> Waaaaay to expensive though.</li>
            <li> Weird, but doesn&#x27;t affect the effectiveness of the prodcut.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Sorry Dermatologist their is a cure.  </li>
            <li> dont get me wrong</li>
            <li> Or, alternatively, it&#x27;s too expensive.</li>
            <li> As a woman, application is a bit silly, tho.  </li>
            <li> and it had made me feel insecure in a way</li>
            <li> I thought \\&quot;can&#x27;t go wrong, I&#x27;ll try it</li>
            <li> but it was expensive.    </li>
            <li> I still have some random outbreaks...</li>
            <li> Angry with my self for purchasing this products and waistline my money.</li>
            <li> Sadly this did not get rid of razor bumps for me, it stings, and clogged a pour that ended up requiring a doctor&#x27;s care.</li>
            <li> that it something this expensive would help some</li>
            <li> cause the product might be fake.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive here on amazon</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no odor, and very thin when applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m horrible at routines, and I bareley do it everyday.</li>
            <li> (I was desperate) but as you all know they are all garbage.</li>
            <li> Even so I&#x27;ve been way too much of a chicken to wax or sugar.</li>
            <li> As everyone out there that suffers from ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>
            <li> you will not be sorry!</li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> i was very skeptical but decided to try it anyway.</li>
            <li> I started getting all kinds of painful bumps or \\&quot;boils\\&quot; in my groin area.  </li>
            <li> This gave me really bad, painful cyst-like bumps.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I&#x27;m fairly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bought this stuff to try to help with ingrown hairs and it made them worse for me!!!</li>
            <li> I have problems after shaving my legs with stupid ingrown hairs.  </li>

            <li> I had tried Tend Skin (horrible) and It just burns the hell out of my skin.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It seemed like once I hit my late 30s,  I started getting all kinds of painful bumps or \\&quot;boils\\&quot; in my groin area.  My OBGYN said it was ingrown hairs....I found that hard to believe since some would end up on the inside of my thigh where there is no hair. I started researching and came across Princereigns and decided to give it a try.  It took about 2 weeks for me...but I noticed I wasnt getting those bumps anymore.  I figured maybe I was just having a \\&quot;dry spell\\&quot; but kept using it.  Its been about 2 years now that I have been using it and I very rarely get any bumps or boils at all.   I used it once a day for the 1st year or so, now I used it every 3 or 4 days.  One time I stopped for about 2 weeks, and those bumps started coming back.  2 of my friends at work started talking about having the same problems I did and I told them to try this and they did, and are amazed.  Its been about 1 month and neither 1 of them has gotten any at all.  I say if you have problems like this, try it...just one bottle.  If you dont notice any difference at all, then dont buy it again but to me,   $25 total is sooo worth it to get rid of those horrible bumps!  And now it lasts me several months since I dont use it as much, so $25 every 3 months or so is not bad for the relief!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months now.. It works ok for the most part. I have noticed that I am not getting as many ingrown hairs as I used to and when I do get them they seem to be easier to get rid of which is always a plus! I have noticed it has cleared up some of the dark spots, but others are still visible they just seem to be a lighter shade. it&#x27;s not perfect. I still get ingrown hairs and the dark spots definitely take some time to go away or fade away would be the correct phrase.</li>
            <li> I got this to help with razor bumps and ingrown hair around my bikini line.  Red bumps are so embarassing during swim suit season.  I apply this to the area after I shave and no more red bumps or ingrown hairs.  My husband is African American and I recommended he use it on his face after shaving.  He just started using it and it works great for him too!  A little goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve had this bottle for over a year and still have a lot left.  I don&#x27;t use it everyday though.  But now that my husband is using it, I may have to buy more.  I also like that the scent is not too powerful, it is light.  If you have problems with razor bumps or ingrown hairs, this is the product to get.</li>
            <li> I wish I had scanned all of the reviews prior to purchasing and seen the one where the ingredients are listed. Neither the amazon.com listing nor the product website provides a full list of ingredients, which should have been a red flag but I took a chance because the price compared favorably to my usual choice, the ingrown hair serum sold by European Wax Center which actually comes in a nearly identical bottle. However, this product unfortunately contains parabens, and it seems disingenuous to advertise it as \\&quot;natural.\\&quot; While there is still question around just how dangerous parabens are, there are enough other endocrine disrupters I&#x27;m potentially exposed to every day that I don&#x27;t need to voluntarily add another one, especially when I have alternatives readily available.</li>
            <li> I picked up this product at a store that I work at and was pretty excited to try something that might actually work.  See, I have razor and ingrown hairs all over my legs and being a girl.... well lets just say it not nice to the touch.  I&#x27;ve just used up my first bottle.  I still have dark spots, none of that improved (perhaps it would work better on the face?).  It helped my ingrown hairs some, however I still had a significant amount. I&#x27;ve so far tried everything from AHA to glycolic on my legs after I&#x27;ve shaved and so far no luck. I&#x27;ve just ordered tend skin... so I have my fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months now.  I get very bad ingrown hairs and need something to help me control them.  This product smells nice, goes on easily, and when applied 2-3 times a day, it did help the bumps go down.  But when I run out of this, I will definitely be going back to Tend Skin.  For the price, Tend Skin is much more effective and lasts a lot longer.  This just simply isn&#x27;t strong enough to completely get rid of the ingrown hairs and razor bumps.</li>
            <li> At first when I bought this product I thought that it wouldn&#x27;t work, another over expensive thing. I have had ingrown hairs for years, anytime I shave or do anything to remove the hair, and it&#x27;s not just a couple its many, tons of them. I recently bought tend skin and that only helped a little bit!    This product Princereigns worked exactly as described! I shaved then applied the gel to my legs, and not one ingrown hair!! The dark spots I do have are slowly disappearing, takes time though. This product works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I like this product. It&#x27;s more effective then Tend Skin and you don&#x27;t need cotton rounds to apply it. I use epilator (a device that pulls hair out at root level) on my underarms, legs and bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;This product came in handy. I&#x27;ve never had an ingrown hair ever since.</li>
            <li> It dries out the problem in no time! A little bit of this stuff goes along way. It works likes a charm.</li>
            <li> After having read all of the fantastic reviews on this product I decided to try it after having tried a few other products specifically aimed at combating ingrown hairs (including Tend Skin which I found pretty useless). I&#x27;ve now used all of my bottle of &#x27;Princereigns&#x27; and I&#x27;m afraid my ingrown hairs haven&#x27;t improved much at all. It&#x27;s a nice product to apply just after shaving as it soothes the area but if you have serious ingrown hair issues like me then save your money!</li>
            <li> this works ok, but doesn&#x27;t do all it promises, tend skin works way better but stings, whereas princereigns does not sting. in general, this product is no where near 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Obviously, this product works for some people - but it definitely didn&#x27;t work for me!  I bought it at the spa where I get my Brazilians - it was highly recommended, so I had high hope for it...plus, for the price I figured it must work. Wrong!  It did nothing for my ingrowns...in fact, I kind of think it may have made them worse.  I thought I would have to stop getting waxed they were getting so bad! I decided to try a different product (fyi - Tend Skin) and seriously - no more ingrown hairs! I don&#x27;t know if this is a testament to what a great product Tend Skin is or what a crap product Prince Reigns is, but either way I will never go back.  Now I&#x27;m just trying to figure out how I can get rid of my half used bottles of Prince Reigns...</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL PRODUCT!! I have struggled for years with ingrown facial hair (especially on my neck). I have used dozens of products over the years and I find Princereigns to be the best to help control and eliminate ingrown facial hair on my neck. I have used this product for about 2 years and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product!!    However, my only complaint is the shipping method this reseller decided to use. They shipped the package to me via USPS with SIGNATURE REQUIRED. This made it VERY inconvenient because I had to make a special trip to the post office to SIGN and pickup this package. I will not use this particular reseller again since it is not convenient to make a special trip to the USPS office to sign and pickup the package.</li>
            <li> I really adore this product, I use it all the time. I really gets rid of the red bumps on my legs that I get from shaving and also just from dry skin. I most often see results the next day, and sometimes after two days of use. I also love that you don&#x27;t have to use it all the time, only when you need it! This product also helps to soothe and heal ingrown hairs, so I find it really useful when I get my legs waxed.       Some people have said in other reviews that the product is a little bit sticky after use, but that only lasts for a minute or so...If it&#x27;s more than that you&#x27;re probably using too much. That&#x27;s another great thing about this product; you don&#x27;t need to use a lot to see results.     I definitely recommend this product to people looking to get rid of red bumps or ingrown hairs. For me, it even moisturizes my skin, and softens it. Five stars!</li>
            <li> This product was okay.  Didn&#x27;t notice much difference when hubby used this.  His skin responds much better to Billy Jealousy Hydroplane and Shaved Ice.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 2 months now and it really does reduce the bumps and irritation. I have shaved as well as use hair remover and it has always kept the irritation down as well as reduced the bumps. I used to have a lot of red bumps after shaving and I would put lotion on it and other things but it would never reduce or make the bumps go away. I tried this product and after using it the bumps went away and stays away. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading all the awesome reviews on Amazon. Although I think it&#x27;s good, its not great. I realize everyone has different skin types and that&#x27;s probably it wasn&#x27;t so great for me. I&#x27;m just waiting to finish it so I can buy something else.</li>
            <li> I was wary about trying another product that would supposedly solve my ingrown hair problems especially with the cost and the seemingly small amount you get.     I use an epilator so I really needed something that would help with my ingrown hairs, I was surprised that after 2 days of usage I noticed a difference. It seems to help make deep ingrown hairs visible but it does a better job at preventing and making your skin feel a bit softer. I already got rid of a couple of ingrown hairs that had been hanging out under my skin for a couple of weeks which made me really happy.     I would recommend this product because even though you don&#x27;t seem to get a lot it&#x27;s worth not having to deal with ingrown hairs and if you only use it once a day it seems just as good. Also it doesn&#x27;t really smell.     Cons: It takes a couple of seconds to dry after application but that&#x27;s really not that bad.</li>
            <li> Ive been try all the after shaves i could get my hands on to try and remove razor bumps and none of them work including this one. This one works the best out of all that ive tried but it doesnt remove all the razor bumps and the redness comes back after 4 hours. I had high hopes seeing as there are so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions religiously and experienced no changes/ improvements. It did not work for me whatsoever. What a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with the bikini area. I have tried every diffrent way to remove the hair but always had bumps and ingrown hairs. I tried Tend Skin first and that did help some, but nothing like Princereigns. This stuff cleared everything up. I still get some ingrown hairs but nothing like before. When I do get an ingrown hair the gel seems to clear the skin up quickly. For the first time in my life I have a smooth, clear, bikini line. I would definately suggest trying this product.</li>
            <li> I think it has helped a little bit with ingrown hairs. I haven&#x27;t been using it everyday so I can&#x27;t really say, but there is an improvement</li>
            <li> This product claims to get rid of ingrown hair and razor bumps. I&#x27;ve been using this product and have seen little to no improvement. I had my hopes set really high based on the previous reviews. So I spent the $ to buy it. I&#x27;d have better results out of beauty supply products. I have dark marks from picking at hair. it doesnt lighten those like it says either. I&#x27;m a African American female is your wondering.</li>
            <li> This gave me really bad, painful cyst-like bumps. I stopped and started using it again 3 times before I was sure it was the product. I was also disappointed with their \\&quot;all natural ingredients\\&quot;. Also, did not see much improvement otherwise. It did take away some of the redness but the bumps it left were so awful that it took about 10 day for them to clear up. I do not have what I would consider sensitive skin either.</li>
            <li> It is pricey but hell I woulda paid double cause it cleared up my face in 4 days and I cant tell you how much of a pain ingrowns were to my skin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;GOOD STUUFF</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what to say,... The items its not working to remove ingrown hair compared to  its price .... But yes its really soothing ..and helps to reduce Razor Bumps so quickly ....</li>
            <li> The product didn&#x27;t exactly work for me. My ingrowns are still the same, even if I do exfoliate and apply twice a day. Maybe it works differently for everyone. However, I was glad that it sort of lightened the dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have been having ingrown hairs around my bikini area and upper thighs for about 5 years now. I also have dark scars from them. I have been using this product for about 2 months now and havent seen any ingrown since I started. I am also starting to see the scars fade away.  First review I have written because I was just so happy that it was the first product that has actually worked on the ingrown hairs as well as the scars! Great product! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks of steady use I failed to see an improvement on a chronic ingrown hair.  Maybe is works for those lil annoyances that go away on their own anyway but it was not a help for me.</li>
            <li> It really helps the ingrowns grow out. A bump would come to the surface and then heal after just a week of use. It smells good, and feels good going on. Dries quickly. Waaaaay to expensive though. I used this for full leg bikini application and it only lasted about 3 weeks with daily use. The other thing is that it leaves a kind of film on your leg, which isn&#x27;t noticable when it&#x27;s dry, but when you shower, it gets kinda slimy. Weird, but doesn&#x27;t affect the effectiveness of the prodcut.</li>
            <li> The product is great and does the job, but you do have to use it regularly in order for it to be 100% effective.  The shipping cost seems to be higher than the actual cost of having it shipped, I noticed the tag on my package was less than $2, but I was charged around $4.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do much for me.  I still have bumps and ingrown hairs and the tiny bottle cost $25 and took forever to receive.  Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I had heard of this in LA before and its in all the goodie bags at these award ceremony&#x27;s but It was never available to us regular folk. I had tried Tend Skin (horrible) and It just burns the hell out of my skin. Princereigns worked miracles for me in 2-3 days. It removed all my ingrown hairs and bumps and I also had those little dark dots where hair is starting to grow and I didnt notice them anymore. I can go 3 days without shaving or trimming down there now and its not noticeable. WOW, living in LA I am ofetn in a bikini or top with sarong so it is key for me. I highly recommend this stuff for all the girls out there.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this gel for about four days and already I&#x27;m seeing results! My hair tends to curl and hide under my skin, plus it&#x27;s usually thick hair. I have had an ingrown hair for, I don&#x27;t even know how long - probably years, I always had a huge bump and I would try to dig out the hair with no luck. After two days of using this gel, all of the sudden, a long hair emerged from this bump in my skin and the bump finally went away! I recommend this to everyone ... I am buying more for my friends and family!</li>
            <li> Dries quickly, and has soothing aloe which is good especially if you have razor burn. Works pretty good I think. I put it on after my shower. A little goes a very long way. There&#x27;s no odor, and very thin when applied. Absorbs almost immediatley. It&#x27;s worth it if you don&#x27;t want nasty ingrown hairs or razor bumps to show!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve held back on reviewing this for a while because I wanted to make sure it worked over the long term.  As it turns out, it does-- to an extent.  I like the fact it is natural and doesn&#x27;t leave a burning sensation, but it does tingle (it might in fact burn if you have sensitive skin).  It works like it claims and teases out a lot of ingrown hairs, and tones down the red spots, but it does not entirely remove blemishes and dark spots from previous cases of ingrown hairs.  Since removing the hair depends on how fast your hair grows, it&#x27;s effectiveness as a \\&quot;remover\\&quot; can vary.  It&#x27;s helped me a lot, but it&#x27;s not a cure-all for ingrown hair and bumps.  While expensive, I find that I don&#x27;t use that much (but I don&#x27;t use it for legs), so one bottle will last me a long time.  The gel is surprisingly thick and spreads very well.  If you need something for a very large surface area, you might want to try something more economical.</li>
            <li> Really good stuff.  I just switched from TendSkin to this.  Not because TendSkin doesn&#x27;t work, because it does work very well, but because it seems this stuff lasts longer.  Which of course means I&#x27;m switching because of the slight cost difference.  But yeah, this stuff really works great!  I would think for starters one should use it twice a day, then after a week start using it only once a day and you&#x27;ll get great results.  I like how the bottle is designed as well, the bottom lifts so you don&#x27;t have to tilt it upsidedown when the bottle is almost gone to try and get that last bit out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Tend Skin and a bunch of others but I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and it really works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This does work, but you gotta be really consistant. I apply this after i use the epilator, and it does sooth the skin.. my primary purpose of buying this was to get rid of my ingrowns, it soothes the ingrown spots when its hurting, but I haven&#x27;t experienced anything the good reviews told me. I still get a lot of ingrowns, and it gets a little sticky right after you apply it, gotta wait a little before putting on clothes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African-american and my specific hair texture is prone to getting ingrowns around the bikini area. Let me tell you, I&#x27;ve gone to many-a-really high end spa in hopes of finding professionals who are more \\&quot;clean\\&quot; than your downtown nail shop. Turns out, I get ingrowns no matter where I go or how much I spend for my brazilians. Lucky for me, a new brazilian wax salon opened up near where I live. I tried them, it hurt like hell, but totally worth it. After a few visits, I got comfortable with my wax lady and I asked her what to do about ingrowns. She applied some of the soothing green Prince Reigns gel for me right then and there, and recommended that I purchase a bottle from the front. She also told me to apply to my bikini area three times a day to prevent ingrowns. I decided to give it a shot, because it felt great when she rubbed it in. It didn&#x27;t burn, AT ALL, even though my skin was screaming from being freshly waxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have NOT had an ingrown since. For real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I would also like to mention that I did not apply three times a day.  I&#x27;m horrible at routines, and I bareley do it everyday. I do it every other day-ish, and I have not had an ingrown since. I. LOVE. THIS. STUFF. It&#x27;s cool and soothing and goes on smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only slightly (but barely) negative thing I would say...is that for me, it has not removed the scars from previous ingrowns. I don&#x27;t mind this though, because like I said, I wont be getting ingrowns ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last caveat...I&#x27;ve tried TendSkin before.  TendSkin makes my skin look crazy; it peels and turns an ashy grey, and it is so dry that it&#x27;s brittle to the touch. GROSS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope this helps! I&#x27;ve never written a review before! :-) there&#x27;s no spell check?! lol</li>
            <li> This product actually does what it says it will do! I don&#x27;t care for the consistency of the product, but it&#x27;s worth it since it works very well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and the ingrown hair problem has decrease so far. I encorage you to try it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Now I finally have the look and feel of a celebrity.  The best product on earth period!  I&#x27;ve tried all ingrown hair product&#x27;s since 1985 beleive me Ive&#x27; spent thousand of dollars, nothing comes close to it \\&quot;forget about it\\&quot; Saliylic Acid is history in my book. Sorry Dermatologist their is a cure.  I bought 1 bottle before christmas 2006.  Since the new year 2007 started I&#x27;ve already bought 2 bottle&#x27;s and I&#x27;m spreading the word.  Don&#x27;t delay a smooth and perfect face is just a few days away. &lt;br /&gt;Thanks to all who have complimented my slick and smooth face. &lt;br /&gt;J. Diaz    Aka  (Papi rico)</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  Product in good condition.  Really works.  Loved the results.  My son was home for a visit from the Navy and thought it was so great, he took it with him to share with the other officers on his ship.</li>
            <li> Im a long time tend skin user and once I stopped using tend skin and started using this....I noticed a dramatic improvement. Tend skin works..dont get me wrong but it didnt suit my skin type it would dry me out all the time and cause me to have an itchy face. This stuff does not dry me out, has no unpleasant smell, and can be used on acne and it works very fast. This stuff easily replaced the tend skin in my opinion, remember they both work but this has a lot less of the drawbacks that tend skin has.</li>
            <li> This products works okay but you have to use it a couple of days before the hair appears. One thing it did do was stop the pain from the ingrown Hair.      Overall it is a good product but you have to use it continuously.</li>
            <li> i did not his this worked at all for ingrown hairs. It felt good after shaving, but did not do waht it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this product. It arrived before expected and works really well. I waxed my bikini area and got several very bad ingrown hairs. I&#x27;ve been using the serum for about a week and can see a significant difference. Some reviews say the product didn&#x27;t work as great as expected; I suggest they be more liberal with the application. I noticed results after 3 or 4 days of use, but when I applied more (2 pumps instead of 1) I saw even better results. The product is a little costly, but for small areas like face and bikini it will last a while. Definitely highly recommend. I&#x27;ve already told several friends about it. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the product and service.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this stuff and really had faith in it but, nope. I have been using it for a good month or 2 and there are barely any results. I&#x27;m not sure if i&#x27;m just convincing myself there are slight results or there really just aren&#x27;t any. It was a disappointment and a waste of money, totally not worth $20-$35. I also read some reviews of people saying it smelt good. It doesn&#x27;t even really have a noticeable smell i&#x27;m not sure if that is a pro or a con I guess that depends on the person. All in all I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone to get this unless it was like $10.</li>
            <li> I have been religiously using this product in the hopes that it would lesson the bumps and ingrown hairs I get on the back of my legs. It has not- waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> It may work for some people but I spent a lot on this small bottle and it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I paid good money for this based on a magazine&#x27;s recommendation.  it did NOTHING.  I could have saved a lot of money by just buying a regular drugstore aloe vera gel or something similar.  No relief from ingrown hairs either for my husband&#x27;s beard or my own eyebrow wax.</li>
            <li> The material and color are very well chosen for a serious and elegant presentation.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery time was good, adequate packaging to protect the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t get rid of all of my ingrown hairs but has definitely helped!i will definitely keep using this as it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like some other products do. it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li> I have seen much improvement in the bikini line area with the use of Princereigns Ingrown Hair Gel. I still have a few brown spots but am by far pleased with the results i have had. Thankyou.</li>
            <li> This stuff really is better than Tend Skin or other anti-ingrown gels. I do think it&#x27;s made a noticeable difference after one or two weeks. The problem is that there&#x27;s not enough in a bottle! Or, alternatively, it&#x27;s too expensive. But it&#x27;s nice stuff. Warning: does contain parabens.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after having suffered with chronic ingrown hairs on my bikini and stomach areas. I often had one or two on my stomach that would be there for months as a huge inflamed red thing that wouldn&#x27;t go away. I&#x27;d tried alternatives, like Bump patrol and bikinizone which didn&#x27;t work that well, and pfb vanish which worked slightly better. However, after applying this for a few weeks my chronic ingrowns disappeared (leaving an inch long hair coming out) and didn&#x27;t come back (or if i did get another big one, it only lasted for a few days). I&#x27;ve also started using an exfoliating brush, one that is very stiff and you use when dry. That, combined with princereigns has gotten my skin back close to normal. My life has literally changed with it. I&#x27;d recommend using it with the brush, and being consistent. Good luck!</li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully! After just a couple of applications, I was completely clear of problems. I use it now just once a week for prevention.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have ingrown hairs on my bikini line and have suffered from them from many years. I bought this product not expecting a miracle, but atleast a little change. I am almost done with the bottle and i see NO change or difference at all. It does sooth the skin, but for the price it is definetly not worth it. Save your money and do not buy this product or be fooled by these positive ratings. Dont say you werent warned.</li>
            <li> I read several upon several reviews regarding the effectiveness of using Princereigns Ingrown Hair Gel and I have to say I&#x27;m fairly disappointed. Now maybe it&#x27;s just me because I come from a German-Italian background and have rich thick black hair and fair skin, but it really didn&#x27;t do much of anything to stop ingrowns. When I first used it there was a slight improvement (I used it every day). It smells nice and feels good on the skin, but I thought maybe my skin needs to breath so I cut back to just using it after I shave and the results changed to not effective at all. For something that costs so much and has had so many great reviews I was expecting a lot more than it making ingrown spots a little less noticeable and feel slightly better.</li>
            <li> It is an effective product to throw $ 30 in the trash</li>
            <li> Been great will definitely keep product on hand in growns have really disappeared after just a few uses of product</li>
            <li> I am probably the last one of all of you to find out about this product, but I&#x27;m blown away by the results I&#x27;ve seen. I had never heard about it until I just sort of stumbled upon it about 3 weeks ago. I had some ingrown hairs in my eyebrow area, &amp; needed something to help this. I had heard about \\&quot;Tend Skin,\\&quot; &amp; went online &amp; read about it. I had fully intended to buy this. However, I was browsing the internet, &amp; typed in \\&quot;ingrown hairs,\\&quot; and the Princereigns info was brought up. I was intrigued about this product being in several magazines like \\&quot;In Style,\\&quot; etc., &amp; the fact that there was info that Angelina Jolie uses this. I think that her complexion is gorgeous. I then went to several of the beauty boards to read reviews, but couldn&#x27;t find any. I then went to Amazon.com, &amp; read testimonials that convinced me to give it a try. It is supposed to remove bumps on your face, as well as dark spots &amp; ingrown hairs. I began to notice a difference in my complexion the second day, which is hard to believe, even for me. Some of the bumps that had been there for years were just gone, and my skin looked so clear. One bump just went away, leaving a long hair that had been clogged in it. I&#x27;ve had so many problems with my skin the last few years that I&#x27;ve been going to a spa and having lactic acid peels and facials. However, the peels are very expensive, and I&#x27;ve noticed only a very small improvement. I&#x27;ve used this product now for about 3 weeks, and have already ordered three more bottles. I am sort of rationing it until my new bottles come in. I don&#x27;t want to be without this gel ever. The lady that does my peels and facials is going to be disappointed that I don&#x27;t have to come back, but my complexion has not looked this good in years. In fact, I don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;ll  have to even wear foundation pretty soon. I&#x27;m truly amazed at this product. It doesn&#x27;t burn, sting, or have a strong smell, etc., and is made from aloe and natural fruit ingredients. When I am just around the house, I don&#x27;t wear makeup, and have used this product about 3 times a day, rather than the 2 times recommended. Also, I find that only 1 thin layer massaged in well is enough for 1 application. I wash my face, and then let it dry. Then I apply the Princereigns, and let it dry before I put my foundation, which goes on smoothly over this. When I wash my face with cleanser, I use a warm wash cloth, and very gently massage it over my face. I can see big knots of white, like an imbedded blackhead roll out. Like I say, I&#x27;m blown away by this product, and just had to rave!</li>
            <li> I used to get ingrown hairs after I shaved and although I still get a few, this product has exponentially decreased them.  It is a little more money than other products but it actually does work!  I use it every time I get out of the shower, even when I do not shave. Give it a shot, I truely am a happy customer and am about to reorder another bottle.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, so I get ingrowns everywhere.  Just a little bit of this stuff and the hairs unwind &amp; come to the surface.  I love it.  As a woman, application is a bit silly, tho.  Because it&#x27;s so expensive, I don&#x27;t want to waste it so I end up dabbing a bit on each individual ingrown which takes forever.  Men using this for ingrowns probably won&#x27;t have that problem.  This is slightly scented, but it&#x27;s a clean smell, not flowery or masculine, so anyone can use it.</li>
            <li> I used this product every time I shaved for two months. Barely any improvement. Not sure if it&#x27;s just me, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again. I prefer PFB Vanish, maybe because it&#x27;s a little harsher. I used it for one week and it was worked much better. Less red bumps and hair that comes in is sticking out straighter so it&#x27;s easier to shave/pluck.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. I have had razor bumps since I was 16 and it had made me feel insecure in a way cause I had always thought that I wasnt ever at my 100% because of it. After using Princereigns for 1 week half of my bumps were gone and in 2 weeks it all cleared up and I started to feel great about myself and more confident it is remarkable. I just had to share this info because I know theres alot of guys out there that feel like me. Oh and P.S. I also tried all the other BS out there like \\&quot;Tend Skin\\&quot; aka liquid Fire and Magic Shave, Min roller and even Nads (I was desperate) but as you all know they are all garbage.</li>
            <li> Works as stated and all though it is a tad on the expensive side it works and works well, no burning or stinging at all and helped get rid of my dark spots too. All and all a good product</li>
            <li> A staple in our house - husband uses this for his ingrown hairs from shaving.</li>
            <li> 10 years ago, I started to wax my bikini area and always used Tend Skin to prevent ingrowns. I never had to worry about ingrowns. Three months ago, as I was looking for good deals for Tend Skin, I came across Princereigns on Amazon and read all the positive reviews. Most people seemed to have a positive outcome, plus it was gentle and had pleasant smell. I thought \\&quot;can&#x27;t go wrong, I&#x27;ll try it out.\\&quot; I was never unhappy with Tend Skin but it did dry out my skin so I was open to trying something new and Princereigns seemed promising. Girl, was I wrong!!!  I didn&#x27;t know how great Tend Skin was in preventing ingrowns until I stopped using it and started to use Princereigns. I gave Princereigns three months to redeem itself...that was too long!!! I was way too optimistic. Currently, I have so many bumps and ingrowns, it&#x27;s too embarrassing to wear a bikini bottom! I have never had so many ingrown hair in my life. I just received Tend Skin in the mail, and hopefully, it&#x27;ll help my waxed area clear up before I take my vacation in 3 weeks. I&#x27;ll be sure to use extra moisturizing lotion when I use Tend Skin. I&#x27;m never going to use Princereigns - I wish there was a money back guarantee. Even my husband who uses Tend Skin on his face got more ingrowns while using Princereigns. I wonder if you&#x27;re better off not using anything at all than to use Princereigns(to save money!)</li>
            <li> It works, but not for all of them. I don&#x27;t use it as much as it says I should, though.. so I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s the only reason why. Even with occasional use I&#x27;ve seen a dramatic reduction in ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I recommend Princereigns for women. It worked within a week, healing my bumps and blisters from shaving - without drying my skin. The hair grew back straight rather than curling. I had used Bump Patrol, which is about one third the price, but it dried my skin, causing peeling and took weeks to notice any difference. Tend Skin didn&#x27;t work at all for me, Bikini Zone was a joke and complete waste of my money. Princereigns costs a bundle but it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I brought this product and to be honest it did nothing it says!...I actually went out and brought a cheaper product that did work for me. Not only that I tried getting my money back from the company. And someone (I guess CSR) was very nasty told me I had to send back what ever I had to get my money back and when I was still asking questions they hung up the phone before I could finish...I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to a dog! I don&#x27;t even want to give a rating they don&#x27;t even deserve a star at all!</li>
            <li> This product is just Amazing!! I have suffered for many many years from ingrown hairs (ever since I started shaving). I have tried everything over the counter even some old fashioned home remedies and they were all sadly disappointing.     Princereigns has changed my life forever. The results are fantastic!! I am proud to say \\&quot;I can&#x27;t wait to go to the beach this summer!\\&quot;  I love this product. A little pricey but I don&#x27;t care it is so worth it.      I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product really works!  I purchased it to use based on the past reviews after purchasing a depilatory device.  I have been tired of shaving my legs and having problems with ingrown hairs.  I decided to give this product a try and have been amazed at how well it has worked.  I find that the hair on my legs comes in straighter rather than under the skin and the pores on my legs appear smaller and overall my legs are always smoother and the skin looks better when I use this product.  I left it at a vacation home of mine and found that when I stopped using it the problem ingrown hairs were back.  This is a miracle product!  Thank you, thank you!</li>
            <li> I have HORRIBLE skin that can&#x27;t \\&quot;push things through\\&quot; on it&#x27;s own, including acne, scars easily, and I have even more stubborn hair. It&#x27;s wirey and strong. This gel has saved me. Beats out the roll-on stuff I would buy at my wax salon 10-fold. Most stuff has alcohol in it which stings and seems inefficient/abrasive. I thought without alcohol it would just be sticky and clog more pores, but it actually goes on so smooth and really soothes. My underarms NEVER have ingrowns anymore, and my brazilian area has only a quarter of what it did. That may not be techincally perfect-- but it is just about that for me, someone suffering for so long. Just bought my 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> Product was missing the tube inside to allow it to pump out properly. I had to pour it out which made for messy application. Product did not seem to work as I had expected and felt that it was expensive for the little amount of product I received.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say. You read the reviews for these kinds of products and some say they work and other say its a complete waste of money. The answer for me was the later, it did absolute nothing to help my ingrown hair issue when shaving with a safety razor. I&#x27;m not going to say it won&#x27;t work for you but when I shave and apply this serum the hair follicles still embedded under my skin giving me pimples/bumps which require me to pull the hair underneath the skin out with tweezers. I&#x27;ve tried at least 10 other products and the same thing. My final decision is the use a electric beard trimmer which doesn&#x27;t shave done to the skin and this has resolved my issue with ingrown hairs. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I was skeptic at first thinking I would waste money buying this shaving gel, but it actually work.  I no longer have ingrown hairs that create bumps.  At bit of advice.... After you shave don&#x27;t apply it right away, wait 5-10 minutes before apply to ensure that no bumps will arrive because they area could be sensitive after shaving.</li>
            <li> thick, sticky and useless. I used this product exactly how i should and it did nothing to improve the situation. DO NOT GET IT!</li>
            <li> There seemed to be alot of hype around this product so I decided to try it.  I have problems after shaving my legs with stupid ingrown hairs.  I honestly can&#x27;t say that I love it - it wasn&#x27;t the total answer I had hoped for - but it certainly has helped. I suspect that it could work better on some than others just by the nature of the product.</li>
            <li> My entire shaving life I&#x27;ve dealt with razor burns, ingrown hairs, and bumps. Even so I&#x27;ve been way too much of a chicken to wax or sugar. Up until this product I pretty much avoided tanks and swim suits, which is fine for the area I live in. But I found myself having to move to sunny southern California and I became a little bit panicked. My sister had used this product before and referred it to me. By this time I&#x27;d used my fair share of serums, natural and chemical. None really worked, but Princereigns...wow. WOW!!! No more bumps, no more razor burns and no more ingrown hair. The level of excitement I have at the results is almost ridiculous really, but I&#x27;ve NEVER been confident wearing a tank or swimsuit and now I am! So happy! I&#x27;ll be using this stuff forever and recommending it to everyone I know.    The bottle says to apply twice a day, but I&#x27;m so forgetful I only do it once a day but it still fixed my problems! I shave less and the bumps and whatnot were gone after 4 days. FOUR DAYS! Try this stuff, it&#x27;s not expensive so give it a shot!</li>
            <li> My husband loves it ...keeps his face smooth &amp; free if razor bumps &amp; ingrown hairs...when he runs out he pesters me to but him more...it works great</li>
            <li> when you have severe ingrown hair problems at least for me my goal is to be open and try most everything. in another post i gave thumbs down to tendskin but i gave it four stars because i could see some results but tendskin burned my skin very badly. maybe it will work for you though. after reading hundreds of posts on various products i chose princereigns because many people were getting results and it didn&#x27;t denote many \\&quot;burns like hell comments\\&quot;. while i applauded previous posts for warning away from this product because it was not 100% natural as stated, costly or plain didn&#x27;t perform, when you have severe/painful ingrown hairs, again you try most anything once. for starts the little bottle is small and lasted me about 6-7 weeks. while it is a small bottle because it is a gel i never wasted a drop rubbing it in - big plus. i would like to see this product in a roller bottle none the less as another method of applying the gel. while somewhat costly my goal was to find the lowest price and free shipping. ordered my 2nd bottle and both times were shipped/recv&#x27;d quickly - under 5 days and shipping was free - that was reasonable. total price w/shipping $20.00 - reasonable. my plan of attack was first to see if my face would tolerate the product or the burn test. no problem with burning and princereigns did a rather good job of soothingly - big plus. even directly after shaving and liberalling rubbing it in good i had no problems at all with burn - this is very good. i used it twice a day in the morning right after shaving and at night before bed. the first week i noticed my skin smoothing a bit. it was like the little pores in my face were closing. would i have liked my skin to be like my 8yr old son&#x27;s skin, yes but realistically my face appeared to get smoother certaining better that it was before a few weeks of this application. i used the product faithfully and liberally over all my shaved areas which is about 3 squirts X 2times daily X 7days a week. is more better, i don&#x27;t know. slowly and i mean slowly one ingrown here and one ingrown there would either disappear or become smaller. after 4weeks about 20% ingrown hairs were gone. miracle no but will i take those results anytime. during the 4-5week, i still plucked a few really deep stubborn ingrown hairs.  with about 1-2 weeks left of the first bottle i am convinced and satisfied it worked. my wife and some friends made a point of saying my skin looked clearer/smoother after a month of usage. ordered 2nd bottle and the plans are to keep using the product at least another 2 months. i figure about 3months should be a good gauge as to where i&#x27;d like my face to be. i do agree with some posts that it does a somewhat decent job of evening out ones skin tone. the smell was absolutley acceptable and not so overwhelming that it would wash out ones cologne or parfume. of course i am still researching other products (like anthony&#x27;s logistics,min ny solutions2) and will keep you posted after 3 months (12/31/2009)of princereigns. so yes, i would say give it a try and see if it works for you. for now i would say so far so good - this product is better than most.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with bumps caused by ingrown hairs from my late teens to my early thirties.  I went to a dermatologist years ago and got a shot in my scalp and took some ointments that helped for a long time but it was expensive.    Years have past and the bumps came back to make matters worse, I was invited to a wedding and I always shave my head and the bumps are here again in all their pain full glory.  Any one who has had these kind of bumps on the back of their scalps and their faces can tell you how pain full and how much these bumps itch.      I have used TendSkin in the past but it burns and leaves my skin really dry, With the wedding coming up and the itching driving me nuts, I jumped on amazon.com and eureka I found the wonder gel and here comes the great part I have only used it for two days now and the itching has stopped and the bumps are shrinking, I recommend this product to any one who wants to get rid of the bumps caused by ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I know I gave this product 4 stars and then I say that it is iffy if I would repurchase this item...contradictory??? Allow me to explain, I give it the 4 stars because it is awesome if my legs are really itchy from all the hair trying to regrow, but I don&#x27;t feel that it prevents the ingrowns, maybe it helps to soften the skin to allow the hair to break through, but I find I achieve maxium results by exfoliating and then using the product. After I&#x27;m done with it I am going to try only exfoliating and see how I fare...more to come! ALSO, another reason why I liked it, it really helps reduce the redness from epilating!</li>
            <li> I found this item almost by accident, but am so glad I did!  I&#x27;ve only applied this product when I&#x27;ve seen an \\&quot;issue\\&quot; arise &amp; it has solved the problem each time.  This will definitely be part of my beauty routine from now on!</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me.  Maybe it works better for other people.  But, it did leave my skin feeling very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Wow! This is the ONLY product on the market (and I have tried SO many) that works to get rid of in-grown hairs.  If you have an ingrown hair, use this for a couple of days to coax it out.  If you have rashes from shaving or bumps from shaving - must have item!  Use this in any area that you shave to ensure smooth, bump-free skin.</li>
            <li> I epilate and razor bumps and ingrown hairs in the bikini issue are an issue for me. I having been using this product twice daily for about 3 weeks now. I think this product has definitely helped bring ingrown hairs to the surface where they become tweezable. Based on the glowing reviews, I was hoping the bumps would reduce more, but do think this product is helping. It is the best I have found to date and will keep using it but I will continue to try other products.</li>
            <li> I had ingrown hairs (from epilation) and tried this product.  I decided to put it on one leg only, to see if I could notice a difference.  I applied it once or twice a day for about 2 weeks without noticing any difference between the treated leg and the untreated one.  There was some minor improvement, but I concluded that it was due to the body&#x27;s natural healing process, as the same amount of healing was visible in the leg where no solution was used.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It helps my neck stay clear and prevents ingrown hair.  I still have some random outbreaks...but I feel this product does it job.  The seller is awesome too!  Way cheaper than buying directly from the supplier and ships really fast!  I highly recommend both the product and seller.</li>
            <li> Worked pretty well, I definitely saw results in about a month. I gave it three stars because of the price and amount of product you get. But overall good quality product!</li>
            <li> This product worked wonders for me!  My skin is clear and free of painful bumps.  In reading the few negative reviews I wonder if people didn&#x27;t give the product enough time?  Nothing is going to work overnight. While I did see immediate improvement within the first few days, it was closer to 2 weeks that I&#x27;d be comfortable saying my skin was completely cured.  Try this product...you will not be sorry!</li>
            <li> they double charged me and sent one bottle... and I do not see a difference after using it.  I will just use aloe.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell a difference using it.  I finally decided to take the plunge and got my neck lazered.  My only regret is I didn&#x27;t do it earlier on!</li>
            <li> this product did work,just not as fast  as promised. Did not completly erase the bumps and dark spots as good as I would of liked. It was the best product that I have found so far for the problem. Still looking for a better cure to the damage of in grown hairs and bumbs</li>
            <li> This product does not work. It looks pretty that&#x27;s about the only thing good about it. Very, very disappointed, it should at least smell good for the price I payed but it doesn&#x27;t do that. Angry with my self for purchasing this products and waistline my money.</li>
            <li> As an African American female it is very hard for me to get rid of ingrown hairs around my private area. This product does well but it doesnt totally get rid of them. But they are not as harsh as they were before using the product. But overall I liked the product and it was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the success reported by other reviewers. Sadly this did not get rid of razor bumps for me, it stings, and clogged a pour that ended up requiring a doctor&#x27;s care. Best of luck to other purchasers, but I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the good reviews, I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with this product.  I don&#x27;t think it is necessarily any better than any of the other ingrown hair products I&#x27;ve tried (eg. Bump Patrol) and its more expensive.  It is soothing to the skin (no burning) and has a nice scent, which is nice compared to other products but I don&#x27;t think it warrants the increased cost.  It also hasn&#x27;t helped to fade the dark spots from past ingrown hairs (which others had mentioned).  I think I would recommend sticking with one of the cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very nice.  It won&#x27;t work miracles, but if you&#x27;re taking good care of your skin already, this will do a great job topping that off.  I get fewer ingrown hairs and razor issues than before, but I still get one every once and again.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes based on other reviews.  But it has not made my ingrown hairs better at all, and actually makes me break out.  I&#x27;ve been trying this for 2 months now but I give up.  This is going in the garbage.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t care what ingredients are in your cosmetics and what you put on your skin, then this review is not relevant for you.  For those of you who do care, beware that the \\&quot;only all natural ingredients\\&quot; advertised on the Prince Reigns website aren&#x27;t that natural at all. Here is the list of INGREDIENTS:    Deionized water  Propylene Glycol  Glycerin  Polysorbate-20  Hydroxyethylcellulose  DMDM Hydantoin  Glycolic Acid  Fragrance  Methyl Paraben  Propyl Paraben  FD&amp;C Green#5  Tocopheryl Acetate  Lavander  Sage  Camomille    Quite a few of these ingredients are highly toxic according to the Skin Deep Safe Cosmetics database.  I wish I would have known the list of ingredients prior to purchasing this product, but I couldn&#x27;t find one anywhere. Hopefully this review will help out those of you who would like to know what&#x27;s in your cosmetics so that you can make an informed decision if this product is for you or not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks and I didn&#x27;t see any results I don&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from ingrown hairs on my legs because I used to use epilator I was really hopeful that this can help me to get rid of them it did nothing for me and also my husband used this and it didn&#x27;t work for him either. I would never buy it again.</li>
            <li> after hearing all the great reviews about this product i decided to try it. it didn&#x27;t work i got ingrown hair by waxing for the 1st time.. ( i will never wax again) i tried this it didnt work.. i try tend skin and it worked.. the bumps appear once in awhile dark spots are the only problem now.. so dont buy this product go with tendskin.</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the biggest disappointments in health and beauty products that I have come across. This serum didn&#x27;t work for me since I still continued to see razor bumps and ingrown hairs even after 2 weeks of trying it on I am very disappointed. Not only that, but this product is very expensive starting at $20 and more online and only get 2 oz or what appears to be nothing more that sugar, water and food coloring mixed together. I have tried other products which work much better like Tend Skin and Min New York Solution two, both just as pricy as this product, but the other ones at least do what they say. Don&#x27;t spend your time and money on this lame product do your research first on something else.</li>
            <li> I am Princereigns addict. Love the stuff and it is perfect for shaving and soothing. Highly recommend,</li>
            <li> This is the best after shave product I have ever purchased it gives you a smooth feeling after every shave and leave you with that elegant and brilliant look it has a great smell too and is very easy to apply unlike other creams or after shave products. Deserved a five star this product got me sold from the first time I used it, will be buying more in the future for sure!!</li>
            <li> As everyone out there that suffers from ingrown hairs I was very excited and praying for this product to work. This product is the same as all the other less expensive products that claim to be a miracle cure. I was fooled by the price thinking that it something this expensive would help some but there has been very little change. For $30 I&#x27;d be better off saving it and putting it towards laser hair removal. I&#x27;m not saying  it won&#x27;t work for someone else.  I just know it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I was recommended by my specialist to use this but they sold it at a high price at their location &amp; I always went through them in a month. So I was excited to see it was sold at a cheaper price w/ a reliable source. Turns out their not. When I got them I realized that the cap was a little lose but thought it was cause of shipping &amp; thought nothing of it. I mentioned it to my specialist &amp; she told me to be careful cause the product might be fake. So with a careful eye I monitored the difference in my skin after using 3 bottles worth &amp; to no surprise nothing changed like how it was suppose to work.</li>
            <li> Love it! I will continue to purchase this product. Not only does it minimize ingrown hairs but it lightens hyperpigmentation that may have resulted from ingrown hair bumps.</li>
            <li> When I shave in personal areas I always get ingrown hairs which is what I purchased this for. I have tried every shaving technique and have had no luck in the past. This stuff does a decent job and I am happy with it. I still have redness after shaving where the hairs grow back in, but they have not turned into bumps and I haven&#x27;t had to pull any ingrown hairs out. Not a miracle worker, but definitely helps!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for me and my daughter.  We have used this after epilation and there are no ingrown hairs that can sometimes be associated with this type of hair removal.  Have been using this product for over a year now and love, love, love it!  The investment of a good epilator and this gel, saves hundreds a year we used to spend on waxing, with the same smooth results.</li>
            <li> Bought this stuff to try to help with ingrown hairs and it made them worse for me!!! i ended up with huge lumps and bumps. will never buy again!!! what a waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> my skin gets pretty bad razor bumps and ingrowns right along my jawbone. I have tried many products, and this one that i dont use anymore. It worked okay, didn&#x27;t get rid of 100% of the ingrown hairs, maybe 60%, but it made my skin very oily. I would not recommend</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the efficacy of this product---kind of like stuff that purports to grow hair, right?---because so many of these don&#x27;t do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this actually works. It&#x27;s easy to use, goes on fine, dries quickly, and as near as I can tell is scent-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re bothered by the occasional ingrown hair, get this stuff!</li>
            <li> this product did absolutely nothing for my ingrown hairs in my bikini area. there was no change let alone improvement. I basicallyy wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself and my husband ended using it more than me.  He asked me to buy more.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years now and have to say its the best around. So good I have introduced it to my brother, cousin and boyfriend who shave their faces and deal with major razor bumps regularly. They swear by it! Thanks Prince Reigns for keeping us pretty!</li>
            <li> At least for me it does. You do have to be patient and apply it as directed for at least a few days, but it did work. I tend to use it parsimoniously only on really difficult spots. It&#x27;s a bit expensive here on amazon but if you can find it at a reasonable price it&#x27;s worth it. Oh and it&#x27;s not a shaving gel, it&#x27;s a serum that you apply to your skin after removing the hair to prevent the itfrom growing back under your skin.</li>
            <li> The product works really well on ingrown hair as well as pretty much any irritated skin. I bought this years ago and find that it still works very well on zits as well as irritated skin. Its very soothing to your skin and brings down redness and swelling. I would most definitely recommend this product to friends.</li>
            <li> i am enjoying this. i use this as a shaving gel to shave with the panasonic wet/dry electric razor. i can tell the difference on my bikini line. ingrown hair starting to fade after just 2 days of shaving with it.</li>
            <li> This really works. I have been plagued with ingrown hairs in recent years and this has really alleviated/prevented them. When I do start to get one if I apply this for 2 days, its gone. I have never used any similar products so I don&#x27;t know it compares, but I have no interest in any other products because this one works great!</li>
            <li> one of the only things that prevent razor burn on my legs. Second only to coconut oil, so for the price, C-oil might win in the future.</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff</li>
            <li> this product definitely helps A LOT. i was very skeptical but decided to try it anyway. I LOVE IT. It helps with bumps, irritation, the little hairs that are stuck underneath quickly peak out. and I dont even use it constantly. (who knows maybe if I did my condition would be completely gone) WORTH TRYING for sure.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on reviews but it didn&#x27;t help me get rid of any bumps from in-grown hairs. Sorry!</li>
            <li> I was so hopeful that this product would work, but it does not for me.  I have multiple dark spots from ingrown hairs and it did not lighten them at all.  It also did not keep them from happening.  BOOOO.</li>
            <li> It really works for me. I tried a lot of things but find this is really helping reduce in grown and marks on my skin due to waxing.</li>
