            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Benefit Porefessional for a while, which I thought was really good.</li>

            <li>Tarte is one of my favorite make up brands, they never seem to disappoint me!</li>

            <li>My crazy-sensitive, reactive skin has truly loved this product and that&#x27;s RARE.</li>
            <li>Even more impressive is that this product and company reflect some of my personal values by not testing on animals to satisfy my desire to look pretty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems to do the job a lot better.</li>
            <li>I tried it, because I will buy more.</li>
            <li>love this prodoct, use with or without makeup.  </li>
            <li>I love the effect of this product.</li>
            <li>I wear a tinted moisturizer and a powder foundation over the top</li>
            <li>There is no shine or sheen, my skin looks so even and my makeup holds up over the top</li>
            <li>, I use a different brand of foundation and it works perfectly under that.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this primer</li>
            <li>this primer actually works and makes my skin look flawless under makeup without breaking me out-</li>
            <li>Love this product&lt;</li>
            <li>but this is so much more money then</li>
            <li>and I really liked the Tarte Clean Slate.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel healthy, smooth, and very clean.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy to get used to) and it seems to act like a barrier between the skin and make-up.  </li>
            <li>I love Tarte clean slate primer</li>
            <li>If your pores really MUST NEVER BE SEEN, talk to a dermatologist about how to reduce pore-size in a healthy and effective way.</li>
            <li>but it goes right on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s primary function is to make your makeup last longer, and it succeeds!</li>
            <li>It feels light on my skin and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>this arrived quickly and safely.  </li>
            <li>I could tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;4.This primer is non-irritating and cruelty free.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product after receiving a free sample from Sephora awhile ago.</li>
            <li>definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>I tried Bare Minerals and it felt good</li>
            <li>A smooth soft canvas before applying the rest of your makeup, for sure!  </li>
            <li>though I&#x27;m still experimenting with make-up (still trying to find the right shade of powder for me, LOL), I will definitely keep using Tarte&#x27;s primer</li>
            <li>I have to say this one is by far amazing.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, this primer doesn&#x27;t mattify for the full 12 hours.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and your foundation will look fresh and polished.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, you need more than a primer to achieve that...let&#x27;s be realistic y&#x27;all!&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my skin feel soft and silky and smooth, even after I put on powder.  </li>
            <li>I have large pores and some acne scars where this primer was supposed to &#x27;fill in&#x27; to make a smooth face</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kept the makeup I wear from settling into and making fine lines and pores more obvious, even if it hasn&#x27;t 100% done away with them.</li>
            <li>for me, 2-3 hours isn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>And how many of them are cruelty free and free of harsh chemicals?</li>
            <li>did exactly what i wanted.  </li>
            <li>and then you look exactly as you would had you never applied the primer.</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this due to the great reviews but it didn&#x27;t work as expected.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly but needs to set for 5+ minutes over my clean, dry, but oily skin.</li>
            <li>I use a small amount and smooth it all over, it makes the pores look smooth and my skin feels luscious!</li>
            <li>The Bare Minerals kind of worked but left my skin greasy and shinny.</li>
            <li>The plus on this product is that its vegan, cruelty free and free of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>, I feel as though a lot of what I want to cover is much easier to cover using this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon and provider</li>
            <li>A small amount is all that&#x27;s really needed; when I first use a bottle or tube of anything, I always put the date I first used it somewhere on the product, and this primer lasted me exactly 5 months!</li>
            <li>You do not need more than a little to cover your entire face.</li>
            <li>This one is clear, and a lot thicker.</li>
            <li>So far it works well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a really terrific primer - covers skin and leaves it like silk ready for foundation.  </li>
            <li>This is a product that can also be used on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have skin that is sensitive, acne and oily to makeup and found out primers.</li>
            <li>Again, I&#x27;ve used mattifying primers that either (a) made my skin dry and flaky, or (b) mattified my skin for little more than an hour.</li>
            <li>I have personally found that some of my larger pores are still pretty obvious to me, but, OVER ALL</li>
            <li>At first it feels really odd</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other primers that didn&#x27;t really affect the lasting power of my makeup, so this was impressive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all it doesn&#x27;t soften the pores and second, you need a bigger amount in comparison with other brands and on top of it, is expensive.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love love love this product.</li>
            <li> This primer is great! I was afraid to try it after reading some pretty negative reviews by Amazon, Ulta, and Tarte customers, but I&#x27;m so glad I went with my gut! Here are some tips if you&#x27;re considering purchasing this product:&lt;br /&gt;1. This primer is a primer. It&#x27;s primary function is to make your makeup last longer, and it succeeds! I have extremely oily skin and I find that my makeup actually lasts throughout the day when I use this product. I&#x27;ve used other primers that didn&#x27;t really affect the lasting power of my makeup, so this was impressive.&lt;br /&gt;2. This product is nourishing, yet mattifying. Again, I&#x27;ve used mattifying primers that either (a) made my skin dry and flaky, or (b) mattified my skin for little more than an hour. This product mattified my skin for an extended period of time without making it look dry. Since purchasing this primer,  I&#x27;ve gone from using blotting sheets and tissues throughout the day to not worrying about excess oil on my skin. HOWEVER, this primer doesn&#x27;t mattify for the full 12 hours. At the end of a 8-hour work day, I have a little bit of &amp;#34;dew&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;grease&amp;#34; on my face. If you&#x27;re looking for 100% matte for 12+hours AND you have oily skin, you need more than a primer to achieve that...let&#x27;s be realistic y&#x27;all!&lt;br /&gt;3. This primer won&#x27;t leave you 100% poreless 100% of the time. Imperfections are BLURRED by makeup, not done away with. I have personally found that some of my larger pores are still pretty obvious to me, but, OVER ALL, I feel as though a lot of what I want to cover is much easier to cover using this product. It&#x27;s kept the makeup I wear from settling into and making fine lines and pores more obvious, even if it hasn&#x27;t 100% done away with them. If your pores really MUST NEVER BE SEEN, talk to a dermatologist about how to reduce pore-size in a healthy and effective way. We will never look like airbrushed models because those models don&#x27;t even look like models. You have pores... That&#x27;s a good thing!&lt;br /&gt;4.This primer is non-irritating and cruelty free. YES there might be better mattifying primers that leave you poreless and perfect... And how many of them are cruelty free and free of harsh chemicals? Not many! My crazy-sensitive, reactive skin has truly loved this product and that&#x27;s RARE. Even more impressive is that this product and company reflect some of my personal values by not testing on animals to satisfy my desire to look pretty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... IT&#x27;S A KEEPER!</li>
            <li> The product is colorless, which is what I wanted. However, it does NOT last 12-hours, as advertised. Goes on smoothly but needs to set for 5+ minutes over my clean, dry, but oily skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing product! I have purchased this product after receiving a free sample from Sephora awhile ago. It goes on smooth and your foundation will look fresh and polished. Very nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Benefit Porefessional for a while, which I thought was really good. However, I saw this on a YouTube video by Tyme the Infamous, and had to try it. Y&#x27;know what? This is superior to the Benefit one. This one is clear, and a lot thicker. Seems to do the job a lot better. Happy I tried it, because I will buy more.</li>
            <li> good product.  did exactly what i wanted.  love this prodoct, use with or without makeup.  get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this due to the great reviews but it didn&#x27;t work as expected.  I have large pores and some acne scars where this primer was supposed to &#x27;fill in&#x27; to make a smooth face but it definitely didn&#x27;t do that.  The makeup still sunk in pores and you can see them thru makeup.  Very disappointed considering what I paid!  :(</li>
            <li> I love the effect of this product. You need about the size of a pea for your entire face. At first it feels really odd and like it&#x27;s just going to ball up like rubber cement, but it goes right on nice and smooth. I have combination skin and this gives a nice matte finish. I wear a tinted moisturizer and a powder foundation over the top and I look flawless. There is no shine or sheen, my skin looks so even and my makeup holds up over the top amazingly.&lt;br /&gt;So why no five star? It lasts 2-3 hours and then you look exactly as you would had you never applied the primer. Your slight sheen you usually have is back, and the uneven texture you may have has returned. It doesn&#x27;t look worse, it just looks exactly the same as if you&#x27;d never put it on. for me, 2-3 hours isn&#x27;t worth the price. If I could find a primer that works this well, but lasted, I&#x27;d be sold!</li>
            <li> This primer works great, I use a different brand of foundation and it works perfectly under that.</li>
            <li> It has a great feel and is an OK primer but it does not minimize my pores at all. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> This gives a very smooth base for makeup. It feels light on my skin and goes on easily.  I will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this primer but I just don&#x27;t. First of all it doesn&#x27;t soften the pores and second, you need a bigger amount in comparison with other brands and on top of it, is expensive. The plus on this product is that its vegan, cruelty free and free of harsh chemicals. Also It works great for people with oily to combination complexion since I find that it helps control the excess of oils under the makeup. I don&#x27;t see myself buying it again.</li>
            <li> this primer actually works and makes my skin look flawless under makeup without breaking me out- definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Product came on time. So far it works well. I would recommend this product to others and my skin is combination. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I decided to try a primer and I really liked the Tarte Clean Slate.  It&#x27;s almost like a gel (so that might be weird for some people but it&#x27;s easy to get used to) and it seems to act like a barrier between the skin and make-up.  I don&#x27;t see any of my pores either after I put on powder.  I love how it makes my skin feel soft and silky and smooth, even after I put on powder.  A small amount is all that&#x27;s really needed; when I first use a bottle or tube of anything, I always put the date I first used it somewhere on the product, and this primer lasted me exactly 5 months! Not bad for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I&#x27;m still experimenting with make-up (still trying to find the right shade of powder for me, LOL), I will definitely keep using Tarte&#x27;s primer so I hope they never discontinue it.  The travel size is a good place to start if you want to try it.</li>
            <li> Love this product&lt;br /&gt;This is a really terrific primer - covers skin and leaves it like silk ready for foundation.  Thanks to Amazon and provider this arrived quickly and safely.  One of the best primers I&#x27;ve used.  Happy Camper</li>
            <li> I love Tarte clean slate primer but this is so much more money then my local mall or the Tarte site.  This just doesn&#x27;t make sense</li>
            <li> You do not need more than a little to cover your entire face. It makes your skin feel healthy, smooth, and very clean. It also helps with oil control. This is a product that can also be used on sensitive skin. It&#x27;s a little expensive, but because you only need to use a little at a time it will last longer than you think. I recommend this item to anyone, I am very happy with my purchase. Tarte is one of my favorite make up brands, they never seem to disappoint me!</li>
            <li> great primer. ticker than some of the other ones i have. a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is the best primer in the world! I tried Bare Minerals and it felt good and I also used several others but they do not last as long they also do not produce that excellent coverage and results.  I use a small amount and smooth it all over, it makes the pores look smooth and my skin feels luscious! It makes my look younger and that is quite a feat! Anything that makes you look good and feel good is worth the investment. A smooth soft canvas before applying the rest of your makeup, for sure!  I love love love it!!</li>
            <li> I have tried at least two other primers, one by Bare Minerals and another one I found on Amazon (can&#x27;t remember the name). I have to say this one is by far amazing. I have skin that is sensitive, acne and oily to makeup and found out primers. The Bare Minerals kind of worked but left my skin greasy and shinny. As soon as I put the Tarte primer I could tell a huge difference. Mostly in the lines around my eyes and my pores, my acne has even stayed away! When I put my makeup on I was amazed at how great it looked and by the end of the day my makeup still looks fresh. Love it! I&#x27;m thinking I will have to stay with this primer, especially because you only have to use very little and it glides on and does not feel like there is anything on my skin. Definitely worth the price.</li>
