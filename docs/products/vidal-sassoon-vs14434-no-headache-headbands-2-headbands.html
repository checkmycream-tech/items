            <li>Love the combs that makes them stay put!</li>
            <li>I love using this for a multitude of reasons!</li>
            <li>They just aren&#x27;t amazing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also looks nice.</li>
            <li>The hair doesn&#x27;t slip on these, so that&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the very best headband I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>so im thrilled to have found these.</li>
            <li>Also they look nice and match hair well.</li>
            <li>They really don&#x27;t hurt my head, and that&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li>These look nice on.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find these online, as I had two but one broke</li>
            <li>catching the bands when I bend my head or move them away from my glasses.  </li>
            <li>I just cannot wear them; I guess I have a huge head!  </li>
            <li>you had more colors.work</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cute.</li>
            <li>So about a year ago I go to Wal-Mart and pick up some more headbands to my surprise when I got them home</li>
            <li>I love that this headband doesn&#x27;t pinch.</li>
            <li>I have been searching everywhere for more of these.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like more colors to choose from as well, but I do like the neutral colors that they do come in.</li>
            <li>Wish it came in more styles, but this works...</li>
            <li>So when you find them buy multiples... over time they do break, but they do hold up better than most resin hairbands.</li>
            <li>I really love them.</li>
            <li>Not terrible at all!</li>
            <li>I really love these headbands.</li>
            <li>I already had so many headbands</li>
            <li>Sure this item does not give me a headache, but it does dig into my scalp.</li>
            <li>Maybe if I had thicker hair they would work better.</li>
            <li>I wish these headbands were a bit more durable, but I have yet to find anything better.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I like them okay, but with my hair in a ponytail</li>
            <li>Comfortable, effective, and cute.  </li>
            <li>These headbands have teeth on the top and the bottom of the sides.</li>
            <li>I love these headbands.  </li>
            <li>These are fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I would love to see more styles and colors.  </li>
            <li>I love these hairbands.</li>
            <li>, I love to wear them :)</li>
            <li>and I had lightly stepped on it - and it didn&#x27;t break!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  glad I did, because these are nice, comfortable headbands.  </li>
            <li>Best headbands, only ones I can wear.</li>
            <li>I have been searching all over for nice comfortable headbands for years at the stores, so I went on Amazon</li>
            <li>I wish they had more color choices.</li>
            <li>These are the one of the two top brands of headbands that I use that DO NOT give me a a headache.  </li>
            <li>These are cute and blend in with my hair.  </li>
            <li>So ,yes, it is not a snug fitting headband to cause headaches, but I prefer a headband that does</li>
            <li>I do wish they have more colors.</li>
            <li>So Its okay for the price.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t been bothered more than one or two times with these on.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li>I used to find them at Wal-Mart but not any more.</li>
            <li>Used to be able to get them at Walmart, but I haven&#x27;t seen them in months.</li>
            <li>So glad I decided to look here.</li>
            <li>Sure, they make break....</li>
            <li>Well..I want more.</li>
            <li>More colors, designs, etc..</li>
            <li>I love headbands.</li>
            <li>I would buy them and pay more for heavier quality.</li>
            <li>Get a handle on better customer service.</li>
            <li>Also, when I would put my reading glasses up on top of my head more often than not it would knock the headband off kilter</li>
            <li>I am sooo glad I found these</li>
            <li>These headbands are fantastic!  </li>
            <li>They are also very attractive, and hold back your hair quite well.  </li>
            <li>I love headbands</li>
            <li>and they were the most comfortable ones I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li>So I love being able to wear my hair</li>
            <li>I have tried so many headbands and they always gave me a headache.  </li>
            <li>I wear glasses and these work better than most.  </li>
            <li>So just by more....&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Most out there are smoothed surface which slides off and doesn&#x27;t hold my hair.  </li>
            <li>I get a headache fairly easily and was suprised that I was able to wear these for a couple of hours and be headache free!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t give headaches, they are very comfortable and they don&#x27;t fall out easily.</li>
            <li>You have to the the perfect round head shape for it to fit good</li>
            <li>and the end have comb-teeth (am sure that&#x27;s not the right term!!)</li>
            <li>light, grips hair and no headache..AND looks great and smart too.</li>
            <li>great stated using with a new do.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise they were pretty awesome and comfortable</li>
            <li>The combs create a nice strong grip, and the earpieces are off-set for a comfortable fit.</li>
            <li>They can break, but it takes quite a bit...they&#x27;re more sturdy than the cheap convenience store models.</li>
            <li>These headbands are cute and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Most comfortable way to keep hair in place.  </li>
            <li>They are the most comfortable headbands I have used with the exception of cloth headbands.</li>
            <li>Besides being cute, these fit well without pinching.  </li>
            <li>These headbands by Vidal Sassoon are significantly more comfortable than the knock off that is all over the stores now.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this design and how they fit.  </li>
            <li>Worked well, looked nice, no headaches, and worth the money.</li>
            <li>The brittle type of plastic they use snaps easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many headbands throughout my lifetime and this one holds true to its claim.</li>
            <li>I ordered these because of the fantastic reviews and it IS  true!</li>
            <li>This headband is definitely more tolerable on my head than most of my other ones and was a great price.</li>
            <li>Headbands were cheaply made and broke easily.</li>
            <li>, my hair looks great all day long - I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and am growing out a pixie cut, so the combs aren&#x27;t as helpful.</li>
            <li>but if you style your hair to cover the ends it looks fine.</li>
            <li>these go on perfectly and don&#x27;t feel tight at all.</li>
            <li>Great design with the little combs at each end because that&#x27;s what make them so effective.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair with random curls, so not all headbands are good fit, but these are perfect.  </li>
            <li>These headbands look great &amp; feel comfortable for several hours.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a great price, totally comfortable, and look current.  </li>
            <li>They are so comfortable and offer all day wear.  </li>
            <li>These are really great for  just pulling back the hair when you are in a hurry  or working in the yard and have not done your hair.  </li>
            <li>They are such a great design</li>
            <li>Cheap</li>
            <li>, I love them and it was totally worth it to me to buy them again.</li>
            <li>For me, they are so comfortable that once I have one on I can&#x27;t feel it.</li>
            <li>these headbands are great, I still get headaches from them - but only after all day wear.</li>
            <li>, they are so comfortable, you forget that they are even there.  </li>
            <li>They are light weight</li>
            <li>They are just what I wanted and fit beaautifully.</li>
            <li>they stay put and are so comfortable</li>
            <li>These fit comfortably without digging into your head.</li>
            <li>and they have been so comfortable I ordered another set.</li>
            <li>of cheap looking plastic&lt;</li>
            <li>These headbands can also be worn comfortably with glasses on.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how comfortable they are.</li>
            <li>I will say they seem cheap and flimsy</li>
            <li>these headbands are comfortable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I felt they were cheaply made.</li>
            <li>They are not tight; hold in place, and look good with anything.</li>
            <li>a bunch more right now</li>
            <li>, they&#x27;re exactly what I needed!!</li>
            <li>They are very light and pretty.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>where them, but I may be more sensitive than most.  </li>
            <li>They are super comfortable, I have even accidentally fallen asleep with them on</li>
            <li>I use these every night to wash my face, keep my growing bangs out of my face while I clean house, or just want to read without worrying about the issue of hair getting in my way.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I am loving these headbands and would definitely purchase more</li>
            <li>It does fit pretty comfortably.</li>
            <li>and it actually holds it in place and looks good.</li>
            <li>No headache but definitely snug so by the end of the day it does feel good to remove it.  </li>
            <li>These rarely tangle my hair and are comfortable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s true</li>
            <li>Most headbands are too tight, so I loved the idea of headbands that wouldn&#x27;t be.  </li>
            <li>Super</li>
            <li>Super product.</li>
            <li>I was lucky.</li>
            <li>It may seem a little silly to rave about how wonderful a headband is, but these are PERFECT!  </li>
            <li>I liked them,just that the material was a little light weight , does not seem durable, but for this price they are okay deal.</li>
            <li>love them and would highly recommend them to anyone who either always or occasionally use a headband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; item also for that free shipping!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very flexible and not at all binding, yet easily keeps my hair under control.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li>Very pretty little ridges and a great price.</li>
            <li>Most of the ones I bought at discount stores didn&#x27;t last a year and were so easy to break.</li>
            <li>They really hold my slippery, fine hair, which is quite an accomplishment.</li>
            <li>They won&#x27;t pull the curl out of your hair because it&#x27;s a much looser fit.</li>
            <li>So, definitely worth the $2.50.</li>
            <li>so I thought a headband would not be for me since the space behind my ears is already taken - so this product is perfect for women wearing glasses.   </li>
            <li>The zigzag style is a nice change from regular headbands.</li>
            <li>But the thing I was most surprised about was how well they stay in your hair.</li>
            <li>, this headband does sit on your head at a different angle than other products on the market, but that&#x27;s what makes it perfect.</li>
            <li>but one thing is it can fix hair rightly</li>
            <li>they do not sit right on my head.  </li>
            <li>They sit right on the pressure points and they have these built in combs on the side that get stuck in your head.</li>
            <li>(price is right)....</li>
            <li>No headaches, they fit great and they hold very well in my thick thich hair.</li>
            <li>Great for keeping your hair back at the gym, as your wash your face at the sink, or just as a cute accessory for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>I have a large head and these fit really well.</li>
            <li>It makes for an easy hair day when I am feeling lazy, but still want to look cute!</li>
            <li>Not too much to the style of the product, but very practical and comfortable.</li>
            <li>It would be great to make a product which is much larger than these ones with the same concept.</li>
            <li>I have medium/thick super straight hair adn</li>
            <li>The nice thing about these headbands is that they pull your hair back with the comb ends, but make my scalp becomes very itchy after awhile.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I only bought this because I needed just a little more to get to $25 free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find them locally, so when I saw these on Amazon, I ordered them right away.</li>
            <li>These are great:  wavy pattern on top holds hair back, hair comb-like tips don&#x27;t give extra pressure with glasses and add extra stability.</li>
            <li>These are easy to wear, not to tight, great colors, nice to have a very thin set, vvery comfortable, would recommend</li>
            <li>They have teeth to grip your hair and they don&#x27;t slide out of place, and the design, with the backward-curving ends is much more comfortable than conventional headbands.</li>
            <li>no headache for real!</li>
            <li>Really pretty with my hair up also in a bun.</li>
            <li>But they did exactly what they claimed.</li>
            <li>It works and it is not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>They get the job done, mostly, but we probably won&#x27;t buy them again in the future.</li>
            <li>They work great for my thick hair, but beware the forks on the sides sometimes get tangled</li>
            <li>exactly what they they promised - no headaches- feels like you are not wearing a headband -</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t pull them off in a certain way then they&#x27;ll pull your hair right out.</li>
            <li>I love these and am going to buy a second pair just to have on hand in case</li>
            <li>Although I have to say that this morning after my shower I was blow drying my hair and felt something funny under one of my stocking feet.  </li>
            <li>Really!</li>
            <li>First day I wore it the damn thing broke...</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve found a headband that doesn&#x27;t hurt or cause headaches.  </li>
            <li>Really cute concept but its to big for my head.</li>
            <li>but I do have a big head so that might be a reason why :)</li>
            <li>They hold the hair back about one to two inches from the top of the forehead.</li>
            <li>They are also great because the teeth hold them securely in my thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had them a month or so and was hoping to get a lot more use out of them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is still useable but I probably will not purchase again after these inevitably lose most of the teeth.</li>
            <li>But these headbands are exactly what they say they are:</li>
            <li>These are quality headbands at a reasonable cost!</li>
            <li>I really do like these headbands!</li>
            <li>Pretty flexible (doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s gonna snap when you put it on.</li>
            <li>In fact, due to the looser fit, you have more control over how much poof you want in front of the band.</li>
            <li>I bought 4 pkgs because they do tend to be somewhat brittle and can break easily if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>I love how these headbands fit and hold my hair in place without feeling too tight.</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic, bought some other VS headbands that were fine, but these snapped immediately out of the box.  </li>
            <li>They were also delivered super fast (2 days, normal shipping)</li>
            <li>I tend to get headaches pretty quickly when wearing headbands, no matter how loosely they fit.</li>
            <li>I finally found them and was so happy to get them in the mail the other day.</li>
            <li>I really liked it, but then my black headband broke after three months.</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not give the headbands 5 stars was that the plastic is the type that might break/snap easy.</li>
            <li>I have long fine hair and most head bands are constantly sliding off.  </li>
            <li>I have a big, beautiful round face.  </li>
            <li>These are the best at holding long thick hairt pack out of my face.  </li>
            <li>I have a large head and always get headaches from headbands.</li>
            <li>I have a large head and was hesitant, but I also have daughters I could give them to</li>
            <li>They are fine to wear, I do not get a headache, but they are molded it seems for a larger head</li>
            <li>These headbands are the only ones made with plastic that really are comfortable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t hold hair very well tend to dig into head and fall out while puling out your hair.</li>
            <li>and they really don&#x27;t give you any head aches.</li>
            <li>Really annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but these are very durable.</li>
            <li>These are truly very comfortable--I never got a headache wearing them.</li>
            <li>is more--they are very functional---</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Not saying much, since I&#x27;m a dude.</li>
            <li>I can wear these for a whole day.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer the Goody no headache bands</li>
            <li>But the price is so reasonable, if they break, I&#x27;ll just buy</li>
            <li>These work really well.</li>
            <li>really can&#x27;t tell I have it in except when taking it off.</li>
            <li>The biggest problem is that Amazon has these available ONLY as an add-on item</li>
            <li>The teeth help your hair go back smoothly without ever digging into your scalp, the bands never pinch into your temples</li>
            <li>These really work well &amp; keep your hair out of your face and doesn&#x27;t cause pressure on the sides of your head which lead to headaches.</li>
            <li>I guess the tilted ends are supposed to hold back the hair near the ears better?</li>
            <li>The only problem is that its made of plastic and does eventually break when its been yanked on by a three year old to many times.</li>
            <li>the teeth on these headbands don&#x27;t fit flat to your head, instead the whole thing pokes you from every direction.</li>
            <li>I ordered more because they do the trick and stay on during yoga and other exercise classes.</li>
            <li>Love the style and they are not as flimsy as other posters mentioned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already added more with other orders.  </li>
            <li>Soooooo much better than any other I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>They grip the hair, stay put and don&#x27;t give a headache like so many other headbands do.</li>
            <li>I have really long fine hair and an injured shoulder, so I need a way to keep my hair out of my face.  </li>
            <li>am on my second set, having broke my first, but they are worth rebuying for me.</li>
            <li>This is the only headband I&#x27;ve ever found that is actually very comfortable and holds my hair back with ease.</li>
            <li>These are classic, well made accessories.</li>
            <li>These are a decent alternative-</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I wish the quality was a little better.</li>
            <li>but my normal bands don&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase a few more of these.</li>
            <li>was having problems with normal headbands</li>
            <li>You barely know it is on your head, yet it does exactly what it is supposed to do, keeps your hair in place without pain.</li>
            <li>You must work the teeth out from the hair, not hard to do, you just need to remember to do it.</li>
            <li>I have been babying my last headband while searching every store for the right head band and</li>
            <li>A super-slim plain band served me better.</li>
            <li>So they live up to their name!&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>They live up to the no headache claim.</li>
            <li>The only headbands I have found that both stay in place, and are relatively headache free.</li>
            <li>I still get headaches from headband and such, but these do a better job than other bands I have/have tried.  </li>
            <li>As many others as I&#x27;ve tried (and given away) in the past</li>
            <li>I have straight fine hair that doesnt usually have problems with hair accessories.</li>
            <li>and i think this is more fit small head and less hairs...</li>
            <li>However, for me, they&#x27;re actually too loose and don&#x27;t feel secure when I&#x27;m wearing them.  </li>
            <li>I try to position the ends farther back than they already go and that helps a little more.  </li>
            <li>I bought these headbands because they are hard to find in the store, and I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li>Fits an adult head without pressing into the scalp.</li>
            <li>However, because of the cut of my hair, I can&#x27;t really go out in public wearing these.  </li>
            <li>the comb part near my ears just sat there....</li>
            <li>I think the plastic is similar to more expensive headbands, but these are better simply because of the design.  </li>
            <li>and I do start to get headaches (i have a quite sensitive head</li>
            <li>But so far, I have worn them on and off for about two months</li>
            <li>Anyway, As soon as I opened the package, I put one on and left it the whole rest of the day/night.  </li>
            <li>This headband is the champ as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li>These are a whole different story, I&#x27;ve worn them for 12 hours with no sign of a headache.</li>
            <li>However, I get headaches from regular head bands, so I was really hopeful when I saw these.</li>
            <li>The ends angle away from your ears towards the back of your head which alleviates any behind the ear pressure and headaches, but more importantly they sit back and out of the way of reading glasses and sunglasses.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d have to take it off and put it back on straight.</li>
            <li>My six year old daughter ended up breaking them on me and for over six months I&#x27;ve been looking for them in every store to no avail</li>
            <li>These are nice if you wear glasses because it doesn&#x27;t bump into the glasses as they rest behind your ears.  </li>
            <li>Very cheap plastic, and very small.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t get the pattern from the teeth on top than the other set, but they are cheap, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt behind my ears.</li>
            <li>I get headaches easily from any hair accessoriy, usually after one to two hours.</li>
            <li>$10 feels like a ripoff compared to how cheap simple plastic headbands are at the grocery store, but none of the other ones I&#x27;ve tried will work properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They definitely need to be available in other colors</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that they break easily, however they are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Price is right for what you get--probably won&#x27;t last too long as they are thin--I still get migraines when I</li>
            <li>It can get a little loose around the top of my head</li>
            <li>The only negative is that I can&#x27;t sit my sunglasses on top of my head when I have the headband on.</li>
            <li>A hairband has to sit very far back on my head</li>
            <li>I have short hair, so it&#x27;s a bit awkward without being able to slip the back teeth into hair, but it works fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There was one I tried once that had soft, flexible sides and was just a dream compared to the usual way they fit me...was hoping this was the same.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of headbands as a general rule</li>
            <li>Also for the price they really don&#x27;t seem flimsy at all to me, I think the minor bit of flexibility is actually helpful in preventing headaches.</li>
            <li>I was able to wear them without getting that headache from the ends digging into my head behind my ears.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, curly, coarse hair; this headband is strong and durable.  </li>
            <li>It really does not give you a headache, unlike other plastic bands.</li>
            <li>Other reviews sounded promising.  </li>
            <li>And my hair is long again now, naturally curly and naturally gray/white/silver, so it&#x27;s naturally coarse.  </li>
            <li>maybe a little more heavy duty</li>
            <li>but when I found them at a local store I tried them, thinking at least they were cheap.</li>
            <li>It would look a little funny.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use elastic-style hairbands because they tend to completely fall off the back of my skull after an hour or so if I wear them far back enough, and I have to constantly take them off and put them back on in the proper place.</li>
            <li>Looks a litle different behind my ears than regular headbands, but the comfort more than makes up for it.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many headbands over the years and they all have something major wrong with them.</li>
            <li>The design stop short of the ends and looks a little funny</li>
            <li>The black one, I use very cautiously.</li>
            <li>So far they seem sturdy &amp; look like they&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li>, they break easily, and hurt behind the ears quite a bit...</li>
            <li>and then my black one broke, which makes me sad because I only had it like 3 days, but they were super cheap.....</li>
            <li>ANYONE that has gone through this transformation with their hair can identify with wanting to keep the growing hair that is too short, but not long enough hair out of their face.</li>
            <li>These stay in place, don&#x27;t put pressure behind the ears and even keep my fine hair out of my eyes.</li>
            <li>You have to try these if you get headaches, hair escapees on the sides near your ears, or if your present headbands are loose and move around (especially when you put your glasses on.)  </li>
            <li>Downside, it isn&#x27;t very tight so doesn&#x27;t always smooth down my hair like I would like.</li>

            <li> Love the combs that makes them stay put!</li>
            <li> I love using this for a multitude of reasons!</li>
            <li> They just aren&#x27;t amazing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also looks nice.</li>
            <li> The hair doesn&#x27;t slip on these, so that&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely the very best headband I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> so im thrilled to have found these.</li>
            <li> Also they look nice and match hair well.</li>
            <li> They really don&#x27;t hurt my head, and that&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> These look nice on.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find these online, as I had two but one broke</li>
            <li> catching the bands when I bend my head or move them away from my glasses.  </li>
            <li> I just cannot wear them; I guess I have a huge head!  </li>
            <li> you had more colors.work</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cute.</li>
            <li> So about a year ago I go to Wal-Mart and pick up some more headbands to my surprise when I got them home</li>
            <li> I love that this headband doesn&#x27;t pinch.</li>
            <li> I have been searching everywhere for more of these.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like more colors to choose from as well, but I do like the neutral colors that they do come in.</li>
            <li> Wish it came in more styles, but this works...</li>
            <li> So when you find them buy multiples... over time they do break, but they do hold up better than most resin hairbands.</li>
            <li> I really love them.</li>
            <li> Not terrible at all!</li>
            <li> I really love these headbands.</li>
            <li> I already had so many headbands</li>
            <li> Sure this item does not give me a headache, but it does dig into my scalp.</li>
            <li> Maybe if I had thicker hair they would work better.</li>
            <li> I wish these headbands were a bit more durable, but I have yet to find anything better.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> I like them okay, but with my hair in a ponytail</li>
            <li> Comfortable, effective, and cute.  </li>
            <li> These headbands have teeth on the top and the bottom of the sides.</li>
            <li> I love these headbands.  </li>
            <li> These are fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I would love to see more styles and colors.  </li>
            <li> I love these hairbands.</li>
            <li> , I love to wear them :)</li>
            <li> and I had lightly stepped on it - and it didn&#x27;t break!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  glad I did, because these are nice, comfortable headbands.  </li>
            <li> Best headbands, only ones I can wear.</li>
            <li> I have been searching all over for nice comfortable headbands for years at the stores, so I went on Amazon</li>
            <li> I wish they had more color choices.</li>
            <li> These are the one of the two top brands of headbands that I use that DO NOT give me a a headache.  </li>
            <li> These are cute and blend in with my hair.  </li>
            <li> So ,yes, it is not a snug fitting headband to cause headaches, but I prefer a headband that does</li>
            <li> I do wish they have more colors.</li>
            <li> So Its okay for the price.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t been bothered more than one or two times with these on.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li> I used to find them at Wal-Mart but not any more.</li>
            <li> Used to be able to get them at Walmart, but I haven&#x27;t seen them in months.</li>
            <li> So glad I decided to look here.</li>
            <li> Sure, they make break....</li>
            <li> Well..I want more.</li>
            <li> More colors, designs, etc..</li>
            <li> I love headbands.</li>
            <li> I would buy them and pay more for heavier quality.</li>
            <li> Get a handle on better customer service.</li>
            <li> Also, when I would put my reading glasses up on top of my head more often than not it would knock the headband off kilter</li>
            <li> I am sooo glad I found these</li>
            <li> These headbands are fantastic!  </li>
            <li> They are also very attractive, and hold back your hair quite well.  </li>
            <li> I love headbands</li>
            <li> and they were the most comfortable ones I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li> So I love being able to wear my hair</li>
            <li> I have tried so many headbands and they always gave me a headache.  </li>
            <li> I wear glasses and these work better than most.  </li>
            <li> So just by more....&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Most out there are smoothed surface which slides off and doesn&#x27;t hold my hair.  </li>
            <li> I get a headache fairly easily and was suprised that I was able to wear these for a couple of hours and be headache free!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t give headaches, they are very comfortable and they don&#x27;t fall out easily.</li>
            <li> You have to the the perfect round head shape for it to fit good</li>
            <li> and the end have comb-teeth (am sure that&#x27;s not the right term!!)</li>
            <li> light, grips hair and no headache..AND looks great and smart too.</li>
            <li> great stated using with a new do.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise they were pretty awesome and comfortable</li>
            <li> The combs create a nice strong grip, and the earpieces are off-set for a comfortable fit.</li>
            <li> They can break, but it takes quite a bit...they&#x27;re more sturdy than the cheap convenience store models.</li>
            <li> These headbands are cute and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Most comfortable way to keep hair in place.  </li>
            <li> They are the most comfortable headbands I have used with the exception of cloth headbands.</li>
            <li> Besides being cute, these fit well without pinching.  </li>
            <li> These headbands by Vidal Sassoon are significantly more comfortable than the knock off that is all over the stores now.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this design and how they fit.  </li>
            <li> Worked well, looked nice, no headaches, and worth the money.</li>
            <li> The brittle type of plastic they use snaps easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many headbands throughout my lifetime and this one holds true to its claim.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because of the fantastic reviews and it IS  true!</li>
            <li> This headband is definitely more tolerable on my head than most of my other ones and was a great price.</li>
            <li> Headbands were cheaply made and broke easily.</li>
            <li> , my hair looks great all day long - I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and am growing out a pixie cut, so the combs aren&#x27;t as helpful.</li>
            <li> but if you style your hair to cover the ends it looks fine.</li>
            <li> these go on perfectly and don&#x27;t feel tight at all.</li>
            <li> Great design with the little combs at each end because that&#x27;s what make them so effective.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair with random curls, so not all headbands are good fit, but these are perfect.  </li>
            <li> These headbands look great &amp; feel comfortable for several hours.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a great price, totally comfortable, and look current.  </li>
            <li> They are so comfortable and offer all day wear.  </li>
            <li> These are really great for  just pulling back the hair when you are in a hurry  or working in the yard and have not done your hair.  </li>
            <li> They are such a great design</li>
            <li> Cheap</li>
            <li> , I love them and it was totally worth it to me to buy them again.</li>
            <li> For me, they are so comfortable that once I have one on I can&#x27;t feel it.</li>
            <li> these headbands are great, I still get headaches from them - but only after all day wear.</li>
            <li> , they are so comfortable, you forget that they are even there.  </li>
            <li> They are light weight</li>
            <li> They are just what I wanted and fit beaautifully.</li>
            <li> they stay put and are so comfortable</li>
            <li> These fit comfortably without digging into your head.</li>
            <li> and they have been so comfortable I ordered another set.</li>
            <li> of cheap looking plastic&lt;</li>
            <li> These headbands can also be worn comfortably with glasses on.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how comfortable they are.</li>
            <li> I will say they seem cheap and flimsy</li>
            <li> these headbands are comfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I felt they were cheaply made.</li>
            <li> They are not tight; hold in place, and look good with anything.</li>
            <li> a bunch more right now</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re exactly what I needed!!</li>
            <li> They are very light and pretty.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> where them, but I may be more sensitive than most.  </li>
            <li> They are super comfortable, I have even accidentally fallen asleep with them on</li>
            <li> I use these every night to wash my face, keep my growing bangs out of my face while I clean house, or just want to read without worrying about the issue of hair getting in my way.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I am loving these headbands and would definitely purchase more</li>
            <li> It does fit pretty comfortably.</li>
            <li> and it actually holds it in place and looks good.</li>
            <li> No headache but definitely snug so by the end of the day it does feel good to remove it.  </li>
            <li> These rarely tangle my hair and are comfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s true</li>
            <li> Most headbands are too tight, so I loved the idea of headbands that wouldn&#x27;t be.  </li>
            <li> Super</li>
            <li> Super product.</li>
            <li> I was lucky.</li>
            <li> It may seem a little silly to rave about how wonderful a headband is, but these are PERFECT!  </li>
            <li> I liked them,just that the material was a little light weight , does not seem durable, but for this price they are okay deal.</li>
            <li> love them and would highly recommend them to anyone who either always or occasionally use a headband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; item also for that free shipping!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very flexible and not at all binding, yet easily keeps my hair under control.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Very pretty little ridges and a great price.</li>
            <li> Most of the ones I bought at discount stores didn&#x27;t last a year and were so easy to break.</li>
            <li> They really hold my slippery, fine hair, which is quite an accomplishment.</li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t pull the curl out of your hair because it&#x27;s a much looser fit.</li>
            <li> So, definitely worth the $2.50.</li>
            <li> so I thought a headband would not be for me since the space behind my ears is already taken - so this product is perfect for women wearing glasses.   </li>
            <li> The zigzag style is a nice change from regular headbands.</li>
            <li> But the thing I was most surprised about was how well they stay in your hair.</li>
            <li> , this headband does sit on your head at a different angle than other products on the market, but that&#x27;s what makes it perfect.</li>
            <li> but one thing is it can fix hair rightly</li>
            <li> they do not sit right on my head.  </li>
            <li> They sit right on the pressure points and they have these built in combs on the side that get stuck in your head.</li>
            <li> (price is right)....</li>
            <li> No headaches, they fit great and they hold very well in my thick thich hair.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping your hair back at the gym, as your wash your face at the sink, or just as a cute accessory for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> I have a large head and these fit really well.</li>
            <li> It makes for an easy hair day when I am feeling lazy, but still want to look cute!</li>
            <li> Not too much to the style of the product, but very practical and comfortable.</li>
            <li> It would be great to make a product which is much larger than these ones with the same concept.</li>
            <li> I have medium/thick super straight hair adn</li>
            <li> The nice thing about these headbands is that they pull your hair back with the comb ends, but make my scalp becomes very itchy after awhile.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I only bought this because I needed just a little more to get to $25 free shipping.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find them locally, so when I saw these on Amazon, I ordered them right away.</li>
            <li> These are great:  wavy pattern on top holds hair back, hair comb-like tips don&#x27;t give extra pressure with glasses and add extra stability.</li>
            <li> These are easy to wear, not to tight, great colors, nice to have a very thin set, vvery comfortable, would recommend</li>
            <li> They have teeth to grip your hair and they don&#x27;t slide out of place, and the design, with the backward-curving ends is much more comfortable than conventional headbands.</li>
            <li> no headache for real!</li>
            <li> Really pretty with my hair up also in a bun.</li>
            <li> But they did exactly what they claimed.</li>
            <li> It works and it is not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> They get the job done, mostly, but we probably won&#x27;t buy them again in the future.</li>
            <li> They work great for my thick hair, but beware the forks on the sides sometimes get tangled</li>
            <li> exactly what they they promised - no headaches- feels like you are not wearing a headband -</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t pull them off in a certain way then they&#x27;ll pull your hair right out.</li>
            <li> I love these and am going to buy a second pair just to have on hand in case</li>
            <li> Although I have to say that this morning after my shower I was blow drying my hair and felt something funny under one of my stocking feet.  </li>
            <li> Really!</li>
            <li> First day I wore it the damn thing broke...</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve found a headband that doesn&#x27;t hurt or cause headaches.  </li>
            <li> Really cute concept but its to big for my head.</li>
            <li> but I do have a big head so that might be a reason why :)</li>
            <li> They hold the hair back about one to two inches from the top of the forehead.</li>
            <li> They are also great because the teeth hold them securely in my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had them a month or so and was hoping to get a lot more use out of them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is still useable but I probably will not purchase again after these inevitably lose most of the teeth.</li>
            <li> But these headbands are exactly what they say they are:</li>
            <li> These are quality headbands at a reasonable cost!</li>
            <li> I really do like these headbands!</li>
            <li> Pretty flexible (doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s gonna snap when you put it on.</li>
            <li> In fact, due to the looser fit, you have more control over how much poof you want in front of the band.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 pkgs because they do tend to be somewhat brittle and can break easily if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> I love how these headbands fit and hold my hair in place without feeling too tight.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic, bought some other VS headbands that were fine, but these snapped immediately out of the box.  </li>
            <li> They were also delivered super fast (2 days, normal shipping)</li>
            <li> I tend to get headaches pretty quickly when wearing headbands, no matter how loosely they fit.</li>
            <li> I finally found them and was so happy to get them in the mail the other day.</li>
            <li> I really liked it, but then my black headband broke after three months.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give the headbands 5 stars was that the plastic is the type that might break/snap easy.</li>
            <li> I have long fine hair and most head bands are constantly sliding off.  </li>
            <li> I have a big, beautiful round face.  </li>
            <li> These are the best at holding long thick hairt pack out of my face.  </li>
            <li> I have a large head and always get headaches from headbands.</li>
            <li> I have a large head and was hesitant, but I also have daughters I could give them to</li>
            <li> They are fine to wear, I do not get a headache, but they are molded it seems for a larger head</li>
            <li> These headbands are the only ones made with plastic that really are comfortable.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t hold hair very well tend to dig into head and fall out while puling out your hair.</li>
            <li> and they really don&#x27;t give you any head aches.</li>
            <li> Really annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but these are very durable.</li>
            <li> These are truly very comfortable--I never got a headache wearing them.</li>
            <li> is more--they are very functional---</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Not saying much, since I&#x27;m a dude.</li>
            <li> I can wear these for a whole day.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer the Goody no headache bands</li>
            <li> But the price is so reasonable, if they break, I&#x27;ll just buy</li>
            <li> These work really well.</li>
            <li> really can&#x27;t tell I have it in except when taking it off.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem is that Amazon has these available ONLY as an add-on item</li>
            <li> The teeth help your hair go back smoothly without ever digging into your scalp, the bands never pinch into your temples</li>
            <li> These really work well &amp; keep your hair out of your face and doesn&#x27;t cause pressure on the sides of your head which lead to headaches.</li>
            <li> I guess the tilted ends are supposed to hold back the hair near the ears better?</li>
            <li> The only problem is that its made of plastic and does eventually break when its been yanked on by a three year old to many times.</li>
            <li> the teeth on these headbands don&#x27;t fit flat to your head, instead the whole thing pokes you from every direction.</li>
            <li> I ordered more because they do the trick and stay on during yoga and other exercise classes.</li>
            <li> Love the style and they are not as flimsy as other posters mentioned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already added more with other orders.  </li>
            <li> Soooooo much better than any other I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> They grip the hair, stay put and don&#x27;t give a headache like so many other headbands do.</li>
            <li> I have really long fine hair and an injured shoulder, so I need a way to keep my hair out of my face.  </li>
            <li> am on my second set, having broke my first, but they are worth rebuying for me.</li>
            <li> This is the only headband I&#x27;ve ever found that is actually very comfortable and holds my hair back with ease.</li>
            <li> These are classic, well made accessories.</li>
            <li> These are a decent alternative-</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I wish the quality was a little better.</li>
            <li> but my normal bands don&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I plan to purchase a few more of these.</li>
            <li> was having problems with normal headbands</li>
            <li> You barely know it is on your head, yet it does exactly what it is supposed to do, keeps your hair in place without pain.</li>
            <li> You must work the teeth out from the hair, not hard to do, you just need to remember to do it.</li>
            <li> I have been babying my last headband while searching every store for the right head band and</li>
            <li> A super-slim plain band served me better.</li>
            <li> So they live up to their name!&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> They live up to the no headache claim.</li>
            <li> The only headbands I have found that both stay in place, and are relatively headache free.</li>
            <li> I still get headaches from headband and such, but these do a better job than other bands I have/have tried.  </li>
            <li> As many others as I&#x27;ve tried (and given away) in the past</li>
            <li> I have straight fine hair that doesnt usually have problems with hair accessories.</li>
            <li> and i think this is more fit small head and less hairs...</li>
            <li> However, for me, they&#x27;re actually too loose and don&#x27;t feel secure when I&#x27;m wearing them.  </li>
            <li> I try to position the ends farther back than they already go and that helps a little more.  </li>
            <li> I bought these headbands because they are hard to find in the store, and I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li> Fits an adult head without pressing into the scalp.</li>
            <li> However, because of the cut of my hair, I can&#x27;t really go out in public wearing these.  </li>
            <li> the comb part near my ears just sat there....</li>
            <li> I think the plastic is similar to more expensive headbands, but these are better simply because of the design.  </li>
            <li> and I do start to get headaches (i have a quite sensitive head</li>
            <li> But so far, I have worn them on and off for about two months</li>
            <li> Anyway, As soon as I opened the package, I put one on and left it the whole rest of the day/night.  </li>
            <li> This headband is the champ as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li> These are a whole different story, I&#x27;ve worn them for 12 hours with no sign of a headache.</li>
            <li> However, I get headaches from regular head bands, so I was really hopeful when I saw these.</li>
            <li> The ends angle away from your ears towards the back of your head which alleviates any behind the ear pressure and headaches, but more importantly they sit back and out of the way of reading glasses and sunglasses.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d have to take it off and put it back on straight.</li>
            <li> My six year old daughter ended up breaking them on me and for over six months I&#x27;ve been looking for them in every store to no avail</li>
            <li> These are nice if you wear glasses because it doesn&#x27;t bump into the glasses as they rest behind your ears.  </li>
            <li> Very cheap plastic, and very small.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get the pattern from the teeth on top than the other set, but they are cheap, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt behind my ears.</li>
            <li> I get headaches easily from any hair accessoriy, usually after one to two hours.</li>
            <li> $10 feels like a ripoff compared to how cheap simple plastic headbands are at the grocery store, but none of the other ones I&#x27;ve tried will work properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They definitely need to be available in other colors</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they break easily, however they are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Price is right for what you get--probably won&#x27;t last too long as they are thin--I still get migraines when I</li>
            <li> It can get a little loose around the top of my head</li>
            <li> The only negative is that I can&#x27;t sit my sunglasses on top of my head when I have the headband on.</li>
            <li> A hairband has to sit very far back on my head</li>
            <li> I have short hair, so it&#x27;s a bit awkward without being able to slip the back teeth into hair, but it works fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There was one I tried once that had soft, flexible sides and was just a dream compared to the usual way they fit me...was hoping this was the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of headbands as a general rule</li>
            <li> Also for the price they really don&#x27;t seem flimsy at all to me, I think the minor bit of flexibility is actually helpful in preventing headaches.</li>
            <li> I was able to wear them without getting that headache from the ends digging into my head behind my ears.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, coarse hair; this headband is strong and durable.  </li>
            <li> It really does not give you a headache, unlike other plastic bands.</li>
            <li> Other reviews sounded promising.  </li>
            <li> And my hair is long again now, naturally curly and naturally gray/white/silver, so it&#x27;s naturally coarse.  </li>
            <li> maybe a little more heavy duty</li>
            <li> but when I found them at a local store I tried them, thinking at least they were cheap.</li>
            <li> It would look a little funny.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use elastic-style hairbands because they tend to completely fall off the back of my skull after an hour or so if I wear them far back enough, and I have to constantly take them off and put them back on in the proper place.</li>
            <li> Looks a litle different behind my ears than regular headbands, but the comfort more than makes up for it.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many headbands over the years and they all have something major wrong with them.</li>
            <li> The design stop short of the ends and looks a little funny</li>
            <li> The black one, I use very cautiously.</li>
            <li> So far they seem sturdy &amp; look like they&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> , they break easily, and hurt behind the ears quite a bit...</li>
            <li> and then my black one broke, which makes me sad because I only had it like 3 days, but they were super cheap.....</li>
            <li> ANYONE that has gone through this transformation with their hair can identify with wanting to keep the growing hair that is too short, but not long enough hair out of their face.</li>
            <li> These stay in place, don&#x27;t put pressure behind the ears and even keep my fine hair out of my eyes.</li>
            <li> You have to try these if you get headaches, hair escapees on the sides near your ears, or if your present headbands are loose and move around (especially when you put your glasses on.)  </li>
            <li> Downside, it isn&#x27;t very tight so doesn&#x27;t always smooth down my hair like I would like.</li>
            <li> The style allows me to wear something cute and casual.</li>
            <li> Usually these hair devices fit so tight that they hurt.</li>
            <li> I have hair that is maybe 6 inches past my shoulders and it holds the hair back very well.</li>
            <li> This one has a special comb that holds the hair behind the ear and is just what I needed.  </li>
            <li> I have a small head, so elastics don&#x27;t really work without the help of a ton of pins and clips.</li>
            <li> Like others her I&#x27;ve never had a headband that didn&#x27;t end up hurting my head, but I wear these all day long to help keep my hair in place if I have it back</li>
            <li> and I dont see them lasting long.</li>
            <li> only downside is that they are very brittle, and both of the ones I purchased previously snapped in half while I was simply removing them from my head.</li>
            <li> I actually use this headband every single day; especially toward the end of a long hair day.</li>
            <li> I wished its a little snug to my head as it does come a little loose after a few jumps and kicks and punches. :-)</li>
            <li> These are the ONLY headbands I can wear ALL DAY LONG because they do not give me a headache!  </li>
            <li> Most headbands give me a horrible pain behind my ears within minutes; these stay pain-free for many hours (though not the whole day).</li>
            <li> hairs are very thin, but there are a lot of them, and weaker headbands tend to just sit on top of my hair rather than actually holding it down.</li>
            <li> As long as I remember to pull it forward to take it out, I don&#x27;t have any problem with it snagging.</li>
            <li> So long hairspray.....</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t even feel it on my head and wore it all day long.</li>
            <li> But at this price, you can&#x27;t go wrong because if you have a normal-sized noggin, you&#x27;ll pay a small price for two nice headbands.</li>
            <li> I dont think my hair is that thick anyway, its just not thin.</li>
            <li> They work well in my thick hair and are very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised and a bit annoyed that almost every other headband manufacturer insists on using the old straight-down-behind-the-ears style when it&#x27;s obvious that&#x27;s not how human heads are shaped.</li>
            <li> Other headbands hurt the back of my ears.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> If you have thick curly hair then I would highly advise you do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> Not one single pain.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not worth my time and aggravation to send back an add-on item.</li>
            <li> so I was forced to purchase other items that I really did not need yet to ship for Amazon so I could get these.  </li>
            <li> The combs that fit behind the ears are also quite large and hard to place unless you have really thick hair.</li>
            <li> I looked down and saw that the headband had fallen off the table next to me</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way they&#x27;d last a full day without driving me crazy.</li>
            <li> Very pretty piece of accessory for casual days.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful to not push them in too deep or you will get a slight headache.</li>
            <li> I can never wear headbands because they are always too tight for my big head.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> If you ar elike me and can&#x27;t wear those little traditional headbands because they hurt your head or dig into the sides of your head by your ears, these are the headbands for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They seem a little big, but they still work.</li>
            <li> The only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is that they are a little brittle and you have to be careful not to crack and break them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a comfortable headband that stays on my head &amp; in my thin hair.  </li>
            <li> However, they still gave me a headache at the end of the day (though not as bad as most headbands</li>
            <li> careful on removal, you can&#x27;t just pull them out or you will snag hair.</li>
            <li> I would be careful with these if I were you.</li>
            <li> They felt like they were slipping off my head.</li>
            <li> I tend to be rough on things</li>
            <li> so you have to be careful with them when putting them on or else</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also still keeping my stray hairs in place so not a real problem I guess.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think I was &#x27;rough&#x27; in my handling ..</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve been discontinued so that was rough.  </li>
            <li> Having lots of curly hair a lot of headbands were not strong enough to stay put, these do not move at all</li>
            <li> They do eventually give me a headache, but not nearly as instantly as other hard headbands.</li>
            <li> The little teeth built into the curve prevents them from slipping, and for extra measure the design with little combs at the curved-back ends ensures they stay in place.  </li>
            <li> But, I did wear it almost every other day, so probably my fault.</li>
            <li> the other I&#x27;m still wearing, although it does aggravate my skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why Sassoon hasn&#x27;t made these in other styles yet.  </li>
            <li> I can wear them all day and they never hurt my head like other headbands.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first</li>
            <li> and I broke the other when I was walking with it</li>
            <li> Not much to say!</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I like its flexibility and it does not fall off like some of the other ones.</li>
            <li> So Vidal Sassoon, please offer these headbands in other styles and heavier quality.</li>
            <li> &quot; I love wearing headbands but the sides always stick behind my ears and i immediately get a severe headache and have to remove the headband, but these are super-comfy and the little combs on each side stick into your hair and not right behind your ears to hurt.  </li>
            <li> However, they are very brittle and I&#x27;ve broken quite a few of these.</li>
            <li> so if you have thick hair or a huge head (guilty on both for me), they might stretch a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for just over a week and worn the black one every day, no worries about it breaking unless I&#x27;m being extraordinarily rough with them.</li>
            <li> Usually headbands are too tight on my head or bother me after a very short amount of time.  </li>
            <li> I would say a week after purchase one of them snapped in half, but I still have the other one and use it almost every day at work.</li>
            <li> (I have dark brunette coloring.)</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the color selection.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Almost all other rigid plastic headbands press into the bone behind my ear (even the ones with those flexible rubbery tips that are supposed to prevent that just press into my head a little bit higher, above where the rubber tip part ends) but the tips of these are bent out of the way and those weird comb things on the ends are completely hidden underneath my hair.</li>
            <li> But, it is so brittle that both of them broke within 2-4 days of use, even when I used them very carefully!</li>
            <li> Love these for days when I give no effs and just want to throw my hair back and have it not look terrible.  </li>
            <li> but then they broke in half.</li>
            <li> or else it just makes this big poof of hair in the back that looks really silly.</li>
            <li> hell color is nicer than the black</li>
            <li> If you have a dremmel type tool to grind off about half the points that stick into the sides of your head, then indeed these can become &amp;</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t feel too tight, but it does give me headache.  </li>
            <li> This product stays put and isn&#x27;t too tight.</li>
            <li> I do not wear them often because they do not keep my hair as tight as I want.</li>
            <li> and I usually have trouble with headbands slipping.  </li>
            <li> The plastic is thick enough to handle the wear and tear of usual use.</li>
            <li> and I ordered these a little over a month ago</li>
            <li> the teeth of these headbands broke a little bit.</li>
            <li> , I thought they were a little wider than they are,</li>
            <li> Has little combs at each end</li>
            <li> I like the little comb pieces at the end.</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with some snapping on me soon after I buy them</li>
            <li> I have had them for a few months now and have not had a problem.</li>
            <li> and when I wear it, the curvature does not fit close to my head to help keep the fly-a-way hair from my face.</li>
            <li> Normally I veer away from thin bands as I have thick hair and usually end up chasing/</li>
            <li> I bought one of these quite a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing quality and sometimes not fit very well</li>
            <li> They are a little small and tight</li>
            <li> they help keep small hair away from your neck and prevent the typical post-headband look.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair and need headbands that have teeth, which is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> My one complaint is the black band was missing teeth</li>
            <li> They either are too tight, don&#x27;t stay put or give you headaches!</li>
            <li> My hair has been thinning over the past few years.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too hard to find a headband with those little teeth and not give me a headache.  </li>
            <li> Since they have a little comb at the ends, they stay in place even with thick hair.  </li>
            <li> The headband is made of plastic and after a few months of ware and hairspray they get weak and tend to just snap in half.  </li>
            <li> I love wearing headbands but they always end up giving me terrible headache in 10-15 mins.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it&#x27;s my head size, or the shape of the headband.</li>
            <li> The teeth on the side keep the band from slipping, and the design keeps the band from digging into the area behind your ears.</li>
            <li> They say no headache, but I usually have a headache within minutes of putting these on.  </li>
            <li> I dont usually wear headbands, i was gonna give them to my sister.</li>
            <li> Unlike the ones I usually get a Walmart, these are hardier.</li>
            <li> Small price to pay to no pain.</li>
            <li> They are rigid and tight, and the little projections poke into the scalp unless you have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> They have small combs at the ends to help hold them in the hair: this would probably be helpful for women with thick hair.</li>
            <li> It was shocking how quickly it was damaged with little wear.</li>
            <li> These headbands are extremely hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Hard to find.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t cause headaches but do cause a little discomfort behind the ears for me.</li>
            <li> When I complained to a coworker, she told me about these.  </li>
            <li> The concept it great--but overall I felt they were just to awkward to wear.  </li>
            <li> Its too late to reshape my skull</li>
            <li> and I have to slowly detangle the sides to not yank out bunches of hair.  </li>
            <li> They should say that if you have thick hair, not to order it.</li>
            <li> The small comb teeth keep hair in place without squeezing your head!</li>
            <li> I purchased all of the other headbands Amazon had to offer, and with the exception of this one, the others were uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> No more headaches!</li>
            <li> Seriously,</li>
            <li> But its so weak it hardly serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased some that bruised my head behind my ears because they pinched so hard.  </li>
            <li> I still get headaches when I wear these, but they aren&#x27;t as bad with these as with the regular ones.  </li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t bad overall.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are a bit difficult to put on my head, it takes me a few minutes to figure it out</li>
            <li> It is really hard to find ones like this!</li>
            <li> and I usually find them uncomfortable, so that says a lot.</li>
            <li> Four stars for the boring plastic tortoise and black as only choices.</li>
            <li> no more headache bands for me!!</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t interfere with my glasses behind my ears.  </li>
            <li> It does not sit on the bony part behind your ears.</li>
            <li> Those of you who use headbands know that spot behind your ears that you start rubbing and moving your headband to relive the pressure, well these headbands don&#x27;t hit that spot.</li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t poorly made, but they don&#x27;t work well for my wife.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> The shape and spikes on these headbands were irritating to my head.  </li>
            <li> they are easily broken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried these headbands before, but mine were borrowed by my granddaughter, and got broken.</li>
            <li> so it sticks in your hair behind your ear instead of squeezing and applying pressure behind your ear</li>
            <li> I hate headbands that give you that ache behind your ears even if you readjust several times.</li>
            <li> The combs dug into my head, and it just plain sits at a weird, uncomfortable place on my head</li>
            <li> Normal headbands give me the worst headache.  </li>
            <li> No more headache from bad headband.</li>
            <li> Usually, headbands press painfully into my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through dozens of headbands only to have all give me horrible neck/shoulder pain and headaches.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I saw the &#x27;no headache&#x27; claim.</li>
            <li> Design is awkward.</li>
            <li> so it fits your head awkwardly.</li>
            <li> was disappointing.</li>
            <li> It would drive me crazy every time I wore sunglasses because the arms of the glasses would bump into the ends of the headband.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t want to look like a mad woman)..</li>
            <li> These are still very uncomfortable to wear and still do cause pain.</li>
            <li> All the headbands I have owned have been worthless, not these</li>
            <li> and I absolutely hate these.</li>
            <li> These are terrible.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> while let my hair grow longer,but dont the hair hanging around my face and ears.wish you had more colors.work great stated using with a new do.</li>
            <li> I can never wear headbands because they are always too tight for my big head.&lt;br /&gt;But these go on perfectly and don&#x27;t feel tight at all. I love them! Also what a great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a bit difficult to put on my head, it takes me a few minutes to figure it out but once it&#x27;s on it feels awesome!</li>
            <li> Usually these hair devices fit so tight that they hurt. Not these. The small comb teeth keep hair in place without squeezing your head! Great hair accessories. I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Price is right for what you get--probably won&#x27;t last too long as they are thin--I still get migraines when I where them, but I may be more sensitive than most.  Colors are great.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like the style and also this is plastic and very fragile and i think this is more fit small head and less hairs...but one thing is it can fix hair rightly</li>
            <li> I bought a ton of different headbands to find one that worked for me.  These stay well in my hair, don&#x27;t pinch or put pressure on my head and I can even wear them with sun glasses on without problems. The only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is that they are a little brittle and you have to be careful not to crack and break them.  If you&#x27;re hesitating making the purchase don&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m going to buy a bunch more right now so I will always have one around.</li>
            <li> These are great... I have fine hair with random curls, so not all headbands are good fit, but these are perfect.  I bought a second set to keep in gym and travel bag.</li>
            <li> These headbands stay in place, too.  I would recommend them.  My daughters also like them.  Good product and good buy.</li>
            <li> I have a large head and always get headaches from headbands. No headaches with these headbands. I ordered more because they do the trick and stay on during yoga and other exercise classes. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> These are really great and I&#x27;m happy to have them. Like others her I&#x27;ve never had a headband that didn&#x27;t end up hurting my head, but I wear these all day long to help keep my hair in place if I have it back and it&#x27;s cute. Great design with the little combs at each end because that&#x27;s what make them so effective.</li>
            <li> My hair has been thinning over the past few years.  I found these headbands at WalMart and have been wearing them for years.  They are so comfortable and offer all day wear.  The headband is made of plastic and after a few months of ware and hairspray they get weak and tend to just snap in half.  I found that I needed to replace them about every 4-6 months.  So about a year ago I go to Wal-Mart and pick up some more headbands to my surprise when I got them home they do not sit right on my head.  To look at these imposter head bands you would think they were the same but they are not!!  I have been babying my last headband while searching every store for the right head band and suddenly one day I thought to search Amazon and here they are.  I ordered 10 sets of 2 so I now have 20 head bands.</li>
            <li> I love wearing headbands but they always end up giving me terrible headache in 10-15 mins. I ordered these because of the fantastic reviews and it IS  true! no headache for real! and the end have comb-teeth (am sure that&#x27;s not the right term!!) they help keep small hair away from your neck and prevent the typical post-headband look.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product! hope they had more colours!</li>
            <li> I wear these headbands all the time. They are super comfortable, I have even accidentally fallen asleep with them on and they didn&#x27;t bother me. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This headband is definitely more tolerable on my head than most of my other ones and was a great price. Really pretty with my hair up also in a bun.</li>
            <li> I love that this headband doesn&#x27;t pinch. And you can wear your sunglasses with it too! I hope I don&#x27;t break them, being plastic. But I&#x27;d buy again if I do!</li>
            <li> I really liked it, but then my black headband broke after three months. But, I did wear it almost every other day, so probably my fault. It really does not give you a headache, unlike other plastic bands. It&#x27;s also looks nice. So, definitely worth the $2.50.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t tell by the picture, but they are curved at the ends.  Other headbands hurt the back of my ears.  But since these are curved, they slant away from the ears.  They are flexible, fit perfectly and stay in place.  I have not found any others that are curved like these.</li>
            <li> These are really great for  just pulling back the hair when you are in a hurry  or working in the yard and have not done your hair.  They work great!!</li>
            <li> Not what I had hoped.  I have really long fine hair and an injured shoulder, so I need a way to keep my hair out of my face.  The toothed headband I was wearing gave me a headache on the side of my head from the teeth scraping my skull and these headbands do the same thing.  I broke one when I hit my head on the car door jamb and the other I&#x27;m still wearing, although it does aggravate my skin.  I am still looking for something that holds back my hair without hurting the skin underneath.</li>
            <li> Fits an adult head without pressing into the scalp. It comes in two different colors, and will go with every outfit.</li>
            <li> These are the best headbands ever.  They turn back at the ends so they don&#x27;t interfere with my glasses behind my ears.  They don&#x27;t dig into the sides of my head, so they don&#x27;t hurt.  Since they have a little comb at the ends, they stay in place even with thick hair.  I bought two sets of them and after about a year, they eventually broke.  I have been searching everywhere for more of these.  They are such a great design I don&#x27;t understand why Sassoon hasn&#x27;t made these in other styles yet.  HEY, SASSOON, GREAT PRODUCT--MAKE MORE!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using these headbands for several years, but couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere locally.  I was very happy to find them on amazon.  I can wear them all day and they never hurt my head like other headbands.</li>
            <li> The brown one broke as I was sliding it into my hair. The black one, I use very cautiously. Design is awkward. I guess the tilted ends are supposed to hold back the hair near the ears better? But its so weak it hardly serves its purpose. Cheap yes, but so is the quality. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> i was so impressed by these, i recommended them to my sister and plan on buying some for my grandchildren soon.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first but when I found them at a local store I tried them, thinking at least they were cheap. But they did exactly what they claimed. I was able to wear them without getting that headache from the ends digging into my head behind my ears.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish they were made of a sturdier plastic. The brittle type of plastic they use snaps easily. My toddler broke one playing with it and I broke the other when I was walking with it and it caught on something. I wish they were made from \\&quot;unbreakable\\&quot; type plastic instead.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Aside from that one flaw, I love them and it was totally worth it to me to buy them again. I&#x27;d like more colors to choose from as well, but I do like the neutral colors that they do come in. For me, they are so comfortable that once I have one on I can&#x27;t feel it. As long as I remember to pull it forward to take it out, I don&#x27;t have any problem with it snagging.</li>
            <li> It does not sit on the bony part behind your ears. It works and it is not uncomfortable. Good bye hair-do headaches! Wish it came in more styles, but this works...</li>
            <li> I wish they had more attractive headbands in this shape. No pressure; no pressure headaches. Very good product. Four stars for the boring plastic tortoise and black as only choices.</li>
            <li> Not much to say! These headbands do what they say they do..........NO HEADACHE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love them and would highly recommend them to anyone who either always or occasionally use a headband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; item also for that free shipping!! Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> These headbands are the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Those of you who use headbands know that spot behind your ears that you start rubbing and moving your headband to relive the pressure, well these headbands don&#x27;t hit that spot. These headbands are extremely hard to find in stores. So when you find them buy multiples... over time they do break, but they do hold up better than most resin hairbands.</li>
            <li> I wear glasses so this worked great with them. I don&#x27;t get sore spots on my head from the bands either like I did with regular headbands</li>
            <li> I have used them for a month or so. I really love them. They are very light and pretty. No more headache from bad headband.</li>
            <li> These are nice if you wear glasses because it doesn&#x27;t bump into the glasses as they rest behind your ears.  It is really hard to find ones like this!</li>
            <li> Got these Vidal Sassoon headbands for my twelve-year-old daughter. Headbands were cheaply made and broke easily. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I get headaches easily from any hair accessoriy, usually after one to two hours. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But these headbands are great, I still get headaches from them - but only after all day wear. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am on my second set, having broke my first, but they are worth rebuying for me. The only headbands I have found that both stay in place, and are relatively headache free. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Be careful on removal, you can&#x27;t just pull them out or you will snag hair. You must work the teeth out from the hair, not hard to do, you just need to remember to do it.</li>
            <li> This is great.  I saw someone wearing this on their hair and asked where is bought it from.  She said from Amazon.  I went online that night and bought it.  It hold up your hair without squezing your head.</li>
            <li> I have a bigger head. These didnt work for me. I am not sure if it&#x27;s my head size, or the shape of the headband. So, they dont work.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic, bought some other VS headbands that were fine, but these snapped immediately out of the box.  Literally couldn&#x27;t put them on my head even once, they both snapped on the way on.</li>
            <li> I love how these headbands fit and hold my hair in place without feeling too tight. I can wear one all day and forget it is even on.  Very pretty little ridges and a great price.</li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t poorly made, but they don&#x27;t work well for my wife.  They just aren&#x27;t amazing.  They get the job done, mostly, but we probably won&#x27;t buy them again in the future.</li>
            <li> Looks a litle different behind my ears than regular headbands, but the comfort more than makes up for it. They can break, but it takes quite a bit...they&#x27;re more sturdy than the cheap convenience store models.</li>
            <li> These are still very uncomfortable to wear and still do cause pain. They don&#x27;t hold hair very well tend to dig into head and fall out while puling out your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many headbands throughout my lifetime and this one holds true to its claim. It also stays in place much better than the rest! Not too much to the style of the product, but very practical and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Love these for days when I give no effs and just want to throw my hair back and have it not look terrible.  Not terrible at all!</li>
            <li> I have a big, beautiful round face.  Normal headbands give me the worst headache.  When I complained to a coworker, she told me about these.  Once I got them, I have not used anything but these.  It keeps the hair out of my face when I am working on the computer and trains the hair back.</li>
            <li> the teeth on these headbands don&#x27;t fit flat to your head, instead the whole thing pokes you from every direction.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t feel too tight, but it does give me headache.  it&#x27;s too hard to find a headband with those little teeth and not give me a headache.  i can wear it for about 30 mins before i start getting headache</li>
            <li> ...and I usually find them uncomfortable, so that says a lot. The combs dug into my head, and it just plain sits at a weird, uncomfortable place on my head no matter how I adjust them. It&#x27;s like the highest point pops way up in the air. I do have a big head, which is why I was looking for an extra-comfortable headband - but my normal bands don&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was one I tried once that had soft, flexible sides and was just a dream compared to the usual way they fit me...was hoping this was the same. It wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is the best, I am trying to let my bangs grow out and I have had the hardest time keeping them out of my face.  I am wearing glasses so I thought a headband would not be for me since the space behind my ears is already taken - so this product is perfect for women wearing glasses.   All the headbands I have owned have been worthless, not these, they are so comfortable, you forget that they are even there.  Having lots of curly hair a lot of headbands were not strong enough to stay put, these do not move at all, my hair looks great all day long - I love this product.</li>
            <li> This are the only headbands I can wear without getting a dreaded headache. These work great. I would recommend them</li>
            <li> I really love these headbands. They are light weight and they really don&#x27;t give you any head aches. LOVE THEM! I already had so many headbands but this one are my favorites. It would be great to make a product which is much larger than these ones with the same concept.</li>
            <li> These headbands are cute and comfortable. I can wear them for 6 hours without getting a headache. My only complaint is that they break easily, however they are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for these &amp;#34;no headache&amp;#34; bands for years. They are just what I wanted and fit beaautifully. And the colors of both bands are great for me (I have dark brunette coloring.)</li>
            <li> Sure this item does not give me a headache, but it does dig into my scalp. I have thin hair and I absolutely hate these. Maybe if I had thicker hair they would work better.</li>
            <li> Oh I so wanted to like these headbands, but... my head is too big.  But at this price, you can&#x27;t go wrong because if you have a normal-sized noggin, you&#x27;ll pay a small price for two nice headbands.</li>
            <li> I used these for a couple of days and they were great while they laster but then they broke in half. I would be careful with these if I were you.</li>
            <li> Most comfortable way to keep hair in place.  I don&#x27;t even realize I&#x27;m wearing it.  The teeth on the side keep the band from slipping, and the design keeps the band from digging into the area behind your ears.</li>
            <li> I use these every night to wash my face, keep my growing bangs out of my face while I clean house, or just want to read without worrying about the issue of hair getting in my way.  They work great for my thick hair, but beware the forks on the sides sometimes get tangled and I have to slowly detangle the sides to not yank out bunches of hair.  Other than that, they&#x27;re perfect, and the forks on the side work well to keep hairstyles in place.</li>
            <li> It holds my hair up and away from my face when I&#x27;m in my body combat class (I don&#x27;t want to look like a mad woman).. I wished its a little snug to my head as it does come a little loose after a few jumps and kicks and punches. :-) No big deal though. It does fit pretty comfortably. I&#x27;m just been picky.</li>
            <li> These give me a headache. They sit right on the pressure points and they have these built in combs on the side that get stuck in your head. Trying to re-adjust it in your hair is a pain b/c it gets caught. These are terrible.</li>
            <li> I still get headaches when I wear these, but they aren&#x27;t as bad with these as with the regular ones.  I try to position the ends farther back than they already go and that helps a little more.  The hair doesn&#x27;t slip on these, so that&#x27;s nice.  However, they are very brittle and I&#x27;ve broken quite a few of these.</li>
            <li> These are the best headbands I have found to keep my unruly hair in place while also staying comfortable all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that they are very brittle, and both of the ones I purchased previously snapped in half while I was simply removing them from my head. It says a lot about them that I am buying replacements. $10 feels like a ripoff compared to how cheap simple plastic headbands are at the grocery store, but none of the other ones I&#x27;ve tried will work properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hairs are very thin, but there are a lot of them, and weaker headbands tend to just sit on top of my hair rather than actually holding it down. A hairband has to sit very far back on my head or else it just makes this big poof of hair in the back that looks really silly. I can&#x27;t use elastic-style hairbands because they tend to completely fall off the back of my skull after an hour or so if I wear them far back enough, and I have to constantly take them off and put them back on in the proper place. Really annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost all other rigid plastic headbands press into the bone behind my ear (even the ones with those flexible rubbery tips that are supposed to prevent that just press into my head a little bit higher, above where the rubber tip part ends) but the tips of these are bent out of the way and those weird comb things on the ends are completely hidden underneath my hair. Super comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised and a bit annoyed that almost every other headband manufacturer insists on using the old straight-down-behind-the-ears style when it&#x27;s obvious that&#x27;s not how human heads are shaped. I wish these headbands were a bit more durable, but I have yet to find anything better.</li>
            <li> When I need my hair out of my face, these do the trick.  However, because of the cut of my hair, I can&#x27;t really go out in public wearing these.  These are for working around the house when I just need some freedom from floppy shortish hair!</li>
            <li> exactly what they they promised - no headaches- feels like you are not wearing a headband - the tortoises hell color is nicer than the black</li>
            <li> Works great. No headaches from these.</li>
            <li> I love them. I have always had trouble with some snapping on me soon after I buy them and I am talking about ones more expensive than these. These held up well. I have had them for a few months now and have not had a problem.</li>
            <li> The concept it great--but overall I felt they were just to awkward to wear.  They felt like they were slipping off my head.</li>
            <li> I tend to be rough on things but these are very durable. The colors are great. The style allows me to wear something cute and casual.</li>
            <li> I like them okay, but with my hair in a ponytail the comb part near my ears just sat there.... and then my black one broke, which makes me sad because I only had it like 3 days, but they were super cheap..... oh well</li>
            <li> The design is very nice and is actually effective in reducing headaches from headbands. But, it is so brittle that both of them broke within 2-4 days of use, even when I used them very carefully! Please save your money and don&#x27;t spend on this low quality product.</li>
            <li> These are great. They stay put all day and they don&#x27;t squeeze the life out of your brain. Who needs a girdle for your head? These are classic, well made accessories. Love them!!</li>
            <li> It may seem a little silly to rave about how wonderful a headband is, but these are PERFECT!  Comfortable, effective, and cute.  Absolutely the very best headband I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> These headbands look great &amp; feel comfortable for several hours. They keep the hair back. So far they seem sturdy &amp; look like they&#x27;ll last a long time. Great price!</li>
            <li> They say no headache, but I usually have a headache within minutes of putting these on.  They are rigid and tight, and the little projections poke into the scalp unless you have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an &amp;#34;add on item&amp;#34;. I wear them every day!! Super product. I don&#x27;t even notice I have them on. No headache at all.</li>
            <li> I used to buy these at Whore-mart, then they stopped carrying them and now carry a different brand that has the earpieces turned at an angle so it fits your head awkwardly. Its too late to reshape my skull so im thrilled to have found these. My one complaint is the black band was missing teeth and it&#x27;s not worth my time and aggravation to send back an add-on item.</li>
            <li> These are truly very comfortable--I never got a headache wearing them. So they live up to their name!&lt;br /&gt;What is more--they are very functional---I wear them often during cooking--no hair escapes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find Vidal Sassoon hair accessories in the stores in my area, so I was happy to find them on Amazon. These headbands have teeth on the top and the bottom of the sides. That makes the headband stay in place. And they&#x27;ve never given me a headache!</li>
            <li> The shape and spikes on these headbands were irritating to my head.  A super-slim plain band served me better. The combs that fit behind the ears are also quite large and hard to place unless you have really thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have a large head and these fit really well. And just as described they don&#x27;t give me a headache. The only reason I did not give the headbands 5 stars was that the plastic is the type that might break/snap easy. I wish the quality was a little better.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and use these to hold back all those stray hairs in a pony tail then you probably won&#x27;t like them. They&#x27;re always getting caught in my hair because of the comb-like things toward the bottom. If you don&#x27;t pull them off in a certain way then they&#x27;ll pull your hair right out.</li>
            <li> If you have a dremmel type tool to grind off about half the points that stick into the sides of your head, then indeed these can become &amp;#34;No Headache&amp;#34; headbands.  But if you can&#x27;t alter them then rate them a 1 or 2 star product unless you have a much smaller head than do I.</li>
            <li> I found these headbands in Walmart one time and bought them yars ago. But when I went looking for them again I couldn&#x27;t for the life of me remember what the brand name of them were and started searching for them on the internet. I finally found them and was so happy to get them in the mail the other day. If you ar elike me and can&#x27;t wear those little traditional headbands because they hurt your head or dig into the sides of your head by your ears, these are the headbands for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have never given me a headache or hurt my head. I love these and am going to buy a second pair just to have on hand in case I break these ones I have.</li>
            <li> I love these headbands.  they stay put and are so comfortable, I forget I am wearing one.  I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a comfortable headband that stays on my head &amp; in my thin hair.  These are great!</li>
            <li> maybe a little more heavy duty and they would be great.  I broke them pulling them from my hair when they got stuck.</li>
            <li> they are easily broken. One of mine just broke in three weeks. Disappointing quality and sometimes not fit very well</li>
            <li> These are &amp;#34;headach-free&amp;#34; headbands.  My wife loves them.</li>
            <li> These fit comfortably without digging into your head. They come in two colors and will go well with any outfit.</li>
            <li> I always get a headache from a headband, and within minutes.  These are fantastic!  They&#x27;re a great price, totally comfortable, and look current.  I would love to see more styles and colors.  I think the plastic is similar to more expensive headbands, but these are better simply because of the design.  I&#x27;m so glad I decided to give them a try!</li>
            <li> I love these hairbands. Ive got curly hair and it is puffy like. lol. So I used it to pull my hair back and it actually holds it in place and looks good. Plus you cant beat the price.</li>
            <li> I was just looking for something very simple, and these do the job. It was a good filler for my order.</li>
            <li> I only bought them because i needed an add-on item. I dont usually wear headbands, i was gonna give them to my sister. Much to my surprise they were pretty awesome and comfortable, I love to wear them :)</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful headband!  It&#x27;s very flexible and not at all binding, yet easily keeps my hair under control. I especially like the fact that the teeth don&#x27;t show while you are wearing it! I purchased all of the other headbands Amazon had to offer, and with the exception of this one, the others were uncomfortable. I plan to purchase a few more of these.</li>
            <li> I am no longer happy with non adjustable plastic head bands.  My head isn&#x27;t built for them.  These look nice and hold great but they poke my head at the ends.</li>
            <li> These headbands work great for me and I usually have trouble with headbands slipping.  The little teeth built into the curve prevents them from slipping, and for extra measure the design with little combs at the curved-back ends ensures they stay in place.  They are a little small and tight so you have to be careful with them when putting them on or else they could possibly break.  Although I have to say that this morning after my shower I was blow drying my hair and felt something funny under one of my stocking feet.  I looked down and saw that the headband had fallen off the table next to me and I had lightly stepped on it - and it didn&#x27;t break! No headache but definitely snug so by the end of the day it does feel good to remove it.  Great price - I&#x27;m going to buy more for backups.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t bad overall. Most headbands give me a horrible pain behind my ears within minutes; these stay pain-free for many hours (though not the whole day). They have small combs at the ends to help hold them in the hair: this would probably be helpful for women with thick hair. I have fine hair and am growing out a pixie cut, so the combs aren&#x27;t as helpful. The zigzag style is a nice change from regular headbands. If they stayed pain-free all day, I&#x27;d probably give them 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I tend to get headaches pretty quickly when wearing headbands, no matter how loosely they fit. These headbands are amazing! I wear them all day and forget they are there. But the thing I was most surprised about was how well they stay in your hair. Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> To be honest, I only bought this because I needed just a little more to get to $25 free shipping.  I&#x27;m  glad I did, because these are nice, comfortable headbands.  They really hold my slippery, fine hair, which is quite an accomplishment.</li>
            <li> These are easy to wear, not to tight, great colors, nice to have a very thin set, vvery comfortable, would recommend</li>
            <li> Best headbands, only ones I can wear. They stay in place but dont give you a headache. Hard to find. STOCK UP!</li>
            <li> I was lucky. I have been searching all over for nice comfortable headbands for years at the stores, so I went on Amazon and I ordered these a little over a month ago and they have been so comfortable I ordered another set. I actually use this headband every single day; especially toward the end of a long hair day. (You know how that is ladies). They are not tight; hold in place, and look good with anything.</li>
            <li> I am still using these headbands. Unlike the ones I usually get a Walmart, these are hardier. Most of the ones I bought at discount stores didn&#x27;t last a year and were so easy to break. These rarely tangle my hair and are comfortable. I sometimes forget I am wearing them. They are the most comfortable headbands I have used with the exception of cloth headbands. I have hair that is maybe 6 inches past my shoulders and it holds the hair back very well. You have to be careful to not push them in too deep or you will get a slight headache. I wish they had more color choices.</li>
            <li> I bought these headbands because they are hard to find in the store, and I am glad that I did. I get a headache fairly easily and was suprised that I was able to wear these for a couple of hours and be headache free! It makes for an easy hair day when I am feeling lazy, but still want to look cute!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried these headbands before, but mine were borrowed by my granddaughter, and got broken. I haven&#x27;t been able to find them locally, so when I saw these on Amazon, I ordered them right away. They have teeth to grip your hair and they don&#x27;t slide out of place, and the design, with the backward-curving ends is much more comfortable than conventional headbands. No headaches! Really! These are great headbands.</li>
            <li> Just got this yesterday and Ive been using it all day today, no Headache. was having problems with normal headbands but this ones fits perfect</li>
            <li> Besides being cute, these fit well without pinching.  I&#x27;ve purchased some that bruised my head behind my ears because they pinched so hard.  Not these though, they feel great!  I can wear them all day and not even think about them because they&#x27;re so comfy.</li>
            <li> First day I wore it the damn thing broke... but then again I have an afro for hair so its probably just a me problem.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many headbands over the years and they all have something major wrong with them. They either are too tight, don&#x27;t stay put or give you headaches! This one is great! You barely know it is on your head, yet it does exactly what it is supposed to do, keeps your hair in place without pain. I definitely would recommend this.</li>
            <li> These are the one of the two top brands of headbands that I use that DO NOT give me a a headache.  Somedays are headband days and this headbands are awesome for that day.  I have thick, curly, coarse hair; this headband is strong and durable.  My hair doesn&#x27;t break this headband and it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache... win,win.</li>
            <li> These are cute and blend in with my hair.  They do eventually give me a headache, but not nearly as instantly as other hard headbands.</li>
            <li> These are great headbands if you are able to put them in and let them be. If you will need to adjust them, however, then be prepared to restyle entirely. The combs create a nice strong grip, and the earpieces are off-set for a comfortable fit.</li>
            <li> I DONT NEED THOSE COMBS IN THE END IS HORRIBLE.&lt;br /&gt;AS I HAVE SO MANNY GAVE ALL THEN TO COOK, BUTLER WIFE AND SO!</li>
            <li> They should say that if you have thick hair, not to order it. I dont think my hair is that thick anyway, its just not thin.</li>
            <li> I am growing out my hair from a very short boy type cut to longer lengths. ANYONE that has gone through this transformation with their hair can identify with wanting to keep the growing hair that is too short, but not long enough hair out of their face. I bought these because of the &#x27;no headache&#x27;. They are fine to wear, I do not get a headache, but they are molded it seems for a larger head and when I wear it, the curvature does not fit close to my head to help keep the fly-a-way hair from my face. So ,yes, it is not a snug fitting headband to cause headaches, but I prefer a headband that does it&#x27;s job in keeping my hair back and staying in place on my head.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve found a headband that doesn&#x27;t hurt or cause headaches.  Flexible yet it holds my hair off my face.  So long hairspray.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just gonna cut to the chase:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*do not cause headaches after 1-2 hours, though any longer and I do start to get headaches (i have a quite sensitive head though)&lt;br /&gt;*teeth on the sides keeps it in place all day&lt;br /&gt;*nice tortoise color&lt;br /&gt;*good price&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*kind of cheap looking plastic&lt;br /&gt;*see \\&quot;pro tip\\&quot; #1</li>
            <li> My hair gets tangled everytime I need to take out and readjust. I have straight fine hair that doesnt usually have problems with hair accessories.</li>
            <li> This product stays put and isn&#x27;t too tight. The material is flexible and I&#x27;m not worried it&#x27;ll crack and snap. It can get a little loose around the top of my head but it&#x27;s also still keeping my stray hairs in place so not a real problem I guess.</li>
            <li> These headbands are the only ones made with plastic that really are comfortable. The fabric/ribbon-like headbands don&#x27;t stay in place nor do the headbands without teeth; these have teeth that don&#x27;t dig into your scalp. These headbands can also be worn comfortably with glasses on. As a person with chronic headaches, I just stopped using headbands for awhile but I took a chance, ordered them, and am happy I did.</li>
            <li> These headbands by Vidal Sassoon are significantly more comfortable than the knock off that is all over the stores now. These stay in place, don&#x27;t put pressure behind the ears and even keep my fine hair out of my eyes. I am glad Amazon still has this brand!</li>
            <li> I like its flexibility and it does not fall off like some of the other ones. I do wish they have more colors.</li>
            <li> I bought these headbands based on the reviews I read on Amazon and I have to say, \\&quot;these headbands are AMAZING!!!!!\\&quot; I love wearing headbands but the sides always stick behind my ears and i immediately get a severe headache and have to remove the headband, but these are super-comfy and the little combs on each side stick into your hair and not right behind your ears to hurt.  They were also delivered super fast (2 days, normal shipping) so that was another plus.  All in all, I am loving these headbands and would definitely purchase more (price is right)....</li>
            <li> Really cute concept but its to big for my head. I had to give them to my mother she seemed to like them.</li>
            <li> I have medium/thick super straight hair adn the teeth of these headbands broke a little bit. they don&#x27;t cause headaches but do cause a little discomfort behind the ears for me. but I do have a big head so that might be a reason why :)</li>
            <li> These headbands are perfect if you wear glasses!!  I don&#x27;t get headaches and they don&#x27;t touch the arms of my glasses!</li>
            <li> Love the style and they are not as flimsy as other posters mentioned. However, they still gave me a headache at the end of the day (though not as bad as most headbands do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Maybe I had a stressful day when I wrote the comment. I haven&#x27;t gotten a headache from this since then.</li>
            <li> Perfect in every way! Great purchase! Worked well, looked nice, no headaches, and worth the money. Would buy again. Thanks</li>
            <li> These headbands are awesome. I prefer them over anything else. Not saying much, since I&#x27;m a dude. I just need my hair out of my face when I wash my face or lounge around doing man things. My sister is trying to steal them from me though, so there&#x27;s a woman&#x27;s endorsement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These do tend to stretch out so if you have thick hair or a huge head (guilty on both for me), they might stretch a bit.</li>
            <li> The nice thing about these headbands is that they pull your hair back with the comb ends, but make my scalp becomes very itchy after awhile. So Its okay for the price.</li>
            <li> Very cheap plastic, and very small. But so far, I have worn them on and off for about two months and I haven&#x27;t been bothered more than one or two times with these on. They hold the hair back about one to two inches from the top of the forehead.</li>
            <li> it is just what I wanted.. light, grips hair and no headache..AND looks great and smart too. Very pretty piece of accessory for casual days.</li>
            <li> No headaches, they fit great and they hold very well in my thick thich hair. Also they look nice and match hair well.</li>
            <li> I still get headaches from headband and such, but these do a better job than other bands I have/have tried.  So it&#x27;s OK.  I guess I just have a big head!</li>
            <li> These are the ONLY headbands I can wear ALL DAY LONG because they do not give me a headache!  They are also great because the teeth hold them securely in my thick hair.  My only complaint is the color selection.  They definitely need to be available in other colors/patterns because I wear these headbands all the time and have been telling my friends how well they work!</li>
            <li> They really don&#x27;t hurt my head, and that&#x27;s wonderful. Also, the design is very nice looking. They will break, so I&#x27;ve gotten several over the years. I used to find them at Wal-Mart but not any more. So I&#x27;m glad Amazon has them!</li>
            <li> Usually headbands are too tight on my head or bother me after a very short amount of time.  I can wear these for a whole day.  The only negative is that I can&#x27;t sit my sunglasses on top of my head when I have the headband on.</li>
            <li> I did not realize that these bands had teeth.  My hair gets tangled in them when taking them on and off.  I much prefer the Goody no headache bands</li>
            <li> You have to try these if you get headaches, hair escapees on the sides near your ears, or if your present headbands are loose and move around (especially when you put your glasses on.)  I LOVE this design and how they fit.  I have a large head and was hesitant, but I also have daughters I could give them to so I thought what the heck.  Other reviews sounded promising.  Anyway, As soon as I opened the package, I put one on and left it the whole rest of the day/night.  Not one single pain.  And my hair is long again now, naturally curly and naturally gray/white/silver, so it&#x27;s naturally coarse.  This headband is the champ as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  As many others as I&#x27;ve tried (and given away) in the past, I never saw this in a store.  I&#x27;ve already added more with other orders.  I wish they came in colors and was thinking of attempting to spray paint one just to see if it would work...  I&#x27;ll come back and tell you if it does.</li>
            <li> No more headaches! Couldn&#x27;t even feel it on my head and wore it all day long. Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through dozens of headbands only to have all give me horrible neck/shoulder pain and headaches. For what ever reason. this style never does. Used to be able to get them at Walmart, but I haven&#x27;t seen them in months. So glad I decided to look here. I bought 4 pkgs because they do tend to be somewhat brittle and can break easily if you&#x27;re not careful. Small price to pay to no pain.</li>
            <li> These are not the cutest headbands but they do keep you from getting a headache. The design stop short of the ends and looks a little funny but if you style your hair to cover the ends it looks fine. Wouldn&#x27;t wear with a pony tail though. It would look a little funny. Like that they match with almost anything and don&#x27;t make my head hurt.</li>
            <li> I never wear headbands because I always get headaches. These are a whole different story, I&#x27;ve worn them for 12 hours with no sign of a headache. Also for the price they really don&#x27;t seem flimsy at all to me, I think the minor bit of flexibility is actually helpful in preventing headaches. I&#x27;ve had it for just over a week and worn the black one every day, no worries about it breaking unless I&#x27;m being extraordinarily rough with them.</li>
            <li> Soooooo much better than any other I&#x27;ve used.  No pressure points to cause pain!  I forget I have one on!  Sure, they make break....they&#x27;re made of plastic.  But the price is so reasonable, if they break, I&#x27;ll just buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 months later.....I still love these!  Several times I have forgot I had one on and slept in it....that&#x27;s how comfortable they are.</li>
            <li> I can wear these for 7-8 hours with no headache. They won&#x27;t pull the curl out of your hair because it&#x27;s a much looser fit. In fact, due to the looser fit, you have more control over how much poof you want in front of the band. You don&#x27;t have to have that pinned-back look to keep the hair out of your face.</li>
            <li> They work well in my thick hair and are very convenient to use. They seem a little big, but they still work.</li>
            <li> These work really well. The plastic is thick enough to handle the wear and tear of usual use. I like them and the side combs help keep it in place.</li>
            <li> I liked them,just that the material was a little light weight , does not seem durable, but for this price they are okay deal.</li>
            <li> My daughter who is 7 loved these headbands. She wears them every day in school. I have bought 2 pairs and she wear them all week in school.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of headbands as a general rule but I do like these.  They grip the hair, stay put and don&#x27;t give a headache like so many other headbands do.</li>
            <li> These look nice on.  I do not wear them often because they do not keep my hair as tight as I want.</li>
            <li> I have a small head, so elastics don&#x27;t really work without the help of a ton of pins and clips. However, I get headaches from regular head bands, so I was really hopeful when I saw these. They are perfect! I wear them during my hour-long workout sessions, and don&#x27;t even feel them in there. I have short hair, so it&#x27;s a bit awkward without being able to slip the back teeth into hair, but it works fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter, She enjoys it, She says it keeps her hair in place and does not annoy her, I thought they were a little wider than they are,</li>
            <li> I loved these but the brown one broke on me yesterday, as I was removing it at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;This was disappointing. I&#x27;ve only had them a month or so and was hoping to get a lot more use out of them.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I was &#x27;rough&#x27; in my handling ..if that&#x27;s possible with a headband.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to get those plastic headbands that hurt..but because it said no headache i bought them. Well..I want more. More colors, designs, etc..NO HEADACHES and really can&#x27;t tell I have it in except when taking it off. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I love headbands. I have very long hair I wear up especially for work. I was skeptical when I saw the &#x27;no headache&#x27; claim. The price on Amazon was inexpensive so I tried them. I wore one to work for over 8 hours with no headache or soreness. I will say they seem cheap and flimsy and I dont see them lasting long. So Vidal Sassoon, please offer these headbands in other styles and heavier quality. I would buy them and pay more for heavier quality. Still, I recommend the headbands. No headache and looks good.</li>
            <li> I concur... these headbands are comfortable. They live up to the no headache claim. I hate headbands that give you that ache behind your ears even if you readjust several times. I have even had ones that leave indents in the skin that I can feel with my fingers. These are great besides the durability issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I felt they were cheaply made. I had these for about a week or two and several of the bottom teeth that comb back broke off of both. I had only worn it a couple of times when I noticed the issue. Maybe it is because I like to carry one or two hair accessories with me in my purse (hair clips, headbands, hair ties, etc) and tossed this in my purse. It was shocking how quickly it was damaged with little wear. It is still useable but I probably will not purchase again after these inevitably lose most of the teeth.</li>
            <li> Could not believe it when I found these.  They&#x27;ve been discontinued so that was rough.  These are the best at holding long thick hairt pack out of my face.  The biggest problem is that Amazon has these available ONLY as an add-on item so I was forced to purchase other items that I really did not need yet to ship for Amazon so I could get these.  Seriously, Amazon/  Because you don&#x27;t make enough money as it is?  You want to save on shipping??  Get a handle on better customer service.</li>
            <li> Nothing earth shattering ... there is a set that I actually prefer but it is almost 10$, they break easily, and hurt behind the ears quite a bit... These are a decent alternative- don&#x27;t get the pattern from the teeth on top than the other set, but they are cheap, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt behind my ears.</li>
            <li> Most headbands are too tight, so I loved the idea of headbands that wouldn&#x27;t be.  However, for me, they&#x27;re actually too loose and don&#x27;t feel secure when I&#x27;m wearing them.  I have to fix and adjust them nearly constantly.  I won&#x27;t return them because it is such a hassle, but I&#x27;ll probably only use them to hold back my hair briefly while I wash my face.  There&#x27;s no way they&#x27;d last a full day without driving me crazy.</li>
            <li> The Perfect Headband!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true, this headband does sit on your head at a different angle than other products on the market, but that&#x27;s what makes it perfect. The ends angle away from your ears towards the back of your head which alleviates any behind the ear pressure and headaches, but more importantly they sit back and out of the way of reading glasses and sunglasses. It would drive me crazy every time I wore sunglasses because the arms of the glasses would bump into the ends of the headband. Also, when I would put my reading glasses up on top of my head more often than not it would knock the headband off kilter and I&#x27;d have to take it off and put it back on straight. I am sooo glad I found these, they&#x27;re exactly what I needed!!</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find these online, as I had two but one broke and I couldn&#x27;t find them in a store anywhere.  I&#x27;ve always gotten headaches from headbands, but NEVER with this make and model.</li>
            <li> These headbands are fantastic!  Usually, headbands press painfully into my scalp.  They make my head hurt within minutes of putting them on.  I just cannot wear them; I guess I have a huge head!  But these headbands are exactly what they say they are: NO HEADACHE!  I am amazed.  They are also very attractive, and hold back your hair quite well.  You must try these headbands!</li>
            <li> These are quality headbands at a reasonable cost! They do not slip off your head or hurt your head so you can wear them for hours on end without feeling the need to shift or remove the headband. Great for keeping your hair back at the gym, as your wash your face at the sink, or just as a cute accessory for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> I love headbands but I can never find any that don&#x27;t slip off my head, pinch my head or cause me severe headaches until these! About 2 years ago I bought 2 packs of these and they were the most comfortable ones I&#x27;ve ever tried! My six year old daughter ended up breaking them on me and for over six months I&#x27;ve been looking for them in every store to no avail, I even had my friends and co-workers out looking for these with no luck. I just found them on amazon and ordered 5 packs and will lock them away! The teeth help your hair go back smoothly without ever digging into your scalp, the bands never pinch into your temples and I&#x27;ve never gotten one headache from them. If I could give them 10 stars I would!</li>
            <li> Normally I veer away from thin bands as I have thick hair and usually end up chasing/catching the bands when I bend my head or move them away from my glasses.  These are great:  wavy pattern on top holds hair back, hair comb-like tips don&#x27;t give extra pressure with glasses and add extra stability.</li>
            <li> no more headache bands for me!! These really work well &amp; keep your hair out of your face and doesn&#x27;t cause pressure on the sides of your head which lead to headaches. So I love being able to wear my hair how I want w/out the worry of a headache!!</li>
            <li> I really do like these headbands! They don&#x27;t give headaches, they are very comfortable and they don&#x27;t fall out easily. I would say a week after purchase one of them snapped in half, but I still have the other one and use it almost every day at work.</li>
            <li> Good headbands. Pretty flexible (doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s gonna snap when you put it on. Has little combs at each end so it sticks in your hair behind your ear instead of squeezing and applying pressure behind your ear (hence, no headache). Downside, it isn&#x27;t very tight so doesn&#x27;t always smooth down my hair like I would like. You have to the the perfect round head shape for it to fit good</li>
            <li> I have tried so many headbands and they always gave me a headache.  I wore this one for the entire day yesterday and it stayed in place and didn&#x27;t give me a headache. I didn&#x27;t even feel it on my head.  I&#x27;m so happy I found these.</li>
            <li> One of the headbands already broke. If you have thick curly hair then I would highly advise you do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these quite a few years ago.  After a move, it got stuck in a box for about 3 years.  When I found it, I was so happy!  Then about 2 months ago I broke it.  I looked everywhere for one made like this, but couldn&#x27;t find it.  This was the only place I found it.  I have long fine hair and most head bands are constantly sliding off.  This one has a special comb that holds the hair behind the ear and is just what I needed.  Itâ€™s a great product and I had a wonderful experience with this seller! I bought two so that if I something happens to this one, I have a back up.  LOVE THIS HEADBAND!</li>
            <li> Love the combs that makes them stay put! Hood price &amp; very useful!!!  I love using this for a multitude of reasons!</li>
            <li> I wear glasses and these work better than most.  They curve back away from your ears so glasses can be worn without interference.</li>
            <li> This is the only headband I&#x27;ve ever found that is actually very comfortable and holds my hair back with ease. The only problem is that its made of plastic and does eventually break when its been yanked on by a three year old to many times. So just by more....&#x3D;) the only headband i&#x27;ll ever wear.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!  I have thick, long hair and need headbands that have teeth, which is hard to find.  Most out there are smoothed surface which slides off and doesn&#x27;t hold my hair.  This one keeps my hair in place.  It&#x27;s light weight and thin.  So handle with care.  I like the little comb pieces at the end.</li>
