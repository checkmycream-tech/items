    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Reviva makes good products, but couldn&#x27;t use this one.  </li>
            <li>Great Item, I just love it</li>
            <li>Amazon offers it at a great price and the product itself is excellent.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product for a makeup primer!</li>
            <li>I love Reviva products!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Reviva Makeup Primer is a smooth operator if ever there was one: successfully manipulating the surface of my skin to make me believe that perfection exists in the world.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my complexion since using this product, and I&#x27;m so glad to look matte in photos now instead of all shiny!</li>
            <li>Love it, very smooth texture when put it on.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels after putting this on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended this product to many family and friends.</li>
            <li>Truth be told, every ‘primer’ on makeup application should incorporate this outstanding product.</li>
            <li>and I love to use Reviva Makeup Primer under makeup.</li>
            <li>maybe i need to be more consistant with it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I like to use it on top of my fave lotion or fave sunblock...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this makeup primer.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s such a great price compared to the $40 primers at Sephora!</li>
            <li>I have been using this stuff for about a month, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Plus it doesn&#x27;t cost nearly as much as many others out there.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite things.  </li>
            <li>This product is light, very effective and glides right on.</li>
            <li>I have tried many face primers and they all end up caky or too oily or just doesn&#x27;t make my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>It is water-based so the primer should have worked fine with it, but it did not.</li>
            <li>It really did make my makeup look amazing.</li>
            <li>The primer alliws the foundation to go on smoothly</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t cheap, so</li>
            <li>I used to use Laura Mercier oil free primer.</li>
            <li>Helps my makeup go on smoothly and no issues with breakouts on my finicky skin.</li>
            <li>I use powdered mineral makeup over it, which goes on smoothly and stays put.  </li>
            <li>After fairly consistent use over the holidays I can now safely say that I will not be repurchasing this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not even need a full pump to cover my face, and it makes my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>I have used several Reviva products with good results.  </li>
            <li>I tried applying it different ways, but it never looks good.</li>
            <li>and all the glowing reviews it received on Vitacost’s website where I continue to purchase this at a ridiculously fair price considering a pea-sized amount is all you need for an entire face.  </li>
            <li>It makes makeup go on smoothly and stay fresh looking longer.  </li>
            <li>A whole day of makeup later, my skin still looks great.</li>
            <li>I work in a hospital kitchen where it is very hot</li>
            <li>It keeps my full coverage makeup looking fresh and also more natural.</li>
            <li>For a more natural product I think it&#x27;s nice to have when you wear it on your bare skin.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing for my sensitive skin- makes any makeup (mineral powder or liquid) stay put all day &amp; is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I have a very labor intensive job and thought that if it could make my makeup look amazing at the end of the day (through sweat and my naturally oily skin) then it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li>and it just makes the makeup appear more soft.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, and when I apply foundation it usually looks great for an hour then gets all greasy...</li>
            <li>I first learned of these products from a Dr. Oz</li>
            <li>the facts: if your ready for prime time, this is your product! </li>
            <li>I got my first one at a health expo and was hooked since.</li>
            <li>and my makeup stays on much longer with this primer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, it leaves a very silky feel that never dissipates and makes my face oily.</li>
            <li>I really like a lot of the Reviva products.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>have used other types of primers that are more lotion like in nature (Korres).</li>
            <li>It took me a week of no makeup, exfoliation, and deep cleansing to clean out everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a small glass bottle with a pump, it does make a good face primer and does feel instantly soft on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really a huge fan of makeup primers - I feel like they clog your skin and don&#x27;t really do anything more than what a face moisturizer can offer.</li>
            <li>I usually never notice my pores, but with this stuff they absolutely stick out.</li>
            <li>now a little about my skin: fair, highly sensitive, &#x27;middle years.&#x27;</li>
            <li>I purchased this product months ago and rarely wear foundation enough to quantify needing a primer.</li>
            <li>All primers are silicon based, so the recipe for these primers are pretty much all the same.</li>
            <li>Good primer, not great though, but</li>
            <li>Reviva Makeup Primer stands up to it all – gliding on like silk while ignoring every flaw (detailed above) all in the process of creating the most amazing base for sunscreen/foundation, et al. </li>
            <li>It does temporarily soften more of the lighter flaws but not a big instant fixer for deep pores or lines.</li>
            <li>I tried putting my makeup on without this after using a whole bottle and immediately got another one because it definitely helps!!</li>
            <li>With it on your skin will feel soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>Natural looking.</li>
            <li>Natural and works well.</li>
            <li>for a natural product it does the trick, it has silicones.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel soft and relaxed.  </li>
            <li>but once you rub it on it&#x27;s not shiny more like a subtle opaque.  </li>
            <li>and it works as well or better then some of the other conventional ones on the market.</li>
            <li>But I read reviews on Reviva and since I was starting a new mineral makeup regimen</li>
            <li>I rarely blot (and then ever so slightly) before 6 hours.</li>
            <li>I have extremely oily skin and large pores.  </li>
            <li>I like the smooth serum consistency, and a very small amount - pea sized</li>
            <li>Second, it doesn&#x27;t conceal my pores or fine lines one bit (not even a little, and my pores are fairly typical size).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It controls oil all day for me - generally about 10 hours, but sometimes if I have a long day, it&#x27;s still doing well after 12 hours.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This didn&#x27;t seem to last very long</li>
            <li> hope the manufacturers will never change this formula with its few, mostly natural, ingredients (checked on EWG’s database).</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend so to see if it would make her face still hold moisture after applying/wearing makeup for long periods of time (like all day)</li>
            <li> I loved the base, so I figured this would be even better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> feels a little greasy if you apply a tiny extra</li>
            <li> Ruddy complexion, combination dry (flaky) with oily t-zone:</li>
            <li> It made my makeup dry and blotchy-</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly and most importantly, this congested my pores like crazy and after a week of consistent use my skin looked horrible.</li>
            <li> And it is an amazing base for my foundation.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> It sinks in quickly, is not sticky and won&#x27;&#x27;t rub off/ball up, is weightless and colorless.  </li>
            <li> she said that it worked well and that its such a noticeable difference it is hard for her to apply makeup without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for years for a quality primer that wasn&#x27;t too heavy, could handle the oil without drying out other areas, wasn&#x27;t tinted, and worked.  </li>
            <li> makes me look greasy after two hours,i have huge pores and it settles me base into crust around them,i wpould stick with moisturizer,let soak in and a good base!</li>
            <li> And I do mean “long day.”</li>
            <li> Other primers I have tried felt heavy and greasy and were not very effective.</li>
            <li> I think it clogs the pores around my nose though just a little.</li>
            <li> Before I went to work today I tried a little bit underneath my makeup.</li>
            <li> However, the product is a little pricey</li>
            <li> Let it set for a few minutes, then your base makeup is easily applied.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years.</li>
            <li> I used it over moisturizer, and under foundation, waiting a few minutes in-between steps.  </li>
            <li> Alas, that is until it is removed at the end of a long day.</li>
            <li> Just wish it wasn&#x27;t in a pump bottle because it is difficult to get the last 1/3 out</li>
            <li> I usually use it every day.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the same time I bought the Loreal perfecting base.</li>
            <li> The Loreal base actually makes them disappear and I noticed that I don&#x27;t need to blot often, if at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive for this size.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to stick with the Loreal base because I didn&#x27;t like Estee Lauder&#x27;s primer either.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used several Reviva products with good results.  I have never used a makeup primer before, fearing they would clog my pores. I have extremely oily skin and large pores.  This smooths them out without exacerbating the oily problem even though it does contain Olive Oil. It keeps my full coverage makeup looking fresh and also more natural. I work in a hospital kitchen where it is very hot and my makeup stays on much longer with this primer. I think it clogs the pores around my nose though just a little.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product months ago and rarely wear foundation enough to quantify needing a primer. After fairly consistent use over the holidays I can now safely say that I will not be repurchasing this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it leaves a very silky feel that never dissipates and makes my face oily. Second, it doesn&#x27;t conceal my pores or fine lines one bit (not even a little, and my pores are fairly typical size).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly and most importantly, this congested my pores like crazy and after a week of consistent use my skin looked horrible. It took me a week of no makeup, exfoliation, and deep cleansing to clean out everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other types of primers that are more lotion like in nature (Korres). I think I will stick with those.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! I bought this for my wedding so my makeup would last. Before I went to work today I tried a little bit underneath my makeup. I have a very labor intensive job and thought that if it could make my makeup look amazing at the end of the day (through sweat and my naturally oily skin) then it&#x27;s a keeper. It really did make my makeup look amazing. ALL DAY LONG!If you have oily skin then this makeup primer is a must.</li>
            <li> Great Item, I just love it</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after putting this on.  I tried putting my makeup on without this after using a whole bottle and immediately got another one because it definitely helps!!</li>
            <li> I bought this at the same time I bought the Loreal perfecting base. I loved the base, so I figured this would be even better.&lt;br /&gt;For me, it does not control oil at all. It also makes my pores and imperfections stick out and my makeup look too obvious. I tried applying it different ways, but it never looks good. I have oily/dry/acne prone skin, maybe that is the problem. I usually never notice my pores, but with this stuff they absolutely stick out. The Loreal base actually makes them disappear and I noticed that I don&#x27;t need to blot often, if at all. Neither product caused me to break out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to stick with the Loreal base because I didn&#x27;t like Estee Lauder&#x27;s primer either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small glass bottle with a pump, it does make a good face primer and does feel instantly soft on. It does temporarily soften more of the lighter flaws but not a big instant fixer for deep pores or lines. For a more natural product I think it&#x27;s nice to have when you wear it on your bare skin.  With it on your skin will feel soft to the touch. But don&#x27;t expect this to be the big miracle worker. Looks like a gel but once you rub it on it&#x27;s not shiny more like a subtle opaque.  Natural looking. I interchange between this and rosehip oil to moisturizer my face.</li>
            <li> It keeps my makeup on longer and doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> I really like a lot of the Reviva products. I first learned of these products from a Dr. Oz show one day. The primer alliws the foundation to go on smoothly and it just makes the makeup appear more soft. I&#x27;ve recommended this product to many family and friends. Also, cheaper than name brand primers !!</li>
            <li> Reviva Makeup Primer is my “all-timer” primer. Truth be told, every ‘primer’ on makeup application should incorporate this outstanding product. I’ve been using this primer for three years and wouldn’t think of facing the day without it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope the manufacturers will never change this formula with its few, mostly natural, ingredients (checked on EWG’s database). Reviva Makeup Primer is without peer and I’ve used (and tossed) plenty before stumbling upon it and all the glowing reviews it received on Vitacost’s website where I continue to purchase this at a ridiculously fair price considering a pea-sized amount is all you need for an entire face.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now a little about my skin: fair, highly sensitive, &#x27;middle years.&#x27; Ruddy complexion, combination dry (flaky) with oily t-zone: a real mixed bag (my skin that is, not me!) Reviva Makeup Primer stands up to it all – gliding on like silk while ignoring every flaw (detailed above) all in the process of creating the most amazing base for sunscreen/foundation, et al. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviva Makeup Primer is a smooth operator if ever there was one: successfully manipulating the surface of my skin to make me believe that perfection exists in the world. Alas, that is until it is removed at the end of a long day. And I do mean “long day.” I rarely blot (and then ever so slightly) before 6 hours. I was lucky to get 2 hours before succumbing to an oil slick with all other primers.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face the facts: if your ready for prime time, this is your product! </li>
            <li> This is a hydrating primer that does not break me out. Gives a brightness, smoothness to my skin, makes whatever foundation I have on last longer. Must try!</li>
            <li> Natural and works well.</li>
            <li> This product is light, very effective and glides right on. Let it set for a few minutes, then your base makeup is easily applied.  Other primers I have tried felt heavy and greasy and were not very effective. My skin is very dry and I love to use Reviva Makeup Primer under makeup.</li>
            <li> i dont know about this primer. maybe i need to be more consistant with it.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Keeps makeup put all day and nourishes my skin!  Not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Good primer, not great though, but for a natural product it does the trick, it has silicones. feels a little greasy if you apply a tiny extra</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a huge fan of makeup primers - I feel like they clog your skin and don&#x27;t really do anything more than what a face moisturizer can offer. But I read reviews on Reviva and since I was starting a new mineral makeup regimen, I decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did. Amazon offers it at a great price and the product itself is excellent. I do not even need a full pump to cover my face, and it makes my skin so smooth. A whole day of makeup later, my skin still looks great. Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product for a makeup primer!</li>
            <li> Love it, very smooth texture when put it on. It&#x27;s expensive for this size.</li>
            <li> makes me look greasy after two hours,i have huge pores and it settles me base into crust around them,i wpould stick with moisturizer,let soak in and a good base!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t seem to last very long and it wasn&#x27;t cheap, so I don&#x27;t thik I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup designer for theatre and I use this product as it helps even out foundation application.  It fills pores somewhat, but the reason I like it is the ease at which foundation can be applied.  However, the product is a little pricey and I might try something cheaper next time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years. I got my first one at a health expo and was hooked since. I like it because it&#x27;s supposed to be a &#x27;healthier&#x27; primer and it works as well or better then some of the other conventional ones on the market. I switched from smashmouth photo box primer and this works just as well. I like to use it on top of my fave lotion or fave sunblock... And it is an amazing base for my foundation.</li>
            <li> For some reason, this primer did not work at all for me.  It made my makeup dry and blotchy- the opposite of what a primer should do.  I used it over moisturizer, and under foundation, waiting a few minutes in-between steps.  I use Revlon Color Stay Foundation for combination skin.  It is water-based so the primer should have worked fine with it, but it did not.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for my sensitive skin- makes any makeup (mineral powder or liquid) stay put all day &amp; is reasonably priced. I used to use Laura Mercier oil free primer.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this makeup primer. Helps my makeup go on smoothly and no issues with breakouts on my finicky skin. A little goes a long way so it lasts a long time. Just wish it wasn&#x27;t in a pump bottle because it is difficult to get the last 1/3 out (I use a q-tip).</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and when I apply foundation it usually looks great for an hour then gets all greasy...however, this primer has saved my life! I&#x27;ve tried multiple foundations on with it, all with the same result, so I know it&#x27;s the primer! I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my complexion since using this product, and I&#x27;m so glad to look matte in photos now instead of all shiny! And it&#x27;s such a great price compared to the $40 primers at Sephora!</li>
            <li> I have the feeling that this primer works quite well. All primers are silicon based, so the recipe for these primers are pretty much all the same. I have very oily skin and this seems to help to keep the make up in place.</li>
            <li> I have tried many face primers and they all end up caky or too oily or just doesn&#x27;t make my skin smooth. This is the best I have ever used. My face did not oil up throughout the day either. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend so to see if it would make her face still hold moisture after applying/wearing makeup for long periods of time (like all day) she said that it worked well and that its such a noticeable difference it is hard for her to apply makeup without it.</li>
            <li> Reviva makes good products, but couldn&#x27;t use this one.  Anything with a lot of perfume or odor masking ingredients will produce enough fumes to irritate my eyes.  This is what happened, and I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for about a month, and I love it.  I have an oily t-zone and &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; on the rest of my face.  I&#x27;ve been looking for years for a quality primer that wasn&#x27;t too heavy, could handle the oil without drying out other areas, wasn&#x27;t tinted, and worked.  Tall order.  I like the smooth serum consistency, and a very small amount - pea sized dab - is enough to do my entire face.  It sinks in quickly, is not sticky and won&#x27;&#x27;t rub off/ball up, is weightless and colorless.  I use powdered mineral makeup over it, which goes on smoothly and stays put.  It controls oil all day for me - generally about 10 hours, but sometimes if I have a long day, it&#x27;s still doing well after 12 hours.  I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this primer for quite a while.  It makes makeup go on smoothly and stay fresh looking longer.  Plus it doesn&#x27;t cost nearly as much as many others out there.  I love Reviva products!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite things.  It makes my face feel soft and relaxed.  I usually use it every day.</li>
