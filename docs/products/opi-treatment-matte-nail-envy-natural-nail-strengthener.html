            <li>Excellent product competitively priced!  </li>
            <li>This is the best nail strengthener I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>product is totally awesome.</li>
            <li>This protects them perfectly and my toenails are no longer bright and shiny.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great.</li>
            <li>It also works great on toenails</li>
            <li>OPI has made one great product here.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This is just a great product since it helps to strengthen my nails and has a matte finish that gives the appearance of wearing no polish at all.  </li>
            <li>This product works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great that it&#x27;s Matte, so it&#x27;s not noticeable.</li>
            <li>Great nail protector with good durability.</li>
            <li>It is what the name suggests, matte  finish, good nail strengthener.</li>
            <li>My manicure always looked good without chipping prematurely.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>My nails look good and they don&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>Good product which I&#x27;ve been using for years and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>The matte finish of this nail strengthener is probably as good as you can get.  </li>
            <li>I LOVED THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried dozens of nail hardeners and strengtheners, but nothing else is anything like as good as this one.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I received the matte and it is exactly what I want at an excellent price!</li>
            <li>This polish seals up the split all the way to the end of the nail and keeps it from catching on things.  </li>
            <li>I also liked the fact that it didn&#x27;t leave a shiny, glossy finish.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product that looks good on nails and definitely provides strengthening.  </li>
            <li>The nail is very strong with two coats of the polish on it.  </li>
            <li>The product chips very easily.</li>
            <li>Best product I&#x27;ve found for natural nails.</li>
            <li>The matte seems to \\&quot;stick\\&quot; the best to the bare nail.  </li>
            <li>&quot; Maybe that would be even more effective, but I&#x27;m very happy with my occasional two-coats</li>
            <li>Application is good turns shiney after awhile, I am looking for a true matte finish</li>
            <li>Love OPI nail envy.</li>
            <li>I personally love nail color but need something to wear during the week for my job</li>
            <li>Was recommended by a co worker and am glad I got it.</li>
            <li>Till now I was not been able to find a solution to my brittle nails.</li>
            <li>So I was glad when I could order it through Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>I have a split thumb nail because of damage to the nail bed many years ago.  </li>
            <li>OPI is my favorite polish.  </li>
            <li>for the Nail Envy itself, I like the matte even better than the gloss - which I&#x27;ve been using for about 6 months</li>
            <li>love the matte finish and the opaque look</li>
            <li>I was looking for something MORE matte in finish, but this product still had a . . .</li>
            <li>bit more shine that I care to have on my manly hands.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better nail strengtheners, like Essie Millionails.</li>
            <li>made my nails peel more</li>
            <li>I also love the way It looks and feels when finished.  </li>
            <li>It is not a matte finish more of a buffed nails finish, shiny but not too shiny.</li>
            <li>I love the finish more than I would&#x27;ve if it had been matte.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really quite remarkable.</li>
            <li>My nails still chip and break easily, but the peeling is getting better.</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis of the nails, and although this is not a cure, sure helps smooth and strengthen the nails.</li>
            <li>matte was the most important thing for me, as I&#x27;m not supposed to wear nail polish at work, but my nails needed something</li>
            <li>but it broke too easily</li>
            <li>Nails are strong when polish is on.  </li>
            <li>I do not like having to use this stuff, but for me, it is fine.  </li>
            <li>This product has allowed me to grow beautiful long, STRONG nails.  </li>
            <li>the downside, it does over time leave a bit of yellowish cast on my nails, which isn&#x27;t a huge deal since I can just paint them.</li>
            <li>Nice matte finish and after 3 to 4 applications, it really helps keep nails from splitting and tearing.</li>
            <li>I initially purchased it because I wanted a matte finish, and it really is great for that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good way to have nice nails and enjoy an active lifesyle.</li>
            <li>Saw a significant improvement in just 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Would love if it were a little bit stonger of the matte finish butfast shipping and great price.</li>
            <li>In other words, it doesn&#x27;t look like you have any polish on your nails, but underneath all that matte coverage, it is doing a good job of strengthening my nails so that they are able to grow.  </li>
            <li>After using it for a couple of months, however, I think their claim is true.</li>
            <li>Appeared to work initially, but then as soon as i missed a day of applying, it no longer looked good.</li>
            <li>This was a re-order for the product and needed it quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is however, a great natural looking polish if you want natural looking nails.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super speedy and the polish was new/sealed/</li>
            <li>It was well packed and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>From my very first use of OPI Matte Nail Envy, my nail problems ceased.  </li>
            <li>Also the matte is truely unnoticable on the nail - would be great for a guy, but I&#x27;d prefer to have a little shine.</li>
            <li>I use two coats and then I use colored polish on top (and of course a quick dry top coat).  </li>
            <li>, 0.5-Fluid Ounce]]If you want shine apply a top coat of clear polish and it lasts for days.</li>
            <li>It dries looking like a fresh manicure.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought it to strengthen my nails but to me it really doesnt strengthen them.</li>
            <li>I will use no other until someone can prove to me there is something better.  </li>
            <li>for the matte finish, I started using it when I ran out of the original formula which is geared to women because of its high gloss finish.</li>
            <li>The finish is only slightly more shiny than my natural nails, and it makes them look nice and smooth and regular.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Nail Envy ever since simply because it works better than anything on the market.</li>
            <li>Well, it really works!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it exactly the way it says.  </li>
            <li>no one will ever notice it which is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>a french manicure done  :)</li>
            <li>looks pretty but didn&#x27;t seem to do anything..... tried for over a month, adding a coat each week.</li>
            <li>-- I was sure that the nails could get extra strength from the polish *while it was on</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t exactly a quantitative double-blind study, but it&#x27;s pretty suggestive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use my hands in so many different ways that growing out my nails is not what I want to do.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really remember how I found the OPI product line, but when I did, what I noticed wasn&#x27;t recommended for women, but for men!  </li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t help my nail peeling and easy breakage near as much as [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>, you will see positive results.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m really writing a review to say I purchased this from Beauty Shine and the shipping was lightning fast!</li>
            <li>I simply want my fingernails to be strong, look groomed, and stand up to the use I give them.  </li>
            <li>Great for growing weak nails out after removing acrylic nails.</li>
            <li>The vendor promised delievery within a reasonable time.  </li>
            <li>The vendor exceeded my expectations by delievery within a much shorter period.  </li>
            <li>The maintenance coats go on quickly and dry super fast.</li>
            <li>It really helped harden my nails and prevent splitting.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried it with a light translucent white or beige to help correct discolored nails with a nutral looking finish.</li>
            <li>I redo my nails completely twice a week to keep the polish fresh and my nail bed protected.</li>
            <li>Being a guy I like the fact that you cant really tell you have it on</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and even after reading the reviews I didn&#x27;t think it would work as well as it did.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks I would use this vendor again.</li>
            <li>This nail treatment works really well.</li>
            <li>Found OPI through a friend and am truly pleased with the results ~ nails have stopped splitting and flaking and are returning to the health and strength they had before use of other products.</li>
            <li>That got my attention, and when reading the details about OPI and this particular treatment, I thought it could work for women too.  </li>
            <li>The matte just gives it a very natural look (if your going for no shine )!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>OPI Natural Nail  really does strengthens nails.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come to prefer the matte finish because it looks very natural and really fits into my busy lifestyle.</li>
            <li>I only coat my right nails and the difference in strength</li>
            <li>Each week I remove my Nail Envy build-up, get a new manicure and start the process over again.</li>
            <li>(Of course, I don&#x27;t think it makes *new* nail growth stronger.)</li>
            <li>Between getting older and having to take steroids, my nails were a complete disaster.  </li>
            <li>WOW it works immediately!</li>
            <li>My nails have a subtle glow and they look nice when I choose to forgo nail color completely.</li>
            <li>While both the matte and glossy are great and the ONLY thing that keeps my weak nails from splitting and breaking, locally everyone carries the glossy.  </li>
            <li>years I have worn clear nail polish to keep from biting my nails.</li>
            <li>OPI Nail Envy Natural Nail Strengthener</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Will absolutely purchase this product again in the future</li>
            <li>OPI has developed this product to strengthen and help cure split nails.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making shopping on line so simple.</li>
            <li>Then, I developed psoriasis underneath the nail bed on my hands.  </li>
            <li>It was supposed to be a completely matte look on the hand, and that&#x27;s what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>This has worked like a charm and worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>Worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend using them in the future.  </li>
            <li>If you examine it closely, you can tell there is polish on it, but in normal daily life</li>
            <li>So then I remove it with nail polish remover and apply two new coats, and then I&#x27;m set until next Sunday.</li>
            <li>One of the reasons I like the matte is that I use it as a base coat and then apply an OPI color over the top and make the matte Nail Envy my top coat.  </li>
            <li>I will keep repurchasing for that only but as far as strength, it hasn&#x27;t done that for me yet.</li>
            <li>This one looks almost like your natural nail while providing extra strength.  </li>

            <li> I use my hands in so many different ways that growing out my nails is not what I want to do.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really remember how I found the OPI product line, but when I did, what I noticed wasn&#x27;t recommended for women, but for men!  </li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t help my nail peeling and easy breakage near as much as [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> , you will see positive results.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m really writing a review to say I purchased this from Beauty Shine and the shipping was lightning fast!</li>
            <li> I simply want my fingernails to be strong, look groomed, and stand up to the use I give them.  </li>
            <li> Great for growing weak nails out after removing acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> The vendor promised delievery within a reasonable time.  </li>
            <li> The vendor exceeded my expectations by delievery within a much shorter period.  </li>
            <li> The maintenance coats go on quickly and dry super fast.</li>
            <li> It really helped harden my nails and prevent splitting.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried it with a light translucent white or beige to help correct discolored nails with a nutral looking finish.</li>
            <li> I redo my nails completely twice a week to keep the polish fresh and my nail bed protected.</li>
            <li> Being a guy I like the fact that you cant really tell you have it on</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and even after reading the reviews I didn&#x27;t think it would work as well as it did.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thanks I would use this vendor again.</li>
            <li> This nail treatment works really well.</li>
            <li> Found OPI through a friend and am truly pleased with the results ~ nails have stopped splitting and flaking and are returning to the health and strength they had before use of other products.</li>
            <li> That got my attention, and when reading the details about OPI and this particular treatment, I thought it could work for women too.  </li>
            <li> The matte just gives it a very natural look (if your going for no shine )!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> OPI Natural Nail  really does strengthens nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to prefer the matte finish because it looks very natural and really fits into my busy lifestyle.</li>
            <li> I only coat my right nails and the difference in strength</li>
            <li> Each week I remove my Nail Envy build-up, get a new manicure and start the process over again.</li>
            <li> (Of course, I don&#x27;t think it makes *new* nail growth stronger.)</li>
            <li> Between getting older and having to take steroids, my nails were a complete disaster.  </li>
            <li> WOW it works immediately!</li>
            <li> My nails have a subtle glow and they look nice when I choose to forgo nail color completely.</li>
            <li> While both the matte and glossy are great and the ONLY thing that keeps my weak nails from splitting and breaking, locally everyone carries the glossy.  </li>
            <li> years I have worn clear nail polish to keep from biting my nails.</li>
            <li> OPI Nail Envy Natural Nail Strengthener</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Will absolutely purchase this product again in the future</li>
            <li> OPI has developed this product to strengthen and help cure split nails.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for making shopping on line so simple.</li>
            <li> Then, I developed psoriasis underneath the nail bed on my hands.  </li>
            <li> It was supposed to be a completely matte look on the hand, and that&#x27;s what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> This has worked like a charm and worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> Worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend using them in the future.  </li>
            <li> If you examine it closely, you can tell there is polish on it, but in normal daily life</li>
            <li> So then I remove it with nail polish remover and apply two new coats, and then I&#x27;m set until next Sunday.</li>
            <li> One of the reasons I like the matte is that I use it as a base coat and then apply an OPI color over the top and make the matte Nail Envy my top coat.  </li>
            <li> I will keep repurchasing for that only but as far as strength, it hasn&#x27;t done that for me yet.</li>
            <li> This one looks almost like your natural nail while providing extra strength.  </li>
            <li> I advise following the directions since it does require a little more time to dry hard than regular nail polish.  </li>
            <li> Now I do my nails half as often (or maybe one third as often), but I can go nearly a month without my nails having problems.</li>
            <li> To make a long story short, I don&#x27;t use anything else now.  </li>
            <li> as long a you apply it regularly as directed</li>
            <li> Have been looking for a matte finish nail strengthener for a long time.  </li>
            <li> They grow so long now</li>
            <li> I am not a person who likes long fingernails.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Incidentally, it&#x27;s worth noting that I&#x27;m not following the directions on the box -- they recommend a very arduous process.</li>
            <li> When I read other reviews claiming that, I dismissed them because it didn&#x27;t seem possible</li>
            <li> con completely not tell that you are wearing nail polish!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had weak nails all my life, and being a guy, didn&#x27;t think much of it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got dry, cracked, brittle, ugly nails, this IS THE PRODUCT for you :)  </li>
            <li> Thankfully I bought my product when it was only $9, so i don&#x27;t feel as though i wasted a ton of money, only a little bit.</li>
            <li> for Nail Envy, I noticed a 2fer at the big box cosmetic store I frequent and decided that I&#x27;d give it a try since my nails are thin.</li>
            <li> It does not really get glossy until a few days later so no embarrassment.  </li>
            <li> I bought this thinking that it would work as well as the Soft &amp; Thin formula only in a matte finish.</li>
            <li> This product helps somewhat but certainly is not a cure-all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never actually had to cut my nails in my life, they usually just break.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> still* don&#x27;t get nicks or rough places!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the box in front of me, but it&#x27;s something like \\&quot;Apply two coats every other day for one week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, two coats seem to last way longer than Hard as Nails --</li>
            <li> When I used the Soft &amp; Thin formula I didn&#x27;t break any.</li>
            <li> Without the nail polish protection, my nails then get little nicks and rough places (which I then mess with or bite).</li>
            <li> Had looked for a matte finish clear polish/strengthener for years; the clear polishes in stores were tearing up my nails badly</li>
            <li> It becomes slightly shiny and will need to be taken off and reapplied if you can&#x27;t have or don&#x27;t want shiny nails, which is the reason for my rating of 4.</li>
            <li> My only problem, which is a serious issue, is that it does not strengthen your nails.</li>
            <li> It has helped my nails grow out to a &amp;#34;respectable&amp;#34; length considering my problem, and after I&#x27;ve applied two coats, they dry to a hard, matte glow.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t provide a hard overcoat as I expected, but rather diffuses into the nail and hardens it all the way through.</li>
            <li> everyday use</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only broken 2 nails since.</li>
            <li> However, it does wear off after a few days of washing your hands a lot at work.</li>
            <li> So, I tried that for a few weeks, applying a coat every day.</li>
            <li> They were excessively brittle.  </li>
            <li> No more splitting.  </li>
            <li> No more breaking.  </li>
            <li> No more brittleness.  </li>
            <li> The matte finish turns a weird fungus-y yellow after a week of wear also-</li>
            <li> B000NUW8V6 Sally Hansen Hard as Nails]],</li>
            <li> I type a lot and am very very hard on my hands and nails.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses the matte finish for his formerly broken nails.</li>
            <li> I have been using this formula for 2 weeks now and have broken 2 nails.</li>
            <li> an added bonus, my nails don&#x27;t look bad when it&#x27;s half worn off because of the matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very weak nails.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the product, and I definitely will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> This sounds tedious but I assure you it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing shy of a miracle.  </li>
            <li> It was a problem that was very difficult to deal with since there isn&#x27;t any treatment for that form of psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> I will use this as a base coat from now on, because it does not seem to make my nails stronger.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The best.  Great nail protector with good durability.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. I have psoriasis of the nails, and although this is not a cure, sure helps smooth and strengthen the nails. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> OPI Natural Nail  really does strengthens nails.  It  keeps nails from drying out and from staining  and often prevents breakage.</li>
            <li> Nails are strong when polish is on.  Definitely a matte - not shiny.</li>
            <li> I have very weak nails.  This product helps somewhat but certainly is not a cure-all.  My nails still chip and break easily, but the peeling is getting better.</li>
            <li> Love OPI nail envy. The matte just gives it a very natural look (if your going for no shine )! I personally love nail color but need something to wear during the week for my job that&#x27;s not visible!</li>
            <li> This was a re-order for the product and needed it quickly.  The vendor promised delievery within a reasonable time.  The vendor exceeded my expectations by delievery within a much shorter period.  Highly recommend using them in the future.  JJF</li>
            <li> Was recommended by a co worker and am glad I got it. It is what the name suggests, matte  finish, good nail strengthener. Till now I was not been able to find a solution to my brittle nails. This has worked like a charm and worth the money spent. [[ASIN:B001ARQWW2 OPI Nail Envy Natural Nail Strengthener, 0.5-Fluid Ounce]]If you want shine apply a top coat of clear polish and it lasts for days.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 or 3 weeks now. I originally bought it to strengthen my nails but to me it really doesnt strengthen them. It is however, a great natural looking polish if you want natural looking nails. I will keep repurchasing for that only but as far as strength, it hasn&#x27;t done that for me yet.</li>
            <li> I could not find the matte OPI nail strengthener locally.  I looked online and was very happy to find it on Amazon.  To ensure it was the matte, not the shiny, I contacted the seller who assured me it was the matte.  I received the matte and it is exactly what I want at an excellent price!</li>
            <li> Have been looking for a matte finish nail strengthener for a long time.  THIS IS IT!  Believe the write ups!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nail Envy for 5-6 years now. What initially got me into OPI products was my manicurist who always used them on my nails. OPI&#x27;s quality is above par. My manicure always looked good without chipping prematurely.&lt;br /&gt;As for Nail Envy, I noticed a 2fer at the big box cosmetic store I frequent and decided that I&#x27;d give it a try since my nails are thin. I&#x27;ve been using Nail Envy ever since simply because it works better than anything on the market. My nails look good and they don&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;As for the matte finish, I started using it when I ran out of the original formula which is geared to women because of its high gloss finish. My husband uses the matte finish for his formerly broken nails. I&#x27;ve come to prefer the matte finish because it looks very natural and really fits into my busy lifestyle. My nails have a subtle glow and they look nice when I choose to forgo nail color completely. When I use nail color, this goes on as a base.&lt;br /&gt;For everyday use, I give myself a manicure and apply two coats allowing ample drying time between coats. Every two days I apply an additional coat. The maintenance coats go on quickly and dry super fast. Each week I remove my Nail Envy build-up, get a new manicure and start the process over again. This sounds tedious but I assure you it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a good way to have nice nails and enjoy an active lifesyle.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t know, learn: Nail Envy is THE PRODUCT to make your nails perfect no matter what you do to them. But I&#x27;m really writing a review to say I purchased this from Beauty Shine and the shipping was lightning fast! Ordered on Thursday night, arrived Monday. Wow.</li>
            <li> It really helped harden my nails and prevent splitting.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t help my nail peeling and easy breakage near as much as [[ASIN:B0006PLOTU Nail Tek Nail Program, II Intensive Therapy .5 fl oz (15 ml)]].  Also the matte is truely unnoticable on the nail - would be great for a guy, but I&#x27;d prefer to have a little shine.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that looks good on nails and definitely provides strengthening.  Will absolutely purchase this product again in the future</li>
            <li> OPI has developed this product to strengthen and help cure split nails.  Well, it really works!  The matte version is especially suited for men because it does not have a glossy finish.  It dries looking like a fresh manicure.  I advise following the directions since it does require a little more time to dry hard than regular nail polish.  The matte version is sometimes packaged with the gloss as a \\&quot;his &#x27;n hers\\&quot; duo.  It also works great on toenails and I&#x27;ve tried it with a light translucent white or beige to help correct discolored nails with a nutral looking finish.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find matte Nail Envy anywhere in our area for some reason.  So I was glad when I could order it through Amazon.com.  While both the matte and glossy are great and the ONLY thing that keeps my weak nails from splitting and breaking, locally everyone carries the glossy.  One of the reasons I like the matte is that I use it as a base coat and then apply an OPI color over the top and make the matte Nail Envy my top coat.  It lasts for weeks without chipping.  The matte seems to \\&quot;stick\\&quot; the best to the bare nail.  I also like the looks of the matte when just used alone.  Good product which I&#x27;ve been using for years and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I wanted something like this to make my nails stronger for finger picking my guitar.  It  seems to be helping but I only started using it a couple days ago</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  Had looked for a matte finish clear polish/strengthener for years; the clear polishes in stores were tearing up my nails badly and I had quit using anything.  Found OPI through a friend and am truly pleased with the results ~ nails have stopped splitting and flaking and are returning to the health and strength they had before use of other products.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got dry, cracked, brittle, ugly nails, this IS THE PRODUCT for you :)  I&#x27;ve got thyroid issues that have just destroyed my nails and hair.  This product has allowed me to grow beautiful long, STRONG nails.  I type a lot and am very very hard on my hands and nails.  This product is nothing shy of a miracle.  I don&#x27;t use it exactly the way it says.  I use two coats and then I use colored polish on top (and of course a quick dry top coat).  I redo my nails completely twice a week to keep the polish fresh and my nail bed protected. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of similar products that make the same claims - this one is legit!</li>
            <li> I have a split thumb nail because of damage to the nail bed many years ago.  Since I&#x27;m a guy I didn&#x27;t want something shiny.  The matte finish of this nail strengthener is probably as good as you can get.  If you examine it closely, you can tell there is polish on it, but in normal daily life no one will ever notice it which is exactly what I wanted.  It seals up the split.  I keep the nail cut extremely short to minimize things getting caught on the split at the end.  This polish seals up the split all the way to the end of the nail and keeps it from catching on things.  I am very happy.  The nail is very strong with two coats of the polish on it.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Excellent product competitively priced!  Thanks for making shopping on line so simple.</li>
            <li> OPI is my favorite polish.  This one looks almost like your natural nail while providing extra strength.  Great for growing weak nails out after removing acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had weak nails all my life, and being a guy, didn&#x27;t think much of it. I recently took up classical guitar, however, and you pick the strings with your nails, so mine were a disaster. Did some research and found this product, bought it and WOW it works immediately! It doesn&#x27;t provide a hard overcoat as I expected, but rather diffuses into the nail and hardens it all the way through. I only coat my right nails and the difference in strength is obvious. And it works in a minute or two! I&#x27;m also taking biotin (2.5 mg/day) which will take a month or so to take effect. My coated nails are a bit shinier than the uncoated ones, so I may opt to do them all, but it&#x27;s not obvious that they&#x27;re coated.</li>
            <li> Between getting older and having to take steroids, my nails were a complete disaster.  They split.  They broke.  They were excessively brittle.  From my very first use of OPI Matte Nail Envy, my nail problems ceased.  No more splitting.  No more breaking.  No more brittleness.  They grow so long now, I actually have to cut them.  Thank you, OPI</li>
            <li> This is the best nail strengthener I have ever used.  I will use no other until someone can prove to me there is something better.  OPI has made one great product here.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super speedy and the polish was new/sealed/authentic.&lt;br /&gt;As for the Nail Envy itself, I like the matte even better than the gloss - which I&#x27;ve been using for about 6 months and I&#x27;ve only broken 2 nails since. I&#x27;ve never actually had to cut my nails in my life, they usually just break.&lt;br /&gt;Now the downside, it does over time leave a bit of yellowish cast on my nails, which isn&#x27;t a huge deal since I can just paint them.</li>
            <li> for fingerstyle guitar students. Nice matte finish and after 3 to 4 applications, it really helps keep nails from splitting and tearing.</li>
            <li> Being a guy I like the fact that you cant really tell you have it on but it didn&#x27;t prevent my nails from splitting and chipping. That&#x27;s why I bought it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and even after reading the reviews I didn&#x27;t think it would work as well as it did.&lt;br /&gt;I love the matte finish and the opaque look it gives my nails.  Now that my nails will finally grow,&lt;br /&gt;just using this makes me look like I had a french manicure done  :)</li>
            <li> I was looking for something MORE matte in finish, but this product still had a . . . bit more shine that I care to have on my manly hands.  I know that is a bit of a oxymoron to use &amp;#34;manly hands&amp;#34; when I bought a Nail Envy product, . . . but I&#x27;m an enigma, so. . . . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the product works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better nail strengtheners, like Essie Millionails.</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found for natural nails.</li>
            <li> This nail varnish was priced well. It was well packed and shipped quickly. Thanks I would use this vendor again.</li>
            <li> I LOVED THE PRODUCT AND WHEN I RUN OUT I WILL REORDER AGAIN. I SEEN THE PRODUCT ON PINTEREST THAT IS WHAT PEAKED MY INTEREST.</li>
            <li> Found this on pinterest. Would love if it were a little bit stonger of the matte finish butfast shipping and great price.</li>
            <li> Great product. Saw a significant improvement in just 2 weeks.  Worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> This nail treatment works really well. I can tell a difference in the strength of my nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The matte was the most important thing for me, as I&#x27;m not supposed to wear nail polish at work, but my nails needed something so they weren&#x27;t so brittle. The matte works REALLY well for a few days...con completely not tell that you are wearing nail polish!! However, it does wear off after a few days of washing your hands a lot at work. It becomes slightly shiny and will need to be taken off and reapplied if you can&#x27;t have or don&#x27;t want shiny nails, which is the reason for my rating of 4.</li>
            <li> looks pretty but didn&#x27;t seem to do anything..... tried for over a month, adding a coat each week.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff to protect my toenails which crack and get fungus in them.  This protects them perfectly and my toenails are no longer bright and shiny.</li>
            <li> This is just a great product since it helps to strengthen my nails and has a matte finish that gives the appearance of wearing no polish at all.  After 3 days it will shine a bit, but a nail buff or another coat takes care of it.</li>
            <li> I have alopecia and it affects my nails.  I do not like having to use this stuff, but for me, it is fine.  It does not really get glossy until a few days later so no embarrassment.  I tried a different matte strengthener but it broke too easily so I went back to this.</li>
            <li> This product works great. I initially purchased it because I wanted a matte finish, and it really is great for that. The finish is only slightly more shiny than my natural nails, and it makes them look nice and smooth and regular. (If I were a guy, I would have no qualms about using this. I don&#x27;t think anybody would ever guess that I&#x27;m wearing polish of some kind.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big surprise for me, however, was that it actually seems to make my nails stronger. When I read other reviews claiming that, I dismissed them because it didn&#x27;t seem possible -- I was sure that the nails could get extra strength from the polish *while it was on* but that the nails&#x27; intrinsic strength remained the same. After using it for a couple of months, however, I think their claim is true. Here&#x27;s my evidence:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I have worn clear nail polish to keep from biting my nails. On Sunday nights I apply two coats of [[ASIN:B000NUW8V6 Sally Hansen Hard as Nails]], and after about a week it wears off of the tips. Without the nail polish protection, my nails then get little nicks and rough places (which I then mess with or bite). So then I remove it with nail polish remover and apply two new coats, and then I&#x27;m set until next Sunday. Since I switched to this Nail Envy strengthener a couple months ago, however, I&#x27;ve had a very different experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, two coats seem to last way longer than Hard as Nails -- sometimes 2-3 weeks. And once it does wear off of the tips, my nails *still* don&#x27;t get nicks or rough places! It&#x27;s really quite remarkable. Now I do my nails half as often (or maybe one third as often), but I can go nearly a month without my nails having problems. (Of course, I don&#x27;t think it makes *new* nail growth stronger.) This isn&#x27;t exactly a quantitative double-blind study, but it&#x27;s pretty suggestive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus, my nails don&#x27;t look bad when it&#x27;s half worn off because of the matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, it&#x27;s worth noting that I&#x27;m not following the directions on the box -- they recommend a very arduous process. I don&#x27;t have the box in front of me, but it&#x27;s something like \\&quot;Apply two coats every other day for one week. Then remove it all and start again. Forever!\\&quot; Maybe that would be even more effective, but I&#x27;m very happy with my occasional two-coats method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is totally awesome. If you&#x27;ve found yourself reading these reviews, you should totally buy it. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of nail hardeners and strengtheners, but nothing else is anything like as good as this one.</li>
            <li> Thankfully I bought my product when it was only $9, so i don&#x27;t feel as though i wasted a ton of money, only a little bit. I will use this as a base coat from now on, because it does not seem to make my nails stronger. It is suggested that a coat be applied every day. So, I tried that for a few weeks, applying a coat every day. Appeared to work initially, but then as soon as i missed a day of applying, it no longer looked good. made my nails peel more (that was not my problem to start). The matte finish turns a weird fungus-y yellow after a week of wear also- it looked like i had nail fungus or was a 3 pack/day smoker. Neither applies to me.</li>
            <li> I am not a person who likes long fingernails.  I use my hands in so many different ways that growing out my nails is not what I want to do.  I simply want my fingernails to be strong, look groomed, and stand up to the use I give them.  For years now I couldn&#x27;t find any product that would the job for me.  Then, I developed psoriasis underneath the nail bed on my hands.  That simply made my nails literally fall apart and crack off.  It was a problem that was very difficult to deal with since there isn&#x27;t any treatment for that form of psoriasis.  I can&#x27;t really remember how I found the OPI product line, but when I did, what I noticed wasn&#x27;t recommended for women, but for men!  That got my attention, and when reading the details about OPI and this particular treatment, I thought it could work for women too.  I also liked the fact that it didn&#x27;t leave a shiny, glossy finish.  It was supposed to be a completely matte look on the hand, and that&#x27;s what I wanted.  To make a long story short, I don&#x27;t use anything else now.  It has helped my nails grow out to a &amp;#34;respectable&amp;#34; length considering my problem, and after I&#x27;ve applied two coats, they dry to a hard, matte glow.  In other words, it doesn&#x27;t look like you have any polish on your nails, but underneath all that matte coverage, it is doing a good job of strengthening my nails so that they are able to grow.  I also love the way It looks and feels when finished.  I guess it is just what a man should use, but for me, it solved a problem that nothing else could.</li>
            <li> The product chips very easily. Application is good turns shiney after awhile, I am looking for a true matte finish</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking that it would work as well as the Soft &amp; Thin formula only in a matte finish. It is not a matte finish more of a buffed nails finish, shiny but not too shiny. I love the finish more than I would&#x27;ve if it had been matte. My only problem, which is a serious issue, is that it does not strengthen your nails. I have been using this formula for 2 weeks now and have broken 2 nails. When I used the Soft &amp; Thin formula I didn&#x27;t break any. Very disappointed in the product, and I definitely will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend who plays classical guitar. He was always worried about breaking his nails. Now this adds strength to his nails. It&#x27;s also great that it&#x27;s Matte, so it&#x27;s not noticeable.</li>
            <li> This is the one that WORKS.....as long a you apply it regularly as directed, you will see positive results.</li>
