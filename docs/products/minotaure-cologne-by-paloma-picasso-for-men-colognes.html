            <li>Still the most sexy and intoxicating scent for my man!</li>
            <li>more than 1 month ago</li>
            <li>I bought it because I enjoyed the packaging and the name</li>
            <li>All time favorite.</li>
            <li>This is probably the favorite of all fragrances I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Minotaure has been my favorite cologne for years, but what I received was not Minotaure!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was my favorite cologne</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t find a better scent than this for a man.</li>
            <li>Its somethings amazing and special about this smell....</li>
            <li>its not the original perfume so dont get it!</li>
            <li>He was surprised and happy with the gift.</li>
            <li>Due to that the service and quality are excellent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing Minotaure for years, like to wear it during the cool New England fall weather as it produces a nice warm</li>
            <li>Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>By far one of the most interesting and rewarding scents you can buy today.</li>
            <li>This cologne errs on the side of lemony-sweet freshness and is still widely available.  </li>
            <li>He had mentioned that it was no longer available.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The contents of this bottle smelled like cheap cologne from a drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>It is fake!&lt;br /&gt;Smells like a cheap china counterfeit</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe this is still available even.</li>
            <li>Very nice fragrance, moderate sillage and projection....</li>
            <li>I was happy to be able to acquire it through  amazon, but when I received the products(I made the error of buying several bottles without checking it out first)</li>
            <li>and I was excited to see it available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Just enjoy it and share with someone so special...</li>
            <li>the flagrant seemed diluted with alcool or whatever, the original smell or flavor was not there</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m a fan of both, I must give credit to the original Minotaure, which no doubt inspired the Nicole Miller for Men fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The original smell of Minotaure.</li>
            <li>I THINK THIS IS NOT AN ORIGINAL PRODUCT</li>
            <li>/&gt;Big mama tells me that I smell sexy and spicey (not in a hot harbanero way) but rather in a mild orange wood spice type of</li>
            <li>It starts off sweet with an eye-opening, honey-lemon freshness.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s mild... not that overpowering sweet nectar that all the post-teenage gigolos like to wear.</li>
            <li>Smells clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>lucky.....</li>
            <li>Classic and elegant cologne</li>
            <li>Having first purchased this cologne in 1993, I have forever been mesmerized by the unique oriental scent.  </li>
            <li>Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
            <li>Patchouli is a bit stronger than I remember, but overall a nice, unique, woodsy, vanilla, orange, patchouli scent that will last for the better part of a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It smells right out of the bottle what Minotaure eventually settles into after 5 minutes---if that makes any sense.  </li>
            <li>I have used many and have always had a positive reaction from the opposite sex when I am wearing Minotaure.</li>
            <li>IN MY OPINION..! :.must be special type of skin to give full essential of it..</li>
            <li>i researched scents that are popular and very well reviewed bought this one in the dark</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the reviews complaining about it not being the real thing dissuade</li>
            <li>The real one.</li>
            <li>the price  is  reasonable and got it in 2 business day  </li>
            <li>While that initial burst may be alarming to some people, the aromatic warm, amber, sweetness that remains is quite inviting.  </li>
            <li>of the few scents I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t turn super sweet on me after 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Its hard to describe but its light, sweet, mellow.</li>
            <li>Regardless of how much applied the scent fades within minutes, must be old or just scented water.  </li>
            <li>way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not over powering and smells very natural.</li>
            <li>Like Antonio Bandeiras Secret, the Minotaure is better !</li>
            <li>The pony collection and the majority of what you can buy in the malls today dosent stand up to the complex smell of this one, ive just fallen in love with it.</li>
            <li>Masculine.</li>
            <li>My only wish is that there will be enough bottles of this now-discontinued fragrance in the future to last me into my old age:)</li>
            <li>and i have to say it is a whole other level above what you can buy for anyone right now.</li>
            <li>I use to buy it on duty free every time i travel but a few years back never seen it at the shops anymore.</li>
            <li>Husbands favorite and very hard to find.  </li>
            <li>I actually have an original bottle with a small amount of cologne in it and this new version isn&#x27;t the same scent.  </li>
            <li>Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I consider \\&quot;Minotaur\\&quot; a casual cologne, and enjoy wearing it on the warmer days to accentuate the warmth of the day and encourage myself to explore the possibilities of it.</li>
            <li> The smell is different to any other fragrance.</li>
            <li> I felt that I was deceived, and it made me slow down in buying certain things on internet now.</li>
            <li> It is EXTREMELY close to capturing Minotaure&#x27;s overall scent---though there is a slightly less noticeable evidence of spice.</li>
            <li> He compared the scent of the gift to the scent of the almost empty bottle that he had.</li>
            <li> and you need to smell it a few times in order to even come close to breaking down the different notes in it.</li>
            <li> recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that.</li>
            <li> Nicole Miller for Men, which was released in 1994, comes extremely close to capturing the essence of Minotaure, but, Minotaure is decidedly lighter and less heady.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s old and outdated, but I guess I am too.</li>
            <li> they water it down</li>
            <li> other words, I got ripped off!</li>
            <li> I was in new york and bought 4 units in January to take with me to Brazil .. are fake or are already overdue ..</li>
            <li> Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> this was horrible, and i wasted my money for a very cheap product.</li>
            <li> you are not able to return cologne purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Yet it stands out, its complex</li>
            <li> This is a men&#x27;s fragrance that is subtle and not to overpowering.  </li>
            <li> subtle &amp; the fragrance of bullfighters &amp; brandy.</li>
            <li> Only the Ancients could compose a character so vicious in his bestiality and yet so tragic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wished i bought something from sephora instead of a fake.</li>
            <li> sometimes people fake this cologne</li>
            <li> The bottle and cap are identical, but sadly the scent isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to find however in retail stores.</li>
            <li> So disappointed...  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed. .</li>

            <li> Everything was just as it should be, thank you</li>
            <li> I do not get the product. more than 1 month ago and still know nothing[[ASIN:B000C1ZAKC Minotaure By Paloma Picasso For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 2.5 Ounces]]</li>
            <li> I have had the \\&quot;Minotaur\\&quot; back in 2001 for the 1st time. I bought it because I enjoyed the packaging and the name I was and am fascinated with that half-bull hall-man creature of the Labyrinth. Only the Ancients could compose a character so vicious in his bestiality and yet so tragic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I consider \\&quot;Minotaur\\&quot; a casual cologne, and enjoy wearing it on the warmer days to accentuate the warmth of the day and encourage myself to explore the possibilities of it.</li>
            <li> Just bought this scent. Im only 18 and have tried scents in the mid range price (50-100) i researched scents that are popular and very well reviewed bought this one in the dark and i have to say it is a whole other level above what you can buy for anyone right now. The pony collection and the majority of what you can buy in the malls today dosent stand up to the complex smell of this one, ive just fallen in love with it. Its hard to describe but its light, sweet, mellow. Yet it stands out, its complex and you need to smell it a few times in order to even come close to breaking down the different notes in it. By far one of the most interesting and rewarding scents you can buy today.</li>
            <li> I just received the cologne.  I use to buy it on duty free every time i travel but a few years back never seen it at the shops anymore. And I finally found it.  I just bathe on it.  MMMMMMM</li>
            <li> wonderful coloneand very sheap for the price.</li>
            <li> It smells just as I remember it from decades ago.  Still the most sexy and intoxicating scent for my man!</li>
            <li> This perfume and knew what I had for a while and this I received the smell was not even remotely similar, also had no fixer none</li>
            <li> What can I say? I like this cologne. I know it&#x27;s old and outdated, but I guess I am too. Smells clean and fresh. Masculine. And it&#x27;s mild... not that overpowering sweet nectar that all the post-teenage gigolos like to wear.</li>
            <li> This is a men&#x27;s fragrance that is subtle and not to overpowering.  I have used it for over 15 years.</li>
            <li> I was in new york and bought 4 units in January to take with me to Brazil .. are fake or are already overdue .. I am very disappointed. .</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance, moderate sillage and projection....nice for any occasion</li>
            <li> I dont understand why Paloma Picasso stopped producing this wonderful fragance! If you dont know it, try it, you will love it!</li>
            <li> Smells just like I remember it. Don&#x27;t let the reviews complaining about it not being the real thing dissuade you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the few scents I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t turn super sweet on me after 15 minutes. Patchouli is a bit stronger than I remember, but overall a nice, unique, woodsy, vanilla, orange, patchouli scent that will last for the better part of a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been using this flagrant since 1991 until it is discontinued.  I was happy to be able to acquire it through  amazon, but when I received the products(I made the error of buying several bottles without checking it out first) the flagrant seemed diluted with alcool or whatever, the original smell or flavor was not there and it smelt like alcool. I felt that I was deceived, and it made me slow down in buying certain things on internet now.</li>
            <li> i bought two of these for christmas presents, and they smelled like used water. its not the original perfume so dont get it! its a scam! this was horrible, and i wasted my money for a very cheap product. wished i bought something from sephora instead of a fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Minotaure for years, like to wear it during the cool New England fall weather as it produces a nice warm scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big mama tells me that I smell sexy and spicey (not in a hot harbanero way) but rather in a mild orange wood spice type of way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not over powering and smells very natural. I&#x27;ve been wearing it on and off for about 20 years along with Aramis Devin (Nice in the N.E. Spring) and Chanel Pour Monsieur (Great for the N.E. Summers).</li>
            <li> Very good esence but doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> Quite simply, there is nothing like this cologne.  Having first purchased this cologne in 1993, I have forever been mesmerized by the unique oriental scent.  It starts off sweet with an eye-opening, honey-lemon freshness.  While that initial burst may be alarming to some people, the aromatic warm, amber, sweetness that remains is quite inviting.  Nicole Miller for Men, which was released in 1994, comes extremely close to capturing the essence of Minotaure, but, Minotaure is decidedly lighter and less heady.  While I&#x27;m a fan of both, I must give credit to the original Minotaure, which no doubt inspired the Nicole Miller for Men fragrance.  Perhaps an even closer follow-up to Minotaure came in 1998 with Boss by Hugo Boss. This cologne errs on the side of lemony-sweet freshness and is still widely available.  It is EXTREMELY close to capturing Minotaure&#x27;s overall scent---though there is a slightly less noticeable evidence of spice. It smells right out of the bottle what Minotaure eventually settles into after 5 minutes---if that makes any sense.  My only wish is that there will be enough bottles of this now-discontinued fragrance in the future to last me into my old age:)</li>
            <li> The original smell of Minotaure. This is the greatest perfum for men created ever... Just enjoy it and share with someone so special...</li>
            <li> sometimes people fake this cologne they water it down they add or subtract something/// THIS IS IT. i have used/purchased  Minotaure since it launched. The real one. This is a great great men&#x27;s cologne. subtle &amp; the fragrance of bullfighters &amp; brandy. Ty Paloma!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my dad&#x27;s birthday. He had mentioned that it was no longer available. He was surprised and happy with the gift. I told him that one review said that it did not have the same scent. He compared the scent of the gift to the scent of the almost empty bottle that he had. They both had the same scent.</li>
            <li> Husbands favorite and very hard to find.  Love it!</li>
            <li> All time favorite.I&#x27;ve been wearing this for over twenty years.</li>
            <li> The smell is different to any other fragrance. I like it since it smells good and i haven&#x27;t met anyone using the same cologne an mine.</li>
            <li> This is probably the favorite of all fragrances I have ever used. I have used many and have always had a positive reaction from the opposite sex when I am wearing Minotaure. It is very difficult to find however in retail stores.</li>
            <li> Regardless of how much applied the scent fades within minutes, must be old or just scented water.  Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Minotaure has been my favorite cologne for years, but what I received was not Minotaure!&lt;br /&gt;The contents of this bottle smelled like cheap cologne from a drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;And BEWARE. . .  you are not able to return cologne purchased from Amazon. This is the message I got when I tried to return it:&lt;br /&gt;  -- For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com. Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations. Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, I got ripped off!</li>
            <li> I THINK THIS IS NOT AN ORIGINAL PRODUCT</li>
            <li> excellent product, excellent service</li>
            <li> So disappointed...  I actually have an original bottle with a small amount of cologne in it and this new version isn&#x27;t the same scent.  This was my favorite cologne and I was excited to see it available on Amazon.  Knowing I couldn&#x27;t return it, I compared the bottle and details online with the one I have.  The bottle and cap are identical, but sadly the scent isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It is fake!&lt;br /&gt;Smells like a cheap china counterfeit perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I will make a video to expose these guys.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my partner and this happens to be his all time favorite cologne, been searching forever online and got it on amazon for a great deal</li>
            <li> Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that.</li>
            <li> Its somethings amazing and special about this smell....NOT FOR EVERYBODY.....IN MY OPINION..! :.must be special type of skin to give full essential of it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im lucky.....people cant stop asking me what is it...?!!!</li>
            <li> packaging open, without seals.</li>
            <li> Classic and elegant cologne</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this cologne since I ran out of it in 1998, and I finally found it again. It&#x27;s my favorite cologne. It&#x27;s relaxing.</li>

            <li> I used to use this cologne back in 1998 and 1999. Never had found it until now. I know is discontinued but finally I got it back.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this is still available even. It&#x27;s the best. You can&#x27;t find a better scent than this for a man.</li>
