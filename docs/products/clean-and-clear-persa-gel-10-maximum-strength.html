            <li>a good moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This would be good for parents to know and to enforce a &#x27;hand washing&#x27; rule after use.</li>
            <li>is just as good</li>

            <li>A lot of people say it&#x27;s amazing and good for acne-prone</li>
            <li>im very pleased with this item</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank goodness for my love of amazon and everyone who has used this product and written their reviews!</li>
            <li>I have no oil problems any more!</li>
            <li>For sure!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>when i first used this product, i thought i had found the best acne treatment cream ever made.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a strong prescription (10% benzoyl peroxide) and is very effective, but you need to gradually increase its use (per instructions) to avoid peeling skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice product for skin problems like acne etc..</li>
            <li>If you need to get rid of a zit fast, then this is the best out there, in my experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had three blemishes all around my mouth and they hurt whenever I smiled.</li>
            <li>This product is cheaper, compared to its counter parts, and is just as effective.</li>
            <li>Quite effective too.  </li>
            <li>So I am satisfied with the purchase, because i bought a good product.</li>
            <li>be honest, I don&#x27;t know which product from Amazon improved my skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Don&#x27;t go to the dermatologist if you have acne like mine because this kind of acne cannot be cured with laser or popping.</li>
            <li>, I would recommend that you extract the material somehow using some kind of a pimple extractor tool, and follow that up with this product.</li>
            <li>That area is now healing up nicely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nicely packaged and will replace my prescription acne medicine.</li>
            <li>It is very good and efficient, I recommend it because while it is very gentle on the skin and clothing colorfast.</li>
            <li>(It works quite nice for shrinking those huge non-headed cyst like things :P ), and consequently any skin around where you apply it.</li>
            <li>But be ware of the fact that you need to keep your skin in good condition since all of the impurities are removed and you can rapidly develop acne all over your face as this is strong medicine that stops the outbreak in one section of your face but could come out in another section.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and in great shape.</li>
            <li>so it is very strong.</li>
            <li>product is a superb choice for people who want clear skin.</li>
            <li>I must say that this product is by far the best over-the-counter acne medication that I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>Looked a lot better then before, kind of had a glow to it, and seemed softer.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best and strongest non-prescription acne medication on the market.</li>
            <li>After a month, their skin is 90% clear which is wonderful.</li>
            <li>If you do use it as often as I do, I recommend using a very light moisturizer</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good product: cheap, easy and works.</li>
            <li>When I was younger, it was the best!</li>
            <li>I love C&amp;C&#x27;s products</li>
            <li>I love that this product dries out acne, but doesn&#x27;t make my skin flakey.  </li>
            <li>I love to use this in the morning after cleansing my face.</li>
            <li>and i think if i used it more often</li>
            <li>All around though its great it really reduces redness and breakouts.</li>
            <li>I love the stuff</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for most of my life.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Poly/cotton blends seem to be more resistant to benzoyl peroxide than 100% cotton.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every (pricey) spot treatment under the sun, from Neutrogena to Clarins to DDF, and this product is one of the better ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was not that satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>me proactive is way better</li>
            <li>Overtime though, many people&#x27;s skin gets used to it</li>
            <li>maybe more.</li>
            <li>but I will need to get some more.</li>
            <li>I am glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>Both have done wonderful things for my skin, especially duac.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said my husband was able to use it as directed with no problems.</li>
            <li>I put it on in the evenings and then wipe it off and put more on before bed each night.</li>
            <li>Okay price.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li>and I do feel like my acne has been getting better.</li>
            <li>sure what to rate this..</li>
            <li>Once it healed my skin was surprisingly in better condition.</li>
            <li>I tried several over-the-counter acne treatment and WHILE this worked, it was the best, clearing up my breakouts within a day or two.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was so upset because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would ever</li>
            <li>Glad I got it.</li>
            <li>may be using too many products</li>
            <li>I know a lot of people think putting on sunblock will clog the pores and cause more breakouts, but in reality, the sun will cause even more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will try using the gel on blackheads and post-acne marks as recommended by a reviewer and see if it helps with that, but I have already ordered Buffering Lotion from Mario Badescu in the hopes that it will give better results.</li>
            <li>Keep it away from your eyes as it will sting and be sure to wash your hands after you put in/take out contacts or else</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t begin to tell you how this product has changed my life, as I&#x27;m sure you may know,</li>
            <li>I can wake up feeling confident about going out and about without checking myself in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>Overall, this is an awesome product!</li>
            <li>The gel has more of a lotion consistency.</li>
            <li>just make sure u use a good moisterizer like Dove for sensitive skin because this has no fragrance and is good for the face.</li>
            <li>And make sure u use it like 3 times a day.</li>
            <li>more than that your skin will rash up, itch, flake, and turn dark.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Works much better to keep acne away.</li>
            <li>, then i put on persa gel 10 as the medication, then i put on a cereve moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>tried it agin, but this time on my forehead (where I have the most acne).</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you rub it off or blend it together with your moisturizer to hide it.</li>
            <li>Clean &amp; Clear Persa-Gel 10 is an excellent inexpensive product for oily skin.  </li>
            <li>In the morning, clean it off and apply moisturizer, something with SPF is best, as this medication will make your skin extremely sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li>i have tried many others and this worked pretty good.</li>
            <li>results are nothing short of AMAZING!!</li>
            <li>It does dry you out buy if you&#x27;re oily like me its awesome.  </li>
            <li>Experimental science is great at proving a hypothesis, but don&#x27;t do it to your face--it&#x27;ll leave discoloration scars that linger for months.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use a great moisturizer immediately following the application of the persa-gel and lather that moisturizer on pretty good to avoid dryness.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a lot thicker in consistency than the treatment but works just as well and is readily available at most stores.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Diet, exercise, hormonal balance, digestive system are more important to keep acne away.</li>
            <li>Or just keep in mind when you find that really nice set of colorful sheets at Overstock.</li>
            <li>:  Something else that&#x27;s great:  This product caused old acne scars on my chin to fade very quickly.  </li>
            <li>im even MORE excited about</li>
            <li>so I stopped using it, kind of defeats the whole purpose of an acne cream if it gives you more pimples than you started with.</li>
            <li>The product arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>this product is too strong for you, I would recommend either a salicylic acid or a prescription from a Dermatologist for Clindamycin or Differin.</li>
            <li>I am highly satisfied with this product on every level; it works well, keeping my skin under control without over drying and the price is right!</li>
            <li>It works best if I exfoliate in the shower right before, using a face wash with exfoliating beads such as an apricot scrub.</li>
            <li>Each tube lasts about 6-7 months, it&#x27;s pretty effective and dissolves in your skin without leaving any trace that it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>Cheap and easy</li>
            <li>and you should be fine.</li>
            <li>best way to use it wash your face at night and apply spots of creams where pimples occur or might occur and get up to a reduced and less inflamed pimple</li>
            <li>With a little patience, this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>but I have a feeling this one played a huge role in fighting my acne.</li>
            <li>Use something light, preferably with SPF.  </li>
            <li>I can run my hands along my face and my face feels smooth</li>
            <li>This product works great for people with oily skin (such as me).</li>
            <li>The greatest thing is once my skin was clear I was able to stop using the product on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>The important thing to know is that it is 10% benzoyl peroxide</li>
            <li>free preferably)</li>
            <li>I use it primarily as a preventative</li>
            <li>Skin Gel, Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Stress Control 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment, and THIS product that I am reviewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put this one and wake up in the morning smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ordering some more right now.</li>
            <li>I would much rather have a face covered in acne than go through this again!!!</li>
            <li>When I saw all the good reviews on Clean &amp; Clear Persa-Gel, I knew I had to try it.</li>
            <li>Most of my breakouts were around my jawline and hairline, although no part of my face could really escape it!  </li>
            <li>and I will have to say that I have been very satisfied with it so far.  </li>
            <li>Hot water seems to make the oily sebum in your pores more clogging.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am VERY pleased to say that after about 2 weeks their skin began to clear up.</li>
            <li>Hopefully this holds up over time but so far I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Again, use it on wet skin with a diluted PersaGel and you will be better off because the Gel works just as good and then will not burn at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s your job to keep your face clean and eat healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>People say tea tree oil works, but even when I burned my whole face with it, 10 huge inflamed acne would appear on my forehead and more on my nose bridge and cheeks.</li>
            <li>My skin was bright red in every area I had put the cream, was itchy, and somewhat flaky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, make sure you use a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer as well if your skin is really sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay, so this product seems to really work.</li>
            <li>So we were delighted to find this product here, and for a lesser price than at the drug stores.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty strong.</li>
            <li>If you put too much it does leave some white residue on your face, but the joy of the morning wash takes that</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m older, I find products with tea tree oil work better for me.</li>
            <li>I cleanse with a  mild tea-tree oil based soap, then</li>
            <li>/&gt;#1 Wash your skin in mild shower water.</li>
            <li>Then I remembered that the only thing that worked for me as a teen was benzoyl peroxide, purchased this, and it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>It works quickly too.</li>
            <li>So now I bought a nice set of white sheets and am trying to find a more color fast duvet cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty cheap, so</li>
            <li>10% may be too strong for some skin types, but not for my very oily skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff is very drying!!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re worried about having a reaction, don&#x27;t put it on your face first!</li>
            <li>But the rash was so inflamed and itchy that I got MORE huge red bumps that looked like zits.  </li>
            <li>I rarely review products, but just had to throw out my kudos to this product.  </li>
            <li>(i ordered from here)&lt;br /&gt;and using this clean and clear product since its so strong</li>
            <li>i would have more clear skin.</li>
            <li>I finally concluded my skin was had some kind of allergic reaction to one of the \\&quot;inactive ingredients\\</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since being introduced to this product by a whim from my cousin, i have since introduced it to my own sister who has similar problems to me, who uses it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I may have more sensitive skin than I realize.</li>
            <li>This was easier for him to use than the acne washes and his skin cleared up nicely over the course of a couple of weeks of regular use.</li>
            <li>, I believe, prevents more inflamed acne from appearing and also completely cleanses the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find the best routine is to clean your skin with a mild soap at night and apply a thin layer all over (it really helps prevent).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway I highly recommend this product because it works well, very quickly, and puts your mind at ease about breaking out or pimples.  </li>
            <li>So, I opted for Clean adn Clear, for I hear such good reviews from them.</li>
            <li>still works better than most other stuff I have tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not too harsh on skin, but very effective.</li>
            <li>Get Eucerin Gentle Body Wash and clean your skin.</li>
            <li>I am very excited to finally find a product that can handle my acne breakout quickly without making my skin peal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad Clean &amp; Clear works for a lot of people, but if you have sensitive skin like mine, DO NOT USE THIS!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going make-up free for a few days so that it effectively works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The good news is that Clean &amp; Clear has just come out with the same product as this in a clear gel!!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty strong but not harsh on</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since then I tried using very, very sparingly.</li>
            <li>I like it better than other brands because of the smooth way it dries onto the skin.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t want to have super dry skin which happens to me if I use this product more then once a day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Persagel in general is by far the best thing you can use on your skin if you get white-heads, it helps with black-heads but not nearly as much as the large blemishes.</li>
            <li>It can leave a white film, but this goes away if you put your moisturizer on top of it.  </li>
            <li>did this two more times that day and once extra before going to bed.</li>
            <li>Hope that it will function better later.</li>
            <li>Have cut back to once a day at times as the top layer of skin becomes dry-scaly.  </li>
            <li>but if you are interested in the product, take me seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really thought I&#x27;d messed up my skin, considering it looked like I had tons of beestings or been chewed up!  </li>
            <li>No external application will fight the bacteria better than this.</li>
            <li>and so I don&#x27;t like going out in public with it on, it just draws more atention to the acne.</li>
            <li>most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recomend Zapzyt over this, its basically the same thing, 10% Benzoyl Peroxide, but cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josh</li>
            <li>This combination REALLY works!</li>
            <li>This product has a 10% concentration of benzoyl peroxide, which is a higher percentage anyways.</li>
            <li>works okay for my teen.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t jump feet first into twice a day usage and must follow up with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>First of all, do not goop on the product all over your face.</li>
            <li>The Neutrogena stuff is better and in the same price range.</li>
            <li>It does tend to bleach fabrics, so make sure to wash your hands after use, and you&#x27;ll probably want to have white sheets/pillowcases while using this product.</li>
            <li>Works fast in just like A DAY!</li>
            <li>use it in hot sun death baked weather.</li>
            <li>I go through many different face products and some</li>
            <li>Okay, we all know that some products work while others don&#x27;t in the realm of acne for each individual.</li>
            <li>so you can test them out: Dickinson&#x27;s Original Witch Hazel Pore Perfecting Toner, Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel (Professional), Aloe life</li>
            <li>I will not buy Clean &amp; Clear products again because of this experience.  </li>
            <li>I started using the Olay Pro-X Advanced cleansing system- a rotating scrub brush for the face to exfoliate the dead dry skin which works great in combination with the Clean &amp; Clear.  </li>
            <li>Please I am not just writing this review to trash Clean &amp; Clear.</li>
            <li>I have used this clean and clear persa gel did nothing for me</li>
            <li>It seems clean and clear</li>
            <li>and then the Clean and Clear Persa-Gel 10.</li>
            <li>I wash with clean &amp; clear foaming face wash.</li>
            <li>it seemed like forever clean &amp; clear persa-gel</li>
            <li>Clean &amp; Clear Persa-gel 10</li>
            <li>Thanks Clean &amp; Clear!</li>
            <li>It works really well if used consistently.  </li>
            <li>I lead a very healthy lifestyle and make my living as a yoga instructor and holistic nutritional counselor so having cystic-like acne all over my forehead and cheeks while I&#x27;m trying to be the picture of good health is quite bad for business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But after reading the reviews, I think it is for milder acne/not for super sensitive skin, because it is drying, but it does work.</li>
            <li>NEVER use this more than a couple of times a day as it can seriously dry out your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this for anyone with super sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been bothered with occasionally breakouts and acnes and this product really is a very potent, fragrance-free topical disinfectant for blemishes</li>
            <li>Easily within a short month basically all my acne was gone</li>
            <li>It is not a miracle cure but it will certainly help to reduce the size and severity of existing break outs.</li>
            <li>but sometimes this cream doesnt work on certain place on my face.</li>
            <li>I dunno what it is but its not normal for sure .</li>
            <li>This product is extremely quick acting and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>the active ingredient in Persa-Gel 10) is much more effective than the salicylic acid that is found in a lot of other acne treatments.</li>
            <li>Then once i put it on my forehead for the day and by the end of the day i noticed a huge white spot spread across my forehead.</li>
            <li>But this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I find that putting this on at night really works.</li>
            <li>I called the company immediately on Monday and was told that a nurse would be in touch with me very soon.  </li>
            <li>This is a routine that really works.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day (once in the morning and once before bed) and it has kept my face much clearer than it was.  </li>
            <li>it works really well an works fast to help the problem</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
            <li>is much nastier.</li>
            <li>This product really helps prevent breakouts and it also helps to keep my skin from being shiny by lunch time.</li>
            <li>none of their products have done much for</li>
            <li>Nothing really worked that well.</li>
            <li>I really do believe it is the Persa-Gel that has worked the biggest miracle for my face.</li>
            <li>Works better than expected.</li>
            <li>This cream really helped my daughter.</li>
            <li>Like others have mentioned, it can be very drying to the skin</li>
            <li>It worked very well for that.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s working for me.</li>
            <li>DO NOT put too much because you will irritate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Okay</li>
            <li>I found it very drying.  </li>
            <li>I see many people complaining about it, but you have to be careful on how you use it because it has 10% Benzoyl Peroxide.</li>
            <li>I will use it today now that I am more confident with my skin, so I will definitely write a review on the sunblock in a few days.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t I would have big puss filled zits after a matter of hours.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this works very well to keep it under control.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>He is so much prone for pimples.</li>
            <li>her face was noticeably clearer and any remaining pimples were much smaller.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I put this on before bed and it really helps.</li>
            <li>I caution to not use it too much because it can be drying.</li>
            <li>If you really have a problem I think there is a lower percentage version.</li>
            <li>This tube works very well for acne.</li>
            <li>This concentration can be very drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product sooo much.</li>
            <li>thanks to this i was all cleared up.</li>
            <li>I came across this product after feeling very close to giving up.</li>
            <li>It works extremely fast which is what I have always looked for.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>and my acne seem to be disappearing really fast.</li>
            <li>I have used so many different products to clear up my acne and nothing has worked.</li>
            <li>After a few months (7) it was no longer effective.</li>
            <li>, my good shirts are nearly wasted near the tops of the collars since the bleach from this product rubs onto them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let me first tell you what new products I use</li>
            <li>Clean &amp; Clear makes some great face wash, but this one is a fail.</li>
            <li>This gel works better than either of the two other products and it works fast.</li>
            <li>I started putting just thin layers until the creme is not visible and my skin is getting so much better again!!</li>
            <li>My skin has cleared up more in 2 days than it has in a month of using this other acne kit I bought.</li>
            <li>Persa-Gel is good stuff and goes on nicely, very difficult to detect by sight or odor and definitely works as a good concentration of benzoyl peroxide should.  </li>
            <li>The main ingredient - benzoyl peroxide does its job well, helped a bunch, I would highly recommend !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit lazy and only use it during the day now, but still have really great results.  </li>
            <li>It is rather strong and I do suggest that  you follow the instructions on the package, especially if you have sensitive skin, to \\&quot;ease into it\\&quot;, even if you are tempted to put it on 2-3 times a day at the very beginning.  </li>
            <li>I smear it all over my face nightly, and use Clean and Clears exfoliating scrub in the morning, and regular antibacterial soap in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I first apply Clean &amp; Clear Pera-Gel to my entire face (twice a day) and then immediately after I apply Neutrogena&#x27;s Combination Skin Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>But then in the very spot I had used it would form a massive pimple--not the kind with the head, but the kind that is extremely swollen and huge and hurts (it feels like something is in pain deep under the skin), almost like a large \\&quot;bump\\&quot;...and then after several days pus would come to the surface, and the whole time it would be extremely sore as if I had pinched it though I had not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I used this product specifically before a special event, and when I awoke the next morning</li>
            <li>I developed acne a year ago after I got married and stopped taking the BC pill.  </li>
            <li>First of all I must say that I DO NOT have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Best thing to do for most people, if you feel your stomach is feeling weird, take a pro-biotic bacteria tablet the night before, and get a good poo poo the next morning.</li>
            <li>I have found that if you mix the gel with a little bit of water or even apply the gel straight to your skin out of the shower it works even better.</li>
            <li>&quot; in this particular gel (it is not the benzoyl peroxide).</li>
            <li>all the classic home remedies...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though it is advised that you avoid cloth and material, as i once had a nice blue flannel, now it has pink marks.</li>
            <li>My face is super itchy and this is the 2nd day I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li>it may even be better than those expensive ones you see on t,v, but ok</li>
            <li>This was a nightmare for me and also a surprise, considering I have never in my life had any allergic reaction to anything, either related to Clean &amp; Clear, or anything period!</li>
            <li>product is not sensitive skin friendly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, and try it at night.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I highly recommend you get tested for allergies before using this product</li>
            <li>i believe the problem with this product is the high concentration of benzoil peroxide of 10%.  </li>
            <li>I will buy it again and highly recommend it to people who have oily skin.</li>
            <li>So it largely depends on how sensitive your skin is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The boys may be a little challenged on washing with it twice a day and have more severe acne than the 13yo</li>
            <li>Clean &amp; Clear Persa-Gel 10 is essentially 10% Benzoyl Peroxide cream.  </li>
            <li>I also use the Clean &amp; Clear face wash and moisturizer along with it twice daily.</li>
            <li>If Clean &amp; Clear is able to reach the infected area through oil and dead skin it will work like nothing else currently on the market.</li>
            <li>I have recently developed cystic acne and it has been very debilitating.</li>
            <li>use this all the time and it works really well; it even takes away old hyperpigmentation from acne.</li>
            <li>but normally I go for Clearasil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I remember wanting to see just one review by someone with severe acne like me, not with small pimples that could disappear the next day with good cleansing.</li>
            <li>I starting seeing results right away.</li>
            <li>Persa-gel IMMEDIATELY cleared my breakouts, and has prevented new acne.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 2-3 weeks and have had ZERO new breakouts.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to using benzoyl peroxide, you should probably use it once a day after washing your face.</li>
            <li>With slight forehead acne due to combination oily skin I was hoping to find a quick fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews on this product and the 10% Benzoyl Peroxide ingredient made me confident that this would do the trick.</li>
            <li>It goes on moist, but quickly dries into a mask-like protective layer (to dry out your skin).</li>
            <li>Well, it does clear the skin.. but mainly just by drying out the acne</li>
            <li>My *rash* got progressively worse over the weekend, it turned very bright and got extremely itchy and got bumpy.  </li>
            <li>and first it would dry out the spot really well</li>
            <li>I was not very confident, since I tried many similar products and they never work very well.</li>
            <li>, I advise using moisturizer PRIOR to persa-gel and allowing it to absorb for 5-15 minutes first.  </li>
            <li>I think the key is just being patient and consistent with how you use it to get results.</li>
            <li>My face went from oily to super dry and flaking after using this!</li>
            <li>I am not sure if this is a product for everybody, but it sure helps me when I need it.</li>
            <li>I have worked in pharmacy for 3 years and have seen people spend a lot of money on prescription acne treatments that basically do the same thing but only cost more, especially if you dont have insurance.  </li>
            <li>On top of this, the actual gel is white and is not something you can put on except for at night before bed without looking like you have a bunch of white stuff on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do this twice a day, preferably after a shower as the hot shower will open up your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also since I apply small amounts, I&#x27;m able to avoid the bleaching effects on towels and sheets.</li>
            <li>If you do not rub this product in enough, it will leave a white spot on your face so be sure to properly apply this product.  </li>
            <li>Since I was using it for the first time, I decided to put the gel on specific areas to see if it would make a difference.</li>
            <li>A pretty simple decision.</li>
            <li>Very strong: I applied it at night and the pimple dried up the next day.</li>
            <li>After less than a week of using the product, I have seen a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>regime for facial care consists of CeRave hydrating cleanser, followed by a Clean &amp; Clear 10% benzoyl peroxide wash and then applying facial moisturizer(oil</li>
            <li>We found this product with other Clean &amp; Clear products.</li>
            <li>I went to Target and spoke to a pharmacist that recommended putting Aveeno Positively Radiant daily moisturizer on the area twice per day.  </li>
            <li>The active ingredient in this product (benzol peroxide, or whatever) is stronger than in comparable products, and the clean &amp; clear is cheaper.</li>
            <li>I have tried just about every other product before, and this is the first one that really helped.  </li>
            <li>I would avoid applying to large areas of your face because it creates a lot of peeling the next day.</li>
            <li>I liberally, and yes I mean liberally use it like a face mask and wait a good 15 mins for it to dry up before I go to sleep.</li>
            <li>Dried out my skin a little bit but does stain very easily so be veryyyy carrful!</li>
            <li>If you have dark hair use a clean pillowcase frequently.</li>
            <li>favorite is Panoxyl Aqua Gel, but it is hard to find in the store</li>
            <li>I tried this product, and at first I thought it was working because my skin seemed to clear up a little after the first night.</li>
            <li>with Neutrogena Clear Pore Cleanser/Mask with Clarisonic Brush&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Clear Pore Toner applied with cotton pad</li>
            <li>with Neutrogena Clear Pore Cleanser/Mask with Clarisonic Brush&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Clear Pore Toner applied with cotton pad</li>
            <li>so I understand that my face will not be 100% clear by using any of these skin products.  </li>
            <li>I will try another product that goes on clear and shows improvements for me.</li>
            <li>I tried a 4% prescription body wash that worked well but didn&#x27;t completely clear me.</li>
            <li>For the frist time in 50 years my skin is mostly clear.</li>
            <li>The sunblock I use is Eltamd UV Clear SPF 46.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used everything under the sun to try to clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>I typically use Clean &amp; Clear.</li>
            <li>I use a tiny amount on my face at night, and it really helps to clear up and prevent pimples.</li>
            <li>I decided to stop using it (thankfully) and by Friday morning, when I woke up, my face was really itchy around my mouth and chin and was red</li>
            <li>So your experience with it may vary depending on how old you are.</li>
            <li>I even used this on a small/picked at sore near my hairline that didn&#x27;t seem to improve after a week or two.  </li>
            <li>prefer to use natural products on my skin, but have made an exception for Persa-Gel.  </li>
            <li>(I have sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li>Although completely man - made blends in the carpet have been bleached.</li>
            <li>product WILL bleach your clothes/pillows/make your skin incredibly sensitive to sunlight.</li>
            <li>For sensitive skin users, DON&#x27;T USE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>One downside is that it left the area that I applied it looking much darker and \\&quot;burned\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>but I am reluctant to try anything besides persagel because it has been my old trusty for decades.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After used this every night really helps reduce the breakouts especially during periods.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaned your face and put on toners before application of Persa-Gel.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m just self conscious about my skin</li>
            <li>I also avoid the sensitive areas around my lips, eyes, and ears or they itch/peel.</li>
            <li>then this is the only way to do it, there&#x27;s nothing else will help as much as this stuff.</li>
            <li>The only thing is it is VERY drying.</li>
            <li>You can always use another product for your acne if you have sensitive skin, like me.</li>
            <li>On the nights where I am extra pimply, I simply put a light layer over my affected areas in the evening after I do my facial routine.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It works very well in reducing time pimples are present.  </li>
            <li>My DH has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far, I gotten this product within 3 days.</li>
            <li>so far, 3 kids (18, 16 and 13) have had no results with this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For those with sensitive skin, you might want to try a lower concentration of benzyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>a 13 year old girl</li>
            <li>We have tried EVERYTHING to clear up my twin 13 year old boys skin.</li>
            <li>but I would recommend to someone who didn&#x27;t have sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li>I buy this stuff from wal-mart but all the same it works pretty well, I barely have breakouts when i use this</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do any good and even made it worse!</li>
            <li>WARNINGI had some acne on my lower jaw (from my pillow...) and silly me, I thought it would be a good idea to apply this in the morning before work.  </li>
            <li>This works great on very bad or light acne break outs.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I learned this the hard way: I woke up one morning and had really puffy eyes, but it was well worth it as I didn&#x27;t have pimples anymore!</li>
            <li>first of all i was on birth control for a very long time, i decided to get off of it</li>
            <li>first night I used it I admittedly used a little too much.</li>
            <li>Anyway, my skin is extremely sensitive now due to the rash and all I have been able to use while it heals is Goat&#x27;s Milk Soap which I highly recommend (buy a well-reviewd one on Amazon) to anyone over these harsh synthetic gels.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and it keeps my skin clean.</li>
            <li>Believe you me, the results I have found using the above routine has given me enough confidence to walk around with no shirt on in a locker room and not feel \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; for the first time since I was 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>The huge, tender, deep down under the skin pimples that take FOREVER to get rid</li>
            <li>about 15 minutes later the spot feels tight and itchy, so I have to wash it off, then I go back and put more on, etc. etc.</li>
            <li>and im only 20 yrs old!!</li>
            <li>one last shot before just figuring I&#x27;d live with the panic attacks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin got very itchy and flaky, and then I started getting acne even WORSE until I had huge patches of itchy acne all over my cheeks and jawline.</li>
            <li>I figured if it worked to clear and prevent one pimple, why not try to clear up my entire face.</li>
            <li>My husband even asked me what I had been doing differently as my face is starting to look so much</li>
            <li>I am from germany sorry my english is not so good</li>
            <li>I had a lot of little acne bumps on my forehead, and after coming back from driving for a couple of hours, they were significantly reduced.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It keeps major breakouts away.  </li>
            <li>advice: Clean/exfoliate (soap/chem peel), apply product, let dry, apply CaraVe moisturizer, go to bed with white bedding (have white towels as well), shower right when you get up.</li>
            <li>The Clean &amp; Clear product is really no different than some of the off-brand ones they sell at pharmacies so you might want to save a few dollars and get the generic if you can.</li>
            <li>It took longer for my skin to clear up because I only used it once a day</li>
            <li>only reason i give 4 is because i was hoping for clear gel.  </li>
            <li>Well, I used this on my back, it did help clear it up.</li>
            <li>and it barely itches anymore.  </li>
            <li>Bare Minerals)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My cure was to ride it out, wash only with water, and moisturize with Eucerin Sensitive Skin.</li>
            <li>I bought Clean&amp;Clear Persa-Gel treat adult acne when I get an occasional break out, and find it to work well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 17 year old girl and have oily, asian skin that was covered with inflamed acne and whiteheads.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li>I have had a moderate case of adult acne.</li>
            <li>It is especially convenient now that my daughter has moved out of state for school to have this delivered directly to her.</li>
            <li>Plus it rubs right in clear and very little product</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;ll feel a very tingly sensation, if not even close to a slight burning if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I get this little bumps if I use it more than once every few days.</li>
            <li>and it really dries up anything active and prevents others from forming.</li>
            <li>Suddenly had an adult acne breakout around my t-zone, hadn&#x27;t had acne since a teen, making it about 10 years or so.</li>
            <li>I notice a marked increase in pimples when I neglect to use this product for several days in a row, so it definitely helps.</li>
            <li>After 4 days my skin started getting MANY of the worst kind of pimples.</li>
            <li>The first day or two my skin was a little flakey in some spots, but after that no problems.  </li>
            <li>So, slowly but surely, my face went back to normal and it&#x27;s still recovering from being dried out by Persa-Gel 10.  </li>
            <li>A few months back, I started having breakouts right by my jaw area</li>
            <li>This in turn makes your skin clear in the long run.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;an extra dab of this on and by morning it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t buy these items online, but this was well worth it.</li>
            <li>With less than one month of usage, old acne scars have faded and new breakouts are almost obsolete.</li>
            <li>My skin is tough and oily and I&#x27;ve been looking for a strong peeling product.</li>
            <li>I first started you may experience a little bit of itchiness, but it faded after regular use.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I never really get breaks outs, I was one of those lucky people who never got pimples, I have had little tiny barely noticeable bumps on my chin for about a year now-</li>
            <li>This product worked quickly and did not dry out my skin, unlike other 10% benzoyl peroxide products that usually cause a rash on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>: I stopped using this for awhile and switched to using tea tree oil but the oil made my inflamed acne worse, so I recently switched back to the Clean &amp; Clear Persa-Gel.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin, it is actually a tad dark naturally</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling very smooth and tight, where other brands feel a little greasy.</li>
            <li>You absolutely have to use a moisturizer after applying this otherwise your skin will feel tight and it will be red and burning.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve tried almost every product out there, including prescriptions, and Persagel gave me clear skin in only a few weeks, and has kept it clear for months!</li>
            <li>Whether I used a little too much isn&#x27;t the point it looked</li>
            <li>It has lightened my complexion, gotten rid of some tough acne scars, and my face always feels smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>It took a little while to work on the big ones but it really dries up the pimples.</li>
            <li>A little (2 tiny dots) is sufficient for whole face application and keeps your pimples/black heads/ cystic acne at bay.</li>
            <li>Other zit creams would dry out my skin too much</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a sticky feel or bad smell, so overall a good product that I recommend for anyone to use</li>

            <li> a bright red/ itchy forehead.&lt;br /&gt;BY</li>
            <li> a good moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This would be good for parents to know and to enforce a &#x27;hand washing&#x27; rule after use.</li>
            <li> is just as good</li>
            <li> This product is great and is highly effective.  </li>
            <li> Good presentation.</li>
            <li> Use alot of Vitamin E with out fragrance products like Herbalife Aloe Vera soothing gel works good for the scars.</li>
            <li> wisely, and it will work.</li>
            <li> Good for over night use.</li>

            <li> A lot of people say it&#x27;s amazing and good for acne-prone</li>
            <li> im very pleased with this item</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank goodness for my love of amazon and everyone who has used this product and written their reviews!</li>
            <li> I have no oil problems any more!</li>
            <li> For sure!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> when i first used this product, i thought i had found the best acne treatment cream ever made.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a strong prescription (10% benzoyl peroxide) and is very effective, but you need to gradually increase its use (per instructions) to avoid peeling skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Nice product for skin problems like acne etc..</li>
            <li> If you need to get rid of a zit fast, then this is the best out there, in my experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had three blemishes all around my mouth and they hurt whenever I smiled.</li>
            <li> This product is cheaper, compared to its counter parts, and is just as effective.</li>
            <li> Quite effective too.  </li>
            <li> So I am satisfied with the purchase, because i bought a good product.</li>
            <li> be honest, I don&#x27;t know which product from Amazon improved my skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Don&#x27;t go to the dermatologist if you have acne like mine because this kind of acne cannot be cured with laser or popping.</li>
            <li> , I would recommend that you extract the material somehow using some kind of a pimple extractor tool, and follow that up with this product.</li>
            <li> That area is now healing up nicely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nicely packaged and will replace my prescription acne medicine.</li>
            <li> It is very good and efficient, I recommend it because while it is very gentle on the skin and clothing colorfast.</li>
            <li> (It works quite nice for shrinking those huge non-headed cyst like things :P ), and consequently any skin around where you apply it.</li>
            <li> But be ware of the fact that you need to keep your skin in good condition since all of the impurities are removed and you can rapidly develop acne all over your face as this is strong medicine that stops the outbreak in one section of your face but could come out in another section.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and in great shape.</li>
            <li> so it is very strong.</li>
            <li> product is a superb choice for people who want clear skin.</li>
            <li> I must say that this product is by far the best over-the-counter acne medication that I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Looked a lot better then before, kind of had a glow to it, and seemed softer.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best and strongest non-prescription acne medication on the market.</li>
            <li> After a month, their skin is 90% clear which is wonderful.</li>
            <li> If you do use it as often as I do, I recommend using a very light moisturizer</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product: cheap, easy and works.</li>
            <li> When I was younger, it was the best!</li>
            <li> I love C&amp;C&#x27;s products</li>
            <li> I love that this product dries out acne, but doesn&#x27;t make my skin flakey.  </li>
            <li> I love to use this in the morning after cleansing my face.</li>
            <li> and i think if i used it more often</li>
            <li> All around though its great it really reduces redness and breakouts.</li>
            <li> I love the stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for most of my life.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Poly/cotton blends seem to be more resistant to benzoyl peroxide than 100% cotton.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every (pricey) spot treatment under the sun, from Neutrogena to Clarins to DDF, and this product is one of the better ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was not that satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> me proactive is way better</li>
            <li> Overtime though, many people&#x27;s skin gets used to it</li>
            <li> maybe more.</li>
            <li> but I will need to get some more.</li>
            <li> I am glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> Both have done wonderful things for my skin, especially duac.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said my husband was able to use it as directed with no problems.</li>
            <li> I put it on in the evenings and then wipe it off and put more on before bed each night.</li>
            <li> Okay price.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li> and I do feel like my acne has been getting better.</li>
            <li> sure what to rate this..</li>
            <li> Once it healed my skin was surprisingly in better condition.</li>
            <li> I tried several over-the-counter acne treatment and WHILE this worked, it was the best, clearing up my breakouts within a day or two.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was so upset because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would ever</li>
            <li> Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> may be using too many products</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people think putting on sunblock will clog the pores and cause more breakouts, but in reality, the sun will cause even more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will try using the gel on blackheads and post-acne marks as recommended by a reviewer and see if it helps with that, but I have already ordered Buffering Lotion from Mario Badescu in the hopes that it will give better results.</li>
            <li> Keep it away from your eyes as it will sting and be sure to wash your hands after you put in/take out contacts or else</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t begin to tell you how this product has changed my life, as I&#x27;m sure you may know,</li>
            <li> I can wake up feeling confident about going out and about without checking myself in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> Overall, this is an awesome product!</li>
            <li> The gel has more of a lotion consistency.</li>
            <li> just make sure u use a good moisterizer like Dove for sensitive skin because this has no fragrance and is good for the face.</li>
            <li> And make sure u use it like 3 times a day.</li>
            <li> more than that your skin will rash up, itch, flake, and turn dark.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Works much better to keep acne away.</li>
            <li> , then i put on persa gel 10 as the medication, then i put on a cereve moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> tried it agin, but this time on my forehead (where I have the most acne).</li>
            <li> i love this product.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you rub it off or blend it together with your moisturizer to hide it.</li>
            <li> Clean &amp; Clear Persa-Gel 10 is an excellent inexpensive product for oily skin.  </li>
            <li> In the morning, clean it off and apply moisturizer, something with SPF is best, as this medication will make your skin extremely sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li> i have tried many others and this worked pretty good.</li>
            <li> results are nothing short of AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> It does dry you out buy if you&#x27;re oily like me its awesome.  </li>
            <li> Experimental science is great at proving a hypothesis, but don&#x27;t do it to your face--it&#x27;ll leave discoloration scars that linger for months.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use a great moisturizer immediately following the application of the persa-gel and lather that moisturizer on pretty good to avoid dryness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a lot thicker in consistency than the treatment but works just as well and is readily available at most stores.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Diet, exercise, hormonal balance, digestive system are more important to keep acne away.</li>
            <li> Or just keep in mind when you find that really nice set of colorful sheets at Overstock.</li>
            <li> :  Something else that&#x27;s great:  This product caused old acne scars on my chin to fade very quickly.  </li>
            <li> im even MORE excited about</li>
            <li> so I stopped using it, kind of defeats the whole purpose of an acne cream if it gives you more pimples than you started with.</li>
            <li> The product arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> this product is too strong for you, I would recommend either a salicylic acid or a prescription from a Dermatologist for Clindamycin or Differin.</li>
            <li> I am highly satisfied with this product on every level; it works well, keeping my skin under control without over drying and the price is right!</li>
            <li> It works best if I exfoliate in the shower right before, using a face wash with exfoliating beads such as an apricot scrub.</li>
            <li> Each tube lasts about 6-7 months, it&#x27;s pretty effective and dissolves in your skin without leaving any trace that it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> Cheap and easy</li>
            <li> and you should be fine.</li>
            <li> best way to use it wash your face at night and apply spots of creams where pimples occur or might occur and get up to a reduced and less inflamed pimple</li>
            <li> With a little patience, this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> but I have a feeling this one played a huge role in fighting my acne.</li>
            <li> Use something light, preferably with SPF.  </li>
            <li> I can run my hands along my face and my face feels smooth</li>
            <li> This product works great for people with oily skin (such as me).</li>
            <li> The greatest thing is once my skin was clear I was able to stop using the product on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> The important thing to know is that it is 10% benzoyl peroxide</li>
            <li> free preferably)</li>
            <li> I use it primarily as a preventative</li>
            <li> Skin Gel, Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Stress Control 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment, and THIS product that I am reviewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put this one and wake up in the morning smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ordering some more right now.</li>
            <li> I would much rather have a face covered in acne than go through this again!!!</li>
            <li> When I saw all the good reviews on Clean &amp; Clear Persa-Gel, I knew I had to try it.</li>
            <li> Most of my breakouts were around my jawline and hairline, although no part of my face could really escape it!  </li>
            <li> and I will have to say that I have been very satisfied with it so far.  </li>
            <li> Hot water seems to make the oily sebum in your pores more clogging.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am VERY pleased to say that after about 2 weeks their skin began to clear up.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this holds up over time but so far I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Again, use it on wet skin with a diluted PersaGel and you will be better off because the Gel works just as good and then will not burn at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s your job to keep your face clean and eat healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> People say tea tree oil works, but even when I burned my whole face with it, 10 huge inflamed acne would appear on my forehead and more on my nose bridge and cheeks.</li>
            <li> My skin was bright red in every area I had put the cream, was itchy, and somewhat flaky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, make sure you use a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer as well if your skin is really sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Okay, so this product seems to really work.</li>
            <li> So we were delighted to find this product here, and for a lesser price than at the drug stores.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty strong.</li>
            <li> If you put too much it does leave some white residue on your face, but the joy of the morning wash takes that</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m older, I find products with tea tree oil work better for me.</li>
            <li> I cleanse with a  mild tea-tree oil based soap, then</li>
            <li> /&gt;#1 Wash your skin in mild shower water.</li>
            <li> Then I remembered that the only thing that worked for me as a teen was benzoyl peroxide, purchased this, and it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> It works quickly too.</li>
            <li> So now I bought a nice set of white sheets and am trying to find a more color fast duvet cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty cheap, so</li>
            <li> 10% may be too strong for some skin types, but not for my very oily skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very drying!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re worried about having a reaction, don&#x27;t put it on your face first!</li>
            <li> But the rash was so inflamed and itchy that I got MORE huge red bumps that looked like zits.  </li>
            <li> I rarely review products, but just had to throw out my kudos to this product.  </li>
            <li> (i ordered from here)&lt;br /&gt;and using this clean and clear product since its so strong</li>
            <li> i would have more clear skin.</li>
            <li> I finally concluded my skin was had some kind of allergic reaction to one of the \\&quot;inactive ingredients\\</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since being introduced to this product by a whim from my cousin, i have since introduced it to my own sister who has similar problems to me, who uses it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I may have more sensitive skin than I realize.</li>
            <li> This was easier for him to use than the acne washes and his skin cleared up nicely over the course of a couple of weeks of regular use.</li>
            <li> , I believe, prevents more inflamed acne from appearing and also completely cleanses the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find the best routine is to clean your skin with a mild soap at night and apply a thin layer all over (it really helps prevent).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway I highly recommend this product because it works well, very quickly, and puts your mind at ease about breaking out or pimples.  </li>
            <li> So, I opted for Clean adn Clear, for I hear such good reviews from them.</li>
            <li> still works better than most other stuff I have tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too harsh on skin, but very effective.</li>
            <li> Get Eucerin Gentle Body Wash and clean your skin.</li>
            <li> I am very excited to finally find a product that can handle my acne breakout quickly without making my skin peal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad Clean &amp; Clear works for a lot of people, but if you have sensitive skin like mine, DO NOT USE THIS!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going make-up free for a few days so that it effectively works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The good news is that Clean &amp; Clear has just come out with the same product as this in a clear gel!!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty strong but not harsh on</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since then I tried using very, very sparingly.</li>
            <li> I like it better than other brands because of the smooth way it dries onto the skin.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t want to have super dry skin which happens to me if I use this product more then once a day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Persagel in general is by far the best thing you can use on your skin if you get white-heads, it helps with black-heads but not nearly as much as the large blemishes.</li>
            <li> It can leave a white film, but this goes away if you put your moisturizer on top of it.  </li>
            <li> did this two more times that day and once extra before going to bed.</li>
            <li> Hope that it will function better later.</li>
            <li> Have cut back to once a day at times as the top layer of skin becomes dry-scaly.  </li>
            <li> but if you are interested in the product, take me seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really thought I&#x27;d messed up my skin, considering it looked like I had tons of beestings or been chewed up!  </li>
            <li> No external application will fight the bacteria better than this.</li>
            <li> and so I don&#x27;t like going out in public with it on, it just draws more atention to the acne.</li>
            <li> most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recomend Zapzyt over this, its basically the same thing, 10% Benzoyl Peroxide, but cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josh</li>
            <li> This combination REALLY works!</li>
            <li> This product has a 10% concentration of benzoyl peroxide, which is a higher percentage anyways.</li>
            <li> works okay for my teen.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t jump feet first into twice a day usage and must follow up with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> First of all, do not goop on the product all over your face.</li>
            <li> The Neutrogena stuff is better and in the same price range.</li>
            <li> It does tend to bleach fabrics, so make sure to wash your hands after use, and you&#x27;ll probably want to have white sheets/pillowcases while using this product.</li>
            <li> Works fast in just like A DAY!</li>
            <li> use it in hot sun death baked weather.</li>
            <li> I go through many different face products and some</li>
            <li> Okay, we all know that some products work while others don&#x27;t in the realm of acne for each individual.</li>
            <li> so you can test them out: Dickinson&#x27;s Original Witch Hazel Pore Perfecting Toner, Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel (Professional), Aloe life</li>
            <li> I will not buy Clean &amp; Clear products again because of this experience.  </li>
            <li> I started using the Olay Pro-X Advanced cleansing system- a rotating scrub brush for the face to exfoliate the dead dry skin which works great in combination with the Clean &amp; Clear.  </li>
            <li> Please I am not just writing this review to trash Clean &amp; Clear.</li>
            <li> I have used this clean and clear persa gel did nothing for me</li>
            <li> It seems clean and clear</li>
            <li> and then the Clean and Clear Persa-Gel 10.</li>
            <li> I wash with clean &amp; clear foaming face wash.</li>
            <li> it seemed like forever clean &amp; clear persa-gel</li>
            <li> Clean &amp; Clear Persa-gel 10</li>
            <li> Thanks Clean &amp; Clear!</li>
            <li> It works really well if used consistently.  </li>
            <li> I lead a very healthy lifestyle and make my living as a yoga instructor and holistic nutritional counselor so having cystic-like acne all over my forehead and cheeks while I&#x27;m trying to be the picture of good health is quite bad for business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But after reading the reviews, I think it is for milder acne/not for super sensitive skin, because it is drying, but it does work.</li>
            <li> NEVER use this more than a couple of times a day as it can seriously dry out your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this for anyone with super sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been bothered with occasionally breakouts and acnes and this product really is a very potent, fragrance-free topical disinfectant for blemishes</li>
            <li> Easily within a short month basically all my acne was gone</li>
            <li> It is not a miracle cure but it will certainly help to reduce the size and severity of existing break outs.</li>
            <li> but sometimes this cream doesnt work on certain place on my face.</li>
            <li> I dunno what it is but its not normal for sure .</li>
            <li> This product is extremely quick acting and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> the active ingredient in Persa-Gel 10) is much more effective than the salicylic acid that is found in a lot of other acne treatments.</li>
            <li> Then once i put it on my forehead for the day and by the end of the day i noticed a huge white spot spread across my forehead.</li>
            <li> But this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I find that putting this on at night really works.</li>
            <li> I called the company immediately on Monday and was told that a nurse would be in touch with me very soon.  </li>
            <li> This is a routine that really works.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day (once in the morning and once before bed) and it has kept my face much clearer than it was.  </li>
            <li> it works really well an works fast to help the problem</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
            <li> is much nastier.</li>
            <li> This product really helps prevent breakouts and it also helps to keep my skin from being shiny by lunch time.</li>
            <li> none of their products have done much for</li>
            <li> Nothing really worked that well.</li>
            <li> I really do believe it is the Persa-Gel that has worked the biggest miracle for my face.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected.</li>
            <li> This cream really helped my daughter.</li>
            <li> Like others have mentioned, it can be very drying to the skin</li>
            <li> It worked very well for that.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s working for me.</li>
            <li> DO NOT put too much because you will irritate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Okay</li>
            <li> I found it very drying.  </li>
            <li> I see many people complaining about it, but you have to be careful on how you use it because it has 10% Benzoyl Peroxide.</li>
            <li> I will use it today now that I am more confident with my skin, so I will definitely write a review on the sunblock in a few days.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t I would have big puss filled zits after a matter of hours.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this works very well to keep it under control.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> He is so much prone for pimples.</li>
            <li> her face was noticeably clearer and any remaining pimples were much smaller.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I put this on before bed and it really helps.</li>
            <li> I caution to not use it too much because it can be drying.</li>
            <li> If you really have a problem I think there is a lower percentage version.</li>
            <li> This tube works very well for acne.</li>
            <li> This concentration can be very drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product sooo much.</li>
            <li> thanks to this i was all cleared up.</li>
            <li> I came across this product after feeling very close to giving up.</li>
            <li> It works extremely fast which is what I have always looked for.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> and my acne seem to be disappearing really fast.</li>
            <li> I have used so many different products to clear up my acne and nothing has worked.</li>
            <li> After a few months (7) it was no longer effective.</li>
            <li> , my good shirts are nearly wasted near the tops of the collars since the bleach from this product rubs onto them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let me first tell you what new products I use</li>
            <li> Clean &amp; Clear makes some great face wash, but this one is a fail.</li>
            <li> This gel works better than either of the two other products and it works fast.</li>
            <li> I started putting just thin layers until the creme is not visible and my skin is getting so much better again!!</li>
            <li> My skin has cleared up more in 2 days than it has in a month of using this other acne kit I bought.</li>
            <li> Persa-Gel is good stuff and goes on nicely, very difficult to detect by sight or odor and definitely works as a good concentration of benzoyl peroxide should.  </li>
            <li> The main ingredient - benzoyl peroxide does its job well, helped a bunch, I would highly recommend !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit lazy and only use it during the day now, but still have really great results.  </li>
            <li> It is rather strong and I do suggest that  you follow the instructions on the package, especially if you have sensitive skin, to \\&quot;ease into it\\&quot;, even if you are tempted to put it on 2-3 times a day at the very beginning.  </li>
            <li> I smear it all over my face nightly, and use Clean and Clears exfoliating scrub in the morning, and regular antibacterial soap in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I first apply Clean &amp; Clear Pera-Gel to my entire face (twice a day) and then immediately after I apply Neutrogena&#x27;s Combination Skin Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> But then in the very spot I had used it would form a massive pimple--not the kind with the head, but the kind that is extremely swollen and huge and hurts (it feels like something is in pain deep under the skin), almost like a large \\&quot;bump\\&quot;...and then after several days pus would come to the surface, and the whole time it would be extremely sore as if I had pinched it though I had not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used this product specifically before a special event, and when I awoke the next morning</li>
            <li> I developed acne a year ago after I got married and stopped taking the BC pill.  </li>
            <li> First of all I must say that I DO NOT have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Best thing to do for most people, if you feel your stomach is feeling weird, take a pro-biotic bacteria tablet the night before, and get a good poo poo the next morning.</li>
            <li> I have found that if you mix the gel with a little bit of water or even apply the gel straight to your skin out of the shower it works even better.</li>
            <li> &quot; in this particular gel (it is not the benzoyl peroxide).</li>
            <li> all the classic home remedies...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though it is advised that you avoid cloth and material, as i once had a nice blue flannel, now it has pink marks.</li>
            <li> My face is super itchy and this is the 2nd day I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> it may even be better than those expensive ones you see on t,v, but ok</li>
            <li> This was a nightmare for me and also a surprise, considering I have never in my life had any allergic reaction to anything, either related to Clean &amp; Clear, or anything period!</li>
            <li> product is not sensitive skin friendly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, and try it at night.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I highly recommend you get tested for allergies before using this product</li>
            <li> i believe the problem with this product is the high concentration of benzoil peroxide of 10%.  </li>
            <li> I will buy it again and highly recommend it to people who have oily skin.</li>
            <li> So it largely depends on how sensitive your skin is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The boys may be a little challenged on washing with it twice a day and have more severe acne than the 13yo</li>
            <li> Clean &amp; Clear Persa-Gel 10 is essentially 10% Benzoyl Peroxide cream.  </li>
            <li> I also use the Clean &amp; Clear face wash and moisturizer along with it twice daily.</li>
            <li> If Clean &amp; Clear is able to reach the infected area through oil and dead skin it will work like nothing else currently on the market.</li>
            <li> I have recently developed cystic acne and it has been very debilitating.</li>
            <li> use this all the time and it works really well; it even takes away old hyperpigmentation from acne.</li>
            <li> but normally I go for Clearasil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I remember wanting to see just one review by someone with severe acne like me, not with small pimples that could disappear the next day with good cleansing.</li>
            <li> I starting seeing results right away.</li>
            <li> Persa-gel IMMEDIATELY cleared my breakouts, and has prevented new acne.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2-3 weeks and have had ZERO new breakouts.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to using benzoyl peroxide, you should probably use it once a day after washing your face.</li>
            <li> With slight forehead acne due to combination oily skin I was hoping to find a quick fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews on this product and the 10% Benzoyl Peroxide ingredient made me confident that this would do the trick.</li>
            <li> It goes on moist, but quickly dries into a mask-like protective layer (to dry out your skin).</li>
            <li> Well, it does clear the skin.. but mainly just by drying out the acne</li>
            <li> My *rash* got progressively worse over the weekend, it turned very bright and got extremely itchy and got bumpy.  </li>
            <li> and first it would dry out the spot really well</li>
            <li> I was not very confident, since I tried many similar products and they never work very well.</li>
            <li> , I advise using moisturizer PRIOR to persa-gel and allowing it to absorb for 5-15 minutes first.  </li>
            <li> I think the key is just being patient and consistent with how you use it to get results.</li>
            <li> My face went from oily to super dry and flaking after using this!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is a product for everybody, but it sure helps me when I need it.</li>
            <li> I have worked in pharmacy for 3 years and have seen people spend a lot of money on prescription acne treatments that basically do the same thing but only cost more, especially if you dont have insurance.  </li>
            <li> On top of this, the actual gel is white and is not something you can put on except for at night before bed without looking like you have a bunch of white stuff on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do this twice a day, preferably after a shower as the hot shower will open up your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also since I apply small amounts, I&#x27;m able to avoid the bleaching effects on towels and sheets.</li>
            <li> If you do not rub this product in enough, it will leave a white spot on your face so be sure to properly apply this product.  </li>
            <li> Since I was using it for the first time, I decided to put the gel on specific areas to see if it would make a difference.</li>
            <li> A pretty simple decision.</li>
            <li> Very strong: I applied it at night and the pimple dried up the next day.</li>
            <li> After less than a week of using the product, I have seen a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> regime for facial care consists of CeRave hydrating cleanser, followed by a Clean &amp; Clear 10% benzoyl peroxide wash and then applying facial moisturizer(oil</li>
            <li> We found this product with other Clean &amp; Clear products.</li>
            <li> I went to Target and spoke to a pharmacist that recommended putting Aveeno Positively Radiant daily moisturizer on the area twice per day.  </li>
            <li> The active ingredient in this product (benzol peroxide, or whatever) is stronger than in comparable products, and the clean &amp; clear is cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every other product before, and this is the first one that really helped.  </li>
            <li> I would avoid applying to large areas of your face because it creates a lot of peeling the next day.</li>
            <li> I liberally, and yes I mean liberally use it like a face mask and wait a good 15 mins for it to dry up before I go to sleep.</li>
            <li> Dried out my skin a little bit but does stain very easily so be veryyyy carrful!</li>
            <li> If you have dark hair use a clean pillowcase frequently.</li>
            <li> favorite is Panoxyl Aqua Gel, but it is hard to find in the store</li>
            <li> I tried this product, and at first I thought it was working because my skin seemed to clear up a little after the first night.</li>
            <li> with Neutrogena Clear Pore Cleanser/Mask with Clarisonic Brush&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Clear Pore Toner applied with cotton pad</li>
            <li> with Neutrogena Clear Pore Cleanser/Mask with Clarisonic Brush&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Clear Pore Toner applied with cotton pad</li>
            <li> so I understand that my face will not be 100% clear by using any of these skin products.  </li>
            <li> I will try another product that goes on clear and shows improvements for me.</li>
            <li> I tried a 4% prescription body wash that worked well but didn&#x27;t completely clear me.</li>
            <li> For the frist time in 50 years my skin is mostly clear.</li>
            <li> The sunblock I use is Eltamd UV Clear SPF 46.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used everything under the sun to try to clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> I typically use Clean &amp; Clear.</li>
            <li> I use a tiny amount on my face at night, and it really helps to clear up and prevent pimples.</li>
            <li> I decided to stop using it (thankfully) and by Friday morning, when I woke up, my face was really itchy around my mouth and chin and was red</li>
            <li> So your experience with it may vary depending on how old you are.</li>
            <li> I even used this on a small/picked at sore near my hairline that didn&#x27;t seem to improve after a week or two.  </li>
            <li> prefer to use natural products on my skin, but have made an exception for Persa-Gel.  </li>
            <li> (I have sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li> Although completely man - made blends in the carpet have been bleached.</li>
            <li> product WILL bleach your clothes/pillows/make your skin incredibly sensitive to sunlight.</li>
            <li> For sensitive skin users, DON&#x27;T USE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> One downside is that it left the area that I applied it looking much darker and \\&quot;burned\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> but I am reluctant to try anything besides persagel because it has been my old trusty for decades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After used this every night really helps reduce the breakouts especially during periods.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaned your face and put on toners before application of Persa-Gel.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m just self conscious about my skin</li>
            <li> I also avoid the sensitive areas around my lips, eyes, and ears or they itch/peel.</li>
            <li> then this is the only way to do it, there&#x27;s nothing else will help as much as this stuff.</li>
            <li> The only thing is it is VERY drying.</li>
            <li> You can always use another product for your acne if you have sensitive skin, like me.</li>
            <li> On the nights where I am extra pimply, I simply put a light layer over my affected areas in the evening after I do my facial routine.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It works very well in reducing time pimples are present.  </li>
            <li> My DH has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far, I gotten this product within 3 days.</li>
            <li> so far, 3 kids (18, 16 and 13) have had no results with this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;For those with sensitive skin, you might want to try a lower concentration of benzyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> a 13 year old girl</li>
            <li> We have tried EVERYTHING to clear up my twin 13 year old boys skin.</li>
            <li> but I would recommend to someone who didn&#x27;t have sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> I buy this stuff from wal-mart but all the same it works pretty well, I barely have breakouts when i use this</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do any good and even made it worse!</li>
            <li> WARNINGI had some acne on my lower jaw (from my pillow...) and silly me, I thought it would be a good idea to apply this in the morning before work.  </li>
            <li> This works great on very bad or light acne break outs.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I learned this the hard way: I woke up one morning and had really puffy eyes, but it was well worth it as I didn&#x27;t have pimples anymore!</li>
            <li> first of all i was on birth control for a very long time, i decided to get off of it</li>
            <li> first night I used it I admittedly used a little too much.</li>
            <li> Anyway, my skin is extremely sensitive now due to the rash and all I have been able to use while it heals is Goat&#x27;s Milk Soap which I highly recommend (buy a well-reviewd one on Amazon) to anyone over these harsh synthetic gels.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it keeps my skin clean.</li>
            <li> Believe you me, the results I have found using the above routine has given me enough confidence to walk around with no shirt on in a locker room and not feel \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; for the first time since I was 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> The huge, tender, deep down under the skin pimples that take FOREVER to get rid</li>
            <li> about 15 minutes later the spot feels tight and itchy, so I have to wash it off, then I go back and put more on, etc. etc.</li>
            <li> and im only 20 yrs old!!</li>
            <li> one last shot before just figuring I&#x27;d live with the panic attacks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin got very itchy and flaky, and then I started getting acne even WORSE until I had huge patches of itchy acne all over my cheeks and jawline.</li>
            <li> I figured if it worked to clear and prevent one pimple, why not try to clear up my entire face.</li>
            <li> My husband even asked me what I had been doing differently as my face is starting to look so much</li>
            <li> I am from germany sorry my english is not so good</li>
            <li> I had a lot of little acne bumps on my forehead, and after coming back from driving for a couple of hours, they were significantly reduced.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It keeps major breakouts away.  </li>
            <li> advice: Clean/exfoliate (soap/chem peel), apply product, let dry, apply CaraVe moisturizer, go to bed with white bedding (have white towels as well), shower right when you get up.</li>
            <li> The Clean &amp; Clear product is really no different than some of the off-brand ones they sell at pharmacies so you might want to save a few dollars and get the generic if you can.</li>
            <li> It took longer for my skin to clear up because I only used it once a day</li>
            <li> only reason i give 4 is because i was hoping for clear gel.  </li>
            <li> Well, I used this on my back, it did help clear it up.</li>
            <li> and it barely itches anymore.  </li>
            <li> Bare Minerals)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My cure was to ride it out, wash only with water, and moisturize with Eucerin Sensitive Skin.</li>
            <li> I bought Clean&amp;Clear Persa-Gel treat adult acne when I get an occasional break out, and find it to work well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 17 year old girl and have oily, asian skin that was covered with inflamed acne and whiteheads.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li> I have had a moderate case of adult acne.</li>
            <li> It is especially convenient now that my daughter has moved out of state for school to have this delivered directly to her.</li>
            <li> Plus it rubs right in clear and very little product</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;ll feel a very tingly sensation, if not even close to a slight burning if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I get this little bumps if I use it more than once every few days.</li>
            <li> and it really dries up anything active and prevents others from forming.</li>
            <li> Suddenly had an adult acne breakout around my t-zone, hadn&#x27;t had acne since a teen, making it about 10 years or so.</li>
            <li> I notice a marked increase in pimples when I neglect to use this product for several days in a row, so it definitely helps.</li>
            <li> After 4 days my skin started getting MANY of the worst kind of pimples.</li>
            <li> The first day or two my skin was a little flakey in some spots, but after that no problems.  </li>
            <li> So, slowly but surely, my face went back to normal and it&#x27;s still recovering from being dried out by Persa-Gel 10.  </li>
            <li> A few months back, I started having breakouts right by my jaw area</li>
            <li> This in turn makes your skin clear in the long run.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;an extra dab of this on and by morning it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t buy these items online, but this was well worth it.</li>
            <li> With less than one month of usage, old acne scars have faded and new breakouts are almost obsolete.</li>
            <li> My skin is tough and oily and I&#x27;ve been looking for a strong peeling product.</li>
            <li> I first started you may experience a little bit of itchiness, but it faded after regular use.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I never really get breaks outs, I was one of those lucky people who never got pimples, I have had little tiny barely noticeable bumps on my chin for about a year now-</li>
            <li> This product worked quickly and did not dry out my skin, unlike other 10% benzoyl peroxide products that usually cause a rash on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> : I stopped using this for awhile and switched to using tea tree oil but the oil made my inflamed acne worse, so I recently switched back to the Clean &amp; Clear Persa-Gel.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin, it is actually a tad dark naturally</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling very smooth and tight, where other brands feel a little greasy.</li>
            <li> You absolutely have to use a moisturizer after applying this otherwise your skin will feel tight and it will be red and burning.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve tried almost every product out there, including prescriptions, and Persagel gave me clear skin in only a few weeks, and has kept it clear for months!</li>
            <li> Whether I used a little too much isn&#x27;t the point it looked</li>
            <li> It has lightened my complexion, gotten rid of some tough acne scars, and my face always feels smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> It took a little while to work on the big ones but it really dries up the pimples.</li>
            <li> A little (2 tiny dots) is sufficient for whole face application and keeps your pimples/black heads/ cystic acne at bay.</li>
            <li> Other zit creams would dry out my skin too much</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a sticky feel or bad smell, so overall a good product that I recommend for anyone to use</li>
            <li> Right now, all that&#x27;s left is tiny spots and dry skin and itch very little, but the marks are gone.</li>
            <li> If I get particularly flaky in spots, a little medical tape works well to pull it off.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s M.O. is to dry out the pimple and all surrounding skin until it&#x27;s so dry</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m surprised it works well as it does, and i used other products with benzo peroxide 2.5% that worked well and realized this is 10%</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as chalky as it used to be in the past, so a thin, effective layer can be worn discretely beneath or above foundation or with moisturizer.</li>
            <li> being self-conscious about your acne can ruin or make your feel depressed in your daily life; I haven&#x27;t worried the past 5 months thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> I try not to use it in large amounts, I usually apply a dab to my palm and use a q-tip to apply to the pimple.</li>
            <li> i have severley dry skin and using this only made my skin peel and burn..</li>
            <li> My face was dry and taut and felt coarse to the touch.</li>
            <li> last thing, If you have acne and wash your face a lot- remember to not use a wash cloth but instead use a paper towel to dry your face.</li>
            <li> Even though it makes my skin red and dry, the pimples go away.</li>
            <li> and I decided to go back on Doxy, filled the expensive prescription, and went to a store and picked up this persa-gel.</li>
            <li> What I do is put a big glob on the pimple and then wait for it to dry</li>
            <li> I put this product on the acne on my back, let it dry and fell asleep for an overnight treatment.</li>
            <li> But... after months and months of using it, my skin just got immune to the strong chemicals.. and sadly to say, it does not work for me at all anymore.</li>
            <li> It performs the same as prescription Benzaclin (and other prescription-only acne medications), but at an obvious fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it four stars is because I&#x27;m not seeing instant impact on existing acne as other reviewers did.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old daughter had a little bit on acne on her nose and forehead.  </li>
            <li> Recently I ruined a new set of expensive sheets and pillow cases, and left a bleached spot on my new comforter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have major acne, but a few spots on my complexion that produce a cluster of pimples occasionally, so I got this stuff to spot-treat it.</li>
            <li> I was placed on hold for a long time and ended up hanging up.  </li>
            <li> It does make my skin peel a tad, and it will probably do the same to you, so be careful not to overuse.  </li>
            <li> the only downfall of this cream that it WILL bleach any clothes it touches, including towels, your shirt, etc so be careful.</li>
            <li> it peeled the whiteheads without me having to pop them or have them for a long time.</li>
            <li> and this product does not clear it.</li>
            <li> Apparently this works for other people, but be careful.</li>
            <li> You will only end up with a red, bloody face and with more acne the next day.&lt;br /&gt;-Always</li>
            <li> I have tried two days, till now no big difference between this product and other product which I tried before.</li>
            <li> other people have mentioned this product does say that it is a gel, but in fact is a white cream and does leave some residue on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I recently ran out of my acne.org gel, and had to use this while I waited for my other shipment to come in.</li>
            <li> now there are only two visible little red zits left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> face or make it red like other products.</li>
            <li> If it gets your skin too irritated, just use it for your pimples only, don&#x27;t rub it around any other area of your face.</li>
            <li> This makes your skin dry (and I have oily skin), so get</li>
            <li> and it IMMEDIATELY began to dry up and heal.  </li>
            <li> I have to say makes your face REALLy dry, but all my acne is gone after 02 weeks using it - before bed time</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t over dry your skin.</li>
            <li> I know some of you with acne and oily skin have the feeling that your skin is oily then after a shower with acne body washes you feel like you have dry</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and clears up any acne I have have in a matter of days.</li>
            <li> dont buy if you have dry skin</li>
            <li> I also let it dry out before going to bed not to leave marks on the pillow</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t dry out&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> My skin was so dry that when makeup covered the area it looked cake-y.  </li>
            <li> helps dry them up.  </li>
            <li> , your skin may dry out.</li>
            <li> face isn&#x27;t irritated but it does seem to make my lips feel dry if I get it too close.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to peel or dry out, but my skin is somewhat oily to begin with.</li>
            <li> (I tend to put the benzoyl on as a final thing after the evening shower while at the bath room sink and in the past I generally haven&#x27;t washed off the residual on my fingers.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously on larger scale break outs, it takes a few days but the results are actually visable as swelling and redness goes</li>
            <li> I put this on a cluster or pimples or even one that is already white and by the next day its completely dried up and on its way to disappearing .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some very expensive stuff for dark circles that wasn&#x27;t as effective as this stuff.</li>
            <li> even redused old scar marks and even excessive oily</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to sleep on any other color pillow case but a white one.</li>
            <li> After all that, I apply a thin layer of Persa-Gel all over my skin adding a bit extra to the more severely broken out areas.  </li>
            <li> A few people here said it left those big sore pimples that you can never really pop.</li>
            <li> just goes back down.</li>
            <li> I am not switching back to any other treatment again!</li>
            <li> I used this product only twice and the skin became really really dry!!!!</li>
            <li> and I just want it gone) and less than 48 hours later the rash and redness is going away</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter if it is wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bleaching agent - not only does it slightly whiten your skin with continued use but it will also bleach anything you touch.</li>
            <li> and tried it 4 different times on different spots over the space of several weeks...and every time I ended up with a huge deep-underneath pimple that was very painful and leaves a purplish discoloration/scar for several months.</li>
            <li> It may cause your skin to become very dry and flaky, somewhat ruining the benefits.  </li>
            <li> I put a teeny dab on one zit for two days and the third morning, I woke up with all those little bumps ALL over my face.  </li>
            <li> Alcohol is usually the only thing actually fighting bacteria; the other stuff just cleans.</li>
            <li> and I applied it with a little with of clyndamycin (I had some left over capsules)</li>
            <li> Just pop the capsule open and put a little bit, I would say about a quarter of the powder in a tablet.</li>
            <li> The only problem is it sometimes makes my face a little red and itchy if I use it to often, but that goes away within a few hours, so for me that&#x27;s not a issue.</li>
            <li> I know that after a couple more days, my life with painful acne will end.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it would disappear the very next morning, or at least the pimple would have became smaller.</li>
            <li> I noticed that immediately, the skin on and minimally around the blemish was dried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t over use it--actually only dabbed on some once a day for a few days...</li>
            <li> But be careful--</li>
            <li> If the product is wet it will bleach eyebrows as well.&lt;br /&gt;Not kidding or exaggerating in all this.</li>
            <li> Also be careful not to get it on any clothing, as it will behave as a bleach and leave spots.  </li>
            <li> I went to Korea this summer and spent over $2000 for skin care by a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have serious acne problems, just the regular monthly booboo in the middle of my face, and compared to Proactive, which has only 2.5% benzoyl peroxide and dried my face after a few days of use, Persa-Gel 10 (10% benzoyl peroxide) can be used only on the spot</li>
            <li> Using a very little amount made no improvement and just a little too much a giant itchy red splotches, but no acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I was a little skeptical at first because other acne medications simply were not working for me.</li>
            <li> went on Doxycycline, which although worked triggered panic attacks, and tried other topicals with no real results.</li>
            <li> If you use it every single day or night, after a few nights your face WILL get really dry though.</li>
            <li> thing I do have to say though, is that someone previous to me, mentioned that this product is the same as the RX product ClidaGel, which is not true.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure there is a hard and fast</li>
            <li> It is typically gone in a few days and typically never really gets that red.</li>
            <li> i would recommend this product to you if your someone who gets very little acne, so when a sudden zit comes up this product will work wonders for you.</li>
            <li> After applying this &#x27;creamy&#x27; gel for several days, I started to see my skin clearing up around typical trouble spots.</li>
            <li> with Olay Total Effects Night Firming cream (allow to absorb for 5-15 minutes)&lt;br /&gt;Apply small amount of persa-gel to entire face, concentrating on breakout areas (rub in a small drop on problem</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also figured out what the small white spots in the carpet are.</li>
            <li> You will want to wait until lying down...etc because it can stain your pillow and other fabrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw it the other day at a Walgreens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it once every other day</li>
            <li> The acne were not red anymore, so although I still had small bumps, they were not noticeable at all.</li>
            <li> You can read the reviews from other users now.</li>
            <li> After one use, small bumps similar to a heat rash was all over her face.</li>
            <li> I notice the expiration date was only about 15 days away, so I am not sure if that is why</li>
            <li> From the other reviews, it seem to worked</li>
            <li> If you use a lot, it can leave a white residue, but I use a small amount and rub it in so</li>
            <li> I try to use it every other day.</li>
            <li> They wash twice a day with purpose soap, and apply a small amount of this gel to their entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I ever notice a small bump starting to form on my face I immediately put this on and it never amounts to anything...</li>
            <li> If you touch an area and then touch something else the results will slowly become apparent.</li>
            <li> Lastly, I noticed that one of my pimples actually turned very hard.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use alot, because it does dry out the skin a little.</li>
            <li> Might make your face a little dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> of.&lt;br /&gt;So now not only is my skin worse, but I can&#x27;t even go back to the product that did work to fix this problem!</li>
            <li> I use this daily or every other day and hardly break out.</li>
            <li> i would wake up with the painful pimples that made a huge bump on your skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried persa-gel first, and even after waiting before applying moisturizer, when I did, some persa-gel ended up getting too close to my eyes and irritating the delicate skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used St Ives peach exfoliating wash, Noxema (cold cream), and cetaphil daily wash (for normal to oily skin).</li>
            <li> me (a female in my late twenties)</li>
            <li> I realized what I&#x27;ve been doing wrong this whole time.</li>
            <li> a small tube goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s settling down now that I&#x27;m in my 30s, but every now</li>
            <li> or I sat down, using my hand to brace me.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products with less benzoyl peroxide and for some reason they always dried my face up.</li>
            <li> (I also had a slight itch on my temple).  </li>
            <li> After a week and a half I realized that the cause of my worsened condition was this gel</li>
            <li> I am throwing out all my expensive prescriptions since I have found a new SOLUTION:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It bleaches dark rings around the eye!  </li>
            <li> Lasted a little over a week.</li>
            <li> I ordered this little cream</li>
            <li> this week I noticed the hoards of little bumps on my chin growing into pimples- about 70% of my chin was soon covered with acne</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Neutrogena On-The-Spot treatment but that yielded little results.</li>
            <li> is that this not only helped the bigger pimples, but actually cleared up the little annoying bumps on my skin</li>
            <li> old had a bad case of acne and we tried several different OTC products with poor results.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this junk, waste of $$.</li>
            <li> Not fantastic.</li>
            <li> This gave my a few of them</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wear makeup and had to wash only using water, for fear of making my face worse.  </li>
            <li> a few years of using this</li>
            <li> Benzoyl Peroxide sloths off any remaining dead skin cells and opens up your pores.</li>
            <li> Acne in trouble spots was reduced or gone, but with a price.</li>
            <li> I have heard a few homeopathics like witch hazel do wonders for zits</li>
            <li> But once every few months or so, I&#x27;ll a get a monster, mountain type zit on my face.</li>
            <li> Will zap away any blemishes you have from pimples to ingrown hairs within a few days to a week.</li>
            <li> I had to use a moisturizer every few hours.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this on my face, it&#x27;s probably too harsh for that, but on my shoulders during the summer when sleep-sweating makes me break out.</li>
            <li> because I just got it a few days ago</li>
            <li> A lot of acne websites told me to apply a bunch of the creme on my acne overnight, but this only made it worse because the skin also need to breathe.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the Persa-Gel helps with shrinkage over a few days, sometimes not at all.</li>
            <li> , this is the product to use to get rid of the problem within a few days.</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because i was all broken out with acne and just started using this product and my acne is finally clearing up.</li>
            <li> and i just had a few acne scars,</li>
            <li> However, my forehead has shown slight, if any, improvements over the past week of using the product.</li>
            <li> product doesn&#x27;t cause those hard pimples for me, like other reviewers have said it causes them.</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, it did NOT clear up my acne any faster, so I won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
            <li> I can put harsh products on my face usually without having redness, irritation, or peeling.</li>
            <li> Nothing would cure the swelling, I looked sick, and I tried ice, hot tea bags, frozen cucumbers, etc.</li>
            <li> However, please be careful when you&#x27;re sleeping because if this products gets on your pillow and then on your eyes, you might get a negative reaction!</li>
            <li> i have spent money on everything u can think of, over the counter..and nothing worked!!!!</li>
            <li> It seriously has never let me down ever.</li>
            <li> I used a small amount once on Tuesday around my chin and mouth area (and a small spot on my temple) and another small amount once on Wednesday and didn&#x27;t notice any difference.  </li>
            <li> For the last two years I have been trying to combat my acne with an expensive combination of antibiotics +</li>
            <li> thank god:) because i hate acne!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dangerous and had me nearly in the hospital.</li>
            <li> I had already used this Benzoyl peroxide on my face, but in a small quantity.</li>
            <li> I have a pimple, I put a small dab of this on it and it dries the pimple out in under a day.</li>
            <li> I usually apply this after moisturizing</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, duac is 5% benzoyl peroxide blended with a topical antibiotic.</li>
            <li> &quot; I guess, so not sure if it will help with acne.</li>
            <li> I usually apply it at night.</li>
            <li> Usually exfoliation with a wash cloth will take care of any flaking and I haven&#x27;t had issues with hyperpigmentation from the benzoyl peroxide like some do.</li>
            <li> Keep it to small amounts and use a moisturizer</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve ruined quite a few towels with this stuff!</li>
            <li> the past 5 months I could count the amount of pimples on one hand, whereas before I was using this product I was counting on both hands daily.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> If you continue to apply it excessively, it will make your skin flake.</li>
            <li> I always like to purchased acne gel for small acne problems.</li>
            <li> (This breakout was from stress, hormones, and a nasty habit of touching my face)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had small pimples on my nose</li>
            <li> This stuff had my eyes and cheeks EXTREMELY swollen, red( now, imagine a black girl with a red face!) and itching VERY badly!!</li>
            <li> It dries it out and prevents it from becoming be a horrible, noticeable, angry, red, zit that everyone stares at in business meetings.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the long review</li>
            <li> I still like some of their other products, but this needs to be taken very seriously.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find an acne product without moisturizers nowdays.</li>
            <li> After that I tried an 8% OTC body wash from Panoxyl, which seemed to hardly work at all.</li>
            <li> I learned this the hard way.</li>
            <li> Because it contains 10% benzoyl peroxide , it will leave your skin feeling very dry and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This is not it despite using multiple acne products so you would think my skin would be peeling like crazy but its not.</li>
            <li> put this on any zit (or blackhead trying to become a zit) that I spy before bed, and it knocks that sucker out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using benzoyl peroxide - based over - the - counter acne treatments for at least 30 years</li>
            <li> WOW, I was shocked.</li>
            <li> It had a myriad of negative side effects.  </li>
            <li> must note that this product hasn&#x27;t made my acne any worse and does seem to have dried some of my oily T-zone without over-drying, but that just didn&#x27;t translate into improvements.</li>
            <li> ALL, I mean ALL, of my acne is gone.</li>
            <li> 23, crazy skin that I have a hard time determining if it&#x27;s dry, oily, combo, sensitve, etc.</li>
            <li> I still struggle with acne even at the ripe old age of 31 :(</li>
            <li> I was only using this once daily and got a horrible rash on my cheeks around the affected area within a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend $$$ where it does no good, and buy this brand for the application.  </li>
            <li> Yikes, when I used them my eyes swelled shut, so not good.</li>
            <li> i hate when i get pimples especially the whiteheads or clusters of small bumps when i break out sometimes..</li>
            <li> I do believe my skin I starting to peel from it as well :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ended up squeezing the area and out popped a VERY hard whitehead.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product made the pimple byproducts (which was one of those pimples from deeper within the skin) to get stuck underneath the skin and solidify but if this happens to you (the area gets very hard and is a raised bump)</li>
            <li> (and I can&#x27;t feel ANY small bumps or clogged pores under the surface!!).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thin cream.</li>
            <li> By Tuesday afternoon I was tired of waiting and called to see if a nurse was ever going to call.  </li>
            <li> Once it was discontinued, my skin took a turn for the worse.</li>
            <li> I have thin, oily skin and used to have pimples ravaging my nose and cheeks.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I never experienced sever acne.</li>
            <li> The instructions say use 1-3 times a day, and apply a THIN layer over the break out.</li>
            <li> and I just put it on yesterday (when the acne was at its worse)</li>
            <li> It made my skin WORSE.  </li>
            <li> but ironically, my skin got worse and worse.</li>
            <li> Not only did I start to hate looking at the mirror, my face hurt like there were bruises.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a dramatic difference within 4 days now.</li>
            <li> your skin will get a nasty white cast to it - that is the filler in the product that makes it &#x27;creamy.</li>
            <li> i had a horrible rash all over my face, neck, back of ears and nose.  </li>
            <li> The white film also is very annoying..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve considered it \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; since the wrong product will make me break out like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I had a horrible reaction to it, my face was red, itchy, and peeling.</li>
            <li> I stopped going because of my insurance (too expensive)</li>
            <li> dont waste your time with this crap please.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, but it&#x27;s really uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It is sometimes difficult to find the 10% Benzoyl Peroxide.</li>
            <li> use this with proactiv refining mask and it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet.</li>
            <li> Unless you have very tough skin</li>
            <li> When I went to apply this to my face I was shocked at how poorly this product absorbs and blends into the skin.</li>
            <li> If your skin isn&#x27;t terribly oily, try using it every other day.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if I would use this product again due to nasty side effects, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely destructive.</li>
            <li> but nothing crazy</li>
            <li> but I was really desperate for a solution.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll get an unpleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating!</li>
            <li> if you are going to try this chemical, start with the 2.5% concentration to avoid the possibility of a very exaggerated skin reaction.</li>
            <li> I still have acne, just not as bad as it was before.  </li>
            <li> and we have never had a bad reaction to it.  </li>
            <li> I have bad acne and have for years.</li>
            <li> For about 15 years I&#x27;ve had fairly bad acne.</li>
            <li> It was really bad</li>
            <li> ugly cystic ance on my cheeks and forehead</li>
            <li> I get a lot of those under the skin painful cyst-like pimples, and I have blackheads as well.</li>
            <li> and then I&#x27;ll get an annoying break out on my chin or nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if your acne is still bad or gets worst, you probably need a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very disappointed that it has not helped them at all.</li>
            <li> Acne scars are the worst because even if the zit goes away</li>
            <li> Tried salicylic acid products, worked terribly.</li>
            <li> Helps controlling a real bad pimple subsides in 2 days.</li>
            <li> I suffered a nasty breakout and needed something to get rid of it without strolling into the spa and seeing an esthetican.</li>
            <li> I used to have terrible acne</li>
            <li> and I still get terrible acne if I don&#x27;t use this every day.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use the product on specific areas, but not seeing any results on visible zits. I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I am highly satisfied with this product on every level; it works well, keeping my skin under control without over drying and the price is right!</li>
            <li> My skin is tough and oily and I&#x27;ve been looking for a strong peeling product. This is not it despite using multiple acne products so you would think my skin would be peeling like crazy but its not. It&#x27;s hard to find an acne product without moisturizers nowdays. How is a product going to peel the zit if its being moisturized?  Defeats the purpose of the product dont you think?</li>
            <li> Persa-Gel is good stuff and goes on nicely, very difficult to detect by sight or odor and definitely works as a good concentration of benzoyl peroxide should.  Don&#x27;t spend $$$ where it does no good, and buy this brand for the application.  Not too harsh on skin, but very effective.</li>
            <li> Nice product for skin problems like acne etc.. The main ingredient - benzoyl peroxide does its job well, helped a bunch, I would highly recommend !</li>
            <li> Each tube lasts about 6-7 months, it&#x27;s pretty effective and dissolves in your skin without leaving any trace that it&#x27;s on. I recommend this and will continue to use it! The only thing...it&#x27;s NOT a gel. It&#x27;s a thin cream.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin. When I sit inside sometimes I sweat. Walk, I sweat.. do anything I sweat. But this stuff really works. I put this on after I wash my face at night. I find that putting this on at night really works. Then in the morning I wash my face to get the oil off of me. If you put too much it does leave some white residue on your face, but the joy of the morning wash takes that away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I have a pimple I put this on every night and in just 2 days its gone. I highly recommend this product, and try it at night.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading all of the great reviews about it.  I used a small amount once on Tuesday around my chin and mouth area (and a small spot on my temple) and another small amount once on Wednesday and didn&#x27;t notice any difference.  I decided to stop using it (thankfully) and by Friday morning, when I woke up, my face was really itchy around my mouth and chin and was red (I also had a slight itch on my temple).  I emailed the company and got a response on Saturday to call them during the week.  My *rash* got progressively worse over the weekend, it turned very bright and got extremely itchy and got bumpy.  It even started oozing for two days.  I called the company immediately on Monday and was told that a nurse would be in touch with me very soon.  By Tuesday afternoon I was tired of waiting and called to see if a nurse was ever going to call.  I was placed on hold for a long time and ended up hanging up.  I went to Target and spoke to a pharmacist that recommended putting Aveeno Positively Radiant daily moisturizer on the area twice per day.  I have actually been putting it on about 5 times per day (it hurts and itches and I just want it gone) and less than 48 hours later the rash and redness is going away and it barely itches anymore.  I will not buy Clean &amp; Clear products again because of this experience.  I would much rather have a face covered in acne than go through this again!!!</li>
            <li> Works great!  If I put it on at night, by morning the zit is practically gone!</li>
            <li> This stuff works well on my blemishes. It took a little while to work on the big ones but it really dries up the pimples. This makes your skin dry (and I have oily skin), so get a good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product: cheap, easy and works.</li>
            <li> If you need to get rid of a zit fast, then this is the best out there, in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on any zit (or blackhead trying to become a zit) that I spy before bed, and it knocks that sucker out.  It does make my skin peel a tad, and it will probably do the same to you, so be careful not to overuse.  Also, make sure you use a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer as well if your skin is really sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  Something else that&#x27;s great:  This product caused old acne scars on my chin to fade very quickly.  Acne scars are the worst because even if the zit goes away it looks like you still have it!  So this product is great for that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SECOND EDIT: I wrote this review several years ago. I&#x27;m now 29 and this product doesn&#x27;t work the same for me as it used to. So your experience with it may vary depending on how old you are. When I was younger, it was the best! Now that I&#x27;m older, I find products with tea tree oil work better for me. Also: beware, this product will bleach any fabric it comes in contact with.</li>
            <li> Persa-Gel 10 is a gel in that it is water based.  It can leave a white film, but this goes away if you put your moisturizer on top of it.  You may think you don&#x27;t need a moisturizer, but you do.  Use something light, preferably with SPF.  Products like Oxy or Neutrogena are creams.  They may appear to sink into the skin, but if you get around any type of moisture (like fog or sweat) your skin will get a nasty white cast to it - that is the filler in the product that makes it &#x27;creamy.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite is Panoxyl Aqua Gel, but it is hard to find in the store so I switched to Persa-Gel.  It works really well if used consistently.  I used to use it day and night and my skin was perfect.  I&#x27;m a bit lazy and only use it during the day now, but still have really great results.  I also use a Clean&amp;Clear acne wash with salicylic acid.  I&#x27;ve been through it all - various OTCs and prescriptions, including two courses of Accutane.  This is a routine that really works.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after the product I had been using for 6 years, oxy Maximum Vanish Lotion, was discontinued. With the oxy lotion my skin was FLAWLESS. Once it was discontinued, my skin took a turn for the worse. Since this Persa-Gel 10 also has 10% benzoyl peroxide, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;ll just say this, ALL BENZOYL PEROXIDE PRODUCTS ARE NOT THE SAME! After using the persa-gel 10 for 2 days I realized it wasn&#x27;t helping my skin, but I kept at it. After 4 days my skin started getting MANY of the worst kind of pimples. The huge, tender, deep down under the skin pimples that take FOREVER to get rid of.&lt;br /&gt;So now not only is my skin worse, but I can&#x27;t even go back to the product that did work to fix this problem! Very frustrating!</li>
            <li> I need something that I could use as a spot treatment.  This product worked quickly and did not dry out my skin, unlike other 10% benzoyl peroxide products that usually cause a rash on my sensitive skin.  I use it only when I feel or see a pimple coming in the morning under my makeup, sometimes afternoon, and at night.  I am very excited to finally find a product that can handle my acne breakout quickly without making my skin peal.</li>
            <li> I got this item from Target today. I had three blemishes all around my mouth and they hurt whenever I smiled. It was definitely a big bother and when my mom took me to the store I knew I needed to look for something. We found this product with other Clean &amp; Clear products. I love C&amp;C&#x27;s products and so I trusted this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to wash you face and apply 1-3 times every day until you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;I washed my face with an exfoliating scrub followed by morning burst and then applied the cream to all spots. I noticed that immediately, the skin on and minimally around the blemish was dried.&lt;br /&gt;I did this two more times that day and once extra before going to bed. Right now, all that&#x27;s left is tiny spots and dry skin and itch very little, but the marks are gone. This product is extremely quick acting and worth every penny. Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> I have tried two days, till now no big difference between this product and other product which I tried before. Hope that it will function better later.</li>
            <li> I rarely review products, but just had to throw out my kudos to this product.  I am a 29 female and have suffered with acne for 15+ years.  It never seemed to get any better, despite expensive prescriptions.  Most of my breakouts were around my jawline and hairline, although no part of my face could really escape it!  For the last two years I have been trying to combat my acne with an expensive combination of antibiotics + birth control + salicylic face wash + aczone ($$!) and retin-a.  Nothing cleared my breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness for my love of amazon and everyone who has used this product and written their reviews! I decided to give persa-gel a shot and with a $5 price tag, I had nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are nothing short of AMAZING!! Persa-gel IMMEDIATELY cleared my breakouts, and has prevented new acne.  The first day or two my skin was a little flakey in some spots, but after that no problems.  I have been using this for about 2-3 weeks and have had ZERO new breakouts.  I can run my hands along my face and my face feels smooth (and I can&#x27;t feel ANY small bumps or clogged pores under the surface!!). I even used this on a small/picked at sore near my hairline that didn&#x27;t seem to improve after a week or two.  I used persa-gel on it and it IMMEDIATELY began to dry up and heal.  REMARKABLE!  As someone who picks at their skin too much (guilty), I love that this product almost seemed to HEAL my skin.  I love that this product dries out acne, but doesn&#x27;t make my skin flakey.  Plus it rubs right in clear and very little product is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so impressed with this product and recommend it to anyone to try.  I am throwing out all my expensive prescriptions since I have found a new SOLUTION:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning:&lt;br /&gt;Wash with Neutrogena Clear Pore Cleanser/Mask with Clarisonic Brush&lt;br /&gt;Use Neutrogena Clear Pore Toner applied with cotton pad&lt;br /&gt;Moisturize with Olay Total Effects moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Only on occasionally I use persa-gel as a spot treatment on any existing breakouts before makeup (Bare Minerals)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Night:&lt;br /&gt;Wash with Neutrogena Clear Pore Cleanser/Mask with Clarisonic Brush&lt;br /&gt;Use Neutrogena Clear Pore Toner applied with cotton pad&lt;br /&gt;Moisturize with Olay Total Effects Night Firming cream (allow to absorb for 5-15 minutes)&lt;br /&gt;Apply small amount of persa-gel to entire face, concentrating on breakout areas (rub in a small drop on problem areas)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also taking Zinc (50 mg) + Copper (2.5 mg) nightly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*If you use moisturizer in conjunction with persa-gel, I advise using moisturizer PRIOR to persa-gel and allowing it to absorb for 5-15 minutes first.  I have tried persa-gel first, and even after waiting before applying moisturizer, when I did, some persa-gel ended up getting too close to my eyes and irritating the delicate skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last three years and I will have to say that I have been very satisfied with it so far.  I use it twice a day (once in the morning and once before bed) and it has kept my face much clearer than it was.  I still have acne, just not as bad as it was before.  I am a realist so I understand that my face will not be 100% clear by using any of these skin products.  I would recommended switching products every six months or so as sometimes your face needs different products.</li>
            <li> i would buy this product again it works really well an works fast to help the problem so i would recomend it</li>
            <li> 1 of my staples!  I love to use this in the morning after cleansing my face. When I don&#x27;t use this stuff, I notice acne coming back.</li>
            <li> first of all i was on birth control for a very long time, i decided to get off of it and ohhhh myy godness,, did i break out...ugly cystic ance on my cheeks and forehead, i broke out like never before and im only 20 yrs old!! i have spent money on everything u can think of, over the counter..and nothing worked!!!! until i started drinking this pills called PANTOTHENIC ACID 1000MG (i ordered from here)&lt;br /&gt;and using this clean and clear product since its so strong i only apply it on the affected area NOT all over my face!!! this two products have made suchhhhh a huggeeeeee difference! omg...my forehead is clearer and so are my cheeks!!! thank god:) because i hate acne! thankkk u.&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> I developed acne a year ago after I got married and stopped taking the BC pill.  I lead a very healthy lifestyle and make my living as a yoga instructor and holistic nutritional counselor so having cystic-like acne all over my forehead and cheeks while I&#x27;m trying to be the picture of good health is quite bad for business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to use natural products on my skin, but have made an exception for Persa-Gel.  After less than a week of using the product, I have seen a huge difference in my skin. My husband even asked me what I had been doing differently as my face is starting to look so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found what works best for me is to use the Persa-Gel before bed as part of my night time cleansing routine.  I cleanse with a  mild tea-tree oil based soap, then depending on what my skin looks and feels like, I tone with witch hazel then apply an aloe based moisturizer. After all that, I apply a thin layer of Persa-Gel all over my skin adding a bit extra to the more severely broken out areas.  I have been doing my nighttime routine for years and all that has changed recently is the addition of the Persa-Gel so I know that it is this product that is making the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s working great for me.  I think the key is just being patient and consistent with how you use it to get results.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 2 weeks but only before i went to sleep. Then once i put it on my forehead for the day and by the end of the day i noticed a huge white spot spread across my forehead. I dunno what it is but its not normal for sure . Don&#x27;t buy this junk, waste of $$. Every time i would put it on acne before i went to bed i would wake up with the painful pimples that made a huge bump on your skin. I stopped using this and my skin cleared up SO WELL. Anyway, i don&#x27;t recommend this AT ALL .</li>
            <li> Clean &amp; Clear Persa-Gel 10 is an excellent inexpensive product for oily skin.  Definitely reduced oil production using twice a day.  Have cut back to once a day at times as the top layer of skin becomes dry-scaly.  I started using the Olay Pro-X Advanced cleansing system- a rotating scrub brush for the face to exfoliate the dead dry skin which works great in combination with the Clean &amp; Clear.  I am on the auto ship program and will continue with this excellent product.  10% may be too strong for some skin types, but not for my very oily skin.</li>
            <li> Not fantastic. Didn&#x27;t really do anything for me. Dried out my skin a little bit but does stain very easily so be veryyyy carrful! And it leaves a light white residue behind but it&#x27;s not a big deal. A few people here said it left those big sore pimples that you can never really pop. This gave my a few of them so I stopped using it, kind of defeats the whole purpose of an acne cream if it gives you more pimples than you started with.</li>
            <li> I buy this stuff from wal-mart but all the same it works pretty well, I barely have breakouts when i use this and i think if i used it more often then i do i would have more clear skin. All around though its great it really reduces redness and breakouts. I love the stuff (:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for most of my life.  It&#x27;s settling down now that I&#x27;m in my 30s, but every now and then I&#x27;ll get an annoying break out on my chin or nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep this stuff on hand at all times.  Other zit creams would dry out my skin too much (I have sensitive skin).  This stuff is pretty strong but not harsh on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is that it&#x27;s benzoyl peroxide so it WILL bleach fabrics and towels.  It bleached my pillowcases almost immediately, so if you&#x27;re applying it at night I&#x27;d recommend using pillowcases and sheets that you don&#x27;t care about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I love this product.  Sometimes I&#x27;ll put it on my entire face even if I don&#x27;t have breakouts, because it keeps my oily skin under control in hotter weather.</li>
            <li> Apparently this works for other people, but be careful. I do not have sensitive skin, it is actually a tad dark naturally (I&#x27;m biracial). I don&#x27;t have major acne, but a few spots on my complexion that produce a cluster of pimples occasionally, so I got this stuff to spot-treat it. I didn&#x27;t over use it--actually only dabbed on some once a day for a few days...and first it would dry out the spot really well and the regular pimples I had would start to go away. But then in the very spot I had used it would form a massive pimple--not the kind with the head, but the kind that is extremely swollen and huge and hurts (it feels like something is in pain deep under the skin), almost like a large \\&quot;bump\\&quot;...and then after several days pus would come to the surface, and the whole time it would be extremely sore as if I had pinched it though I had not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept thinking it was \\&quot;a coincidence\\&quot;...and tried it 4 different times on different spots over the space of several weeks...and every time I ended up with a huge deep-underneath pimple that was very painful and leaves a purplish discoloration/scar for several months. I never get those kinds normally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I finally concluded my skin was had some kind of allergic reaction to one of the \\&quot;inactive ingredients\\&quot; in this particular gel (it is not the benzoyl peroxide). So it seems this works great for most people. But be careful--if you develop the same reaction I did, don&#x27;t keep trying it again and again like I did. Experimental science is great at proving a hypothesis, but don&#x27;t do it to your face--it&#x27;ll leave discoloration scars that linger for months.</li>
            <li> DISCLAIMER: Sorry for the long review but if you are interested in the product, take me seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do NOT recommend this product for anyone, unless they have been given the \\&quot;okay\\&quot; by their doctor! I used this product specifically before a special event, and when I awoke the next morning and I could barely open my eyes! This stuff had my eyes and cheeks EXTREMELY swollen, red( now, imagine a black girl with a red face!) and itching VERY badly!! This was a nightmare for me and also a surprise, considering I have never in my life had any allergic reaction to anything, either related to Clean &amp; Clear, or anything period! Nothing would cure the swelling, I looked sick, and I tried ice, hot tea bags, frozen cucumbers, etc. all the classic home remedies...nothing. Anyway, I highly recommend you get tested for allergies before using this product it&#x27;s dangerous and had me nearly in the hospital. Please I am not just writing this review to trash Clean &amp; Clear. I still like some of their other products, but this needs to be taken very seriously.</li>
            <li> This product works great. I&#x27;ve been using benzoyl peroxide - based over - the - counter acne treatments for at least 30 years and I&#x27;m ordering some more right now. But there is a caution that I should remember, but I recently forgot. Benzoyl peroxide is a bleach (they even use it in Asia to bleach flour, just check the label on your Ramen package). It can bleach literally anything. Recently I ruined a new set of expensive sheets and pillow cases, and left a bleached spot on my new comforter. So now I bought a nice set of white sheets and am trying to find a more color fast duvet cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also figured out what the small white spots in the carpet are. I&#x27;ve bleached out places in the carpet where I figure the residual on my fingers touched it. (I tend to put the benzoyl on as a final thing after the evening shower while at the bath room sink and in the past I generally haven&#x27;t washed off the residual on my fingers.) I&#x27;ve determined I was picking something off the carpet or I sat down, using my hand to brace me. Poly/cotton blends seem to be more resistant to benzoyl peroxide than 100% cotton. Although completely man - made blends in the carpet have been bleached. So I&#x27;m not sure there is a hard and fast rule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be good for parents to know and to enforce a &#x27;hand washing&#x27; rule after use. Or just keep in mind when you find that really nice set of colorful sheets at Overstock.</li>
            <li> I had already used this Benzoyl peroxide on my face, but in a small quantity. I have to say makes your face REALLy dry, but all my acne is gone after 02 weeks using it - before bed time and when I wake up - take care!</li>
            <li> I use this for stubborn acne as a spot treatment.  The cystic acne I get occasional responds well to this as nothing else seems to.</li>
            <li> i had a horrible rash all over my face, neck, back of ears and nose.  basically all the areas i applied to cream to.  it&#x27;s been 3 days now, and my skin hasn&#x27;t improved at all, so i started applying a 1% hydrocortisone cream as of tonight (recommended by a friend dermatologist).  i believe the problem with this product is the high concentration of benzoil peroxide of 10%.  if you are going to try this chemical, start with the 2.5% concentration to avoid the possibility of a very exaggerated skin reaction.</li>
            <li> This product works great for people with oily skin (such as me). It performs the same as prescription Benzaclin (and other prescription-only acne medications), but at an obvious fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a superb choice for people who want clear skin. It goes on moist, but quickly dries into a mask-like protective layer (to dry out your skin). You will want to wait until lying down...etc because it can stain your pillow and other fabrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people might find that process gross, but I know that waking up with oily skin (and the sensation of the bacteria...etc actually &#x27;moving around&#x27; underneath your skin) is much nastier. This is a vertiable bargain any day of the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t put off having the skin which you have always wanted, get this product today.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very drying!! My face went from oily to super dry and flaking after using this! To make matters worse, it did NOT clear up my acne any faster, so I won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used persagel for years and tried all the brands on the market. This is my #2 choice. If it&#x27;s on sale I&#x27;ll buy it but normally I go for Clearasil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This product WILL bleach your clothes/pillows/make your skin incredibly sensitive to sunlight. I use white pillow cases and wear it while I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Persagel in general is by far the best thing you can use on your skin if you get white-heads, it helps with black-heads but not nearly as much as the large blemishes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad Clean &amp; Clear works for a lot of people, but if you have sensitive skin like mine, DO NOT USE THIS!  I put a teeny dab on one zit for two days and the third morning, I woke up with all those little bumps ALL over my face.  I couldn&#x27;t wear makeup and had to wash only using water, for fear of making my face worse.  I really thought I&#x27;d messed up my skin, considering it looked like I had tons of beestings or been chewed up!  So, slowly but surely, my face went back to normal and it&#x27;s still recovering from being dried out by Persa-Gel 10.  From one spot, my WHOLE face dried out.  For sensitive skin users, DON&#x27;T USE THIS PRODUCT.  My cure was to ride it out, wash only with water, and moisturize with Eucerin Sensitive Skin.</li>
            <li> I used this product only twice and the skin became really really dry!!!! It didn&#x27;t do any good and even made it worse!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have very oily skin. This product really helps prevent breakouts and it also helps to keep my skin from being shiny by lunch time. I wear it at night to help prevent pimples and I wear it during the day under my makeup to control the oil and shine. If you do use it as often as I do, I recommend using a very light moisturizer so you don&#x27;t over dry your skin. If your skin isn&#x27;t terribly oily, try using it every other day.&lt;br /&gt;When I have a pimple, I put a small dab of this on it and it dries the pimple out in under a day. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it&#x27;s definitely my go to pimple cream.</li>
            <li> I have thin, oily skin and used to have pimples ravaging my nose and cheeks.  This product has cured my acne without aggravating my skin.  I&#x27;ve tried every (pricey) spot treatment under the sun, from Neutrogena to Clarins to DDF, and this product is one of the better ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this product is **NOT A GEL** as advertised!  It is a white cream that can leave splotches as it dries.  I usually apply this after moisturizing so I don&#x27;t get splotches anyway, but this is something that buyers should know: the packaging is truly misleading.</li>
            <li> This works great on very bad or light acne break outs.&lt;br /&gt;This even redused old scar marks and even excessive oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;Obviously on larger scale break outs, it takes a few days but the results are actually visable as swelling and redness goes down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since being introduced to this product by a whim from my cousin, i have since introduced it to my own sister who has similar problems to me, who uses it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it is advised that you avoid cloth and material, as i once had a nice blue flannel, now it has pink marks. ¬¬</li>
            <li> I must say that this product is by far the best over-the-counter acne medication that I have ever tried. I&#x27;ll admit that I was a little skeptical at first because other acne medications simply were not working for me. Just before I ordered this product I was halfway done with my Neutrogena 3 in 1 fight and fade gel and I was not that satisfied with the results. This product is cheaper, compared to its counter parts, and is just as effective. Because it contains 10% benzoyl peroxide , it will leave your skin feeling very dry and uncomfortable. If you&#x27;re new to using benzoyl peroxide, you should probably use it once a day after washing your face. One downside is that it left the area that I applied it looking much darker and \\&quot;burned\\&quot;. If this does happen to you then I would recommend using cocoa butter once the acne clears up.</li>
            <li> Alcohol is usually the only thing actually fighting bacteria; the other stuff just cleans. No external application will fight the bacteria better than this. Why isn&#x27;t this in all acne products? It&#x27;s extremely destructive. Doesn&#x27;t matter if it is wet or dry. That&#x27;s the clincher.&lt;br /&gt;Best advice: Clean/exfoliate (soap/chem peel), apply product, let dry, apply CaraVe moisturizer, go to bed with white bedding (have white towels as well), shower right when you get up. If you touch an area and then touch something else the results will slowly become apparent. If you have dark hair use a clean pillowcase frequently. If the product is wet it will bleach eyebrows as well.&lt;br /&gt;Not kidding or exaggerating in all this. If Clean &amp; Clear is able to reach the infected area through oil and dead skin it will work like nothing else currently on the market. Tell your body it doesn&#x27;t need to moisturize- use CaraVe after bathing and as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*After a few years of using this I found a wonderful side affect.  It bleaches dark rings around the eye!  Quite effective too.  I&#x27;ve tried some very expensive stuff for dark circles that wasn&#x27;t as effective as this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used this clean and clear persa gel did nothing for me none of their products have done much for me proactive is way better or I use biore is just as good the presa gel just did it work I still have the tube will not use this again I bought it at walgreens it was before using proactive.It seems clean and clear I just can&#x27;t use any of their products they just don&#x27;t do anything for me their body wash was it all either.</li>
            <li> I tried numerous products that were for sensative skin or acne skin. Nothing really worked that well. Nothing until now. Here is my routine and I hope you try it if you have found nothing else that works for back acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 Wash your skin in mild shower water. Hot water seems to make the oily sebum in your pores more clogging. That is just my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2 Get a get body wash loofah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#3 Get Eucerin Gentle Body Wash and clean your skin. This Body wash contains no acne causing ingredients. Also, It does not try out your skin. I know some of you with acne and oily skin have the feeling that your skin is oily then after a shower with acne body washes you feel like you have dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#4 Use Johnson &amp; Johnson PersaGel with Benzoyl Peroxide after you get done with your shower. Benzoyl Peroxide sloths off any remaining dead skin cells and opens up your pores. This in turn makes your skin clear in the long run. Believe you me, the results I have found using the above routine has given me enough confidence to walk around with no shirt on in a locker room and not feel \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; for the first time since I was 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last note. I have found that if you mix the gel with a little bit of water or even apply the gel straight to your skin out of the shower it works even better. The water dilutes the gel so it won&#x27;t burn at all. Sometimes with 10% Benzoyl Peroxide Max strength it can burn skin. Again, use it on wet skin with a diluted PersaGel and you will be better off because the Gel works just as good and then will not burn at all.</li>
            <li> Well, it does clear the skin.. but mainly just by drying out the acne (It works quite nice for shrinking those huge non-headed cyst like things :P ), and consequently any skin around where you apply it. The white film also is very annoying.. and so I don&#x27;t like going out in public with it on, it just draws more atention to the acne. So I put it on only at nights or when I&#x27;ll be staying home most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recomend Zapzyt over this, its basically the same thing, 10% Benzoyl Peroxide, but cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josh</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have serious acne problems, just the regular monthly booboo in the middle of my face, and compared to Proactive, which has only 2.5% benzoyl peroxide and dried my face after a few days of use, Persa-Gel 10 (10% benzoyl peroxide) can be used only on the spot and I could see results in hours. I am not sure if this is a product for everybody, but it sure helps me when I need it.</li>
            <li> This product is great and is highly effective.  I have worked in pharmacy for 3 years and have seen people spend a lot of money on prescription acne treatments that basically do the same thing but only cost more, especially if you dont have insurance.  This strength of Benzoyl Peroxide used to be RX only, but now is over the counter.  It is rather strong and I do suggest that  you follow the instructions on the package, especially if you have sensitive skin, to \\&quot;ease into it\\&quot;, even if you are tempted to put it on 2-3 times a day at the very beginning.  It may cause your skin to become very dry and flaky, somewhat ruining the benefits.  Overtime though, many people&#x27;s skin gets used to it and then you can increase the application as neeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other people have mentioned this product does say that it is a gel, but in fact is a white cream and does leave some residue on the skin.  The good news is that Clean &amp; Clear has just come out with the same product as this in a clear gel!!  I saw it the other day at a Walgreens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do have to say though, is that someone previous to me, mentioned that this product is the same as the RX product ClidaGel, which is not true.  ClindaGel contain benzoyl Peroxide, but it alos contains clindamycin which is another acne fighting engredient.  I just thought that I should mention that in case anyone reading this uses ClindaGel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is definately a great product!!!</li>
            <li> First of all I must say that I DO NOT have sensitive skin. I can put harsh products on my face usually without having redness, irritation, or peeling. When I saw all the good reviews on Clean &amp; Clear Persa-Gel, I knew I had to try it. I figured if it worked to clear and prevent one pimple, why not try to clear up my entire face. I have recently developed cystic acne and it has been very debilitating. I first apply Clean &amp; Clear Pera-Gel to my entire face (twice a day) and then immediately after I apply Neutrogena&#x27;s Combination Skin Moisturizer. I should also say that before applying the Persa-Gel, I use Oxy Maximum Facial Cleanser. I really do believe it is the Persa-Gel that has worked the biggest miracle for my face. ALL, I mean ALL, of my acne is gone. It has lightened my complexion, gotten rid of some tough acne scars, and my face always feels smooth and hydrated. I have tried other products with less benzoyl peroxide and for some reason they always dried my face up. This combination REALLY works! Make sure you use a great moisturizer immediately following the application of the persa-gel and lather that moisturizer on pretty good to avoid dryness. I have never been happier with a product as I am with this one. Thanks Clean &amp; Clear!</li>
            <li> It probably not a product for me. You see I have the really big type of ance that grow deeper under the skin and this product does not clear it. It does reduce the redness though.</li>
            <li> REALLY AWESOME product. I use it everyday and it keeps my skin clean. I will buy it again and highly recommend it to people who have oily skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this miracle stuff for around 9 years..maybe more. It seriously has never let me down ever. It does dry you out buy if you&#x27;re oily like me its awesome.  I put this on a cluster or pimples or even one that is already white and by the next day its completely dried up and on its way to disappearing .</li>
            <li> I have used so many different products to clear up my acne and nothing has worked. I use this product only at nighttime before bed instead of the three times a day it recommends. I starting seeing results right away. It took longer for my skin to clear up because I only used it once a day but I didn&#x27;t want to have super dry skin which happens to me if I use this product more then once a day. The greatest thing is once my skin was clear I was able to stop using the product on a daily basis. If I notice my skin starting to break out I use it only on the problem area. Totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected. I was not very confident, since I tried many similar products and they never work very well. This one overcame the expectations.</li>
            <li> With slight forehead acne due to combination oily skin I was hoping to find a quick fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews on this product and the 10% Benzoyl Peroxide ingredient made me confident that this would do the trick. However, my forehead has shown slight, if any, improvements over the past week of using the product. On top of this, the actual gel is white and is not something you can put on except for at night before bed without looking like you have a bunch of white stuff on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must note that this product hasn&#x27;t made my acne any worse and does seem to have dried some of my oily T-zone without over-drying, but that just didn&#x27;t translate into improvements. I will try another product that goes on clear and shows improvements for me.</li>
            <li> This cream really helped my daughter. Her acne is clearing up but I will need to get some more. I am glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> I still struggle with acne even at the ripe old age of 31 :( My dermatologist prescribed both retin-a micro and duac. Both have done wonderful things for my skin, especially duac. Unfortunately, duac is 5% benzoyl peroxide blended with a topical antibiotic. When I started suffering from all kinds of infections as a possible side effect of constantly using antibiotics, I switched to this and surprise! It works just as well for a fraction of the cost! This product has a 10% concentration of benzoyl peroxide, which is a higher percentage anyways. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and clears up any acne I have have in a matter of days.</li>
            <li> This is the best treatment for acne in terms of efficacy. A little (2 tiny dots) is sufficient for whole face application and keeps your pimples/black heads/ cystic acne at bay.</li>
            <li> This product is a must. It&#x27;s not as chalky as it used to be in the past, so a thin, effective layer can be worn discretely beneath or above foundation or with moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Please Keep in mind I have oily, acne prone skin. I&#x27;ve considered it \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; since the wrong product will make me break out like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used 10% in a face wash before but never in a cream that stayed on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first night I used it I admittedly used a little too much. Acne in trouble spots was reduced or gone, but with a price. My skin was bright red in every area I had put the cream, was itchy, and somewhat flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I tried using very, very sparingly. I&#x27;ve also used St Ives peach exfoliating wash, Noxema (cold cream), and cetaphil daily wash (for normal to oily skin). Using a very little amount made no improvement and just a little too much a giant itchy red splotches, but no acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may have more sensitive skin than I realize. Unless you have very tough skin I do not recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said my husband was able to use it as directed with no problems. So it largely depends on how sensitive your skin is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not sensitive skin friendly.</li>
            <li> This product is very similar to the treatment that is sold as part of the acne.org regime.&lt;br /&gt;It is a lot thicker in consistency than the treatment but works just as well and is readily available at most stores.&lt;br /&gt;My skin flares up occasionally and I use this on individual break outs before bed. Like others have mentioned, it can be very drying to the skin but I have found that following up with an oil-free moisturizer (after washing my face in the morning) is sufficient enough to keep my skin from peeling and flaking.&lt;br /&gt;For me (a female in my late twenties) benzoyl peroxide (the active ingredient in Persa-Gel 10) is much more effective than the salicylic acid that is found in a lot of other acne treatments. It is not a miracle cure but it will certainly help to reduce the size and severity of existing break outs.</li>
            <li> I have heard a few homeopathics like witch hazel do wonders for zits but I am reluctant to try anything besides persagel because it has been my old trusty for decades. Luckily, I never experienced sever acne. But once every few months or so, I&#x27;ll a get a monster, mountain type zit on my face. This stuff is great. It dries it out and prevents it from becoming be a horrible, noticeable, angry, red, zit that everyone stares at in business meetings. I put it on in the evenings and then wipe it off and put more on before bed each night. It is typically gone in a few days and typically never really gets that red. I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore so thankfully amazon sells it.</li>
            <li> Very good product that you can use morning and night. Will zap away any blemishes you have from pimples to ingrown hairs within a few days to a week. amazing!</li>
            <li> Good presentation. Excellent quality. The product arrived very quickly. the Benzoyl peroxide is a very good substance to eliminate acne. So I am satisfied with the purchase, because i bought a good product.</li>
            <li> I use this product ever day. I have no oil problems any more! I will be ordering this one again. For sure! Okay price.</li>
            <li> My 13 yr. old had a bad case of acne and we tried several different OTC products with poor results. This was easier for him to use than the acne washes and his skin cleared up nicely over the course of a couple of weeks of regular use.</li>
            <li> i have severley dry skin and using this only made my skin peel and burn.. regret buying it. dont buy if you have dry skin</li>
            <li> Works just as good as any 10% Benzoyl Peroxide, good brand and good price.  It doesn&#x27;t have a sticky feel or bad smell, so overall a good product that I recommend for anyone to use</li>
            <li> I used to have lots of pimples on my face.&lt;br /&gt;After used this every night really helps reduce the breakouts especially during periods.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaned your face and put on toners before application of Persa-Gel.</li>
            <li> This product has been a staple for us for years.  I continues to work well and we have never had a bad reaction to it.  I like it better than other brands because of the smooth way it dries onto the skin.  It leaves my face feeling very smooth and tight, where other brands feel a little greasy.</li>
            <li> This is the only blemish cream that I use. It works. Give it a shot. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it either. I found that it did leave a residue that is visible on my brown skin, so I would suggest using it at night time. I have used it during the day and I don&#x27;t think anyone noticed.</li>
            <li> I recently ran out of my acne.org gel, and had to use this while I waited for my other shipment to come in. When I went to apply this to my face I was shocked at how poorly this product absorbs and blends into the skin. Whether I used a little too much isn&#x27;t the point it looked like I had chalk all over my face. I didn&#x27;t have this issue with Dan&#x27;s bp gel no matter how you apply it absorbs well into the skin. The only reason I gave this product two stars was because I didn&#x27;t have any break outs the three days I had to use it.</li>
            <li> I needed a spot treatment asap, my skin routine that I had been using for around a month was not working. I picked up this stuff and I put it on my skin and I saw results almost immediately. I had a lot of little acne bumps on my forehead, and after coming back from driving for a couple of hours, they were significantly reduced. My skin has cleared up more in 2 days than it has in a month of using this other acne kit I bought. But after reading the reviews, I think it is for milder acne/not for super sensitive skin, because it is drying, but it does work. I LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a week now and I do feel like my acne has been getting better. The important thing to know is that it is 10% benzoyl peroxide so you&#x27;ll feel a very tingly sensation, if not even close to a slight burning if you have sensitive skin.The instructions say use 1-3 times a day, and apply a THIN layer over the break out. NEVER use this more than a couple of times a day as it can seriously dry out your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My regime for facial care consists of CeRave hydrating cleanser, followed by a Clean &amp; Clear 10% benzoyl peroxide wash and then applying facial moisturizer(oil free preferably) and then the Clean and Clear Persa-Gel 10. Do this twice a day, preferably after a shower as the hot shower will open up your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: This product doesn&#x27;t help reduce/prevent acne, this is just to get rid of current acne. It&#x27;s your job to keep your face clean and eat healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this product is too strong for you, I would recommend either a salicylic acid or a prescription from a Dermatologist for Clindamycin or Differin.</li>
            <li> works okay for my teen. i have tried many others and this worked pretty good. arrived in perfect shape.  thank you</li>
            <li> I actually bought this product to use for getting permanent marker stains off of an American Girl doll. It worked very well for that.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s working for me. My face is super itchy and this is the 2nd day I&#x27;m using it. I do believe my skin I starting to peel from it as well :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what to rate this..&lt;br /&gt;I had a horrible reaction to it, my face was red, itchy, and peeling. Lasted a little over a week. Once it healed my skin was surprisingly in better condition. Looked a lot better then before, kind of had a glow to it, and seemed softer. Don&#x27;t know if I would use this product again due to nasty side effects, but dang my skin looked good after! Haha&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have acne to begin with I think I&#x27;m just self conscious about my skin cause I had a lot of pimples when I was younger so I tend to look for acne treatment products to rid of my \\&quot;scars\\&quot; I guess, so not sure if it will help with acne.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best and strongest non-prescription acne medication on the market. Yes, it dries your skin - you can&#x27;t jump feet first into twice a day usage and must follow up with a moisturizer. I also avoid the sensitive areas around my lips, eyes, and ears or they itch/peel. With less than one month of usage, old acne scars have faded and new breakouts are almost obsolete. With a little patience, this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I bought Clean&amp;Clear Persa-Gel treat adult acne when I get an occasional break out, and find it to work well.  This gel is white and leaves a bit of residue on the skin. I usually apply it at night. However if I notice a zit starting in the morning I dab a bit of it on my face on the way to work and then I need to remember to remove it after I get there.  Also be careful not to get it on any clothing, as it will behave as a bleach and leave spots.  I also let it dry out before going to bed not to leave marks on the pillow case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a strong prescription (10% benzoyl peroxide) and is very effective, but you need to gradually increase its use (per instructions) to avoid peeling skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> Suddenly had an adult acne breakout around my t-zone, hadn&#x27;t had acne since a teen, making it about 10 years or so. Tried salicylic acid products, worked terribly. Then I remembered that the only thing that worked for me as a teen was benzoyl peroxide, purchased this, and it worked wonderfully. Will be repurchasing this again and again as needed.</li>
            <li> I have severe Acne and I had to go to the dermatologist. I stopped going because of my insurance (too expensive) A few months back, I started having breakouts right by my jaw area and I would wash and exfoliate and they wouldn&#x27;t go away. I ordered this little cream and I applied it with a little with of clyndamycin (I had some left over capsules) Just pop the capsule open and put a little bit, I would say about a quarter of the powder in a tablet. DO NOT put too much because you will irritate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Okay, now with that said. I have OILY SKIN and it&#x27;s pretty strong. I applied it every evening for about a week or two. On day 3 I had to stop because of the itchiness. I would not recommend applying this cream every night for ppl with sensistive skin. But my acne problem has gone away... Well, it has moved now to my chest, Now I&#x27;m gonna try the cream on my chest. I love it! Cheap and easy</li>
            <li> I tried several over-the-counter acne treatment and WHILE this worked, it was the best, clearing up my breakouts within a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this three stars for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. After a few months (7) it was no longer effective. It had not expired, it just no longer worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I found it very drying.  My face was dry and taut and felt coarse to the touch. I had to use a moisturizer every few hours.</li>
            <li> this works and it works fast,if there is one acne spot treatment to get it would be this .i didn&#x27;t think it would work so i was pleasantly surprise by this</li>
            <li> I never really get breaks outs, I was one of those lucky people who never got pimples, I have had little tiny barely noticeable bumps on my chin for about a year now- once and a while id get a pimple there but nothing crazy&lt;br /&gt;. this week I noticed the hoards of little bumps on my chin growing into pimples- about 70% of my chin was soon covered with acne and I was so upset because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would ever stop.&lt;br /&gt;My mom gave me this product and I just put it on yesterday (when the acne was at its worse) and i slept with it on, woke up this morning and looked in the mirror- WOW, I was shocked. now there are only two visible little red zits left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what im even MORE excited about is that this not only helped the bigger pimples, but actually cleared up the little annoying bumps on my skin Ive had for years in the span of a day and one night (I used it all day yesterday).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one last thing, If you have acne and wash your face a lot- remember to not use a wash cloth but instead use a paper towel to dry your face. and NEVER use a loofa, they are found to be crawling with bacteria.</li>
            <li> I tried a 4% prescription body wash that worked well but didn&#x27;t completely clear me. After that I tried an 8% OTC body wash from Panoxyl, which seemed to hardly work at all. I decided that I needed something stronger that would stay on the skin longer. This gel works better than either of the two other products and it works fast. I use it once every other day and it really dries up anything active and prevents others from forming. Usually exfoliation with a wash cloth will take care of any flaking and I haven&#x27;t had issues with hyperpigmentation from the benzoyl peroxide like some do. If I get particularly flaky in spots, a little medical tape works well to pull it off. I don&#x27;t use this on my face, it&#x27;s probably too harsh for that, but on my shoulders during the summer when sleep-sweating makes me break out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years.  I use it primarily as a preventative measure.&lt;br /&gt;It keeps major breakouts away.  When I do get the occasional Zitzilla, I put&lt;br /&gt;an extra dab of this on and by morning it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  This doesn&#x27;t dry out&lt;br /&gt;my face or make it red like other products.</li>
            <li> Seems to work OK, but I&#x27;m slightly angry about the container design because a couple times I mistook it for toothpaste and put it in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I got my grandson to do a face washing routine twice a day and use this. After almost three weeks, his face is nearlyclear. Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> After applying this &#x27;creamy&#x27; gel for several days, I started to see my skin clearing up around typical trouble spots. The only reason I gave it four stars is because I&#x27;m not seeing instant impact on existing acne as other reviewers did. It only works over time for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also since I apply small amounts, I&#x27;m able to avoid the bleaching effects on towels and sheets. Keep it to small amounts and use a moisturizer and you should be fine.</li>
            <li> if you have a pimple or bumps and you need to rid of it then this is the only way to do it, there&#x27;s nothing else will help as much as this stuff. the only downfall of this cream that it WILL bleach any clothes it touches, including towels, your shirt, etc so be careful. while it will rid of pimples i actually use it as my razor bump defense and seems to work 100% EVEN if you already have the bumps.</li>
            <li> I have bad acne and have for years. Just recently, though, I started getting cystic acne. I tried this product, and at first I thought it was working because my skin seemed to clear up a little after the first night. However, even though I was only using it once a night, it started severely drying out my skin. My skin got very itchy and flaky, and then I started getting acne even WORSE until I had huge patches of itchy acne all over my cheeks and jawline. I would not recommend this for anyone with super sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> I have never had ongoing skin issues until using this gel.  It had a myriad of negative side effects.  1) It severely dries your skin to the point where it&#x27;s itchy and flaky.  My skin was so dry that when makeup covered the area it looked cake-y.  2) It&#x27;s a bleaching agent - not only does it slightly whiten your skin with continued use but it will also bleach anything you touch. 3) It made my skin WORSE.  I was only using this once daily and got a horrible rash on my cheeks around the affected area within a couple of days.  After a week and a half I realized that the cause of my worsened condition was this gel so I stopped using it.  But the rash was so inflamed and itchy that I got MORE huge red bumps that looked like zits.  Anyway, my skin is extremely sensitive now due to the rash and all I have been able to use while it heals is Goat&#x27;s Milk Soap which I highly recommend (buy a well-reviewd one on Amazon) to anyone over these harsh synthetic gels.</li>
            <li> Okay, so this product seems to really work. It shrinks pimples over night and gets rid of them in like two days. The only thing is it is VERY drying. You absolutely have to use a moisturizer after applying this otherwise your skin will feel tight and it will be red and burning. I try not to use it in large amounts, I usually apply a dab to my palm and use a q-tip to apply to the pimple. I would avoid applying to large areas of your face because it creates a lot of peeling the next day. Use a good moisturizer!</li>
            <li> WARNINGI had some acne on my lower jaw (from my pillow...) and silly me, I thought it would be a good idea to apply this in the morning before work.  Well, come laundry day, my good shirts are nearly wasted near the tops of the collars since the bleach from this product rubs onto them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work FANTASTICALLY though... if you have white pillows and only use it before bed as instructed.</li>
            <li> When I started using this product, I noticed that my acne was actually getting clearer. The only thing that I dislike about it is that it over dries my skin a lot, leaving my skin red and itchy. I used to put it on all over my acne spots, pimples, and acne scars. Now I just put it on any pimple that just pops up and that pimple goes away in 1-2 day(s). This product is amazing. I see many people complaining about it, but you have to be careful on how you use it because it has 10% Benzoyl Peroxide. If it gets your skin too irritated, just use it for your pimples only, don&#x27;t rub it around any other area of your face. You can always use another product for your acne if you have sensitive skin, like me.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every other product before, and this is the first one that really helped.  I would definitly recommend trying it out</li>
            <li> For the frist time in 50 years my skin is mostly clear. I use it twice a day on the the t zone. Wish it would come in a bigger unit.</li>
            <li> Even with the hardest pimples! it is like a miracle relief. Especially when you put at night it dries all the acne and oil stuff.</li>
            <li> when i first used this product, i thought i had found the best acne treatment cream ever made. i would put it on my pimple overnight and it would disappear the very next morning, or at least the pimple would have became smaller. But... after months and months of using it, my skin just got immune to the strong chemicals.. and sadly to say, it does not work for me at all anymore. i would recommend this product to you if your someone who gets very little acne, so when a sudden zit comes up this product will work wonders for you.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I get a lot of breakouts on my forehead--especially now that I have bangs and thus produce extra oil in that area. On the nights where I am extra pimply, I simply put a light layer over my affected areas in the evening after I do my facial routine. In the morning, they are ALL gone! It is a miracle! However, please be careful when you&#x27;re sleeping because if this products gets on your pillow and then on your eyes, you might get a negative reaction! I learned this the hard way: I woke up one morning and had really puffy eyes, but it was well worth it as I didn&#x27;t have pimples anymore! Haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also get some bacne (gross) and some on my chest. Even though it makes my skin red and dry, the pimples go away. It&#x27;s the lesser of two evils.</li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE SEVERE ACNE, YOU HAVE TO READ THIS. I&#x27;m a 17 year old girl and have oily, asian skin that was covered with inflamed acne and whiteheads.&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I don&#x27;t know which product from Amazon improved my skin but I have a feeling this one played a huge role in fighting my acne. Let me first tell you what new products I use so you can test them out: Dickinson&#x27;s Original Witch Hazel Pore Perfecting Toner, Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel (Professional), Aloe life Skin Gel, Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Stress Control 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment, and THIS product that I am reviewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be using too many products but I was really desperate for a solution. I went to Korea this summer and spent over $2000 for skin care by a dermatologist. I had three different treatments, one which included laser. I went there twice a week but ironically, my skin got worse and worse. People say tea tree oil works, but even when I burned my whole face with it, 10 huge inflamed acne would appear on my forehead and more on my nose bridge and cheeks. Not only did I start to hate looking at the mirror, my face hurt like there were bruises. Those who suffer from severe acne understand this feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched on Amazon for hours and read hundreds of reviews. Because I read that benzyl peroxide is the best treatment for inflamed acne, I added this product to my cart. It&#x27;s only been 2 days and the result is almost instant. I woke up the next morning after I applied the product and my inflamed acne noticeably shrank. This morning, I woke up and I couldn&#x27;t believe what I was seeing. The acne were not red anymore, so although I still had small bumps, they were not noticeable at all. I know that after a couple more days, my life with painful acne will end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Witch Hazel toner I use, I believe, prevents more inflamed acne from appearing and also completely cleanses the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the whiteheads, I believe the salicylic acid gel peel helpedbecause it peeled the whiteheads without me having to pop them or have them for a long time. I will write a review on this, so look it up on Amazon and check it out! It also has great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never written a review but I remember wanting to see just one review by someone with severe acne like me, not with small pimples that could disappear the next day with good cleansing. I hope a lot of people see this review and try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HUGE ADVICE&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t go to the dermatologist if you have acne like mine because this kind of acne cannot be cured with laser or popping. You will only end up with a red, bloody face and with more acne the next day.&lt;br /&gt;-Always put on sunblock. I know a lot of people think putting on sunblock will clog the pores and cause more breakouts, but in reality, the sun will cause even more. I learned this the hard way. The sunblock I use is Eltamd UV Clear SPF 46. I haven&#x27;t tried it on yet because I just got it a few days ago and I didn&#x27;t want to go out with my acne face. I will use it today now that I am more confident with my skin, so I will definitely write a review on the sunblock in a few days. You can read the reviews from other users now. A lot of people say it&#x27;s amazing and good for acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 10/6/2012: I stopped using this for awhile and switched to using tea tree oil but the oil made my inflamed acne worse, so I recently switched back to the Clean &amp; Clear Persa-Gel. I am not switching back to any other treatment again! I realized what I&#x27;ve been doing wrong this whole time. A lot of acne websites told me to apply a bunch of the creme on my acne overnight, but this only made it worse because the skin also need to breathe. I started putting just thin layers until the creme is not visible and my skin is getting so much better again!!</li>
            <li> I get a lot of those under the skin painful cyst-like pimples, and I have blackheads as well. Sometimes the Persa-Gel helps with shrinkage over a few days, sometimes not at all. I do feel that once the acne has erupted, the persa-gel works faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea why my bathroom towels were having bleach spots until I read the reviews here. Wish I had seen them sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try using the gel on blackheads and post-acne marks as recommended by a reviewer and see if it helps with that, but I have already ordered Buffering Lotion from Mario Badescu in the hopes that it will give better results. We shall see!</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product.  My 11 year old daughter had a little bit on acne on her nose and forehead.  After one use, small bumps similar to a heat rash was all over her face.</li>
            <li> Clean &amp; Clear Persa-Gel 10 is essentially 10% Benzoyl Peroxide cream.  When applied to a blemish or affected area, it helps heal the blemish as well as reduce future breakouts.  I have extremely sensitive skin yet I have not had any problems using this product- it dries but it does not overdry and there is no red areas after treatment.  If you do not rub this product in enough, it will leave a white spot on your face so be sure to properly apply this product.  Keep it away from your eyes as it will sting and be sure to wash your hands after you put in/take out contacts or else you&#x27;ll get an unpleasant surprise.  The Clean &amp; Clear product is really no different than some of the off-brand ones they sell at pharmacies so you might want to save a few dollars and get the generic if you can.</li>
            <li> Yikes, when I used them my eyes swelled shut, so not good. When I got the box I notice the expiration date was only about 15 days away, so I am not sure if that is why but I had to just throw it away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been bothered with occasionally breakouts and acnes and this product really is a very potent, fragrance-free topical disinfectant for blemishes</li>
            <li> i hate when i get pimples especially the whiteheads or clusters of small bumps when i break out sometimes.. this gives me hope lol. i&#x27;m surprised it works well as it does, and i used other products with benzo peroxide 2.5% that worked well and realized this is 10% so it makes sense why it works well.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I highly recommend this product because it works well, very quickly, and puts your mind at ease about breaking out or pimples.  Just don&#x27;t use alot, because it does dry out the skin a little.</li>
            <li> It works very well in reducing time pimples are present.  helps dry them up.  only reason i give 4 is because i was hoping for clear gel.  this is white cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to say that this product works! But be ware of the fact that you need to keep your skin in good condition since all of the impurities are removed and you can rapidly develop acne all over your face as this is strong medicine that stops the outbreak in one section of your face but could come out in another section.</li>
            <li> I have been using this at night time for years. I wash with clean &amp; clear foaming face wash. Then I follow with this. It works. Just be careful not to sleep on any other color pillow case but a white one. It can bleach......</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product because I thought it would help with my acne. From the other reviews, it seem to worked so I decided to try it out. Since I was using it for the first time, I decided to put the gel on specific areas to see if it would make a difference. It did not make any difference... but it&#x27;s all about trial and error when it comes to getting rid of acne. Some things work for people while for others they do not.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I think I&#x27;ve tried almost every product out there, including prescriptions, and Persagel gave me clear skin in only a few weeks, and has kept it clear for months! I find the best routine is to clean your skin with a mild soap at night and apply a thin layer all over (it really helps prevent). In the morning, clean it off and apply moisturizer, something with SPF is best, as this medication will make your skin extremely sensitive to the sun. Do watch for bleaching though, I&#x27;ve ruined quite a few towels with this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used everything under the sun to try to clear up my skin. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff 2-3 times a day and I&#x27;ve noticed a dramatic difference within 4 days now. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This gel works wonders, in one use I could see a difference in the size of my pimples and white heads</li>
            <li> This saved me a trip to the store! I usually don&#x27;t buy these items online, but this was well worth it.</li>
            <li> For about 15 years I&#x27;ve had fairly bad acne. To the point where I was waking up and would immediately go the bathroom to scrub away my pimples before I started my day. I would do that throughout the day. If I didn&#x27;t I would have big puss filled zits after a matter of hours.&lt;br /&gt;I went on Doxycycline, which although worked triggered panic attacks, and tried other topicals with no real results. It was really bad and I decided to go back on Doxy, filled the expensive prescription, and went to a store and picked up this persa-gel. Figuring I&#x27;d give this product one last shot before just figuring I&#x27;d live with the panic attacks.&lt;br /&gt;Within 2 days I noticed I was not producing pimples. I smear it all over my face nightly, and use Clean and Clears exfoliating scrub in the morning, and regular antibacterial soap in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;In the past 5 months I could count the amount of pimples on one hand, whereas before I was using this product I was counting on both hands daily.&lt;br /&gt;When the occasional one comes this works very well to keep it under control.&lt;br /&gt;When I first started you may experience a little bit of itchiness, but it faded after regular use.&lt;br /&gt;Also, your skin may dry out. I stopped using moisturizers as they tended to increase acne no matter what the box said. I splash water on my face a couple times before heading out and that is all the moisture I need.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how this product has changed my life, as I&#x27;m sure you may know, being self-conscious about your acne can ruin or make your feel depressed in your daily life; I haven&#x27;t worried the past 5 months thanks to this product. I can wake up feeling confident about going out and about without checking myself in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Try this product.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle cream, only if you know how to use it. First of all, do not goop on the product all over your face. It is more for spot treatments of pimples that randomly pop out on your face once in a while. I cannot recommend it for perpetual acne sufferers. Also, if your skin starts to peel, please pause the application of this product. If you continue to apply it excessively, it will make your skin flake. Lastly, I noticed that one of my pimples actually turned very hard. After several days, the \\&quot;pimple\\&quot; would not go away. Thus, I had to peel off the scab and decided to see what was going on. I ended up squeezing the area and out popped a VERY hard whitehead. I don&#x27;t know if this product made the pimple byproducts (which was one of those pimples from deeper within the skin) to get stuck underneath the skin and solidify but if this happens to you (the area gets very hard and is a raised bump), I would recommend that you extract the material somehow using some kind of a pimple extractor tool, and follow that up with this product. That area is now healing up nicely. Overall, this is an awesome product! But it might not work for everyone. It definitely decreases the lifespan of a pimple.</li>
            <li> My DH has sensitive skin. He is so much prone for pimples. Helps controlling a real bad pimple subsides in 2 days. best way to use it wash your face at night and apply spots of creams where pimples occur or might occur and get up to a reduced and less inflamed pimple</li>
            <li> it says it comes with two tubes of the gel, when it got here it was only one tube. not to mention it took 8 days to get here. dont waste your time with this crap please.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I keep buying this, it does not work for me. As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s M.O. is to dry out the pimple and all surrounding skin until it&#x27;s so dry it just breaks off like chalk. I don&#x27;t know, but it&#x27;s really uncomfortable. For me it is a cycle of putting on cream, about 15 minutes later the spot feels tight and itchy, so I have to wash it off, then I go back and put more on, etc. etc. The Neutrogena stuff is better and in the same price range. Clean &amp; Clear makes some great face wash, but this one is a fail.</li>
            <li> Already seeing a great reaction. My face is clearing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face isn&#x27;t irritated but it does seem to make my lips feel dry if I get it too close.</li>
            <li> I always like to purchased acne gel for small acne problems. I typically use Clean &amp; Clear. This one is maximum strength so it is very strong. It has gotten rid of the acne I felt forming from being stressed out from finals but you should not apply this every night. This dries out your skin and causes your face to itch so one should use this sparingly and at night with plenty of moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does the job but if your acne is still bad or gets worst, you probably need a dermatologist. This product works for me but does not work for my boyfriend who has to get specialized medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those whose skin break out every once in a while, this is the product to use to get rid of the problem within a few days.</li>
            <li> The gel has more of a lotion consistency. I use a tiny amount on my face at night, and it really helps to clear up and prevent pimples. It does tend to bleach fabrics, so make sure to wash your hands after use, and you&#x27;ll probably want to have white sheets/pillowcases while using this product. One tube lasts me several months, and I&#x27;ve been using this for several years. It works best if I exfoliate in the shower right before, using a face wash with exfoliating beads such as an apricot scrub. I notice a marked increase in pimples when I neglect to use this product for several days in a row, so it definitely helps. I had a friend staying over that used this on her chronic acne, and after just one overnight application her face was noticeably clearer and any remaining pimples were much smaller.&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t cause those hard pimples for me, like other reviewers have said it causes them. It doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to peel or dry out, but my skin is somewhat oily to begin with. If you use a lot, it can leave a white residue, but I use a small amount and rub it in so this isn&#x27;t a problem for me. If you&#x27;re worried about having a reaction, don&#x27;t put it on your face first! Try it on the inside of your elbow. I&#x27;d also recommend using a sunscreen over this if you plan on wearing it during the day, because sun and benzoyl peroxide don&#x27;t mix well.</li>
            <li> I have had a moderate case of adult acne. 23, crazy skin that I have a hard time determining if it&#x27;s dry, oily, combo, sensitve, etc. I suffered a nasty breakout and needed something to get rid of it without strolling into the spa and seeing an esthetican. And yes, I cleanse my face daily too. (This breakout was from stress, hormones, and a nasty habit of touching my face)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was too a point the pigmentation was showing through my make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Neutrogena On-The-Spot treatment but that yielded little results. So, I opted for Clean adn Clear, for I hear such good reviews from them. So, I strolled into the store and bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now recovering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not instant, but the pimple on my forehead is going away and the breakout on my chin is going away as well. It&#x27;s day 2, I just applied it on after washing my face and showering. I&#x27;m going make-up free for a few days so that it effectively works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, I recommend this! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Works fast in just like A DAY! just make sure u use a good moisterizer like Dove for sensitive skin because this has no fragrance and is good for the face. And make sure u use it like 3 times a day. Use alot of Vitamin E with out fragrance products like Herbalife Aloe Vera soothing gel works good for the scars.</li>
            <li> I put this on before bed and it really helps. It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel too greasy and surprisingly enough a small tube goes a long way.</li>
            <li> So far, I gotten this product within 3 days. It&#x27;s nicely packaged and will replace my prescription acne medicine. I&#x27;m starting to see the results.</li>
            <li> I know it says so in the safety warning, but in case you didn&#x27;t read it, don&#x27;t get any of this stuff on your clothes or bed, it will leave bleach spots.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using Benzoyl Peroxide for several years. It is sometimes difficult to find the 10% Benzoyl Peroxide. So we were delighted to find this product here, and for a lesser price than at the drug stores. It is especially convenient now that my daughter has moved out of state for school to have this delivered directly to her. It is a win/win for both of us!</li>
            <li> still works better than most other stuff I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;just use non-comedogenic lotion on a regular basis so your skin doesn&#x27;t flake as much.&lt;br /&gt;use it once a day. more than that your skin will rash up, itch, flake, and turn dark.&lt;br /&gt;I use this with proactiv refining mask and it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet. (the refining mask is only 4 bucks here on amazon and its a 2.5 ounce bottle, might want to give it a shot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t use it in hot sun death baked weather. your skin will only get damaged. its best to apply it at night 2 hours before you sleep.&lt;br /&gt;use wisely, and it will work. if you overdo it, then your skin will develop a resistance to it and eventually lose its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I put it on problem areas or an already formed pimple, followed by my nighttime moisturizer and it works great! Might make your face a little dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> it works as it&#x27;s supposed. If you are going to use it try to use sunblock as well, otherwise your skin will get red.</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because i was all broken out with acne and just started using this product and my acne is finally clearing up.</li>
            <li> Great sale and had no problems what so ever and was happy with everything.  Arrived quickly and in great shape.</li>
            <li> so far, 3 kids (18, 16 and 13) have had no results with this.  The boys may be a little challenged on washing with it twice a day and have more severe acne than the 13yo but I&#x27;m very disappointed that it has not helped them at all.</li>
            <li> It is very good and efficient, I recommend it because while it is very gentle on the skin and clothing colorfast.</li>
            <li> I use this daily or every other day and hardly break out. I have problem skin even though I am in my 30&#x27;s. If I feel something coming on I put this one and wake up in the morning smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.  I caution to not use it too much because it can be drying. I try to use it every other day. If you really have a problem I think there is a lower percentage version. Try that.</li>
            <li> This tube works very well for acne. It does not cause any burning sensation as it contains Benzoyl peroxide. Good for over night use. Dries out skin though. This product is recommended.</li>
            <li> Leaving it on overnight. What I do is put a big glob on the pimple and then wait for it to dry (so then it doesn&#x27;t bleach your sheets). Then if you just go to sleep with it on, it will reduce the size and redness of the pimple. Do this for a couple nights, and the pimple should be gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those with sensitive skin, you might want to try a lower concentration of benzyl peroxide. This concentration can be very drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this all the time and it works really well; it even takes away old hyperpigmentation from acne. It&#x27;s pretty cheap, so if you&#x27;re considering trying it, I would recommend going for it.</li>
            <li> Diet, exercise, hormonal balance, digestive system are more important to keep acne away. If some do pop up, this helps a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best thing to do for most people, if you feel your stomach is feeling weird, take a pro-biotic bacteria tablet the night before, and get a good poo poo the next morning. Works much better to keep acne away.</li>
            <li> I didnt buy this prouduct on amazon, but i did buy it at publix. Im a 13 year old girl and i found this product off of a girl on youtube. She said really great reviews on it so i decided to try it out. This was maybe... 5 months ago? So i got it, and i would wash my face with cetaphil cleanser, put an astrigent on it (i used sea breeze and i loveeee it), then i put on persa gel 10 as the medication, then i put on a cereve moisturizer on top. And literally within 1 week i could already see my moderate to severe acne clearing up. Easily within a short month basically all my acne was gone and i just had a few acne scars, i LOVVVVEEEEEEE this product sooo much. Its what got rid of my acne. I was so self concious and thanks to this i was all cleared up. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I put this product on the acne on my back, let it dry and fell asleep for an overnight treatment. When I woke up the next morning, my pillow case was ruined from this product bleaching it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I tried it agin, but this time on my forehead (where I have the most acne). I woke up the next morning with a bright red/ itchy forehead.&lt;br /&gt;BY ALL MEANS, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> We have tried EVERYTHING to clear up my twin 13 year old boys skin. Prescription, over the counter you name it. I came across this product after feeling very close to giving up. They wash twice a day with purpose soap, and apply a small amount of this gel to their entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am VERY pleased to say that after about 2 weeks their skin began to clear up. After a month, their skin is 90% clear which is wonderful. Hopefully this holds up over time but so far I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried hundreds of acne creams and have never had results like this one before. If I apply this cream 2 or 3 times a day, my pimples are gone by the next day. It works extremely fast which is what I have always looked for. The only problem is it sometimes makes my face a little red and itchy if I use it to often, but that goes away within a few hours, so for me that&#x27;s not a issue. I recommend this to everyone! I will never use another acne product again.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient in this product (benzol peroxide, or whatever) is stronger than in comparable products, and the clean &amp; clear is cheaper. A pretty simple decision. It works well for clearing up my skin from an occasional zit.</li>
            <li> im very pleased with this item it may even be better than those expensive ones you see on t,v, but ok</li>
            <li> Works really well. If I ever notice a small bump starting to form on my face I immediately put this on and it never amounts to anything...just goes back down. It works quickly too. I usually only have to do it once or twice. I only do it at night before bed because I don&#x27;t want to walk around with white dots on my face during the day. If you use it every single day or night, after a few nights your face WILL get really dry though. Try to use it only when necessary, not as a daily regimen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this medication for years. I used to have terrible acne and I still get terrible acne if I don&#x27;t use this every day. I also use the Clean &amp; Clear face wash and moisturizer along with it twice daily.</li>
            <li> Well, I used this on my back, it did help clear it up. I wouldn&#x27;t boast a miracle cream or anything but if you&#x27;re suffering from it like I was any improvement is a good thing!</li>
            <li> I have been religiously using the product for years.  I go through many different face products and some I like and some I don&#x27;t, but this one is a staple.  I use it at night all over my face to keep pimples at bay.</li>
            <li> I am from germany sorry my english is not so good but i want to order this, it is possible? Please answer</li>
            <li> I do see an improvement when using this product however I can only use this product once in awhile because it dries out my skin  and I get this little bumps if I use it more than once every few days. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again but I would recommend to someone who didn&#x27;t have sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> i started using this and my acne seem to be disappearing really fast. i love this product. but sometimes this cream doesnt work on certain place on my face.</li>
            <li> Okay, we all know that some products work while others don&#x27;t in the realm of acne for each individual. I have an oily complexion and this product help suppresses the oil and drys up my skin. I use it only before I sleep and I do not do spot treatment. I liberally, and yes I mean liberally use it like a face mask and wait a good 15 mins for it to dry up before I go to sleep. It helps out and to me it seems that it also help with scars too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for those who have a oily complexion, try it and see how it is. I have been using this for about 3 years now and I got through 3 tubes a month. Also it bleaches, so if you are planning to sleep in it watch out for what type of clothing you have on!</li>
            <li> I had small pimples on my nose it seemed like forever clean &amp; clear persa-gel 10 got rid of them and know I&#x27;m getting rid of the one on my forehead. Clean &amp; Clear Persa-gel 10 you&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> Very strong: I applied it at night and the pimple dried up the next day. However, note that when you go out during the day, the gel does leave a white residue! Just make sure you rub it off or blend it together with your moisturizer to hide it.</li>
