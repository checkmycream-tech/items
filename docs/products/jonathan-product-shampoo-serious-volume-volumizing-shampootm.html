    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Smells good too!  </li>
            <li>My hair was beautiful for days....</li>
            <li>br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li>products smell great.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels and smells great when I use it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li>I loved everything, except the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>getting good hair is not just a matter of using a good product and expect miracles out of it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I wanted something that would work with both fine and color treated hair, and this is great for that.  </li>
            <li>Even my own sylist said, whatever you are using...</li>
            <li>My hair looks so good, healthy and shiny and it cleans my hair fairly better than all of those I have tried before.</li>
            <li>This product has given me great volume, made my hair soft and smells good too.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time and it gave my hair great body.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and after trying every product out there and wanting more volume, I bit the bullet and paid the $60 for shampoo/conditoner and foam set.</li>
            <li>They washed my hair just fine, but I didn&#x27;t get the spectacular results that the company claims.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews of Jonathan&#x27;s products, I wasn&#x27;t completely sure I would like them, but wanted to try the shampoo, conditioner and Dirt after seeing him demonstrate Dirt on TV.  </li>
            <li>It worked okay, but I need to get used to it.</li>
            <li>but it turns my fairly healthy hair into the texture of straw.  </li>
            <li>I made sure to use it on and off to be sure it was the Jonathan shampoo..</li>
            <li>I think I will continue to use and will buy again! :-)</li>
            <li>Definitley better than most shampoo&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;ll admit.</li>
            <li>the volume created by the products was all flyaway hair: styled by the static electricity generated by my hair being devoided of any moisture that it once held by this lovely \\&quot;dessicant\\&quot; shampoo.  </li>
            <li>After 3 days of feeling the wicked witch of the west was having better hair days than I was, I returned the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyone who is that determined to make the best product on the market, obviously will do whatever it takes to make it happen.</li>
            <li>*love*</li>
            <li>/&gt;a satisfied customer in Maine</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I bought some for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>It is the only shampoo that gives me good hair days!</li>
            <li>it lathered just fine</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and was hoping to get some volume by using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and this shampoo gave it a nice healthy feeling and more volume than my previous shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this \\&quot;amazing-hyped\\&quot; shampoo,I bought the kit from QVC.All</li>
            <li>It feels clean and sleek.</li>
            <li>I also use the thickening foam, no need to blow dry to get great volume.    </li>
            <li>I was hoping for shiny clean hair.  </li>
            <li>Go to Jonathan&#x27;s website for full directions, it will help.</li>
            <li>The one thing that I found out though is that you do not have to use very much as it makes lots of lather!  </li>
            <li>This product made my hair, very very full, FULL of shine, and very soft.</li>
            <li>It is especially great with my very hard water.  </li>
            <li>WELL WORTH THE COST.</li>
            <li>But it is worth the 20 bucks.</li>
            <li>I could feel the volumizing effect right after rinsing, after which I used the volumizing conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My hair, is very damaged, brittle and FULL of split ends.</li>
            <li>I have very fine blonde hair that will not hold a hairstyle.  </li>
            <li>First the volumizing shampoo:  </li>
            <li>Would maybe recommend to lather the shampoo in your hands first then work thoroughly</li>
            <li>Plus this shampoo is very concentrated so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot!  </li>
            <li>I have tried many   volumizer shampoos with no use, I would not say this shampoo gives such lift to my root</li>
            <li>When I first tried it</li>
            <li>After several washes I can say that I love this shampoo</li>
            <li>-Dried my hair, and right there, I knew that this product is definitely the BEST hair product BY FAR, that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, bodyless hair that is short and  high- and low-lighted.  </li>
            <li>And if so, I am willing spend 1k to stock up and save as much as I can.</li>
            <li>I am still trying to figure out if it worth the price, but overall is not a bad product.</li>
            <li>Oooo, \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; - no animals sacrificed in the making or testing of this - \\&quot;vegan\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I headed into the shower with confidence that I had finally dumped $35 on a shampoo and conditioner set that would make a difference to my fine straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Make sure your hair is wet, not just damp, and you should not have a \\&quot;lathering problem\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>you hair feels very damaged.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After seeing how much the product was, I cringed at the fact that a bottle of shampoo would be that much.</li>
            <li>bought it, went straight to my bathroom, and washed my hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The quantity is probably the same as any other good product.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, super straight hair, middle to short.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, and am going to try the other products as well.</li>
            <li>I decided to forego the thickening spraygel that I usually use in order to give Dirt an honest try.</li>
            <li>This is my new shampoo!</li>
            <li>For the firt time after long long time I wash my hair every 2 days and my hair look nice and normal.</li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo I have ever tried that has a nice \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; feel rather than the slimy feel of other shampoos.  </li>
            <li>think I need a little more practice with this product since I am not a hairdresser.  </li>
            <li>Definitely not thick.  </li>
            <li>After using it for a few days now my hair has never looked better, I truly feel like this shampoo/conditioner was meant for me.  </li>
            <li>First, there are a lot of reviews on Amazon for Jonathan Product that aren&#x27;t actually reviewing the particular item for sale (example: reviewing Dirt in the Volumizing Shampoo sales.)   </li>
            <li>All Hype-No Action!</li>
            <li>I later, literally dragged myself to Sephora to purchase this shampoo/conditioner after knowing that I was willing to take a risk that could eventually end up in my closet.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s vegan and doesn&#x27;t contain sulfates, I wanted to love it, but alas it didn&#x27;t get my hair clean, and left a residue.</li>
            <li>but I would confidently say that a little amount of this shampoo has made a big difference to the greasy look of my hair.</li>
            <li>I never thought it would be possible to have my hair feel so good with such hard water.   </li>
            <li>I had to smear \\&quot;Dirt\\&quot; on my head to get it to calm down.  </li>
            <li>The lack of sulfates really does make a different on overall hair texture.  </li>
            <li>There is no other product like it.</li>
            <li>The conditioner was a very light, thin substance.</li>
            <li>There is a little less lather than you may be used too, but washes out fine and the conditioner leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo because I wanted my hair to remain clean for at least 2 days</li>
            <li>And the size and price are comparable to other high quality salon brands I have used.  </li>
            <li>I would really like to know what product half of you are using.</li>
            <li>I have flat root, straight hair as a result I need to wash my hair every other day</li>
            <li>It goes back to normal texture if I use my other shampoos.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Next time I will put it on completely dry hair and apply it from the bottom going up and underneath.  </li>
            <li> If you look in beauty supply stores there are other brands that are sulfate-free also, such as Mastey(Code Red)</li>
            <li> After watching Blow Out and seeing how passionate Jonathan was about his product, he sold me.</li>
            <li> I have VERY thin and fine hair, and this adds the body and volume I need.  </li>
            <li> $60 is alot to pay for itchy dry hair.</li>
            <li> As soon as I put my hair down from a pony tail (I&#x27;m a waitress), INSTANTLY everyone noticed my hair.</li>
            <li> ( it doesn&#x27;t lather as well as some shampoos that have lots of glycerine in them) and only apply the conditioner towards the end of your hair and leave in for a few min.  </li>
            <li> A few times I had to use a different shampoo afterwards to remove the hairspray.</li>
            <li> This product did not leave my hair in th least bit dry and &#x27;&#x27;straw like&#x27;&#x27; quite the opposite.</li>
            <li> and I used only a small amount.  </li>
            <li> Now I know why these products should all be used in conjunction with each other.</li>
            <li> I usually use Aquage products because they don&#x27;t weight my hair down and especially  like the thickening spraygel for body.</li>
            <li> It does dry my hair out a little, but I just comb the conditioner through my hair in the shower and leave it in a little longer</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I was a little worried about using the product I had already ordered.  </li>
            <li> I used the smallest amount and my hair was slightly damp.  </li>
            <li> And no amount of the so-called conditioner helped to right the wrong!  </li>
            <li> I still use the other products, but stick to Pantene Volumizing Shampoo and Conditioner, which works just as well, if not better, plus its $30 less...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> My hair is as limp as ever.</li>
            <li> Waste of money in my book.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> My hair was well limp.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what is in this stuff</li>
            <li> The bottles are small, 8 oz.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews, I was a bit skeptical of actually buying this product.  </li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> I felt that my hair was difficult to comb.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was once again disappointed by Jonathan (and again I mean the Product not the man as I have never met him and frankly after trying these products I am unsure if I ever will).   </li>
            <li> I was clearly disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> Now my worst fear is that it will be discontinued for any reason.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was so excited to try this \\&quot;amazing-hyped\\&quot; shampoo,I bought the kit from QVC.All I can say is what a disaster.My hair which is coarse,it instantly turned to straw. No lather,horrible tangles,the conditioner did not help at all (left it on for 10-15 min).I also contacted Jonathan Procduct,Inc(4) times and left messages for them to please call me to discuss the problem with their product. NO RESPONSE! All Hype-No Action! Don&#x27;t waste your money. $60 is alot to pay for itchy dry hair.If you look in beauty supply stores there are other brands that are sulfate-free also, such as Mastey(Code Red)</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews of Jonathan&#x27;s products, I wasn&#x27;t completely sure I would like them, but wanted to try the shampoo, conditioner and Dirt after seeing him demonstrate Dirt on TV.  I have very fine, bodyless hair that is short and  high- and low-lighted.  I usually use Aquage products because they don&#x27;t weight my hair down and especially  like the thickening spraygel for body. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jonathan products smell great.  Additionally, I had no problem with the size of the bottles.  The quantity is probably the same as any other good product.  First the volumizing shampoo:  it lathered just fine and I used only a small amount.  I could feel the volumizing effect right after rinsing, after which I used the volumizing conditioner.  Again, no problem.  I decided to forego the thickening spraygel that I usually use in order to give Dirt an honest try. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I think I need a little more practice with this product since I am not a hairdresser.  I used the smallest amount and my hair was slightly damp.  I also need a haircut at the moment.  Next time I will put it on completely dry hair and apply it from the bottom going up and underneath.  It worked okay, but I need to get used to it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  try it...you&#x27;ll like it.  Sandra in Tulsa</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I was a little worried about using the product I had already ordered.  After using it for a few days now my hair has never looked better, I truly feel like this shampoo/conditioner was meant for me.  I have fine, super straight hair, middle to short.  It feels clean and sleek. The conditioner smells like pina coloda, yum!  I would definatly recommend this for my hair type.  Would maybe recommend to lather the shampoo in your hands first then work thoroughly( it doesn&#x27;t lather as well as some shampoos that have lots of glycerine in them) and only apply the conditioner towards the end of your hair and leave in for a few min.  Hope that helps!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and was hoping to get some volume by using this shampoo. My hair is as limp as ever. The shampoo didn&#x27;t even remove the hairspray on my hair. A few times I had to use a different shampoo afterwards to remove the hairspray. Waste of money in my book.</li>
            <li> I have been using the volumizing shampoo and conditioner for 2 weeks.  I love this product!  No build up, No dandruf.  Make sure your hair is wet, not just damp, and you should not have a \\&quot;lathering problem\\&quot;.  I purchased this from QVC and I will definately be a repeat customer.  I have short hair, so this will last me a while.  I loved it so much I bought some for my daughter.  This is my new shampoo!</li>
            <li> Not sure what is in this stuff but it turns my fairly healthy hair into the texture of straw.  Even my own sylist said, whatever you are using...STOP..you hair feels very damaged.  It goes back to normal texture if I use my other shampoos.  I made sure to use it on and off to be sure it was the Jonathan shampoo..and it was.  It went into the trash.  Don&#x27;t purchase this stuff...unless you&#x27;re going for the scarecrow look.</li>
            <li> I would really like to know what product half of you are using. This product did not leave my hair in th least bit dry and &#x27;&#x27;straw like&#x27;&#x27; quite the opposite. I have very fine hair and after trying every product out there and wanting more volume, I bit the bullet and paid the $60 for shampoo/conditoner and foam set. Not with out hearing \\&quot;Are you mad??\\&quot; from my hubby/ This product has given me great volume, made my hair soft and smells good too. There is a little less lather than you may be used too, but washes out fine and the conditioner leaves hair soft. I am still trying to figure out if it worth the price, but overall is not a bad product. I think I will continue to use and will buy again! :-) Definitley better than most shampoo&#x27;s out there. I recommend.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says.  I wanted something that would work with both fine and color treated hair, and this is great for that.  It does dry my hair out a little, but I just comb the conditioner through my hair in the shower and leave it in a little longer and I&#x27;m good to go.  I have VERY thin and fine hair, and this adds the body and volume I need.  I also use the thickening foam, no need to blow dry to get great volume.    The people who rated this low are way off.  My hair feels very soft when its dry, although I will admit not when its still wet.  And the size and price are comparable to other high quality salon brands I have used.  Plus this shampoo is very concentrated so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot!  Go to Jonathan&#x27;s website for full directions, it will help.</li>
            <li> I have flat root, straight hair as a result I need to wash my hair every other day otherwise it looks greasy. I have tried many   volumizer shampoos with no use, I would not say this shampoo gives such lift to my root but I would confidently say that a little amount of this shampoo has made a big difference to the greasy look of my hair. For the firt time after long long time I wash my hair every 2 days and my hair look nice and normal. I loveeeeeeeeeee it!</li>
            <li> I actually bought the volumizing kit from QVC for $60 which included the volumizing shampoo and conditioner, the volumizing foam, Dirt, and the Smoothing Serum. I loved everything, except the shampoo and conditioner. They washed my hair just fine, but I didn&#x27;t get the spectacular results that the company claims. The bottles are small, 8 oz. I think, so for $40 when you buy the shampoo and conditioner, especially if you have longer hair, will last you 2 weeks, maybe. I still use the other products, but stick to Pantene Volumizing Shampoo and Conditioner, which works just as well, if not better, plus its $30 less... Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;ll admit. I bought into the hype.  Oooo, no \\&quot;sulfates\\&quot;...  Oooo, \\&quot;essential water\\&quot;....  Oooo, \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; - no animals sacrificed in the making or testing of this - \\&quot;vegan\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I headed into the shower with confidence that I had finally dumped $35 on a shampoo and conditioner set that would make a difference to my fine straight hair.  And what a difference it made...the volume created by the products was all flyaway hair: styled by the static electricity generated by my hair being devoided of any moisture that it once held by this lovely \\&quot;dessicant\\&quot; shampoo.  And no amount of the so-called conditioner helped to right the wrong!  I tried various amounts of conditioner and left it on for longer and longer periods of time without any change in results.  After 3 days of feeling the wicked witch of the west was having better hair days than I was, I returned the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product truly deserves 0 stars!!</li>
            <li> After watching Blow Out and seeing how passionate Jonathan was about his product, he sold me. Anyone who is that determined to make the best product on the market, obviously will do whatever it takes to make it happen. &lt;br /&gt;After seeing how much the product was, I cringed at the fact that a bottle of shampoo would be that much. I later, literally dragged myself to Sephora to purchase this shampoo/conditioner after knowing that I was willing to take a risk that could eventually end up in my closet. &lt;br /&gt;I bought it, went straight to my bathroom, and washed my hair. The shampoo did not lather, which I expected considering there is no harsh detergents or sodium lauryl sulfate. The conditioner was a very light, thin substance. Definitely not thick.  &lt;br /&gt;Finale-Dried my hair, and right there, I knew that this product is definitely the BEST hair product BY FAR, that I have ever used. My hair, is very damaged, brittle and FULL of split ends. This product made my hair, very very full, FULL of shine, and very soft. My hair was beautiful for days.... &lt;br /&gt;Last test.. going to work. As soon as I put my hair down from a pony tail (I&#x27;m a waitress), INSTANTLY everyone noticed my hair. They asked \\&quot;what did you do?? your hair is soo beautiful\\&quot;.. I told them \\&quot;40 dollar shampoo and conditioner\\&quot; WELL WORTH THE COST. Definitely a salon in a bottle. Now my worst fear is that it will be discontinued for any reason. And if so, I am willing spend 1k to stock up and save as much as I can. There is no other product like it.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s vegan and doesn&#x27;t contain sulfates, I wanted to love it, but alas it didn&#x27;t get my hair clean, and left a residue. Just not for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because I wanted my hair to remain clean for at least 2 days and I chose this one because the ingredients. When I first tried it I was not impressed with the results. I felt that my hair was difficult to comb. After several washes I can say that I love this shampoo and I will definitely buy it again. My hair looks so good, healthy and shiny and it cleans my hair fairly better than all of those I have tried before.</li>
            <li> I was clearly disappointed in this product.  I was hoping for shiny clean hair.  After using Dirt, the product as I am personally quite hygenic, I needed to get rid of that substance immediately.  Unfortunately I was once again disappointed by Jonathan (and again I mean the Product not the man as I have never met him and frankly after trying these products I am unsure if I ever will).   My hair was well limp.  And I cannot tell you enough times that this is well unacceptable.   No wonder he throws his stuff around the room, I was quite tempted myself!!!</li>
            <li> I have very fine blonde hair that will not hold a hairstyle.  This is the only shampoo I have ever tried that has a nice \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; feel rather than the slimy feel of other shampoos.  It is the only shampoo that gives me good hair days!</li>
            <li> As with any volumizing shampoo, the effect was not what I was hoping for.  Instead of luxurious locks cascading to my shoulders, I was left looking like Rosanne Rosannadanna.  Total Triangle head.  I had to smear \\&quot;Dirt\\&quot; on my head to get it to calm down.  Now I know why these products should all be used in conjunction with each other.</li>
            <li> First, there are a lot of reviews on Amazon for Jonathan Product that aren&#x27;t actually reviewing the particular item for sale (example: reviewing Dirt in the Volumizing Shampoo sales.)   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Second, getting good hair is not just a matter of using a good product and expect miracles out of it.  My rating is based on the shampoo itself...not the overall style that I got out as a result. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That being said, I *love* this shampoo.  My hair feels and smells great when I use it.  The lack of sulfates really does make a different on overall hair texture.  It is especially great with my very hard water.  I never thought it would be possible to have my hair feel so good with such hard water.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews, I was a bit skeptical of actually buying this product.  I used it for the first time and it gave my hair great body.  My hair is very fine and this shampoo gave it a nice healthy feeling and more volume than my previous shampoos.  The one thing that I found out though is that you do not have to use very much as it makes lots of lather!  Smells good too!  I highly recommend! &lt;br /&gt;a satisfied customer in Maine</li>
            <li> I was in Sephora and realized I was out of shampoo, so I grabbed it with low expectations. But it is worth the 20 bucks. This is the third day I have used it and my hair is fat and holding its style at day&#x27;s end which NEVER happens. I&#x27;m using the same styling products, so I know it&#x27;s the shampoo. Have gotten comments from others as well. I love this stuff, and am going to try the other products as well.</li>
