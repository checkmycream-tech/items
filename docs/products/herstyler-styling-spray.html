            <li>however my girlfriend says it&#x27;s a very good product!</li>
            <li>but it also seems to need heat to work its best.  </li>
            <li>Was happy with shipping time &amp; product!</li>
            <li>It really is awesome!</li>
            <li>smells awesome and works great!!</li>
            <li>the HairStyler Styling Spray is a very good product, it adds volume to my hair.</li>
            <li>It is a very nice product like some comments mentioned but it makes this sizzle noise like it is going to burn your hair</li>
            <li>it was because i love the way her hair serum smells, this product doesnt smell very good though</li>
            <li>Herstyler seems to be a good product</li>
            <li>but i have been looking for a good one for awhile now</li>
            <li>and i loved that this had the argon oil too</li>
            <li>not as good as comparable sprays</li>
            <li>I am so happy I was able to find it on amazon so I can keep ordering it.</li>
            <li>She used the product and was very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this spray!  </li>
            <li>Love the smell!</li>
            <li>Amazon has an amazing price.  </li>
            <li>The seller was not the problem here, it was the product, I just didn&#x27;t care for this as much as I liked.</li>
            <li>i started with the Herstyler argon oil hair serum (must have for nice hair by the way)</li>
            <li>it holds my curls nicely.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to everyone who wants the perfect hairspray!</li>
            <li>Also said it had a nice smell.</li>
            <li>I bought a HerStyler flatiron at the state fair two years ago and was given a bottle of this spray for free.  </li>
            <li>I love the spray and I love the ease of ordering thru Amazon.</li>
            <li>This stuff sells for much more at the mall.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I can save $$ without sacrificing quality.  </li>
            <li>I think u will enjoy!</li>
            <li>Not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Also works as a great hairspray that holds really well</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this spray.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff went to the mall awhile back and bought some awesome product</li>
            <li>Still need to try product. :)</li>
            <li>Has great hold and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I very rarely leave reviews, but I wanted to be sure to leave one for this spray.  </li>
            <li>I use this as you would a hair spray, and even when I wake up the next morning my hair looks great and still has curl.</li>
            <li>Also, Bumble and Bumble Invisible Oil Primer is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>BUT it WON&#x27;T. Don&#x27;t let the sound scare you.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making it available.</li>
            <li>all in all quality product with argon oil that makes your hair nice and soft, what&#x27;s not to like? :)</li>
            <li>this has a really good smell, but doesn&#x27;t hold like I would like it to hold, my hair is thin, might do better with thicker hair or one than hold curl good</li>
            <li>I originally received this hair style spray as a christmas gift from my boyfriend&#x27;s mom and found that I just adore it.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of the original herstyler styling spray.</li>
            <li>I like the old kind without the oil.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve found good products that will keep my style in place all day and into the next.  </li>
            <li>it holds for a good 6-8 hours and doesn&#x27;t give you an extra sticky feel if you get any on your skin.</li>
            <li>This is a true test because the beach always turns my hair into a frizzball</li>
            <li>I have tried many expensive brands from the salon and like this best.</li>
            <li>flatiron and your hair is smooth and straight for days!  </li>
            <li>love it, and the whole line smells pretty.</li>
            <li>It also works very well on my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes your hair smooth, straight and shiny.</li>
            <li>I will buy from this seller again though because I do like the other products they carry and they have really good prices.</li>
            <li>I love the Nexxus hairspray a lot, it gives natural invisible hold that really works for the duration.</li>
            <li>Also works well with hot rollers or curling irons.</li>
            <li>this is a great hairspray for when you want a good hold but not something to make your hair hard and stiff</li>
            <li>Good if your looking for a very stiff hairspray.</li>
            <li>Has a very high water content.</li>
            <li>IT WAS REAL.</li>
            <li>It controls frizz, provides thermal protection and makes my hair really shiny.  </li>
            <li>Not for curly hair that you are trying to wear straight.</li>
            <li>I rate this product a 3..does not sprayed evenly..comes out in clumps and very sticky.</li>
            <li>Spray is really sticky and sometimes clogs.</li>
            <li>but very expensive.when i saw the price</li>
            <li>I received this product a day early than expected wrapped and packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>Love their other products</li>
            <li>I spray this in my hair as I blow dry it with a round brush and it gives great volume and hold.  </li>
            <li>I love this hairspray for my fine, thin hair, it holds the set</li>
            <li>, thats the main reason i bought</li>
            <li>These three products held my style all day, even in the high humidity.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this styling spray.</li>
            <li>In the morning I used a curling iron to create big waves and it helped define the curls really well.  </li>
            <li>and i was very dissapointed to find out that it didnt have the same smell as the hair serum</li>
            <li>You can use it on wet hair and scrunch/air dry for nice waves, or spray on wet hair then blow/</li>
            <li>i typically do not like hairspray</li>
            <li>Recommend it especially if you have naturally curly hair like me!!</li>
            <li>After using this hair styling spray no other hairsprays cut it.</li>
            <li>This spray held my loose waves very well.</li>
            <li>Makes hair feel super stiff</li>
            <li>I have very thick, heavy long hair and have used all sorts of hair sprays, from cheap to expensive brands, and this is the best I have used by far.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it works really well.</li>
            <li>First I used a primer on wet hair and then sprayed on Herstyler and let it air dry overnight.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> (i usually have dry frizzy hair that is naturally wavy).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s mega rainy here, thick, shoulder length African American hair can sometimes lose the look of the braid out or twist out you worked on nite before.</li>
            <li> I think it holds your style but in a really stick stiff  messy way!!</li>
            <li> I sprayed this on my hair after I blow dried and curled it and it turned my hair back to the way it was before I blow dried it.</li>
            <li> I use this product when I get out of the shower and my hair is a little damp</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to style it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need anything heavy ....</li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t sticky or stiff at all.  </li>
            <li> but isn&#x27;t crunchy stiff.  </li>
            <li> I love the Her Styler products, haven&#x27;t been disappointed by any that I have ordered from hair products to stylers!</li>
            <li> It cuts my straightening time in half, makes hair shiney, and it holds the style all day without hard or \\&quot;cruchy\\&quot; hairsprays.  </li>
            <li> I used this for my small wedding ceremony on the beach.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a less expensive alternative</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S A FAKE NAME BRAND.  </li>
            <li> It All spray, which is really expensive.  </li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed and too tired to start all over again.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I like the old kind without the oil.</li>
            <li> I love the spray and I love the ease of ordering thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was given a bottle of this when I purchased a Herstyler straightening iron at the mall.  I spray this all over my dryed hair from root to tip and brush through just before straightening.  It cuts my straightening time in half, makes hair shiney, and it holds the style all day without hard or \\&quot;cruchy\\&quot; hairsprays.  This stuff sells for much more at the mall.  Amazon has an amazing price.  I have tried many expensive brands from the salon and like this best.</li>
            <li> NO SUCH COMPANY CALLED HERSTYLE.  GOOGLE IT FOR YOURSELF.  IT&#x27;S A FAKE NAME BRAND.  NOT NESSISERALY THE SELLERS FAULT.  THEY MAY HAVE BOUGHT IT THINKING IT WAS REAL.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used this personnally...however my girlfriend says it&#x27;s a very good product! Would definetely give this item as a gift again and maybe even try it myself!</li>
            <li> I very rarely leave reviews, but I wanted to be sure to leave one for this spray.  I ordered it, along with the hair serum, and this spray is the only spray I have ever used that holds my curling iron curls all day long.  I have very thick, heavy long hair and have used all sorts of hair sprays, from cheap to expensive brands, and this is the best I have used by far.

            <li> This spray held my loose waves very well. First I used a primer on wet hair and then sprayed on Herstyler and let it air dry overnight.  In the morning I used a curling iron to create big waves and it helped define the curls really well.  I ran my finger through and then sprayed Nexxus Comb Thru hairspray all over.  These three products held my style all day, even in the high humidity.  My hair wasn&#x27;t sticky or stiff at all.  There is some debate as to whether Herstyler is a styling spray or a hairspray.  I used it as a styling spray and it was comparable to Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Does It All spray, which is really expensive.  I was looking for a less expensive alternative and I guess I&#x27;ve found it.  Herstyler seems to be a good product but it also seems to need heat to work its best.  I love the Nexxus hairspray a lot, it gives natural invisible hold that really works for the duration. Also, Bumble and Bumble Invisible Oil Primer is fantastic.  It controls frizz, provides thermal protection and makes my hair really shiny.  I think I&#x27;ve found good products that will keep my style in place all day and into the next.  I will order another bottle of Herstyler.  I&#x27;m glad that I can save $$ without sacrificing quality.  I highly recommend this styling spray.</li>

            <li> Not for curly hair that you are trying to wear straight. Has a very high water content. Love their other products but this one misses the mark. Will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice product like some comments mentioned but it makes this sizzle noise like it is going to burn your hair BUT it WON&#x27;T. Don&#x27;t let the sound scare you. Other than that, it works really well. Makes your hair smooth, straight and shiny.</li>
            <li> I sprayed this on my hair after I blow dried and curled it and it turned my hair back to the way it was before I blow dried it. I was highly disappointed and too tired to start all over again.</li>

            <li> i typically do not like hairspray but i have been looking for a good one for awhile now and i found this. i started with the Herstyler argon oil hair serum (must have for nice hair by the way) and i loved that this had the argon oil too (i usually have dry frizzy hair that is naturally wavy). it holds for a good 6-8 hours and doesn&#x27;t give you an extra sticky feel if you get any on your skin. all in all quality product with argon oil that makes your hair nice and soft, what&#x27;s not to like? :)</li>
            <li> I used this for my small wedding ceremony on the beach.  I loaded my hair with this stuff &amp; it held!  This is a true test because the beach always turns my hair into a frizzball</li>
            <li> Was happy with shipping time &amp; product!</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t need anything heavy .... It&#x27;s just during the spring and it&#x27;s mega rainy here, thick, shoulder length African American hair can sometimes lose the look of the braid out or twist out you worked on nite before. Does NOT make hair flaky and crunchy. I think u will enjoy!</li>

            <li> Did not realize this product had radon oil in it. Not my favorite. I am a fan of the original herstyler styling spray.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my niece.  She used the product and was very satisfied with it.  Also said it had a nice smell.</li>
            <li> I think it holds your style but in a really stick stiff  messy way!! Makes hair feel super stiff ‼️</li>
            <li> Good if your looking for a very stiff hairspray.</li>
            <li> love it, and the whole line smells pretty.</li>
            <li> this is a great hairspray for when you want a good hold but not something to make your hair hard and stiff</li>
            <li> the HairStyler Styling Spray is a very good product, it adds volume to my hair. The only objection is that it does not leave it as soft and silky as I expected.</li>
            <li> Has great hold and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> I bought a HerStyler flatiron at the state fair two years ago and was given a bottle of this spray for free.  I LOVE this spray!  You can use it on wet hair and scrunch/air dry for nice waves, or spray on wet hair then blow/flatiron and your hair is smooth and straight for days!  Also works as a great hairspray that holds really well but isn&#x27;t crunchy stiff.  It really is awesome!</li>
            <li> Spray is really sticky and sometimes clogs.</li>
            <li> Must have when using heating elements on your hair. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the Her Styler products, haven&#x27;t been disappointed by any that I have ordered from hair products to stylers!</li>
            <li> Wife said it was too sticky and i was very dissapointed to find out that it didnt have the same smell as the hair serum, thats the main reason i bought it was because i love the way her hair serum smells, this product doesnt smell very good though</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this spray.  It also works very well on my fine hair.  I don&#x27;t use a lot either.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff went to the mall awhile back and bought some awesome product but very expensive.when i saw the price online i had to buy it!!! Recommend it especially if you have naturally curly hair like me!! smells awesome and works great!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell! Still need to try product. :)</li>
