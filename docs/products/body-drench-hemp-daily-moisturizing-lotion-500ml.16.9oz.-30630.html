            <li>I actually love this lotion, however when I received this item, the pump was broke right out of the box.</li>
            <li>I love the LARGE size;</li>
            <li>I love the large size and the usefulness of a pump.</li>

            <li>This lotion is no where near the original body drench.  </li>
            <li>and this is certainly one of them.  </li>
            <li>and this certainly does the job.</li>
            <li>but this is for real.</li>
            <li>Very spa like.</li>
            <li>This lotion absorbs quickly and deeply so I don&#x27;t feel \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; after applying.  </li>

            <li>The fragrance is fresh and subtle; nice enough even for a guy.</li>
            <li>Smells odd and does not come close to the moisturizing quality of the original.</li>
            <li>For some reason, this lotion seems to penetrate the skin much better than  the common commercial brands of lotion.</li>

            <li> I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with the lotion, for me with dry skin it is a good supplement to my regular lotion.  I was hoping to be able to replace regular lotion, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this brand -Body Drench-now I think I have my daughter hooked on this lotion as well -this is the only place I can find it</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. Price and service were wonderful.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time.  A friend came to my home and used some on her hands and fell in love with it.  I bought her some for her birthday!</li>
            <li> This lotion absorbs quickly and deeply so I don&#x27;t feel \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; after applying.  I love the LARGE size; great value. I have tried other lotions w/hemp seed oil and find this to be the best. The fragrance is fresh and subtle; nice enough even for a guy. Order arrived on time as promised. I will continue to purchase this product and from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I love body drench for going to the beach/pools... But as a reg routine, I am sticking to the body butters.&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect for moisturizing in between, but I wouldnt say it holds up all day. Sticking to Hemp Body Butter from The Body Shop!</li>
            <li> My hair dresser gave me a small bottle of Body Drench Hemp and another Body Drench moisturizer for Christmas.  The one moisturizer was ok, but not different than many others I have experienced.  The Hemp body Drench is an excellent moisturizer and it is very inexpensive.  I bought 3 bottles, so I wouldn&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> I have sun damage on my arms. The lotion has made my arms heal and look better. The smell is also pleasing. Will recommend this lotion to others. The price is also very good.  S</li>
            <li> This lotion hydrates well.  It&#x27;s really hard to find a great lotion and this is certainly one of them.  First used this at work and when I got home I promptly ordered some.  Will definitely reorder!</li>
            <li> Smells odd and does not come close to the moisturizing quality of the original.</li>
            <li> Body Drench is a great product. I find it to be the best allover moisturizer that I have ever used. Non greasy, soaks into the skin. Smells great. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> This lotion is no where near the original body drench.  I&#x27;m not sure why, but it seems to dry the skin.  I still use the original body drench, which I love.</li>
            <li> This is really great lotion and I like the fragrance of the hemp. Body drench absorbs into the skin with absolutely no residue on your hands. A lot claim that but this is for real. Because it absorbs so well you have to use 4-5 times a day. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Body Drench Lotion! It is the only lotion I will use &amp; it is one of the few lotions on the market that has no alcohol ( which dries your skin) in it.</li>

            <li> We discovered this lotion at our local spa and love the way it smells. It&#x27;s very light on the skin, but keeps everyone moisturized. I struggle with getting my family to moisturize. This is the first lotion that they look for WILLINGLY. I have resorted to buying multiple bottles at a time.</li>
            <li> Best lotion everrrrr!!!!! Very hydrating and smells ah-mazing!!!!! I have been searching everywhere for this lotion and was extatic to find it here!!!</li>
            <li> I love the large size and the usefulness of a pump. The smell of this body lotion is heavenly. Very spa like.</li>
            <li> What I like most about my Lotion is the pleasant smell, I got the Hemp, I will try the others, but this is my fave.  I have very dry skin and this certainly does the job.</li>
