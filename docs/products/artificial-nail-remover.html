            <li> I used acetone from discount stores prior to this, and tore up my nails trying to get the base coats off.  </li>
            <li> It works very well, but I would recommend people check their fingers for cuts before using it to avoid an awful stinging.</li>

            <li> works well without dryiing out your nails.  The longer you soak them the easier it is to get the gel off.  The directions say to soak them for 15 minutes but it works better if you soak them for 30 minutes.</li>

            <li> I used this, but found that the 100% pure acetone that I got at Walmart worked better.  I probably would not reorder this.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as described and quickly.  I use this to get my &amp;#34;solar&amp;#34; acrylic off of my nails. I let this soak for about 10 minutes on my nail and the acrylic comes right off!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gelish gel nails for a while now, and this is what I use to get it off when it needs to be re-done. It works very well, but I would recommend people check their fingers for cuts before using it to avoid an awful stinging.</li>
            <li> I love this bc it gets the gel polish off quickly and doesnt leave your nails nail and brittle like the pure acetone. Nails actually feel healthy after using. Drawback is its not a lot for your money - you go through the bottle in about 10 removals. A nice thing to add to your gel polish collection.</li>
            <li> I like to stick with products that are brand names, I&#x27;m using all the  products with the Gelish  polish, I think they work better together.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these items.  I t is saving me bunches of money/  I even do my families and friends nails for a small fee.</li>
            <li> Yes I know that simple acetone can also be used but the acetone dried my nails and surrounding areas out a lot. This is much easier on my skin and also does the job faster which makes it well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> The product removed the gel coating but I think I had too many coats from the nail shop applied. Took me quite a while to get most of it removed. There&#x27;s still a bit left. Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s Gelish&#x27;s fault though. I just wanted all that gel to just go already. Think it will work better with fewer coats. Would buy again, though.</li>
            <li> Works great for my gel nail polish removal. It only takes 5 min to remove gel polish. Great product. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the Gelish products. They are of good quality at an affordable price. This product removes no chip nail polish as described when instructions are followed.</li>
            <li> Gelish Artificial Nail Remover is great for removing any type of gel nail polish.  It is a great alternative to acetone, as it doesn’t dry out your cuticles.</li>
