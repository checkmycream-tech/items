            <li> Absolutely love this perfume! So happy it&#x27;s available again</li>
            <li> i love it since my wife loves it as well! Bought it for her because she asked me to buy it! Very gentle and nice smell!</li>
            <li> So sad when I received my Promesse.  It was not what I had expected.  It was a watered down alcohol version of the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; Promesse.  I am so bummed that it was not the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; fragrance.  The box and bottle were the same, they must have done something to it.  Be very careful when you order.  However, this is most favorite smell and I get SO many compliments when I have the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; fragrance.  I wish they still made it.  I am 44 and LOVE Promesse!  Just disappointed it was not REAL.</li>
            <li> Love it and will order again</li>
            <li> excellent product, rich fragrance as ever, hard one of my favorite brands, very fresh scent unmistakable.excuse my English.satisfied with the seller</li>
            <li> Love this scent! It has a light refreshing scent. Not over powering like some perfumes. I deffinately will buy it again</li>
            <li> got it in time for Christmas - my wife loves it - too bad it is not made anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SS</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume since I was 17 and has been my signature smell ever since. I have switched to other perfumes over the years but I always get compliments on this one. I just wish I could buy it from Macy&#x27;s or another store when I run out but I will have to settle for buying it online.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne, however it&#x27;s getting hard to find . I always receive&lt;br /&gt;compliments on this fragrance. I wish the company start making it again</li>
            <li> I am glade I can still fined it although it&#x27;s price is high. It is my favorite perfume, and the only place I could fine it was (unused) was on Amazon .</li>

            <li> Promesse is no longer obtainable as far as I know, so I was lucky to find this one. You can&#x27;t even buy it in France on the open market. But good luck because it&#x27;s a very attractive perfume in the old tradition.</li>
            <li> I love this product and everything about the transaction with the seller when just fine. I&#x27;ll buy it again if it&#x27;s still available. :)</li>
