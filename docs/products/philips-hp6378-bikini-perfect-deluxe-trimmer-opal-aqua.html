            <li>Great buy!!  </li>
            <li>Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>Perfect for all a girls trimming needs.</li>
            <li>Best bikini trimmer ever!</li>
            <li>Works like a charm, great if you&#x27;re like me and allergic to shaving !</li>
            <li>I charged it, followed the directions and wasnt impressed.</li>
            <li>dealer, got in perfect conditions and in time</li>
            <li>This trimmer isn&#x27;t the best, but it does the job.</li>
            <li>it is the best.</li>
            <li>Best epilator out there!</li>
            <li>and I needed to get another trusted Philips Bikini Perfect</li>
            <li>It works great for those purposes but the close shaver didn&#x27;t work at all!  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is awesome!</li>
            <li>Great gadget for the price!</li>
            <li>Not the best razor.</li>
            <li>The body of the trimmer is the perfect size</li>
            <li>I have not been faced with a power outage with the Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size for them, and it keeps me from having to shave my armpits all the time.</li>
            <li>I found it works best if one shapes a teenie-weenie bit (of the brow) at a time -- because, as the instructions indicate, it does remove every hair it touches.</li>
            <li>Does everything it says it will--and does it perfectly.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>and she is very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Seems great!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>They just don&#x27;t make perfect bikini trimmers anymore.</li>
            <li>That being said, this is the best trimmer i have ever bought.</li>
            <li>Once you learn how to use this tool, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Best of its type.</li>
            <li>My wife has been very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I use it alongside a razor to get a perfect bikini</li>
            <li>But this is perfect.</li>
            <li>Awesome electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Not the best product in the world</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li>this kit is very good, it has everything you need, the battery goes very good</li>
            <li>Perfect price, good for travel lovers..</li>
            <li>Great product, great price, great customer service....</li>
            <li>The travel case is utilitarian at best, but the product itself created an enthusiastic fan.</li>
            <li>My wife is quite happy with this razor.  </li>
            <li>The lighted tweezers are great.  </li>
            <li>Has been working great.</li>
            <li>in all, I am happy with this trimmer as it does what it says it does.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a sturdy, ergonomic unit that should get some great years of use.  </li>
            <li>I have the Braun Silk Epil which is great</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a great product.</li>
            <li>I am exceptionally happy with the epi head.</li>
            <li>Works great, no problems at all.</li>
            <li>My wife loves this thing, so that makes me happy with it.</li>
            <li>It gave me great results.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great trimmer.</li>
            <li>It comes with a great carrying  case.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel great, and it isn&#x27;t painless.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For now though, I&#x27;m happy as a clam.rge on this thing seems like it lasts forever.  </li>
            <li>I have not been faced with a power outage with the Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe.      </li>
            <li>For now though, I&#x27;m happy as a clam.</li>
            <li>Philips Hp6378/10 Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe, Opal / Aqua</li>
            <li>Philips Hp6378/10 Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe</li>
            <li>Great for in the shower or on land.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great woman&#x27;s gadget and it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does a great job (no pulling, etc.) of keeping the hedges trimmed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>and that look very nice</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>OK, you look great!</li>
            <li>I mostly use the two trimmer attachments without the hair length adjusting attachments because I find they work best by themselves.</li>
            <li>Which is nice because it&#x27;s already a chore all of us women detest!  </li>
            <li>best razor ever..much better than batteries</li>
            <li>Nice touches like the led lit tweezers/mirror and convenient carry bag rounds out the package and makes it a great value.</li>
            <li>Good power and have had no problems with holding a charge.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I loved the eyebrow attachment and the lighted tweezer that came in the box.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this trimmer.</li>
            <li>If you are in a hurry and you want to DIY, the eyebrow trimmer is a good choice.</li>
            <li>The Good:   </li>
            <li>I wish there was a good electric bikini shaver out there</li>
            <li>, my wife loved it!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>The BF isn&#x27;t complaining so all is good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fairly ergonomic</li>
            <li>It works really good.</li>
            <li>I bought mine elsewhere.. and loved it.  </li>
            <li>This product is of fair quality.</li>
            <li>You can use it in the bathroom which is good.</li>
            <li>The good - The head is detachable and all of it is water proof</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had an electric shaver before and feel this one is on the high-end quality wise</li>
            <li>Awesome way to stay trim and clean.</li>
            <li>The Philips Hp6378/10 Bikini Perfect Deluxe Trimmer put my worries to rest -- it was easy to use and worked magically!     </li>
            <li>the brave, there is also an epilating attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean-up of the Philips Hp6378/10 Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe&#x27; attachments was an absolute breeze!  </li>
            <li>the brave, there is also an epilating attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean-up of the Philips Hp6378/10 Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe&#x27; attachments was an absolute breeze!  </li>
            <li>this point I&#x27;m beginning to get familiar with the Philips Hp6378/10 Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe</li>
            <li>The eyebrow attachment is great for trimming in between waxes, or on the top of the eybrow where I prefer not to tweeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very cute</li>
            <li>Great love it makes shaving a breeze</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>She was very satisfied, but the battery has lost capacity.</li>
            <li>I am very glad that I purchased this item.</li>
            <li>The design is beautiful, easy to hold.</li>
            <li>I received very fast and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Buy this you will love it!</li>
            <li>: use the epilator on your knees - it is way better than shaving or waxing!</li>
            <li>And for me, the epilator is pretty awesome.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am kind of impressed with myself for being brave enough to try the one that attaches to this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing</li>
            <li>I have had this for two years now, and it worked amazingly until my husband broke it.</li>
            <li>She reports it is handy and effective.</li>
            <li>They are actually a nice set of tweezers to tackle any pesky hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great kit and a must for those who like to groom their bikini line and keep things nice and neat.  </li>
            <li>The foil works best when the hair is much shorter or when they are just stub length.</li>
            <li>It is nice that it is usable in the shower and this is where I use it most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At that point I decided it was time to purchase my own.  </li>
            <li>Nice product as a replacement for shaving.</li>
            <li>I liked the variety of attachments.</li>
            <li>This product gives a close nice shave.</li>
            <li>Everything fits nicely in the bag supplied.</li>
            <li>Then they were actually handy.</li>
            <li>The attachments offer a nice variety.</li>
            <li>Really nice.</li>
            <li>Best trimmer for intimate place for women.</li>
            <li>Philips Bikini Perfect represents a new breed of product truly tailored toward a woman&#x27;s needs.</li>
            <li>Let me introduce you to my new Best Friend:  </li>
            <li>It is especially good for defining edges rather than shaving completely.</li>
            <li>By far the best bikini trimmer.</li>
            <li>It is good for keeping this from getting overgrown, but not making it smooth.</li>
            <li>It is nice to have so many options</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled.</li>
            <li>Nice to be able to recharge without having to buy batteries.</li>
            <li>The best desciption for its result is that it gives a soft stubly feel after use instead of having a bushy area.</li>
            <li>the attachments are great and useful.</li>
            <li>So easy to use in the shower or out!  </li>
            <li>This was so easy to use!</li>
            <li>The battery life is great and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>and it is a great price and overall great product.</li>
            <li>The battery charges quickly and keeps the charge for a good while.</li>
            <li>It has tweezers with light so that should be better!</li>
            <li>:)  The trimmer is very precise and one does not a lot of pressure is needed.  </li>
            <li>you may end up lopping off more than you desire.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s hit the pool! :)</li>
            <li>The many attachments included allow for customization to trim the way you choose.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, threading is still much better as it looks better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This profuct allows all of those criteria to be satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Each one has a different purpose and they all work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>works better than others.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with the bikini touch pen as well, that way</li>
            <li>hair needs to be longer for it to work better?</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>I love this item.</li>
            <li>I also love the eyebrow tools for shaping.</li>
            <li>: I absolutly love the eybrow and depilatory attachments.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Trimmer my hair short within 15 minutes which is perfect for my schedule.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I think that really shows how great of a product this is that they haven&#x27;t had a need to change it in years - though I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ve probably tweaked some internal things, but it is simply an awesome</li>
            <li>I just truly love this thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think I like this model even better.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a bunch of attachments, most of which I haven&#x27;t used yet.  </li>
            <li>The guard over the end is better than the Remington, but I don&#x27;t like anything else about this shaver.  </li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s a better product.  </li>
            <li>more mobility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>keep wanting to remove more hair and detail more spots from head to toe just because I can...</li>
            <li>I keep wanting to remove more hair and detail more spots from head to toe just because I can...</li>
            <li>my wife didn&#x27;t like there are much better out there</li>
            <li>I use this more often than I use my full-sized epilator/shaver.</li>
            <li>That is, until Now! :)  </li>
            <li>Hollywood, Here I Come! :)</li>
            <li>:)  --Katharena</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Love that its wet/dry</li>
            <li>5 stars for the provider and product :)</li>
            <li>do love the fact that this trimmer can be recharged and is cordless for use.</li>
            <li>, it replaced and works better than the shaver I had before it.</li>
            <li>love it..</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through a couple of cheap ones, and this is by far the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it works!</li>
            <li>In short, it&#x27;s the perfect</li>
            <li>I wish the shaver was able to trim my pubic hairs lower.</li>
            <li>Its a cute kit though.</li>
            <li>comes with many Many parts.</li>
            <li>This product has a longer operating time and better equipment.</li>
            <li>Love this device.</li>
            <li>Enjoying the purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the epilator attachment.</li>
            <li>I use this mostly for underarms and bikini.</li>
            <li>As many reviewers have said - this does not hold a charge.  </li>
            <li>I love that this comes with an epilator.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not hopeful there&#x27;s better out there.</li>
            <li>so I wasnt sure what I was getting into when I purchased this.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>what more could you want.</li>
            <li>but it takes way too many strokes with the trimmer accessories.</li>
            <li>The micro shaver does not shave but I like it better than the trimmer because it can&#x27;t cut you and it trims shorter.</li>
            <li>I am pleased.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use and clean!!!</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s pretty good; best for maintenance.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to clean, a good product I like it and recommend it.</li>
            <li>:) I will probably wax if I go on a vacation and need everything clean, but this will be something I use all the time!</li>
            <li>First one worked good for about a month and then would not take a charge.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Precision Trimmer\\&quot; leaves a significant length of hair!</li>
            <li>This product is ok - I like that you can use it in the shower since it&#x27;s always best to shave wet hair that&#x27;s been softened.</li>
            <li>The Philips Hp6378/10 Trimmer also comes with additional items -- a pair of ex-foliating gloves, a pair of lighted tweezers with its own case, as well as a travel bag that the shaver, attachments, tweezers, and gloves as fit comfortably in.      </li>
            <li>This device is also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Philips HP6378 Bikini Perfect Deluxe Trimmer is much cheaper than SEPHORA and it&#x27;s the same product they sell in the stores</li>
            <li>Prednisone has turned me from a lovely thing who has always appeared fairly light and smooth in the fur coat department to wondering how much more medication it will take until I&#x27;m dealing with a five o&#x27;clock shadow (on my face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After  one get&#x27;s past that, the Philips Hp6378/10 Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe will need a 10 hour charge, which will give plenty of time to read over the (easy to follow)</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and had to stop waxing all together, and shaving irritates me too much, so this was the perfect solution.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to choose the desired length.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to cut myself.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for well over a year, and its going strong.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy the idea of the light up tweezers as the light provides a lot of illumination and you can see the hairs better.</li>
            <li>Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe comes with many attachments so it can be used on pretty much any fuzz the female body can grow.  </li>
            <li>At the end of the day, I need comfortable clean results much more than I need to have my trimmer look ladylike.</li>
            <li>The Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe smoothly handles the facial hair, shaping my brows, and even offers an attachment to put the eyebrow antennae in their place.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold and easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmer is light and easy to carry around.</li>
            <li>It works fine in and out of the shower.</li>
            <li>It pulls out all of the hair except for the really fine ones.</li>
            <li>and it works, fine.</li>
            <li>The epilator was fine.  </li>
            <li>It cuts fine without the trimmers on</li>
            <li>This is a good investment so far!</li>
            <li>It is easy to hold and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It is quick and really effective to the point that it was almost fun</li>
            <li>Easy to use - easy to clean.</li>
            <li>In the box is an awesome illuminated brow  tweezer and mirror in a plastic case a little longer than a lipstick tube.</li>
            <li>Besides it makes a huge noise.</li>
            <li>Great personal grooming set with lots of attachments.</li>
            <li>No electric razor will be 100% snag free</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say how precise they are.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>She wasn&#x27;t too keen on using the epilator as it seems rip out the remaining trunks after the initial trim, but everything else works great.</li>
            <li>I wish my two men&#x27;s hair trimmers by the same company would be as attractive and flexible as this one.</li>
            <li>I use it to remove the hair from my legs, and I stay hair free for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Had to replace one that I paid over $100 for 5 yrs ago and am just as happy with this one for only $35.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product just not for me.</li>
            <li>After trying a few attachments, I was impressed by the versatility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of amazed at how much of a workhorse</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of amazed at how much of a workhorse</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One may need to use a sturdy box knife to open the Philips Hp6378/10 Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe and retrieve the product, attachments and extra goodies out of the packaging.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean ..</li>
            <li>and it recently broke, but I&#x27;m so happy with it</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to clean + hygienic.</li>
            <li>As for all the gadgets that come with they sure are all fun to try.</li>
            <li>Twizer light does not work.</li>
            <li>It can give you a close trim, but it won&#x27;t be as smooth as a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to spend more than twenty bucks on a bikini trimmer, but I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>This was so easy to use and did the job so quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve kind of given up on this attachment and use mainly the precision comb and epilator.</li>
            <li>Very practical as it contours around very easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame that men&#x27;s trimming products are so much better designed and engineered and deliver great results without the huge price tag while women have to suffer with crap like this Philips bikini perfect.</li>
            <li>The narrow trimmer is nice, but I&#x27;ve since switched over to the more affordable and effective Panasonic ES2207P.</li>
            <li>This shaver was worth every cent!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny how identical my old Bikini Perfect is to the new one - it hasn&#x27;t changed a bit.</li>
            <li>However, do realize that the trimmer will not give a clean shave.</li>
            <li>Okay, not as great as my last trimmer but does a decent job</li>
            <li>and you now have a styling tool for creating fun bikini area things like hearts, diamonds or (just for fun) how about \\&quot;his\\&quot; favorite team logo.</li>
            <li>and you now have a styling tool for creating fun bikini area things like hearts, diamonds or (just for fun) how about \\&quot;his\\&quot; favorite team logo.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t yet found another that would be better as far as usability and features, though I think this one could be of better quality.</li>
            <li>then I use the razor to clean up.</li>
            <li>Works good but if not real careful</li>
            <li>It is very small and very light, which makes it real handy.</li>
            <li>By far I love it!</li>
            <li>This works so easily, without leavong a rash and trimming the hair pretty precisely, making the area look neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is perfect and it does the job much easier than any other method I have tried.</li>
            <li>Perfect for those hard to reach areas</li>
            <li>This is the first \\&quot;bikini trimmer\\&quot; that I&#x27;ve bought, and I&#x27;m really happy with the initial results from this one.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much the first time that I bought another one.</li>
            <li>This product is really a multiple-use grooming tool, even thought it&#x27;s targeted mostly for the bikini</li>
            <li>No painful nicks.</li>
            <li>This device must be charged a full 10 hours for every 60 minutes you want to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She really likes it and was glad she was able to get very close without worry of nicks.</li>
            <li>I thought it was good enough to travel with</li>
            <li>Many of us wax, trim, shave, depilatate, electro-zap, and laser so that nobody knows how furry we really can</li>
            <li>and I can shape my brows with ease and without my hands going into full on crampy arthritic</li>
            <li>:) That would really set you apart from all the rest...</li>
            <li>:) That would really set you apart from all the rest...</li>
            <li>because I thought the attachments looked cool.</li>
            <li>There are two tiny batteries inside that must not be in good working condition.</li>
            <li>A word about the packaging - it&#x27;s very cute and girly; definitely made me excited to put this product to use.</li>
            <li>Their reviews were good, but the price was a little higher than I liked</li>
            <li>The shape of the precision trimmer is more like a mini blade razor head rather than a narrower tipped attachment as seen in older models.</li>
            <li>It comes with tweezers that have a tiny light attached to them, nice bonus.</li>
            <li>Charging is quick for a rated 60 minutes of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Philips trimmer seems to have everything she needs in her fight, and it has already proven a worthy adversary in her battles.</li>
            <li>is that it charges quickly and doesn&#x27;t need to be charged too often.  </li>
            <li>I love and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor with high hopes despite the many reviews that told me not to.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty certain that the epilator on this one will leave you with more damage than not).</li>
            <li>1- It charges very quickly and holds the charge very well.   </li>
            <li>Works really well and is very quick.</li>
            <li>personally only really use the epilator head on this, but I would have paid $100 just for a new bikini perfect if it only came with an epilator head, that&#x27;s how much I love this product and know</li>
            <li>Nice little compact gentle and effective unit..</li>
            <li>Of course an epilator is a modern day torture device that&#x27;s not supposed to be snag free, but it did its job of sticking with hairs and not skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is light but does the job very well.</li>
            <li>This product came with a bunch of useful accessories - an exfoliating glove, LED-lit tweezers, a number of attachments for the trimmer, and a bag for it all.    </li>
            <li>one.not worth your money.</li>
            <li>This product would be worth alone based on the shaving and trimmer heads, but it also comes with an eyebrow tweezers.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper now than what I payed for it, but it still isn&#x27;t worth even a dollar.</li>
            <li>Actually it turns out to be quite nice.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is considering purchasing this handy dandy shaver.    </li>
            <li>so I chose to start with doing away with my beloved visits to The Wax Center and threading salons.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product, because of the functional design and the promising features, but in the end it&#x27;s just an okay product.</li>
            <li>because I have used their similar kind before and didn&#x27;t like them.</li>
            <li>My wife likes this much better than her old one.</li>
            <li>It was absolutely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>THE ONLY THING I WASNT THRILLED ABOUT</li>
            <li>and we&#x27;re just not as powerful and did not have all these attachment.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I fell for the good reviews and spent a lot of money for the Philips kit.</li>
            <li>It does a nice job maybe not quite waxing quality results but pretty good especially with the epilator attachment (as long as you can stand the pain).  </li>
            <li>I just bought an electric razor and while it&#x27;s a bit larger, it gets the job done a lot more cleanly, plus</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re time constrained, this trimmer is great for small areas, otherwise you may be more efficient with an old fashioned blade.</li>
            <li>Works good and just what I expected!</li>
            <li>someone wearing a suit with a more revealing (high cut) leg opening may need a combination of waxing (or, my recommendation, electrolysis) with this trimmer to get the desired results, but, for me, the trim function was absolutely sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written by \\&quot;Mrs.</li>
            <li>Bought another one and right from the package would not take a charge.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to change out all the different heads.</li>
            <li>Okay, now is where one can get down and get creative, so-to-speak.  </li>
            <li>Okay, now is where one can get down and get creative, so-to-speak.  </li>
            <li>Full disclosure: I have really hairy legs.</li>
            <li>The epilator will probably work great too since its small</li>
            <li>If you can afford to, you should probably look around a little more for something better.</li>
            <li>...was a little surprised at the powerful hum and vibration of the Philips Hp6378/10 Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe&#x27;s motor, and holding a vibrating little gismo that close to my eye</li>
            <li>When there are a few stray hairs, it does a wonderful job of removing them entirely.   </li>
            <li>just run attachments under warm water and put on paper towel to air dry.</li>
            <li>just run attachments under warm water and put on paper towel to air dry.</li>
            <li>How did I ever live without this bikini trimmer!?!!</li>
            <li>I usually wax myself and when I started not having enough time to wax my bikini area, I started looking for an electric shaver (ideally), wishing women had one like the ones men use on their face - giving them that smooth, satin feel.</li>
            <li>She loved these particular tweezers, whereas she had rejected the top of the line Sephora Professional series tweezers I tried previously and Tweezerman tweezers.    </li>
            <li>THIS ONE ITEM IS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE VERY VERY VERY</li>
            <li>And is very gentle .all</li>
            <li>for the other extras, the carry case is made of cheap fabrics but it works and I was able to get all of my attachments and the handle in there, even the brush for cleaning it.</li>
            <li>With our other trimmer (my husband&#x27;s though I have borrowed it on occasion) I&#x27;m always nervous that if I start a hair removal job then there is a good chance that the battery will run out before I have time to really even things out or even just make things look not-lopsided.  </li>

            <li>This is a good little shaver.  </li>
            <li>I love this trimmer for a trimmer but did not find all the other attachments very useful.</li>
            <li>I rarely charge it and it&#x27;s always ready.</li>
            <li>Would prefer the plug in version for consistent power.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We fell in love with the lighted tweezers which is such a novelty.</li>
            <li>Being able to use it in the shower is a big plus for my wife.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s an ok device.</li>
            <li>It is the first trimmer that I have used for \\&quot;personal\\&quot; grooming.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I was using a different product for so many years.</li>
            <li>At first I was hesitant to use an electric/rechargeable shaver.  </li>
            <li>Plus,  for the price I think the package deal is pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>remember raving about this to my roommates in college when I first got it about how the epilator made it</li>
            <li>It travels well and is pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d try this one first.  </li>
            <li>Many different attachments.</li>
            <li>I am assuming that this is to make navigating various areas and crevices easier and allow for more hair removal control than an epilator</li>
            <li>detailed instructions, complete with how-to images.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The trimmer works exactly like I wanted.</li>
            <li>I thought the light-up tweezers were hilarious until I stepped on a tiny piece of glass.</li>
            <li>THANKS AMAZON FOR YOUR VARIETY!</li>
            <li>I use that to place my plastic heads in, but have opted in using a cushioned makeup bag instead for storage of the entire set for more protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only slightly better for bikini area.</li>
            <li>I did some more research and decided to spring for the extra money to get this unit which seemed like higher quality.</li>
            <li>The exactly product I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quick grooming method.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but not super smooth.</li>
            <li>:  I loved my bikini waxes because I only needed to have it done every 4-5 weeks,  The bikini attachments are basically for trimming not total hair removal.  </li>
            <li>I was excited that the Bikini Perfect could be used wet or dry, no one likes a dry shave unless she is looking to be punished.</li>
            <li>I love all the attachments, the case and the little brush to clean.</li>
            <li>I never heard my wife giggled and scream as much since our first night.</li>
            <li>They both provide close hair removal and pretty much flawlesss ability to screw up my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Women have hair pretty much everywhere, though we don&#x27;t like to admit it.  </li>
            <li>doesnt get a very close shave and gets hot in the shower</li>
            <li>I had mainly bought this for the epilator attachment, but I just want to warn buyers that epilators REALLY hurt &amp;#34;down there,&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Here&#x27;s why I am giving this product 3 stars: while the bikini trimming attachments are good for removing longer hairs or large amounts of hair, I was not able to get a close shave with them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it is a simple and easy to use trimmer, but don&#x27;t expect it to replace a razor.  </li>
            <li>I can leave this one in the shower, and the attachments change out easily and there are enough options to craft my look to my every whim.</li>
            <li>The not so good - when using the covers on these, it only cuts very long hair.</li>
            <li>I like the power it has and its great to use both wet and dry.</li>
            <li>Fast and easy, with 3 different trim length</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, it&#x27;s easy to clean, and it works pretty well, but the shave just doesn&#x27;t seem to be close enough because you get stubble back much faster than with a regular manual blade.    </li>
            <li>This trimmer is not particularly high quality—there&#x27;s better stuff out on the market.</li>
            <li>I have had this item for several months now and it works fine.</li>
            <li>This takes a bit of concentration, and a pretty steady hand.  </li>
            <li>I pretty much just use two of the attachments--the main shaver (for you-know-where) and the expilator (for my face).</li>
            <li>However, this company shipped it on time and the packaging was very well done.</li>
            <li>It came with a variety of different shaving heads for this as well as an exfoliating glove, travel case, and a light up tweezer.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating glove I have yet to use as I haven&#x27;t really had a need for it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this epilator for years and the product does not disappoint on the whole too much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is still a gentle epilator considering what else is on the market.</li>
            <li>I really am just using the trimmer for the bikini area.</li>
            <li>It is also much safer without any exposed blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In modern society women having an abundance of hair is frowned upon, which means that women resolve to all kinds of hair removal techniques.</li>
            <li>The unit is very compact.</li>
            <li>And the \\&quot;Lighted Tweezers\\&quot; are very convenient.  </li>
            <li>This is the very reason I use a Trimmer instead of a razor or waxing, etc.   </li>
            <li>I do really like</li>
            <li>The clipper doesn&#x27;t shave very close.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!  ...</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!  ...</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for a similar device that had apparently died of old age, so I knew what I was getting, and am once again very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Did not like this much.</li>
            <li>It just didn&#x27;t seem to remove much at all.</li>
            <li>I am very unimpressed with this razor.  </li>
            <li>dont really see much of a difference in the extensions that it comes with.</li>
            <li>hahaha</li>
            <li>I really like this bikini trimmer.</li>
            <li>I had a Remington cheap trimmer for about 7years until the charger quit connecting enough to charge the battery</li>
            <li>When I plug them in to charge them initially, the light comes on to signify it is charging</li>
            <li>but I feel like when the trimmer has the guard on it doesn&#x27;t do much trimming.</li>
            <li>Trims very close or use the plastic guard for a longer length.</li>
            <li>but the battery barely lasted one full trim &amp;#34;down</li>
            <li>My only tiny wish would be for a matching set of scissors, but I can supply my own.</li>
            <li>This works great on delicate and sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>Make sure you allow the charge to completely die before recharging or you will wreck the battery (that&#x27;s wheat happened to my last one.</li>
            <li>This comes with numerous attachments, which are easily switched out and store in a decent pouch.  </li>
            <li>I am going back to using my old razor which does a much better job of shaving.  </li>
            <li>I think it would be good for people with thick eyebrows.</li>
            <li>strongly recommend especially for women that aren&#x27;t too high maintenance, because it really helps.</li>
            <li>As for the other three heads it comes with, I&#x27;m not even sure two of them are functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife likes this unit (except for the epilator which can irritate the skin and may also hurt a lot) and the charge holds better than other trimmers.</li>
            <li>I tried all the other tools to make sure I was using everything correctly, but no.</li>
            <li>But you have to be doing (epilating) like a whole leg for over a half hour or more before it will die.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seems exciting with its endless options, and the size appears just right, BUT it doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li>So far works pretty well.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that, per the manual, it takes 10 hours to get a full charge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really disappointed because the reviews I&#x27;d read seemed to be pretty good, but I had a Remington before this that I think worked a heck of a lot better.  </li>
            <li>It kind of loosely hangs there like a ten cent item.</li>
            <li>This is a great bikini trimmer, but not a good product if you want to go bare.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have better results and less pain.</li>
            <li>She reports most of the extra attachments aren&#x27;t really necessary.</li>
            <li>Lesser pain (OK - it is not entirely painless).</li>
            <li>I mainly bought this for the trimmer and epilator.</li>
            <li>So many different attachments that can be used in multiple areas.</li>
            <li>Really like this one so far!</li>
            <li>My hair grows up pretty fast and they are thick so that waxing or epilating delayed the hair regrowth the most.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Plus, I love getting the little extras as well.</li>
            <li>I love this little machine.</li>
            <li>This great and ingenous little device takes a lot of the guess work out of grooming the \\&quot;hair down there\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how much I got when I got this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I have so much fun using all the different heads that came with it.</li>
            <li>The epilator attachment puts it miles ahead of similar shavers, so it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Great shaver, but doesnt last too long before it starts breaking down.</li>
            <li>Worked only once right when I received the package, and never again.</li>
            <li>It trims all the naughty bits easily and gets a close shave without giving irritation.   </li>
            <li>Long battery life, but even without the guard on it isn&#x27;t a super close shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It holds the charge super long.  </li>
            <li>but I think I can live with it</li>
            <li>Purchased for my wife as she wanted a new razor.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job of cutting through real fast and being pain-less.</li>
            <li>I use the main trimming tip and  follow it up for a closer shave with the tip made for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for sensitive areas and haircare needs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, the white bag that it comes with is very very flimsy.</li>
            <li>This might seem strange but the trimmer is geared to be easily cleaned and utilized in several ways.  </li>
            <li>The pouch is very thin, but I was able to fit everything in there and zip it easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have only charged it when it first arrived.  </li>
            <li>The bag is pretty flimsy but convenient with multiple compartments for the attachments.</li>
            <li>I basically used the Philips tool first, and then had to go over the area with my regular razor.</li>
            <li>This really surprised me!  </li>
            <li>More expensive doesn&#x27;t always equal a better product.</li>
            <li>The electric shaver attachment does not work very well, so if you&#x27;re expecting this trimmer with that attachment to leave you bare, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first one about 8 or 9 years ago from Sephora, and it recently just isn&#x27;t holding a charge.</li>
            <li>Works ok if you are going to trim a small area like your chin, but I don&#x27;t even like it for the underarms.</li>
            <li>; epilating gave me a lot of ingrown hairs and it takes way too long to be worth the pain.</li>
            <li>You can definitely get a pretty close trim with it too.</li>
            <li>A  potential fire hazard should anyone attempt to use it at a higher voltage.</li>
            <li>Higher quality should &#x3D; last longer, etc.</li>
            <li>But tweezers light worked for less than a week.</li>
            <li>This is the exact one minus the bliss sticker on the side and sooo much cheaper.</li>
            <li>It is small, quiet and effective.</li>
            <li>and it came with little tweezers with a light and mirror.</li>
            <li>The action is gentle and although the shave can be close, it isn&#x27;t close enough to irritate.  </li>
            <li>You click on them and all you get is the same old thing: the whole package or nothing&lt;</li>
            <li>but this one did considerably well.</li>
            <li>far as attachments go: there&#x27;s a precision tip for the bikini area and also one for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s an epilator attachments that removes the hair from the root so that it doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additional use: any one of the bikini area attachments can be used as hair trimmers for any area really, even on men if they don&#x27;t mind using the same tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was beyond surprised by the results...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to a precision trimmer head getting very close to the skin, but I went over and over the same spot, only to find that it still looked as though there was multiple days worth of growth.  </li>
            <li>This is a miracle and keep skin soft.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate all of the attachments that came with it especially the eyebrow trimmer.</li>
            <li>I have to trim, or I start looking like an old guy with hairs curling out of nostrils</li>
            <li>and I tried it on my downy soft, pre-teen leg fuzz (it was blond so not too Sasquatch-y for the 7th grade)...&lt;br</li>
            <li>I charged it for over 24 hours (the green light was on, indicating it was receiving power) and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why two of these in a row would be complete garbage, but they were.</li>
            <li>We both use it and it trims sensitive places efficiently.  </li>
            <li>So far I like this razor.</li>
            <li>The various options really work.</li>
            <li>I wear bathing suits with a fairly modest cut at the leg opening, so</li>
            <li>This is in direct contradiction to the written</li>
            <li>No problems thus far.</li>
            <li>I purchased one several years ago and it lasted really well.  </li>
            <li>whatever you do - do NOT use it without the guard, against any sensitive area...</li>
            <li>Initially loved it but something is wrong with the charger connection or battery and now it won&#x27;t charge.</li>
            <li>The illuminating tweezer was a major disapointment!!</li>
            <li>It also will make your skin red for a while afterwards, so I would not recommend doing it right before you are going out in public!  </li>
            <li>Product is a little challenging to clean but does its job with thick hair growth.</li>
            <li>The small design makes it easy to maneuver, and allows you to see what you are doing.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the grooves on the heads and handle are difficult to clean, and the the bits of the body that need be regularly lubricated get pretty gross fairly frequently, and subsequently require even more additional cleaning.</li>
            <li>far as the other attachments, the epilator was the one I was most curious about as the last time I was faced with an epilator was way back in the 80&#x27;s when the first epilady came out</li>
            <li>Tried it but the razor doesn&#x27;t catch a single hair the first 3 times you go over.</li>
            <li>does the job quickly and neatly down there...</li>
            <li>2- I switched to the \\&quot;Micro Shaver\\&quot; to hopefully get down to a nice close shave, but alas, a significant amount of stuble was left.   </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an older version of the same brand.</li>
            <li>BUT IF USED CAREFULLY ITS NOT A BAD ITEM, ESPECIALLY FOR THE COST!!</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re going for a certain length then it takes 3 times as long to even out your bikini area.</li>
            <li>normally wax or epilate, which obviously are time consuming (mainly because of the pain because I pause and take deep breaths</li>
            <li>Also you will get a carrying pouch an exfoliating glove and a tweezers with a light small mirror.</li>
            <li>I do however, enjoy the small razor attachment for the face and fingers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The foil cutter head, which is used for general trimming developed holes and thus cannot be used</li>
            <li>, its surface area is smaller than a normal dedicated epilators .</li>
            <li>After charging this shaver the first time, I got roughly an hour to 90 minutes of shave time with one charge.  </li>
            <li>Rechargeable batteries give out after 3-4 charges, plastic breaks, and only with normal use.</li>
            <li>In the middle of the tweezers is a white LED powered by a button battery, very clever indeed.</li>
            <li>I have been using a less expensive Bikini Trimmer for some time now, I&#x27;ve been very happy with it, but decided to try and upgrade with a more expensive product with all the bells and whistles this Trimmer comes with.  </li>
            <li>I could use my old charger or my old head attachments because it&#x27;s all the same.  </li>
            <li>Was so cheap that i didn&#x27;t want to waste time sending it back</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful but not super noisy.</li>
            <li>Trimmer is not very good for a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin but using this properly, I didn&#x27;t have any irritation at all.</li>
            <li>Very hard to change attachments, I basically use the trimmer most which works well</li>
            <li>Hard to explain, but it doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth as others that I have used.</li>
            <li>I like it does the job but not too wide and takes more time for my legs than usual.</li>
            <li>So apparently, this manufacturer does not stand behinds its product.</li>
            <li>this device is for the ladies who want their nether regions either sculpted (make an arrow, or a landing strip!), closely trimed (a.k.a. itchy) or bare all together (thats me)</li>
            <li>It comes with six different attachments, my least favorite being the epilator, which totally removes the hair at the root.  </li>
            <li>So I used I am adjusting to the trimmed instead of bare.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to replace an old Remington 5-in-1 personal grooming kit when it started to die.</li>
            <li>but i still use a razor i Trim it down first</li>
            <li>However, even though I have really small hands (they pretty much stopped growing since middle school), it still took a little bit of work to get into the gloves at first as they are so small that it seems like only a kid&#x27;s hands would fit in there</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this piece of equipment due to the fact that the blades in each attachment are not sharp and cause too much irritation (no matter how it is utilized).  </li>
            <li>I came back to amazon and cannot find any evidence that it is used or refurbished - and the packaging was completely new - giant plastic sealed in...</li>
            <li>I like the multifunction aspect of this particular one (the various attachments), the fact that it can be used wet or dry, can be cleaned very well, is rechargeable, and the price is right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works well for bikini trimming short but not down to the skin which is what I want.</li>
            <li>The other attachments let you choose how close you want to shave, and how much you want to shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For a final touch, I popped on the micro shaver attachment and went over the entire (newly) shaved and trimmed area, which left my bikini area</li>
            <li>/&gt;For a final touch, I popped on the micro shaver attachment and went over the entire (newly) shaved and trimmed area, which left my bikini area</li>
            <li>Without going into too much uncomfortable detail, it&#x27;s easy to handle, intuitively designed, cuts very well without pulling, and has different length settings.</li>
            <li>I also like it to be quick, as painless a possible, not too messy, and low cost.   </li>
            <li>The only ones I use on a regular basis though are the regular trimmer head, and the epilator has been great for all the random hairs that popped up due to pregnancy hormones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought other brands which would typically stop working after awhile because they&#x27;d get all clogged up with hair and wouldn&#x27;t easily clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really understand the need for the LED tweezers unless I ever needed to tweeze in the dark I suppose.</li>
            <li>One day, it just stopped working, but I was surprised that it had lasted so long, so we bought another one.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just haven&#x27;t explored how to use this product enough, but I have barely used it at all.  </li>
            <li>It still has the old standby attachments such as a precision trimmer and micro shaver, but the micro trimmer, eyebrow comb, epilator, and accessories are clearly not just repackaged men&#x27;s ones.</li>
            <li>The epilator head has also broken into three pieces but was easily reassembled.</li>
            <li>I tried to use the epilator as they call it to try and get it down to the roots but even while following directions, it hurt so much that I just put it</li>
            <li>It really only trims the hair down to a certain point, and then I have to use a regular razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s weak, its cheap.  </li>
            <li>: I think it&#x27;s a decent product for keeping the hair down there in check, but it doesn&#x27;t provide a close enough shave for the bikini days.</li>
            <li>I read the good and the bad reviews and figured for the price (which is one visit to the wax salon)</li>

            <li> it is the best.</li>
            <li> Best epilator out there!</li>
            <li> and I needed to get another trusted Philips Bikini Perfect</li>
            <li> It works great for those purposes but the close shaver didn&#x27;t work at all!  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is awesome!</li>
            <li> Great gadget for the price!</li>
            <li> Not the best razor.</li>
            <li> The body of the trimmer is the perfect size</li>
            <li> I have not been faced with a power outage with the Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size for them, and it keeps me from having to shave my armpits all the time.</li>
            <li> I found it works best if one shapes a teenie-weenie bit (of the brow) at a time -- because, as the instructions indicate, it does remove every hair it touches.</li>
            <li> Does everything it says it will--and does it perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> and she is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Seems great!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li> They just don&#x27;t make perfect bikini trimmers anymore.</li>
            <li> That being said, this is the best trimmer i have ever bought.</li>
            <li> Once you learn how to use this tool, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Best of its type.</li>
            <li> My wife has been very happy with it.  </li>

            <li> But this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Awesome electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Not the best product in the world</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> this kit is very good, it has everything you need, the battery goes very good</li>
            <li> Perfect price, good for travel lovers..</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, great customer service....</li>
            <li> The travel case is utilitarian at best, but the product itself created an enthusiastic fan.</li>
            <li> My wife is quite happy with this razor.  </li>
            <li> The lighted tweezers are great.  </li>
            <li> Has been working great.</li>
            <li> in all, I am happy with this trimmer as it does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a sturdy, ergonomic unit that should get some great years of use.  </li>
            <li> I have the Braun Silk Epil which is great</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a great product.</li>
            <li> I am exceptionally happy with the epi head.</li>
            <li> Works great, no problems at all.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this thing, so that makes me happy with it.</li>
            <li> It gave me great results.</li>

            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> It comes with a great carrying  case.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel great, and it isn&#x27;t painless.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;For now though, I&#x27;m happy as a clam.rge on this thing seems like it lasts forever.  </li>
            <li> I have not been faced with a power outage with the Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe.      </li>
            <li> For now though, I&#x27;m happy as a clam.</li>
            <li> Philips Hp6378/10 Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe, Opal / Aqua</li>
            <li> Philips Hp6378/10 Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe</li>
            <li> Great for in the shower or on land.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great woman&#x27;s gadget and it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does a great job (no pulling, etc.) of keeping the hedges trimmed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> and that look very nice</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> OK, you look great!</li>
            <li> I mostly use the two trimmer attachments without the hair length adjusting attachments because I find they work best by themselves.</li>
            <li> Which is nice because it&#x27;s already a chore all of us women detest!  </li>
            <li> best razor ever..much better than batteries</li>
            <li> Nice touches like the led lit tweezers/mirror and convenient carry bag rounds out the package and makes it a great value.</li>
            <li> Good power and have had no problems with holding a charge.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I loved the eyebrow attachment and the lighted tweezer that came in the box.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this trimmer.</li>
            <li> If you are in a hurry and you want to DIY, the eyebrow trimmer is a good choice.</li>
            <li> The Good:   </li>
            <li> I wish there was a good electric bikini shaver out there</li>
            <li> , my wife loved it!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> The BF isn&#x27;t complaining so all is good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fairly ergonomic</li>
            <li> It works really good.</li>
            <li> I bought mine elsewhere.. and loved it.  </li>
            <li> This product is of fair quality.</li>
            <li> You can use it in the bathroom which is good.</li>
            <li> The good - The head is detachable and all of it is water proof</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had an electric shaver before and feel this one is on the high-end quality wise</li>
            <li> Awesome way to stay trim and clean.</li>
            <li> The Philips Hp6378/10 Bikini Perfect Deluxe Trimmer put my worries to rest -- it was easy to use and worked magically!     </li>
            <li> the brave, there is also an epilating attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean-up of the Philips Hp6378/10 Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe&#x27; attachments was an absolute breeze!  </li>
            <li> the brave, there is also an epilating attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean-up of the Philips Hp6378/10 Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe&#x27; attachments was an absolute breeze!  </li>
            <li> this point I&#x27;m beginning to get familiar with the Philips Hp6378/10 Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe</li>
            <li> The eyebrow attachment is great for trimming in between waxes, or on the top of the eybrow where I prefer not to tweeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very cute</li>
            <li> Great love it makes shaving a breeze</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> She was very satisfied, but the battery has lost capacity.</li>
            <li> I am very glad that I purchased this item.</li>
            <li> The design is beautiful, easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I received very fast and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Buy this you will love it!</li>
            <li> : use the epilator on your knees - it is way better than shaving or waxing!</li>
            <li> And for me, the epilator is pretty awesome.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am kind of impressed with myself for being brave enough to try the one that attaches to this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing</li>
            <li> I have had this for two years now, and it worked amazingly until my husband broke it.</li>
            <li> She reports it is handy and effective.</li>
            <li> They are actually a nice set of tweezers to tackle any pesky hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great kit and a must for those who like to groom their bikini line and keep things nice and neat.  </li>
            <li> The foil works best when the hair is much shorter or when they are just stub length.</li>
            <li> It is nice that it is usable in the shower and this is where I use it most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At that point I decided it was time to purchase my own.  </li>
            <li> Nice product as a replacement for shaving.</li>
            <li> I liked the variety of attachments.</li>
            <li> This product gives a close nice shave.</li>
            <li> Everything fits nicely in the bag supplied.</li>
            <li> Then they were actually handy.</li>
            <li> The attachments offer a nice variety.</li>
            <li> Really nice.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer for intimate place for women.</li>
            <li> Philips Bikini Perfect represents a new breed of product truly tailored toward a woman&#x27;s needs.</li>
            <li> Let me introduce you to my new Best Friend:  </li>
            <li> It is especially good for defining edges rather than shaving completely.</li>
            <li> By far the best bikini trimmer.</li>
            <li> It is good for keeping this from getting overgrown, but not making it smooth.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have so many options</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled.</li>
            <li> Nice to be able to recharge without having to buy batteries.</li>
            <li> The best desciption for its result is that it gives a soft stubly feel after use instead of having a bushy area.</li>
            <li> the attachments are great and useful.</li>
            <li> So easy to use in the shower or out!  </li>
            <li> This was so easy to use!</li>
            <li> The battery life is great and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> and it is a great price and overall great product.</li>
            <li> The battery charges quickly and keeps the charge for a good while.</li>
            <li> It has tweezers with light so that should be better!</li>
            <li> :)  The trimmer is very precise and one does not a lot of pressure is needed.  </li>
            <li> you may end up lopping off more than you desire.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s hit the pool! :)</li>
            <li> The many attachments included allow for customization to trim the way you choose.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, threading is still much better as it looks better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This profuct allows all of those criteria to be satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Each one has a different purpose and they all work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> works better than others.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with the bikini touch pen as well, that way</li>
            <li> hair needs to be longer for it to work better?</li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> I love this item.</li>
            <li> I also love the eyebrow tools for shaping.</li>
            <li> : I absolutly love the eybrow and depilatory attachments.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> Trimmer my hair short within 15 minutes which is perfect for my schedule.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I think that really shows how great of a product this is that they haven&#x27;t had a need to change it in years - though I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ve probably tweaked some internal things, but it is simply an awesome</li>
            <li> I just truly love this thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I like this model even better.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a bunch of attachments, most of which I haven&#x27;t used yet.  </li>
            <li> The guard over the end is better than the Remington, but I don&#x27;t like anything else about this shaver.  </li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s a better product.  </li>
            <li> more mobility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> keep wanting to remove more hair and detail more spots from head to toe just because I can...</li>
            <li> I keep wanting to remove more hair and detail more spots from head to toe just because I can...</li>
            <li> my wife didn&#x27;t like there are much better out there</li>
            <li> I use this more often than I use my full-sized epilator/shaver.</li>
            <li> That is, until Now! :)  </li>
            <li> Hollywood, Here I Come! :)</li>
            <li> :)  --Katharena</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Love that its wet/dry</li>
            <li> 5 stars for the provider and product :)</li>
            <li> do love the fact that this trimmer can be recharged and is cordless for use.</li>
            <li> , it replaced and works better than the shaver I had before it.</li>
            <li> love it..</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a couple of cheap ones, and this is by far the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, it works!</li>
            <li> In short, it&#x27;s the perfect</li>
            <li> I wish the shaver was able to trim my pubic hairs lower.</li>
            <li> Its a cute kit though.</li>
            <li> comes with many Many parts.</li>
            <li> This product has a longer operating time and better equipment.</li>
            <li> Love this device.</li>
            <li> Enjoying the purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the epilator attachment.</li>
            <li> I use this mostly for underarms and bikini.</li>
            <li> As many reviewers have said - this does not hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> I love that this comes with an epilator.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not hopeful there&#x27;s better out there.</li>
            <li> so I wasnt sure what I was getting into when I purchased this.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> what more could you want.</li>
            <li> but it takes way too many strokes with the trimmer accessories.</li>
            <li> The micro shaver does not shave but I like it better than the trimmer because it can&#x27;t cut you and it trims shorter.</li>
            <li> I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use and clean!!!</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s pretty good; best for maintenance.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean, a good product I like it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> :) I will probably wax if I go on a vacation and need everything clean, but this will be something I use all the time!</li>
            <li> First one worked good for about a month and then would not take a charge.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Precision Trimmer\\&quot; leaves a significant length of hair!</li>
            <li> This product is ok - I like that you can use it in the shower since it&#x27;s always best to shave wet hair that&#x27;s been softened.</li>
            <li> The Philips Hp6378/10 Trimmer also comes with additional items -- a pair of ex-foliating gloves, a pair of lighted tweezers with its own case, as well as a travel bag that the shaver, attachments, tweezers, and gloves as fit comfortably in.      </li>
            <li> This device is also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Philips HP6378 Bikini Perfect Deluxe Trimmer is much cheaper than SEPHORA and it&#x27;s the same product they sell in the stores</li>
            <li> Prednisone has turned me from a lovely thing who has always appeared fairly light and smooth in the fur coat department to wondering how much more medication it will take until I&#x27;m dealing with a five o&#x27;clock shadow (on my face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After  one get&#x27;s past that, the Philips Hp6378/10 Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe will need a 10 hour charge, which will give plenty of time to read over the (easy to follow)</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and had to stop waxing all together, and shaving irritates me too much, so this was the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to choose the desired length.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to cut myself.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for well over a year, and its going strong.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy the idea of the light up tweezers as the light provides a lot of illumination and you can see the hairs better.</li>
            <li> Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe comes with many attachments so it can be used on pretty much any fuzz the female body can grow.  </li>
            <li> At the end of the day, I need comfortable clean results much more than I need to have my trimmer look ladylike.</li>
            <li> The Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe smoothly handles the facial hair, shaping my brows, and even offers an attachment to put the eyebrow antennae in their place.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable to hold and easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer is light and easy to carry around.</li>
            <li> It works fine in and out of the shower.</li>
            <li> It pulls out all of the hair except for the really fine ones.</li>
            <li> and it works, fine.</li>
            <li> The epilator was fine.  </li>
            <li> It cuts fine without the trimmers on</li>
            <li> This is a good investment so far!</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It is quick and really effective to the point that it was almost fun</li>
            <li> Easy to use - easy to clean.</li>
            <li> In the box is an awesome illuminated brow  tweezer and mirror in a plastic case a little longer than a lipstick tube.</li>
            <li> Besides it makes a huge noise.</li>
            <li> Great personal grooming set with lots of attachments.</li>
            <li> No electric razor will be 100% snag free</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say how precise they are.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> She wasn&#x27;t too keen on using the epilator as it seems rip out the remaining trunks after the initial trim, but everything else works great.</li>
            <li> I wish my two men&#x27;s hair trimmers by the same company would be as attractive and flexible as this one.</li>
            <li> I use it to remove the hair from my legs, and I stay hair free for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Had to replace one that I paid over $100 for 5 yrs ago and am just as happy with this one for only $35.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product just not for me.</li>
            <li> After trying a few attachments, I was impressed by the versatility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of amazed at how much of a workhorse</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of amazed at how much of a workhorse</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One may need to use a sturdy box knife to open the Philips Hp6378/10 Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe and retrieve the product, attachments and extra goodies out of the packaging.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean ..</li>
            <li> and it recently broke, but I&#x27;m so happy with it</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to clean + hygienic.</li>
            <li> As for all the gadgets that come with they sure are all fun to try.</li>
            <li> Twizer light does not work.</li>
            <li> It can give you a close trim, but it won&#x27;t be as smooth as a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to spend more than twenty bucks on a bikini trimmer, but I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> This was so easy to use and did the job so quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve kind of given up on this attachment and use mainly the precision comb and epilator.</li>
            <li> Very practical as it contours around very easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame that men&#x27;s trimming products are so much better designed and engineered and deliver great results without the huge price tag while women have to suffer with crap like this Philips bikini perfect.</li>
            <li> The narrow trimmer is nice, but I&#x27;ve since switched over to the more affordable and effective Panasonic ES2207P.</li>
            <li> This shaver was worth every cent!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny how identical my old Bikini Perfect is to the new one - it hasn&#x27;t changed a bit.</li>
            <li> However, do realize that the trimmer will not give a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Okay, not as great as my last trimmer but does a decent job</li>
            <li> and you now have a styling tool for creating fun bikini area things like hearts, diamonds or (just for fun) how about \\&quot;his\\&quot; favorite team logo.</li>
            <li> and you now have a styling tool for creating fun bikini area things like hearts, diamonds or (just for fun) how about \\&quot;his\\&quot; favorite team logo.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet found another that would be better as far as usability and features, though I think this one could be of better quality.</li>
            <li> then I use the razor to clean up.</li>
            <li> Works good but if not real careful</li>
            <li> It is very small and very light, which makes it real handy.</li>
            <li> By far I love it!</li>
            <li> This works so easily, without leavong a rash and trimming the hair pretty precisely, making the area look neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is perfect and it does the job much easier than any other method I have tried.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those hard to reach areas</li>
            <li> This is the first \\&quot;bikini trimmer\\&quot; that I&#x27;ve bought, and I&#x27;m really happy with the initial results from this one.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much the first time that I bought another one.</li>
            <li> This product is really a multiple-use grooming tool, even thought it&#x27;s targeted mostly for the bikini</li>
            <li> No painful nicks.</li>
            <li> This device must be charged a full 10 hours for every 60 minutes you want to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She really likes it and was glad she was able to get very close without worry of nicks.</li>
            <li> I thought it was good enough to travel with</li>
            <li> Many of us wax, trim, shave, depilatate, electro-zap, and laser so that nobody knows how furry we really can</li>
            <li> and I can shape my brows with ease and without my hands going into full on crampy arthritic</li>
            <li> :) That would really set you apart from all the rest...</li>
            <li> :) That would really set you apart from all the rest...</li>
            <li> because I thought the attachments looked cool.</li>
            <li> There are two tiny batteries inside that must not be in good working condition.</li>
            <li> A word about the packaging - it&#x27;s very cute and girly; definitely made me excited to put this product to use.</li>
            <li> Their reviews were good, but the price was a little higher than I liked</li>
            <li> The shape of the precision trimmer is more like a mini blade razor head rather than a narrower tipped attachment as seen in older models.</li>
            <li> It comes with tweezers that have a tiny light attached to them, nice bonus.</li>
            <li> Charging is quick for a rated 60 minutes of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Philips trimmer seems to have everything she needs in her fight, and it has already proven a worthy adversary in her battles.</li>
            <li> is that it charges quickly and doesn&#x27;t need to be charged too often.  </li>
            <li> I love and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor with high hopes despite the many reviews that told me not to.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty certain that the epilator on this one will leave you with more damage than not).</li>
            <li> 1- It charges very quickly and holds the charge very well.   </li>
            <li> Works really well and is very quick.</li>
            <li> personally only really use the epilator head on this, but I would have paid $100 just for a new bikini perfect if it only came with an epilator head, that&#x27;s how much I love this product and know</li>
            <li> Nice little compact gentle and effective unit..</li>
            <li> Of course an epilator is a modern day torture device that&#x27;s not supposed to be snag free, but it did its job of sticking with hairs and not skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is light but does the job very well.</li>
            <li> This product came with a bunch of useful accessories - an exfoliating glove, LED-lit tweezers, a number of attachments for the trimmer, and a bag for it all.    </li>
            <li> one.not worth your money.</li>
            <li> This product would be worth alone based on the shaving and trimmer heads, but it also comes with an eyebrow tweezers.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper now than what I payed for it, but it still isn&#x27;t worth even a dollar.</li>
            <li> Actually it turns out to be quite nice.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is considering purchasing this handy dandy shaver.    </li>
            <li> so I chose to start with doing away with my beloved visits to The Wax Center and threading salons.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, because of the functional design and the promising features, but in the end it&#x27;s just an okay product.</li>
            <li> because I have used their similar kind before and didn&#x27;t like them.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this much better than her old one.</li>
            <li> It was absolutely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> THE ONLY THING I WASNT THRILLED ABOUT</li>
            <li> and we&#x27;re just not as powerful and did not have all these attachment.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I fell for the good reviews and spent a lot of money for the Philips kit.</li>
            <li> It does a nice job maybe not quite waxing quality results but pretty good especially with the epilator attachment (as long as you can stand the pain).  </li>
            <li> I just bought an electric razor and while it&#x27;s a bit larger, it gets the job done a lot more cleanly, plus</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re time constrained, this trimmer is great for small areas, otherwise you may be more efficient with an old fashioned blade.</li>
            <li> Works good and just what I expected!</li>
            <li> someone wearing a suit with a more revealing (high cut) leg opening may need a combination of waxing (or, my recommendation, electrolysis) with this trimmer to get the desired results, but, for me, the trim function was absolutely sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written by \\&quot;Mrs.</li>
            <li> Bought another one and right from the package would not take a charge.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to change out all the different heads.</li>
            <li> Okay, now is where one can get down and get creative, so-to-speak.  </li>
            <li> Okay, now is where one can get down and get creative, so-to-speak.  </li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I have really hairy legs.</li>
            <li> The epilator will probably work great too since its small</li>
            <li> If you can afford to, you should probably look around a little more for something better.</li>
            <li> ...was a little surprised at the powerful hum and vibration of the Philips Hp6378/10 Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe&#x27;s motor, and holding a vibrating little gismo that close to my eye</li>
            <li> When there are a few stray hairs, it does a wonderful job of removing them entirely.   </li>
            <li> just run attachments under warm water and put on paper towel to air dry.</li>

            <li> How did I ever live without this bikini trimmer!?!!</li>
            <li> I usually wax myself and when I started not having enough time to wax my bikini area, I started looking for an electric shaver (ideally), wishing women had one like the ones men use on their face - giving them that smooth, satin feel.</li>
            <li> She loved these particular tweezers, whereas she had rejected the top of the line Sephora Professional series tweezers I tried previously and Tweezerman tweezers.    </li>
            <li> THIS ONE ITEM IS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE VERY VERY VERY</li>
            <li> And is very gentle .all</li>
            <li> for the other extras, the carry case is made of cheap fabrics but it works and I was able to get all of my attachments and the handle in there, even the brush for cleaning it.</li>
            <li> With our other trimmer (my husband&#x27;s though I have borrowed it on occasion) I&#x27;m always nervous that if I start a hair removal job then there is a good chance that the battery will run out before I have time to really even things out or even just make things look not-lopsided.  </li>

            <li> This is a good little shaver.  </li>
            <li> I love this trimmer for a trimmer but did not find all the other attachments very useful.</li>
            <li> I rarely charge it and it&#x27;s always ready.</li>
            <li> Would prefer the plug in version for consistent power.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We fell in love with the lighted tweezers which is such a novelty.</li>
            <li> Being able to use it in the shower is a big plus for my wife.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s an ok device.</li>
            <li> It is the first trimmer that I have used for \\&quot;personal\\&quot; grooming.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I was using a different product for so many years.</li>
            <li> At first I was hesitant to use an electric/rechargeable shaver.  </li>
            <li> Plus,  for the price I think the package deal is pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> remember raving about this to my roommates in college when I first got it about how the epilator made it</li>
            <li> It travels well and is pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d try this one first.  </li>
            <li> Many different attachments.</li>
            <li> I am assuming that this is to make navigating various areas and crevices easier and allow for more hair removal control than an epilator</li>
            <li> detailed instructions, complete with how-to images.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trimmer works exactly like I wanted.</li>
            <li> I thought the light-up tweezers were hilarious until I stepped on a tiny piece of glass.</li>
            <li> THANKS AMAZON FOR YOUR VARIETY!</li>
            <li> I use that to place my plastic heads in, but have opted in using a cushioned makeup bag instead for storage of the entire set for more protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only slightly better for bikini area.</li>
            <li> I did some more research and decided to spring for the extra money to get this unit which seemed like higher quality.</li>
            <li> The exactly product I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quick grooming method.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but not super smooth.</li>
            <li> :  I loved my bikini waxes because I only needed to have it done every 4-5 weeks,  The bikini attachments are basically for trimming not total hair removal.  </li>
            <li> I was excited that the Bikini Perfect could be used wet or dry, no one likes a dry shave unless she is looking to be punished.</li>
            <li> I love all the attachments, the case and the little brush to clean.</li>
            <li> I never heard my wife giggled and scream as much since our first night.</li>
            <li> They both provide close hair removal and pretty much flawlesss ability to screw up my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Women have hair pretty much everywhere, though we don&#x27;t like to admit it.  </li>
            <li> doesnt get a very close shave and gets hot in the shower</li>
            <li> I had mainly bought this for the epilator attachment, but I just want to warn buyers that epilators REALLY hurt &amp;#34;down there,&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Here&#x27;s why I am giving this product 3 stars: while the bikini trimming attachments are good for removing longer hairs or large amounts of hair, I was not able to get a close shave with them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it is a simple and easy to use trimmer, but don&#x27;t expect it to replace a razor.  </li>
            <li> I can leave this one in the shower, and the attachments change out easily and there are enough options to craft my look to my every whim.</li>
            <li> The not so good - when using the covers on these, it only cuts very long hair.</li>
            <li> I like the power it has and its great to use both wet and dry.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy, with 3 different trim length</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, it&#x27;s easy to clean, and it works pretty well, but the shave just doesn&#x27;t seem to be close enough because you get stubble back much faster than with a regular manual blade.    </li>
            <li> This trimmer is not particularly high quality—there&#x27;s better stuff out on the market.</li>
            <li> I have had this item for several months now and it works fine.</li>
            <li> This takes a bit of concentration, and a pretty steady hand.  </li>
            <li> I pretty much just use two of the attachments--the main shaver (for you-know-where) and the expilator (for my face).</li>
            <li> However, this company shipped it on time and the packaging was very well done.</li>
            <li> It came with a variety of different shaving heads for this as well as an exfoliating glove, travel case, and a light up tweezer.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating glove I have yet to use as I haven&#x27;t really had a need for it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this epilator for years and the product does not disappoint on the whole too much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is still a gentle epilator considering what else is on the market.</li>
            <li> I really am just using the trimmer for the bikini area.</li>
            <li> It is also much safer without any exposed blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In modern society women having an abundance of hair is frowned upon, which means that women resolve to all kinds of hair removal techniques.</li>
            <li> The unit is very compact.</li>
            <li> And the \\&quot;Lighted Tweezers\\&quot; are very convenient.  </li>
            <li> This is the very reason I use a Trimmer instead of a razor or waxing, etc.   </li>
            <li> I do really like</li>
            <li> The clipper doesn&#x27;t shave very close.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!  ...</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!  ...</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a similar device that had apparently died of old age, so I knew what I was getting, and am once again very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Did not like this much.</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t seem to remove much at all.</li>
            <li> I am very unimpressed with this razor.  </li>
            <li> dont really see much of a difference in the extensions that it comes with.</li>
            <li> hahaha</li>
            <li> I really like this bikini trimmer.</li>
            <li> I had a Remington cheap trimmer for about 7years until the charger quit connecting enough to charge the battery</li>
            <li> When I plug them in to charge them initially, the light comes on to signify it is charging</li>
            <li> but I feel like when the trimmer has the guard on it doesn&#x27;t do much trimming.</li>
            <li> Trims very close or use the plastic guard for a longer length.</li>
            <li> but the battery barely lasted one full trim &amp;#34;down</li>
            <li> My only tiny wish would be for a matching set of scissors, but I can supply my own.</li>
            <li> This works great on delicate and sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Make sure you allow the charge to completely die before recharging or you will wreck the battery (that&#x27;s wheat happened to my last one.</li>
            <li> This comes with numerous attachments, which are easily switched out and store in a decent pouch.  </li>
            <li> I am going back to using my old razor which does a much better job of shaving.  </li>
            <li> I think it would be good for people with thick eyebrows.</li>
            <li> strongly recommend especially for women that aren&#x27;t too high maintenance, because it really helps.</li>
            <li> As for the other three heads it comes with, I&#x27;m not even sure two of them are functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife likes this unit (except for the epilator which can irritate the skin and may also hurt a lot) and the charge holds better than other trimmers.</li>
            <li> I tried all the other tools to make sure I was using everything correctly, but no.</li>
            <li> But you have to be doing (epilating) like a whole leg for over a half hour or more before it will die.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seems exciting with its endless options, and the size appears just right, BUT it doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> So far works pretty well.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that, per the manual, it takes 10 hours to get a full charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed because the reviews I&#x27;d read seemed to be pretty good, but I had a Remington before this that I think worked a heck of a lot better.  </li>
            <li> It kind of loosely hangs there like a ten cent item.</li>
            <li> This is a great bikini trimmer, but not a good product if you want to go bare.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have better results and less pain.</li>
            <li> She reports most of the extra attachments aren&#x27;t really necessary.</li>
            <li> Lesser pain (OK - it is not entirely painless).</li>
            <li> I mainly bought this for the trimmer and epilator.</li>
            <li> So many different attachments that can be used in multiple areas.</li>
            <li> Really like this one so far!</li>
            <li> My hair grows up pretty fast and they are thick so that waxing or epilating delayed the hair regrowth the most.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Plus, I love getting the little extras as well.</li>
            <li> I love this little machine.</li>
            <li> This great and ingenous little device takes a lot of the guess work out of grooming the \\&quot;hair down there\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how much I got when I got this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have so much fun using all the different heads that came with it.</li>
            <li> The epilator attachment puts it miles ahead of similar shavers, so it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great shaver, but doesnt last too long before it starts breaking down.</li>
            <li> Worked only once right when I received the package, and never again.</li>
            <li> It trims all the naughty bits easily and gets a close shave without giving irritation.   </li>
            <li> Long battery life, but even without the guard on it isn&#x27;t a super close shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It holds the charge super long.  </li>
            <li> but I think I can live with it</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife as she wanted a new razor.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job of cutting through real fast and being pain-less.</li>
            <li> I use the main trimming tip and  follow it up for a closer shave with the tip made for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for sensitive areas and haircare needs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, the white bag that it comes with is very very flimsy.</li>
            <li> This might seem strange but the trimmer is geared to be easily cleaned and utilized in several ways.  </li>
            <li> The pouch is very thin, but I was able to fit everything in there and zip it easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have only charged it when it first arrived.  </li>
            <li> The bag is pretty flimsy but convenient with multiple compartments for the attachments.</li>
            <li> I basically used the Philips tool first, and then had to go over the area with my regular razor.</li>
            <li> This really surprised me!  </li>
            <li> More expensive doesn&#x27;t always equal a better product.</li>
            <li> The electric shaver attachment does not work very well, so if you&#x27;re expecting this trimmer with that attachment to leave you bare, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first one about 8 or 9 years ago from Sephora, and it recently just isn&#x27;t holding a charge.</li>
            <li> Works ok if you are going to trim a small area like your chin, but I don&#x27;t even like it for the underarms.</li>
            <li> ; epilating gave me a lot of ingrown hairs and it takes way too long to be worth the pain.</li>
            <li> You can definitely get a pretty close trim with it too.</li>
            <li> A  potential fire hazard should anyone attempt to use it at a higher voltage.</li>
            <li> Higher quality should &#x3D; last longer, etc.</li>
            <li> But tweezers light worked for less than a week.</li>
            <li> This is the exact one minus the bliss sticker on the side and sooo much cheaper.</li>
            <li> It is small, quiet and effective.</li>
            <li> and it came with little tweezers with a light and mirror.</li>
            <li> The action is gentle and although the shave can be close, it isn&#x27;t close enough to irritate.  </li>
            <li> You click on them and all you get is the same old thing: the whole package or nothing&lt;</li>
            <li> but this one did considerably well.</li>
            <li> far as attachments go: there&#x27;s a precision tip for the bikini area and also one for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s an epilator attachments that removes the hair from the root so that it doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additional use: any one of the bikini area attachments can be used as hair trimmers for any area really, even on men if they don&#x27;t mind using the same tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was beyond surprised by the results...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to a precision trimmer head getting very close to the skin, but I went over and over the same spot, only to find that it still looked as though there was multiple days worth of growth.  </li>
            <li> This is a miracle and keep skin soft.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate all of the attachments that came with it especially the eyebrow trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have to trim, or I start looking like an old guy with hairs curling out of nostrils</li>
            <li> and I tried it on my downy soft, pre-teen leg fuzz (it was blond so not too Sasquatch-y for the 7th grade)...&lt;br</li>
            <li> I charged it for over 24 hours (the green light was on, indicating it was receiving power) and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why two of these in a row would be complete garbage, but they were.</li>
            <li> We both use it and it trims sensitive places efficiently.  </li>
            <li> So far I like this razor.</li>
            <li> The various options really work.</li>
            <li> I wear bathing suits with a fairly modest cut at the leg opening, so</li>
            <li> This is in direct contradiction to the written</li>
            <li> No problems thus far.</li>
            <li> I purchased one several years ago and it lasted really well.  </li>
            <li> whatever you do - do NOT use it without the guard, against any sensitive area...</li>
            <li> Initially loved it but something is wrong with the charger connection or battery and now it won&#x27;t charge.</li>
            <li> The illuminating tweezer was a major disapointment!!</li>
            <li> It also will make your skin red for a while afterwards, so I would not recommend doing it right before you are going out in public!  </li>
            <li> Product is a little challenging to clean but does its job with thick hair growth.</li>
            <li> The small design makes it easy to maneuver, and allows you to see what you are doing.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the grooves on the heads and handle are difficult to clean, and the the bits of the body that need be regularly lubricated get pretty gross fairly frequently, and subsequently require even more additional cleaning.</li>
            <li> far as the other attachments, the epilator was the one I was most curious about as the last time I was faced with an epilator was way back in the 80&#x27;s when the first epilady came out</li>
            <li> Tried it but the razor doesn&#x27;t catch a single hair the first 3 times you go over.</li>
            <li> does the job quickly and neatly down there...</li>
            <li> 2- I switched to the \\&quot;Micro Shaver\\&quot; to hopefully get down to a nice close shave, but alas, a significant amount of stuble was left.   </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older version of the same brand.</li>
            <li> BUT IF USED CAREFULLY ITS NOT A BAD ITEM, ESPECIALLY FOR THE COST!!</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re going for a certain length then it takes 3 times as long to even out your bikini area.</li>
            <li> normally wax or epilate, which obviously are time consuming (mainly because of the pain because I pause and take deep breaths</li>
            <li> Also you will get a carrying pouch an exfoliating glove and a tweezers with a light small mirror.</li>
            <li> I do however, enjoy the small razor attachment for the face and fingers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The foil cutter head, which is used for general trimming developed holes and thus cannot be used</li>
            <li> , its surface area is smaller than a normal dedicated epilators .</li>
            <li> After charging this shaver the first time, I got roughly an hour to 90 minutes of shave time with one charge.  </li>
            <li> Rechargeable batteries give out after 3-4 charges, plastic breaks, and only with normal use.</li>
            <li> In the middle of the tweezers is a white LED powered by a button battery, very clever indeed.</li>
            <li> I have been using a less expensive Bikini Trimmer for some time now, I&#x27;ve been very happy with it, but decided to try and upgrade with a more expensive product with all the bells and whistles this Trimmer comes with.  </li>
            <li> I could use my old charger or my old head attachments because it&#x27;s all the same.  </li>
            <li> Was so cheap that i didn&#x27;t want to waste time sending it back</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful but not super noisy.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is not very good for a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin but using this properly, I didn&#x27;t have any irritation at all.</li>
            <li> Very hard to change attachments, I basically use the trimmer most which works well</li>
            <li> Hard to explain, but it doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth as others that I have used.</li>
            <li> I like it does the job but not too wide and takes more time for my legs than usual.</li>
            <li> So apparently, this manufacturer does not stand behinds its product.</li>
            <li> this device is for the ladies who want their nether regions either sculpted (make an arrow, or a landing strip!), closely trimed (a.k.a. itchy) or bare all together (thats me)</li>
            <li> It comes with six different attachments, my least favorite being the epilator, which totally removes the hair at the root.  </li>
            <li> So I used I am adjusting to the trimmed instead of bare.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to replace an old Remington 5-in-1 personal grooming kit when it started to die.</li>
            <li> but i still use a razor i Trim it down first</li>
            <li> However, even though I have really small hands (they pretty much stopped growing since middle school), it still took a little bit of work to get into the gloves at first as they are so small that it seems like only a kid&#x27;s hands would fit in there</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this piece of equipment due to the fact that the blades in each attachment are not sharp and cause too much irritation (no matter how it is utilized).  </li>
            <li> I came back to amazon and cannot find any evidence that it is used or refurbished - and the packaging was completely new - giant plastic sealed in...</li>
            <li> I like the multifunction aspect of this particular one (the various attachments), the fact that it can be used wet or dry, can be cleaned very well, is rechargeable, and the price is right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works well for bikini trimming short but not down to the skin which is what I want.</li>
            <li> The other attachments let you choose how close you want to shave, and how much you want to shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;For a final touch, I popped on the micro shaver attachment and went over the entire (newly) shaved and trimmed area, which left my bikini area</li>
            <li> /&gt;For a final touch, I popped on the micro shaver attachment and went over the entire (newly) shaved and trimmed area, which left my bikini area</li>
            <li> Without going into too much uncomfortable detail, it&#x27;s easy to handle, intuitively designed, cuts very well without pulling, and has different length settings.</li>
            <li> I also like it to be quick, as painless a possible, not too messy, and low cost.   </li>
            <li> The only ones I use on a regular basis though are the regular trimmer head, and the epilator has been great for all the random hairs that popped up due to pregnancy hormones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other brands which would typically stop working after awhile because they&#x27;d get all clogged up with hair and wouldn&#x27;t easily clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand the need for the LED tweezers unless I ever needed to tweeze in the dark I suppose.</li>
            <li> One day, it just stopped working, but I was surprised that it had lasted so long, so we bought another one.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just haven&#x27;t explored how to use this product enough, but I have barely used it at all.  </li>
            <li> It still has the old standby attachments such as a precision trimmer and micro shaver, but the micro trimmer, eyebrow comb, epilator, and accessories are clearly not just repackaged men&#x27;s ones.</li>
            <li> The epilator head has also broken into three pieces but was easily reassembled.</li>
            <li> I tried to use the epilator as they call it to try and get it down to the roots but even while following directions, it hurt so much that I just put it</li>
            <li> It really only trims the hair down to a certain point, and then I have to use a regular razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weak, its cheap.  </li>
            <li> : I think it&#x27;s a decent product for keeping the hair down there in check, but it doesn&#x27;t provide a close enough shave for the bikini days.</li>
            <li> I read the good and the bad reviews and figured for the price (which is one visit to the wax salon)</li>
            <li> the actual trimmer, 6 different attachments, a carrying pouch, a wall charger, an exfoliating glove and a tweezer with a light and a small mirror for tweezing down there.</li>
            <li> This is a little more expensive than the other comparable products but worth it.</li>
            <li> This Trimmer leaves a significant amount of hair length behind.</li>
            <li> The epilator hurts, but seems to work - but takes a long time because the unit is pretty small.    </li>
            <li> It takes too long to use it as the area it covers at a time is pretty small.</li>
            <li> Efficient, quiet, long lasting battery.  </li>
            <li> It does not shave anywhere near close enough, the trimmer is not that precise and sometimes grabs the hair rather than cutting it.  </li>
            <li> It is small and very compact...</li>
            <li> how well it works and how long it will last</li>
            <li> I charge mine once every 1-2 months, and the batteries last a long time.</li>
            <li> I pretty much only use the trimmer for the bikini area, although I have used the epilator down there a few times.</li>
            <li> It traps hair in it because it is so large and hollow, so I end up having to take it off a few times to rinse it out while I am using it.  </li>
            <li> I guess my smaller, tighter head on the old Remington trimmer spoiled me a little.  </li>
            <li> You can use it wet/dry, but I&#x27;ve stuck to using it dry and only once in the shower (in avoidance and fear of it rusting out on me.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charge doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long, but as long as I charge the trimmer before or after every use I don&#x27;t have an issue with it.</li>
            <li> , This product is a multiple use grooming tool, but it&#x27;s for the bikini areas specialty has 6 different attachments a precision tip for the bikini area, one for sensitive skin one epilator attachment, and one a small tip for trimming.</li>
            <li> Just think of it as something similar to a loose tooth tied to a string which is then tied to a door knob.</li>
            <li> and if you have long fingers, forget about</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s nature trail and accompanying forest grow in at an alarming rate, and she has to constantly battle the onslaught of the encroaching darkness.</li>
            <li> Having diabetes, I have to be careful of cuts, etc, especially on my legs and feet.  </li>
            <li> And it holds a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Biggest reason I decided to try something different was because hair jammed up my Remington, no matter how often I rinsed it.</li>
            <li> The attachment heights are all too long to get a close trim.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> While trimming, I realized I&#x27;d had it a really long time now, and decided to make a review.</li>
            <li> would say the only downside is that there&#x27;s not much warning when it&#x27;s dying.</li>
            <li> It runs for a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;6 stars to Amazon for taking back this useless product for full refund.</li>
            <li> They work if what u want is 0.5cm long!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to get one of these!</li>
            <li> The charge lasts surprisingly long!</li>
            <li> , I have used other products similar to this one but none are even compared to its quality.</li>
            <li> It holds the charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It has a very long battery life.</li>
            <li> Someone said she bought it anyway even though many people left bad reviews.</li>
            <li> even a closer shave done dry does not leave irritated skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They can do better with the white carrying case, a bit small and made of very thin material.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needless to say, the reviewers of this product that said not to buy it were totally right!  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t send the product back because it is not worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I tired the many different heads and product performs poorly.</li>
            <li> The foils on the shaver head broke within the first few weeks, the cap for the trimmer is essentially useless (pops straight off unless you&#x27;re actively holding it in place), and --</li>
            <li> It just sort of hangs there loosely</li>
            <li> I purchased an Epilady epilator and it didn&#x27;t hold a charge long enough to epilate a little armpit.</li>
            <li> The trimmer can be used wet or dry and</li>
            <li> Ots rechargeable and can be used wet or dry, which is a bonus in my book.</li>
            <li> Designed for wet and dry which is well-suited to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly but I was not impressed.  </li>
            <li> The micro trimmer has a head slightly under 3/8 of an inch wide, properly offset from the body for visibility and ease of use.</li>
            <li> I received mine and I am a little concerned that while inspecting this &amp;#34;brand new&amp;#34; product, I found short pieces of hair in the attached piece!</li>
            <li> Hardly trims the hair at all; you have to make several passes over the same area.  </li>
            <li> The only negative, like others have said, is that the tiny shaver attachment doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t even need a pink handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Despite air drying it after use it managed to stop working after only a few months of bi-weekly use.</li>
            <li> Not much to say...</li>
            <li> I HAVE TO BE REALLY CAREFUL</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t just slow and get slower and slower when it&#x27;s dying; it works close to 100% even when it&#x27;s near dying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews about being afraid of the epilator, but really, a paper cut is more uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> She generally opts out for eyebrow threading because that has to be done less often than tweezing or waxing, At some point I decided to help her with a few stray hairs that had grown.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I would do my whole leg with it, but for those problematic areas with random hair (for me, my inner thighs, and I&#x27;ve also used it on my bikini line and upper lip)</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It also has a rectangular mirror inside the tube, which alas, is too small to really be useful for its purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t shave \\&quot;down there\\&quot; for several weeks you can fix it up in just a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Will have to be replaced ever few years if you use it regularly as the motor will eventually become less efficient.</li>
            <li> The ability to use the shaver in the shower makes this extremely convenient.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for any of the other attachments.</li>
            <li> However you can not expect an extremely close shave from any electric razor unless you use an epilator  attachment.</li>
            <li> I like that it comes with a case, other attachments, and is waterproof.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare it to any other.</li>
            <li> I can us it for other parts of my body.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The personal groomers I&#x27;ve had in the past were battery operated</li>
            <li> I choose it for price and other reviews.  </li>
            <li> You have to use it very carefully.</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself is so small (all of the attachments are small) that it is not really useful for trimming anything but tiny tiny areas.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that the description did not make it clear that this only runs on 110V. Totally unsuitable for international customers.</li>
            <li> but the large size makes it difficult to shape the nether regions well.  </li>
            <li> I was a blade user prior to this, and blades can be hard to compete with for closeness.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how this will hold up in the long run in terms of staying sharp.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the price, his trimmer is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> It really is not worth it.</li>
            <li> It is not worth any stars.)</li>
            <li> It was also irritating to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I get a nick every time I use this thing - not terrible but annoying.</li>
            <li> It made grooming \\&quot;down there\\&quot; a million times easier than I&#x27;m used to (scissors, razors).</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re like me and you keep some hair down there</li>
            <li> I always was nervous shaving down there.</li>
            <li> I previously reviewed [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I guess because the razor has less work to do</li>
            <li> but you want it to be shorter and less bushy, then get this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> oh, and I created a little arrow, pointing down.</li>
            <li> oh, and I created a little arrow, pointing down.</li>
            <li> The long hair trimmer sucks.</li>
            <li> The plastic cover that adjusts the height of the shave is a little wiggly</li>
            <li> From a little trimming to a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> The task just got a little easier.</li>
            <li> I just wish the power was a little stronger and the blades were a bit sharper.</li>
            <li> this little gadget it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this little gadget it.     </li>
            <li> took a little getting used to.  </li>
            <li> A little noisy..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that the guard is flimsy - makes me a little nervous around the lady</li>
            <li> I used it without and then ended up with a few little cuts.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> so you will want to have a firm grip or else</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the narrow head/blades</li>
            <li> I shall update my rewiew in a few months if the tide turns, and she has been beaten by the hairy beast once again.</li>
            <li> I got one of these years ago from sephora when they collaborated with bliss, it died on me after a few years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> Leaves area choppy and uneven.</li>
            <li> I did have a few snags though.</li>
            <li> Seriously, don&#x27;t waste you money on this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cordless, but is rechargeable so money isn&#x27;t wasted on batteries...</li>
            <li> the cutter head is not covered because it is an \\&quot;accessory\\&quot; and is not available anyway.</li>
            <li> It would get gunked up and eventually the blades had trouble moving because of it.</li>
            <li> but the battery is dead.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned, I have been using a Trimmer in the past which gets down to the skin as though I have used a razor, but with out the irritation.</li>
            <li> , this is a small price to pay for less pain and</li>
            <li> I purchased this a little over 2 years ago, and it&#x27;s dead!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just so odd that a unit this expensive would have such a design flaw.</li>
            <li> it is so much less messy and time consuming than the waxing I was doing before!!</li>
            <li> The tweezers itself leaves a little bit to be desired as it was hard to grab hairs</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also a small tip for trimming your eyebrows and an eyebrow</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m not a fan of the depilatory attachment: not only because it hurts but it fails to remove all the hair without breakage.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> The head of it is rather small.  </li>
            <li> I will update my review if anything out of the ordinary happens with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will update my review if anything out of the ordinary happens with it.      </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have one yet, then you&#x27;re missing out!</li>
            <li> I am not sure why Philips would sell such a lousy product.  </li>
            <li> There is no click or usual snugness or anything for the power cord to go into place.</li>
            <li> I took everything apart and washed all of the components, but I am not sure they are sanitized and I am weary of using this product.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure I want a used bikini shaver....</li>
            <li> waste your money like I did!</li>
            <li> My old trimmer had an issue where hair would get trapped inside the head of the trimmer and was all but impossible to get out.</li>
            <li> worst of all -- the epilator left me with painful broken hairs (please note that I am experienced with epilating and</li>
            <li> I have annoying facial hair that I have to remove daily.</li>
            <li> In fact, it is less painful than a tweezers as the hair comes off quicker before you actually know it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just so hard to change them, I feel like they&#x27;re going to break.</li>
            <li> I dropped it quite hard this time and it broke.  </li>
            <li> At least I can borrow the micro trimmer/shaver (which are designed for the face) when we&#x27;re on trips.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife after she complained about the trimmer she had.</li>
            <li> My husband complained one day that his beard trimmer was rusty and smelled like vagina.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled about the power button being on the front, but I&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
            <li> I feel like the people who are giving this negative reviews are looking for a shaver and not a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Not sure why manufacturers include cheesy little travel bags for products like this...never use them.</li>
            <li> The epilator is not as scary as the other reviews suggest.</li>
            <li> Was never able to be used and no return since I purchased it in advance of the gifing date!  </li>
            <li> If you are one of those who waxes or pull them off clean to the root with a pair of tweezers, the epilator will not be as terrifying as it sounds</li>
            <li> This product is not very good compared to my conair shaver that has now been discontinued!</li>
            <li> While this product may be a little expensive, it works as a bikini trimmer</li>
            <li> /&gt;This unit failed after less than 11 months of infrequent use and the company will not stand behind it</li>
            <li> DUE TO THE DAMAGE/DEATH FACTOR INVOLVED IN ME CUTTING OR BLEEDING....</li>
            <li> If you are attracted to this product because of this neat twizer as an extra, I just want to caution you that you might be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Also, the blade is very hard on your skin.</li>
            <li> It was a bit uncomfortable to say the least.  </li>
            <li> so I gave it to my husband because his trimmer was broken.</li>
            <li> It gives a close shave without irritating skin.</li>
            <li> not a one fits all idea that is sold behind this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have seen such a worthless piece of equipment.  </li>
            <li> I am on here searching for a new one, but couldn&#x27;t help leaving a review on this terrible product.  </li>
            <li> so it wont be as painful as it pulls out less hair at a time.</li>
            <li> My mom finds tweezing painful and it usually makes her eyelids swell up.</li>
            <li> No more painful razor burn trying to maintain my bikini area.  </li>
            <li> When I bought it I thought I would just use the bikini trimmer, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Sorry Philips.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this device is useless.</li>
            <li> that gets a close shave AND doesn&#x27;t yank random hairs.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that the quality of everything would be poor because it comes with a lot for the price</li>
            <li> I got these and for me they a bit difficult to use.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t an incredibly expensive piece</li>
            <li> Although this product is covered by a two year warranty, and four years on the cutter, the warranty is useless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beginning to seem like they are all incredibly poor quality!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tedious.</li>
            <li> Comes with everything you need to trim that difficult area.</li>
            <li> If they&#x27;re going to offer the razor itself with all these worthless attachments, at least they could let us know where to get a replacement charger.</li>
            <li> Gone are the days of having to go that route and take the chance of cutting too closely or accidentally cutting yourself.  </li>
            <li> Becareful not to trim your eyebrows into one lengthed shape, though, or it will look weird!</li>
            <li> The Bad:  </li>
            <li> Bad.</li>
            <li> I tried the epilator attachment and found it to be too painful, but that&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that item to be so painful, I cried.</li>
            <li> The Phillips epilator head that comes with this trimmer is neither irratating nor extremely painful.</li>
            <li> It grabs the hair from the root, and it is not as painful as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> It is painful but all epilators are.</li>
            <li> However, thinking about doing it everytime would make me frustrated.</li>
            <li> I was, however, disappointed with the micro shaver.</li>
            <li> I have been waxed for over 10 years and hate the part when the hair just begins to pop through the surface.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worthless at this point</li>
            <li> And none of the attachments get a close shave - completely worthless for legs or underarms.  </li>
            <li> The power cord will not plug into the base of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> But &amp;#34;bad out of the box&amp;#34; is the worst disappointment for any product.</li>
            <li> I hate to say it, but I was very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will be in pain and very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Terrible device&lt;br /&gt;Needed to return it</li>
            <li> This is the worst bikini trimmer I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> It is truly awful!  </li>
            <li> It hurts worst to pluck your eyebrows than use this!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning up the bikini and eyebrow area has always been absolutely boring, un-imaginative and time consuming.  </li>
            <li> It was so disgusting when I want to use it and found there was body hair in the product.</li>
            <li> It is awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So far works pretty well. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that, per the manual, it takes 10 hours to get a full charge.</li>
            <li> Great personal grooming set with lots of attachments. I like that its also rechargeable instead of having to use double AA&#x27;s. Nice touches like the led lit tweezers/mirror and convenient carry bag rounds out the package and makes it a great value.</li>
            <li> The following is from my daughter (not Wayne):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Bikini Perfect represents a new breed of product truly tailored toward a woman&#x27;s needs. It still has the old standby attachments such as a precision trimmer and micro shaver, but the micro trimmer, eyebrow comb, epilator, and accessories are clearly not just repackaged men&#x27;s ones. The shape of the precision trimmer is more like a mini blade razor head rather than a narrower tipped attachment as seen in older models. Even the included illuminated tweezers have a strip shaped mirror that does not have the awkwardness of a \\&quot;compact\\&quot; mirror. The epliator attachment is designed to grab hairs by the roots so they are gone for weeks. It can \\&quot;tweeze\\&quot; larger areas faster. The micro trimmer has a head slightly under 3/8 of an inch wide, properly offset from the body for visibility and ease of use. An exfoliation glove is also included. The overall suite of attachments is unquestionably well suited. And it doesn&#x27;t even need a pink handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The proof of any product is in its use. I was asked to consider issues such as snagging, red bumps and irritation, closeness and maneuverability, ease of use, smoothness, and \\&quot;day after\\&quot; feel, as well as longer term use. I was a blade user prior to this, and blades can be hard to compete with for closeness. Nevertheless, I did not have irritation problems, and found this to be a pleasure to use. No electric razor will be 100% snag free but this one did considerably well. Of course an epilator is a modern day torture device that&#x27;s not supposed to be snag free, but it did its job of sticking with hairs and not skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, there&#x27;s a lot to like about this product. The travel case is utilitarian at best, but the product itself created an enthusiastic fan.</li>
            <li> My wife is quite happy with this razor.  It does a nice job maybe not quite waxing quality results but pretty good especially with the epilator attachment (as long as you can stand the pain).  The ability to use the shaver in the shower makes this extremely convenient.  Good power and have had no problems with holding a charge.  Have only charged it when it first arrived.  Comfortable to hold and easy to maneuver.  Cleaning is a snap.  The Mrs. likes it..    The lighted tweezers are great.  The bag is pretty flimsy but convenient with multiple compartments for the attachments.</li>
            <li> This product is not very good compared to my conair shaver that has now been discontinued! I have cut myself several times while shaving. You have to use it very carefully. However, this company shipped it on time and the packaging was very well done.</li>
            <li> Terrible device&lt;br /&gt;Needed to return it</li>
            <li> Has been working great. I rarely charge it and it&#x27;s always ready. The plastic cover that adjusts the height of the shave is a little wiggly so you will want to have a firm grip or else you may end up lopping off more than you desire. I haven&#x27;t used the narrow head/blades so I can&#x27;t say how precise they are.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how much I got when I got this trimmer. It came with a variety of different shaving heads for this as well as an exfoliating glove, travel case, and a light up tweezer. The trimmer itself does what it says it does, which is trim your bikini area. It does a good job of cutting through real fast and being pain-less. However, do realize that the trimmer will not give a clean shave. It just trims. I am not sure how this will hold up in the long run in terms of staying sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is light and easy to carry around. I tried to use the epilator as they call it to try and get it down to the roots but even while following directions, it hurt so much that I just put it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the other extras, the carry case is made of cheap fabrics but it works and I was able to get all of my attachments and the handle in there, even the brush for cleaning it. The exfoliating glove I have yet to use as I haven&#x27;t really had a need for it. However, even though I have really small hands (they pretty much stopped growing since middle school), it still took a little bit of work to get into the gloves at first as they are so small that it seems like only a kid&#x27;s hands would fit in there and if you have long fingers, forget about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy the idea of the light up tweezers as the light provides a lot of illumination and you can see the hairs better. The tweezers itself leaves a little bit to be desired as it was hard to grab hairs with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am happy with this trimmer as it does what it says it does. Plus, I love getting the little extras as well. You get a lot for the price.</li>
            <li> Okay, not as great as my last trimmer but does a decent job</li>
            <li> A word about the packaging - it&#x27;s very cute and girly; definitely made me excited to put this product to use. This product is really a multiple-use grooming tool, even thought it&#x27;s targeted mostly for the bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you get in the box: the actual trimmer, 6 different attachments, a carrying pouch, a wall charger, an exfoliating glove and a tweezer with a light and a small mirror for tweezing down there. The pouch is very thin, but I was able to fit everything in there and zip it easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as attachments go: there&#x27;s a precision tip for the bikini area and also one for sensitive skin. There&#x27;s an epilator attachments that removes the hair from the root so that it doesn&#x27;t grow back as fast. There&#x27;s also a small tip for trimming your eyebrows and an eyebrow brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why I am giving this product 3 stars: while the bikini trimming attachments are good for removing longer hairs or large amounts of hair, I was not able to get a close shave with them. I basically used the Philips tool first, and then had to go over the area with my regular razor. I tried the epilator attachment and found it to be too painful, but that&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I loved the eyebrow attachment and the lighted tweezer that came in the box. The eyebrow attachment is great for trimming in between waxes, or on the top of the eybrow where I prefer not to tweeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional use: any one of the bikini area attachments can be used as hair trimmers for any area really, even on men if they don&#x27;t mind using the same tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I think it&#x27;s a decent product for keeping the hair down there in check, but it doesn&#x27;t provide a close enough shave for the bikini days.</li>
            <li> The packaging it&#x27;s very cute I like a lot the color aqua and that look very nice, This product is a multiple use grooming tool, but it&#x27;s for the bikini areas specialty has 6 different attachments a precision tip for the bikini area, one for sensitive skin one epilator attachment, and one a small tip for trimming. Also you will get a carrying pouch an exfoliating glove and a tweezers with a light small mirror. Easy to use and easy to clean, a good product I like it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> She reports it is handy and effective. No painful nicks. Easy to use. She reports most of the extra attachments aren&#x27;t really necessary. It is especially good for defining edges rather than shaving completely. It is easy to clean. For the quality it does seem over-priced... maybe about 30 bucks rather than 50 in our opinion.   OK, you look great! Let&#x27;s hit the pool! :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this trimmer. It is light but does the job very well. Very practical as it contours around very easily. I have very sensitive skin, and had to stop waxing all together, and shaving irritates me too much, so this was the perfect solution. No itching for me. Great buy!!  It can also be used on eyebrows. It comes with tweezers that have a tiny light attached to them, nice bonus. I love and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Keeping a bikini line in check can be a challenge when using a regular razor.  Gone are the days of having to go that route and take the chance of cutting too closely or accidentally cutting yourself.  This great and ingenous little device takes a lot of the guess work out of grooming the \\&quot;hair down there\\&quot;.  The many attachments included allow for customization to trim the way you choose.  From a little trimming to a closer shave.  The trimmer can be used wet or dry and even a closer shave done dry does not leave irritated skin.  This really surprised me!  The action is gentle and although the shave can be close, it isn&#x27;t close enough to irritate.  Cleaning the unit is simple and there is also an attachment to trim and shape eyebrows.  This might seem strange but the trimmer is geared to be easily cleaned and utilized in several ways.  There is an epilator head attachment that allows you to epilate (in essence pulling hair out at their roots).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a sturdy, ergonomic unit that should get some great years of use.  It came with a carrying case and a bonus lighted tweezers.  They are actually a nice set of tweezers to tackle any pesky hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great kit and a must for those who like to groom their bikini line and keep things nice and neat.  The task just got a little easier.</li>
            <li> This product came with a bunch of useful accessories - an exfoliating glove, LED-lit tweezers, a number of attachments for the trimmer, and a bag for it all.    The trimmer itself is so small (all of the attachments are small) that it is not really useful for trimming anything but tiny tiny areas.</li>
            <li> This trimmer just rocked my bikini line! I have always waxed and found my problems with ingrowns so I got a trimmer and I was beyond surprised by the results...so is my boyfriend :) I will probably wax if I go on a vacation and need everything clean, but this will be something I use all the time! Super easy to use and clean!!! Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Never again will I purchase a produce like this one.not worth your money.</li>
            <li> Perfect for all a girls trimming needs. Lots of options and attachments.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a little over 2 years ago, and it&#x27;s dead! The search continues for a reliable lady shaver</li>
            <li> Best bikini trimmer ever! It is truly as close as you&#x27;re going to get!</li>
            <li> I have been using this epilator for years and the product does not disappoint on the whole too much. The Achilles of this product happens to be its sensitivity. I needed to replace it as it broke when accidentally dropped. The epilator head has also broken into three pieces but was easily reassembled. As for the other three heads it comes with, I&#x27;m not even sure two of them are functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is still a gentle epilator considering what else is on the market. Ots rechargeable and can be used wet or dry, which is a bonus in my book.</li>
            <li> I have had this item for several months now and it works fine. I really am just using the trimmer for the bikini area. I can&#x27;t speak for any of the other attachments.</li>
            <li> This is a good little shaver.  Would prefer the plug in version for consistent power.  I have the Braun Silk Epil which is great but the large size makes it difficult to shape the nether regions well.  I tried the eyebrow trimmer on this Philips and do not think it works.</li>
            <li> It has a trimmer, a foil shaver and an epilator. Designed for wet and dry which is well-suited to use in the shower. It is very small and very light, which makes it real handy. Charging is quick for a rated 60 minutes of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) You have a choice between a regular trimmer, and the tiny trimmer for the eyebrows. Both of them come with an accessory so you have control of the length of the trim. If you are in a hurry and you want to DIY, the eyebrow trimmer is a good choice. Otherwise, threading is still much better as it looks better.&lt;br /&gt;b) The foil works best when the hair is much shorter or when they are just stub length. It is also much safer without any exposed blade.&lt;br /&gt;c) The epilator is the beast of all the attachments. I never heard my wife giggled and scream as much since our first night. If you are one of those who waxes or pull them off clean to the root with a pair of tweezers, the epilator will not be as terrifying as it sounds it is. In fact, it is less painful than a tweezers as the hair comes off quicker before you actually know it. Just think of it as something similar to a loose tooth tied to a string which is then tied to a door knob. Lesser pain (OK - it is not entirely painless). Just one con with the epilator attachment, its surface area is smaller than a normal dedicated epilators . But hey, no shaving can beat as close as you can get with an epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We fell in love with the lighted tweezers which is such a novelty. It is housed in a sleek lipstick-shaped container - sturdy metal construction. In the middle of the tweezers is a white LED powered by a button battery, very clever indeed. It also has a rectangular mirror inside the tube, which alas, is too small to really be useful for its purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They can do better with the white carrying case, a bit small and made of very thin material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product. Made in China.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I have really hairy legs. This means that I also have a hairy bikini area. Additionally, this means that I have bushy eyebrows.   In modern society women having an abundance of hair is frowned upon, which means that women resolve to all kinds of hair removal techniques. I like to be low maintenance about my choices of hair removal. I also like it to be quick, as painless a possible, not too messy, and low cost.   This profuct allows all of those criteria to be satisfied. It takes about 3 minutes to shave an entire bikini area. It trims all the naughty bits easily and gets a close shave without giving irritation.   Additionally, the product comes with different head attachments - one of which is an epilator head. I previously reviewed [[ASIN:B00006592X Braun SE3170 Silk-épil 3 SoftPerfection Epilator]]. I found that item to be so painful, I cried. It was also irritating to my sensitive skin. The Phillips epilator head that comes with this trimmer is neither irratating nor extremely painful. When there are a few stray hairs, it does a wonderful job of removing them entirely.   This product would be worth alone based on the shaving and trimmer heads, but it also comes with an eyebrow tweezers.   My mom finds tweezing painful and it usually makes her eyelids swell up. She generally opts out for eyebrow threading because that has to be done less often than tweezing or waxing, At some point I decided to help her with a few stray hairs that had grown. She loved these particular tweezers, whereas she had rejected the top of the line Sephora Professional series tweezers I tried previously and Tweezerman tweezers.    I would highly recommend this product for sensitive areas and haircare needs.</li>
            <li> For the price, his trimmer is not worth it. Despite air drying it after use it managed to stop working after only a few months of bi-weekly use. The narrow trimmer is nice, but I&#x27;ve since switched over to the more affordable and effective Panasonic ES2207P.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife for Christmas to replace another brand she had. My wife&#x27;s nature trail and accompanying forest grow in at an alarming rate, and she has to constantly battle the onslaught of the encroaching darkness. This Philips trimmer seems to have everything she needs in her fight, and it has already proven a worthy adversary in her battles. She wasn&#x27;t too keen on using the epilator as it seems rip out the remaining trunks after the initial trim, but everything else works great. I shall update my rewiew in a few months if the tide turns, and she has been beaten by the hairy beast once again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for one of these for years. By far the best bikini trimmer. I got one of these years ago from sephora when they collaborated with bliss, it died on me after a few years. This is the exact one minus the bliss sticker on the side and sooo much cheaper. Works like a charm, great if you&#x27;re like me and allergic to shaving !</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly but I was not impressed.  The package came with a battery operated tweezers, but the battery did not work.  I call the phone number listed on the enclosure for assistance, (the manufacturer) and they said that the product I bought was no longer be made and they wouldn&#x27;t help me.  I just asked for them to send a replacement battery because that was what swayed me to purchase this item over another.  So apparently, this manufacturer does not stand behinds its product.</li>
            <li> I wish my two men&#x27;s hair trimmers by the same company would be as attractive and flexible as this one. At least I can borrow the micro trimmer/shaver (which are designed for the face) when we&#x27;re on trips. My wife likes this unit (except for the epilator which can irritate the skin and may also hurt a lot) and the charge holds better than other trimmers. If you&#x27;re time constrained, this trimmer is great for small areas, otherwise you may be more efficient with an old fashioned blade. The unit is very compact. Being able to use it in the shower is a big plus for my wife.</li>
            <li> Awesome way to stay trim and clean. Love it.</li>
            <li> This product is ok - I like that you can use it in the shower since it&#x27;s always best to shave wet hair that&#x27;s been softened. As a bikini razor, it just doesn&#x27;t get close enough. It&#x27;s ok, but not super smooth. The epilator hurts, but seems to work - but takes a long time because the unit is pretty small.    Overall, it&#x27;s an ok device. It&#x27;s easy to use, it&#x27;s easy to clean, and it works pretty well, but the shave just doesn&#x27;t seem to be close enough because you get stubble back much faster than with a regular manual blade.    Not sure why manufacturers include cheesy little travel bags for products like this...never use them.</li>
            <li> Great love it makes shaving a breeze</li>
            <li> I have so much fun using all the different heads that came with it. When I bought it I thought I would just use the bikini trimmer, but I was wrong. Each one has a different purpose and they all work wonderfully. I am exceptionally happy with the epi head. It grabs the hair from the root, and it is not as painful as I thought it would be. I use it to remove the hair from my legs, and I stay hair free for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I hate to say it, but I was very disappointed in this product. I have been using a less expensive Bikini Trimmer for some time now, I&#x27;ve been very happy with it, but decided to try and upgrade with a more expensive product with all the bells and whistles this Trimmer comes with.  The Good:   1- It charges very quickly and holds the charge very well.   2- It does come with multiple convenient tools, such as the \\&quot;Epilator\\&quot;--which pulls the hair by the root! And the \\&quot;Lighted Tweezers\\&quot; are very convenient.  The Bad:  1- The \\&quot;Precision Trimmer\\&quot; leaves a significant length of hair! I&#x27;m used to a precision trimmer head getting very close to the skin, but I went over and over the same spot, only to find that it still looked as though there was multiple days worth of growth.  2- I switched to the \\&quot;Micro Shaver\\&quot; to hopefully get down to a nice close shave, but alas, a significant amount of stuble was left.   3- It irritated my skin! It looked and felt as though I had razor burn! This is the very reason I use a Trimmer instead of a razor or waxing, etc.   As I mentioned, I have been using a Trimmer in the past which gets down to the skin as though I have used a razor, but with out the irritation. This Trimmer leaves a significant amount of hair length behind. I tried all the other tools to make sure I was using everything correctly, but no. Sorry Philips. More expensive doesn&#x27;t always equal a better product.</li>
            <li> Long battery life, but even without the guard on it isn&#x27;t a super close shave. My last trimmer (Remmington) got a closer shave but the battery barely lasted one full trim &amp;#34;down there.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;My husband likes this one for shaving his neck though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now.  It is the first trimmer that I have used for \\&quot;personal\\&quot; grooming.  I like it well enough, but found that it does have a couple flaws.  It doesn&#x27;t get close enough with the attachments.  I used it without and then ended up with a few little cuts.&lt;br /&gt;What I do really like is that it charges quickly and doesn&#x27;t need to be charged too often.  I&#x27;ve let it go without being charged for a couple of weeks.  It is nice that it is usable in the shower and this is where I use it most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a simple and easy to use trimmer, but don&#x27;t expect it to replace a razor.  It is good for keeping this from getting overgrown, but not making it smooth.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this device is useless. It&#x27;s seems exciting with its endless options, and the size appears just right, BUT it doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> This is the worst bikini trimmer I have ever used!  It is truly awful!  It doesn&#x27;t hold a charge, it takes forever to charge, you can&#x27;t use is while it&#x27;s plugged in charging.  It&#x27;s weak, its cheap.  I am on here searching for a new one, but couldn&#x27;t help leaving a review on this terrible product.  I would never buy it again.  It&#x27;s cheaper now than what I payed for it, but it still isn&#x27;t worth even a dollar.</li>
            <li> Actually it turns out to be quite nice. works better than others.</li>
            <li> Quit working after 5 months!</li>
            <li> This is a great bikini trimmer, but not a good product if you want to go bare. I mostly use the two trimmer attachments without the hair length adjusting attachments because I find they work best by themselves. The electric shaver attachment does not work very well, so if you&#x27;re expecting this trimmer with that attachment to leave you bare, don&#x27;t buy it. Also, I&#x27;m not a fan of the depilatory attachment: not only because it hurts but it fails to remove all the hair without breakage. I love this trimmer for a trimmer but did not find all the other attachments very useful.</li>
            <li> This was NOT what I was expecting. I thought it could be used for shaving but it left a lot of hair no matter what attachment I used. I did get pinched a couple times by a couple of the attachments in a place you don&#x27;t want to get pinched. Ouch! Sending it back. I wish there was a good electric bikini shaver out there that gets a close shave AND doesn&#x27;t yank random hairs.</li>
            <li> I love it! I bring it always with me .. I have annoying facial hair that I have to remove daily. This is a miracle and keep skin soft.</li>
            <li> Works great, no problems at all.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this thing, so that makes me happy with it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer comes with everything you need. I love that it comes with the bikini touch pen as well, that way when you are on the go you can just throw it in your purse. This was so easy to use and did the job so quickly. I can&#x27;t believe I was using a different product for so many years. Haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower yet though but I can already tell it leaves me with no irritation and there was no pinching. Buy this you will love it!</li>
            <li> We had one of these that lasted us about 5 years! One day, it just stopped working, but I was surprised that it had lasted so long, so we bought another one. It works fine in and out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Lets be blunt. this device is for the ladies who want their nether regions either sculpted (make an arrow, or a landing strip!), closely trimed (a.k.a. itchy) or bare all together (thats me) So I basically would be using the one attachment for the close shave. I was excited that the Bikini Perfect could be used wet or dry, no one likes a dry shave unless she is looking to be punished. This device must be charged a full 10 hours for every 60 minutes you want to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I charged it, followed the directions and wasnt impressed. I get a closer shave with a disposable razor. It irritated my skin, in fact it wasnt a close shave in the slightest.  For an electric shaver to then require you to follow up with a regular razor doesnt make any sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if my ...ehem...hair needs to be longer for it to work better? do I need to let the garden grow? I will try that and then edit if it made a difference.</li>
            <li> At first I was hesitant to use an electric/rechargeable shaver.  Having diabetes, I have to be careful of cuts, etc, especially on my legs and feet.  The Philips Hp6378/10 Bikini Perfect Deluxe Trimmer put my worries to rest -- it was easy to use and worked magically!     After charging this shaver the first time, I got roughly an hour to 90 minutes of shave time with one charge.  It comes with six different attachments, my least favorite being the epilator, which totally removes the hair at the root.  It was a bit uncomfortable to say the least.  The other attachments let you choose how close you want to shave, and how much you want to shave.  Nicked skin was not an issue with this shaver, and for that alone I would buy this product!      The Philips Hp6378/10 Trimmer also comes with additional items -- a pair of ex-foliating gloves, a pair of lighted tweezers with its own case, as well as a travel bag that the shaver, attachments, tweezers, and gloves as fit comfortably in.      I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is considering purchasing this handy dandy shaver.    Natalie S. for Amazon Vine</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife after she complained about the trimmer she had. She really likes it and was glad she was able to get very close without worry of nicks. She has not tried the epilator however, she tossed out her remaining bikini razors, so that says something.</li>
            <li> My husband complained one day that his beard trimmer was rusty and smelled like vagina.  At that point I decided it was time to purchase my own.  I can leave this one in the shower, and the attachments change out easily and there are enough options to craft my look to my every whim.</li>
            <li> Not much to say... Works how it&#x27;s supposed too, my wife loved it!&lt;br /&gt;Good dealer, got in perfect conditions and in time</li>
            <li> I love this.  So easy to use in the shower or out!  I only wish the battery would last longer.</li>
            <li> Product is a little challenging to clean but does its job with thick hair growth. Nice product as a replacement for shaving.</li>
            <li> I love this item. Even if you don&#x27;t shave \\&quot;down there\\&quot; for several weeks you can fix it up in just a few seconds. I use the main trimming tip and  follow it up for a closer shave with the tip made for sensitive skin. I also love the eyebrow tools for shaping. The epilator works well. It is painful but all epilators are. However you can not expect an extremely close shave from any electric razor unless you use an epilator  attachment. I was afraid that the quality of everything would be poor because it comes with a lot for the price but I couldn&#x27;t be more wrong. This device is also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Does the trick - been using this for years. Comes with a lot of options for hair removal &amp; trimming.</li>
            <li> I was hesitated to buy one because I&#x27;ve never used one. I read all the reviews and got scared by everyone&#x27;s comments. Don&#x27;t! This was so easy to use! It gave me great results. It made grooming \\&quot;down there\\&quot; a million times easier than I&#x27;m used to (scissors, razors). I definitely recommend this to anyone! I liked the variety of attachments. The epilator is not as scary as the other reviews suggest. It hurts worst to pluck your eyebrows than use this!</li>
            <li> It really only trims the hair down to a certain point, and then I have to use a regular razor. Not exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Had to replace one that I paid over $100 for 5 yrs ago and am just as happy with this one for only $35.</li>
            <li> This trimmer isn&#x27;t the best, but it does the job. I like that it comes with a case, other attachments, and is waterproof. I just wish the power was a little stronger and the blades were a bit sharper. This doesn&#x27;t trim as close to the skin as I would like - I have to use a disposable razor after trimming to get the clear/smooth look I like. Overall, it&#x27;s pretty good; best for maintenance.</li>
            <li> Works great. But tweezers light worked for less than a week.</li>
            <li> I decided I wanted to start saving some extra dollars so I chose to start with doing away with my beloved visits to The Wax Center and threading salons.  I read the good and the bad reviews and figured for the price (which is one visit to the wax salon) I would try it.&lt;br /&gt;Pro: I absolutly love the eybrow and depilatory attachments.  They both provide close hair removal and pretty much flawlesss ability to screw up my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:  I loved my bikini waxes because I only needed to have it done every 4-5 weeks,  The bikini attachments are basically for trimming not total hair removal.  Especially on coarse hair. So I used I am adjusting to the trimmed instead of bare.  The BF isn&#x27;t complaining so all is good.</li>
            <li> Philips HP6378 Bikini Perfect Deluxe Trimmer is much cheaper than SEPHORA and it&#x27;s the same product they sell in the stores</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, because of the functional design and the promising features, but in the end it&#x27;s just an okay product. The foils on the shaver head broke within the first few weeks, the cap for the trimmer is essentially useless (pops straight off unless you&#x27;re actively holding it in place), and -- worst of all -- the epilator left me with painful broken hairs (please note that I am experienced with epilating and I&#x27;m pretty certain that the epilator on this one will leave you with more damage than not). Furthermore, the grooves on the heads and handle are difficult to clean, and the the bits of the body that need be regularly lubricated get pretty gross fairly frequently, and subsequently require even more additional cleaning. If you can afford to, you should probably look around a little more for something better.</li>
            <li> this kit is very good, it has everything you need, the battery goes very good I dont have to charge it vey often. Even my husband uses it sometimes.</li>
            <li> Really like this one so far!</li>
            <li> This is a must have personal groomer for every woman. I&#x27;m not sure how trimmers are since this is my first one so I can&#x27;t compare it to any other. This works so easily, without leavong a rash and trimming the hair pretty precisely, making the area look neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally wax or epilate, which obviously are time consuming (mainly because of the pain because I pause and take deep breaths A LOT between each pull). My hair grows up pretty fast and they are thick so that waxing or epilating delayed the hair regrowth the most. However, thinking about doing it everytime would make me frustrated. Especially this semester with an internship, work and 15 college credit hours, I had NO TIME for waxing or epilating. That&#x27;s why I decide to buy a trimmer and this product have met my expectations to the fullest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a lot of different additions. I didn&#x27;t get the exfoliating gloves as it claimed on the box but that&#x27;s okay because I have used their similar kind before and didn&#x27;t like them. It has tweezers with light so that should be better! Plus,  for the price I think the package deal is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope the battery works longer and it doesn&#x27;t break or anything. By far I love it! Trimmer my hair short within 15 minutes which is perfect for my schedule. No pain or rash either! The epilator will probably work great too since its small so it wont be as painful as it pulls out less hair at a time. The design is beautiful, easy to hold. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quick grooming method. This is a good investment so far!</li>
            <li> I love it. it is the best.</li>
            <li> Great shaver, but doesnt last too long before it starts breaking down. The charger no longer works.</li>
            <li> Best epilator out there! This is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased. I purchased my first one about 8 or 9 years ago from Sephora, and it recently just isn&#x27;t holding a charge. I purchased an Epilady epilator and it didn&#x27;t hold a charge long enough to epilate a little armpit. I realized switching brands was a mistake and I needed to get another trusted Philips Bikini Perfect kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s funny how identical my old Bikini Perfect is to the new one - it hasn&#x27;t changed a bit. Why change the design if it works so well? I could use my old charger or my old head attachments because it&#x27;s all the same.  I think that really shows how great of a product this is that they haven&#x27;t had a need to change it in years - though I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ve probably tweaked some internal things, but it is simply an awesome product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember raving about this to my roommates in college when I first got it about how the epilator made it so I never had to shave my armpits.  I would recommend this product to any woman with hair anywhere that she doesn&#x27;t want.&lt;br /&gt;It even works on guys chest hair, back of the neck hair, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally only really use the epilator head on this, but I would have paid $100 just for a new bikini perfect if it only came with an epilator head, that&#x27;s how much I love this product and know how well it works and how long it will last me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds the charge super long.  It doesn&#x27;t just slow and get slower and slower when it&#x27;s dying; it works close to 100% even when it&#x27;s near dying. But you have to be doing (epilating) like a whole leg for over a half hour or more before it will die. If you&#x27;re using it for trimming or your bikini region, it should get it all done in one charge - EASILY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and it came with little tweezers with a light and mirror. As well as a carrying case and a glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;45 day money back guarantee &amp; 2 year warranty - It&#x27;s like one of those &amp;#34;You have nothing to lose!&amp;#34; ads - I just truly love this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;__________________&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 4 days after order datethis thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;__________________&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 4 days after order date</li>
            <li> I mainly bought this for the trimmer and epilator. It works great for those purposes but the close shaver didn&#x27;t work at all!  Overall I&#x27;m happy with the purchase. It is nice to have so many options and it&#x27;s small so I can travel with it.</li>
            <li> This is a little more expensive than the other comparable products but worth it. I really appreciate all of the attachments that came with it especially the eyebrow trimmer. Works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer. I bought it for the epilator. The epilator hurts like hell so I stopped using it. The trimmer didn&#x27;t get hair short enough for me so I gave it to my husband because his trimmer was broken. He loves it! Overall a great product just not for me.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace a similar model I&#x27;ve had for years that finally gave out.  I think I like this model even better.  It comes with a bunch of attachments, most of which I haven&#x27;t used yet.  And it holds a charge for a long time.  I&#x27;m not thrilled about the power button being on the front, but I&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
            <li> This product gives a close nice shave. My husband has used it on his face for years and since I have a side shave I&#x27;ve even used it on my head. Will have to be replaced ever few years if you use it regularly as the motor will eventually become less efficient.</li>
            <li> I love this little machine. It is small, quiet and effective. It travels well and is pretty sturdy. Everything fits nicely in the bag supplied. It is easy to hold and easy to clean. The epilator attachment puts it miles ahead of similar shavers, so it is worth the money. Tip: use the epilator on your knees - it is way better than shaving or waxing! My only tiny wish would be for a matching set of scissors, but I can supply my own.</li>
            <li> This works great on delicate and sensitive areas. It gives a close shave without irritating skin. The small design makes it easy to maneuver, and allows you to see what you are doing.</li>
            <li> The long hair trimmer sucks. Hardly trims the hair at all; you have to make several passes over the same area.  Works ok if you are going to trim a small area like your chin, but I don&#x27;t even like it for the underarms. Lesson learned, I guess.  I&#x27;m really disappointed because the reviews I&#x27;d read seemed to be pretty good, but I had a Remington before this that I think worked a heck of a lot better.  I might keep this one to trim the bikini area. The guard over the end is better than the Remington, but I don&#x27;t like anything else about this shaver.  Going to try a Wahl next time.  Their reviews were good, but the price was a little higher than I liked so I thought I&#x27;d try this one first.  Guess you get what you pay for.  Although the Remington was only $20 and I think it&#x27;s a better product.  Biggest reason I decided to try something different was because hair jammed up my Remington, no matter how often I rinsed it. Guess the search is still on.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is awesome! Many different attachments. I have been waxed for over 10 years and hate the part when the hair just begins to pop through the surface. This has a short  enough attachment that allows for a very short  trim with no stubble. It comes with a great carrying  case. The battery life is great and easy to clean. Great gadget for the price!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is not particularly high quality—there&#x27;s better stuff out on the market. I just bought an electric razor and while it&#x27;s a bit larger, it gets the job done a lot more cleanly, plus I can us it for other parts of my body. I had mainly bought this for the epilator attachment, but I just want to warn buyers that epilators REALLY hurt &amp;#34;down there,&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it; epilating gave me a lot of ingrown hairs and it takes way too long to be worth the pain. I would suggest waxing or trying a laser instead if that is what you&#x27;re going for.</li>
            <li> If I could give -5 stars, I would have. 0 stars isn&#x27;t even an option. I might has well have tried to shave with a cotton ball. Pointless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 stars to Amazon for taking back this useless product for full refund.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this much better than her old one.</li>
            <li> Not the best razor. Leaves area choppy and uneven. I thought it was good enough to travel with but I just can&#x27;t get it to cut anything. Including eyebrows and lip hair.</li>
            <li> The clipper doesn&#x27;t shave very close. Always leaves stubble. Also, the blade is very hard on your skin. Hard to explain, but it doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth as others that I have used. I wouldn&#x27;t put &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; in the name and I don&#x27;t see anything that makes this &amp;#34;deluxe&amp;#34; either.</li>
            <li> Women have hair pretty much everywhere, though we don&#x27;t like to admit it.  Many of us wax, trim, shave, depilatate, electro-zap, and laser so that nobody knows how furry we really can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe comes with many attachments so it can be used on pretty much any fuzz the female body can grow.  After trying a few attachments, I was impressed by the versatility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to arthritis, I take prednisone.  Prednisone has turned me from a lovely thing who has always appeared fairly light and smooth in the fur coat department to wondering how much more medication it will take until I&#x27;m dealing with a five o&#x27;clock shadow (on my face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, this is a small price to pay for less pain and more mobility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have to trim, or I start looking like an old guy with hairs curling out of nostrils, errant brow \\&quot;feeler\\&quot; hairs...  The Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe smoothly handles the facial hair, shaping my brows, and even offers an attachment to put the eyebrow antennae in their place.  The body of the trimmer is the perfect size and shape- it&#x27;s fairly ergonomic and I can shape my brows with ease and without my hands going into full on crampy arthritic claws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the other attachments, the epilator was the one I was most curious about as the last time I was faced with an epilator was way back in the 80&#x27;s when the first epilady came out and I tried it on my downy soft, pre-teen leg fuzz (it was blond so not too Sasquatch-y for the 7th grade)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am kind of impressed with myself for being brave enough to try the one that attaches to this trimmer.  The head of it is rather small.  I am assuming that this is to make navigating various areas and crevices easier and allow for more hair removal control than an epilator the size of a zamboni would allow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel great, and it isn&#x27;t painless.  It is quick and really effective to the point that it was almost fun and I had to stop myself before I got rid of all body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge on this thing seems like it lasts forever.  With our other trimmer (my husband&#x27;s though I have borrowed it on occasion) I&#x27;m always nervous that if I start a hair removal job then there is a good chance that the battery will run out before I have time to really even things out or even just make things look not-lopsided.  I have not been faced with a power outage with the Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep wanting to remove more hair and detail more spots from head to toe just because I can... I&#x27;m kind of amazed at how much of a workhorse this little gadget it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only time will tell how this trimmer performs over time.  I will update my review if anything out of the ordinary happens with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now though, I&#x27;m happy as a clam.rge on this thing seems like it lasts forever.

            <li> Tried it but the razor doesn&#x27;t catch a single hair the first 3 times you go over. Talk about time consuming to get a tiny area done! The attachment heights are all too long to get a close trim. They work if what u want is 0.5cm long! I did have a few snags though. Not worth it at all. I use a men&#x27;s gillette proglide styler instead. At the end of the day, I need comfortable clean results much more than I need to have my trimmer look ladylike. It&#x27;s a shame that men&#x27;s trimming products are so much better designed and engineered and deliver great results without the huge price tag while women have to suffer with crap like this Philips bikini perfect.</li>
            <li> Works. Who has time for waxing with 3 kids? Get this instead.</li>
            <li> Works well for bikini trimming short but not down to the skin which is what I want. Charge lasts a while.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> This item was defective. I charged it for over 24 hours (the green light was on, indicating it was receiving power) and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I exchanged it for another one. This time, I charged it for 48 hours using two different outlets. The same thing happened. I don&#x27;t know why two of these in a row would be complete garbage, but they were. They should have been checked by the manufacturer before they left the factory.</li>
            <li> Initially loved it but something is wrong with the charger connection or battery and now it won&#x27;t charge. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It dose not work my wife didn&#x27;t like there are much better out there</li>
            <li> All-in-one!!! Perfect price, good for travel lovers.. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I use this more often than I use my full-sized epilator/shaver. I pretty much only use the trimmer for the bikini area, although I have used the epilator down there a few times. I use the epilator all the time on my armpits. It&#x27;s the perfect size for them, and it keeps me from having to shave my armpits all the time. The only negative, like others have said, is that the tiny shaver attachment doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> doesnt get a very close shave and gets hot in the shower</li>
            <li> Philips Hp6378/10 Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe, Opal / Aqua&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning up the bikini and eyebrow area has always been absolutely boring, un-imaginative and time consuming.  That is, until Now! :)  Let me introduce you to my new Best Friend:  Philips Hp6378/10 Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One may need to use a sturdy box knife to open the Philips Hp6378/10 Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe and retrieve the product, attachments and extra goodies out of the packaging.  After  one get&#x27;s past that, the Philips Hp6378/10 Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe will need a 10 hour charge, which will give plenty of time to read over the (easy to follow) detailed instructions, complete with how-to images.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with the Eye Brow Comb placed over the precision trimmer to trim my eye brows.  ...was a little surprised at the powerful hum and vibration of the Philips Hp6378/10 Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe&#x27;s motor, and holding a vibrating little gismo that close to my eye took a little getting used to.  Fast and easy, with 3 different trim length settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, on to Contouring the Eyebrows with the micro trimmer.  This takes a bit of concentration, and a pretty steady hand.  I found it works best if one shapes a teenie-weenie bit (of the brow) at a time -- because, as the instructions indicate, it does remove every hair it touches. :)  The trimmer is very precise and one does not a lot of pressure is needed.  In the box is an awesome illuminated brow  tweezer and mirror in a plastic case a little longer than a lipstick tube. Hollywood, Here I Come! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point I&#x27;m beginning to get familiar with the Philips Hp6378/10 Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe and it&#x27;s different attachments, and what they do.  On to the bikini area!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Placing the precision trimmer on the handle and then adding the precision comb with 3 length settings was a snap!  Easy to choose the desired length.  Comb glided through hair with no snags, rendering the desired outcome.  Okay, now is where one can get down and get creative, so-to-speak.  Just remove the precision comb and you now have a styling tool for creating fun bikini area things like hearts, diamonds or (just for fun) how about \\&quot;his\\&quot; favorite team logo. :) That would really set you apart from all the rest...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a final touch, I popped on the micro shaver attachment and went over the entire (newly) shaved and trimmed area, which left my bikini area baby-skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the brave, there is also an epilating attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean-up of the Philips Hp6378/10 Philips Bikini Perfect Deluxe&#x27; attachments was an absolute breeze!  just run attachments under warm water and put on paper towel to air dry. Highly Recommended!  ...oh, and I created a little arrow, pointing down. :)  --Katharena Eiermann, 2010he desired outcome.  Okay, now is where one can get down and get creative, so-to-speak.

            <li> The wife loves to &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; with this.  We both use it and it trims sensitive places efficiently.  It holds a charge well and it has a carrying case to keep everything together.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works exactly like I wanted. You can definitely get a pretty close trim with it too. I thought the light-up tweezers were hilarious until I stepped on a tiny piece of glass. Then they were actually handy. Who knew.</li>
            <li> It works really good.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to get one of these! I pretty much just use two of the attachments--the main shaver (for you-know-where) and the expilator (for my face). The charge lasts surprisingly long! Great for in the shower or on land.</li>
            <li> Quality product, works as advertised</li>
            <li> Purchased this product as a gift.  This product will not take a charge!  Was never able to be used and no return since I purchased it in advance of the gifing date!  Save your money, buy a razor!</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a similar device that had apparently died of old age, so I knew what I was getting, and am once again very pleased with it.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other brands which would typically stop working after awhile because they&#x27;d get all clogged up with hair and wouldn&#x27;t easily clean. This one didn&#x27;t do that. I&#x27;ve had it for well over a year, and its going strong. Love that its wet/dry so I can take it in the shower with me.</li>
            <li> Did not like this much. It actually cut me a couple of times. I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Works great. Interchangeable heads are convenient. Make sure you allow the charge to completely die before recharging or you will wreck the battery (that&#x27;s wheat happened to my last one.</li>
            <li> Does everything it says it will--and does it perfectly. I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled. It was absolutely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> So far I like this razor. I did not use the different opitions yet, when I do I will let everyone know what I think.</li>
            <li> Works really well and is very quick.</li>
            <li> I received very fast and I am very happy with my purchase. 5 stars for the provider and product :)</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this product. The attachments offer a nice variety. The battery charges quickly and keeps the charge for a good while. I was, however, disappointed with the micro shaver. It just didn&#x27;t seem to remove much at all. I&#x27;ve kind of given up on this attachment and use mainly the precision comb and epilator. I&#x27;ve read other reviews about being afraid of the epilator, but really, a paper cut is more uncomfortable. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very hard to change attachments, I basically use the trimmer most which works well, it&#x27;s just so hard to change them, I feel like they&#x27;re going to break.</li>
            <li> I am very unimpressed with this razor.  If you are hoping for the same results as a regular trimmer... You will be in pain and very disappointed.  I do however, enjoy the small razor attachment for the face and fingers.</li>
            <li> No more painful razor burn trying to maintain my bikini area.  Which is nice because it&#x27;s already a chore all of us women detest!  Great product!</li>
            <li> It trims. And that&#x27;s it. No bells or whistles. You&#x27;re not going to get a close shave, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what&#x27;s advertised, and for the people that are complaining about that. They should probably learn how to read.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing I like it a lot, I have used other products similar to this one but none are even compared to its quality.</li>
            <li> I HAVE TO BE REALLY CAREFUL BECAUSE I HAVE A GENETIC AUTO IMMUNE BLEEDING ISSUE CALLED APS THAT I HAVE TO TAKE BLOOD THINNERS FOR, I CANT USE REGULAR RAZORS, ETC DUE TO THE DAMAGE/DEATH FACTOR INVOLVED IN ME CUTTING OR BLEEDING....SO I BUY ALL SORTS OF SHAVING TRIMMERS, ETC LIKE THIS ONE...THE ONLY THING I WASNT THRILLED ABOUT WITH THIS ONE ITEM IS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE VERY VERY VERY CAREFULL OR IT WILL CATCH YOUR SKIN AND MAKE YOU BLEED AND CAN RAZOR BURN YOU JUST AS A RAZOR MIGHT, PLUS IT CAN ALSO LEAVE YOUR BODY WITH STUBBLE AND SORE PLACES...BUT IF USED CAREFULLY ITS NOT A BAD ITEM, ESPECIALLY FOR THE COST!! THANKS AMAZON FOR YOUR VARIETY!</li>
            <li> It takes too long to use it as the area it covers at a time is pretty small. Not exactly what I was expecting but I think I can live with it</li>
            <li> Works good but if not real careful it can and will cut you. Nice to be able to recharge without having to buy batteries.</li>
            <li> I bought mine elsewhere.. and loved it.  So I got this as a gift for someone and she loves it too.  This is a great woman&#x27;s gadget and it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend especially for women that aren&#x27;t too high maintenance, because it really helps.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife as she wanted a new razor.  This comes with numerous attachments, which are easily switched out and store in a decent pouch.  The downside is all the attachments do not cut close to the skin and the cause numerous skin irritations.  I would not recommend this piece of equipment due to the fact that the blades in each attachment are not sharp and cause too much irritation (no matter how it is utilized).  Purchase something that is specific to shaving or plucking...not a one fits all idea that is sold behind this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Its a bit under powered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this set for almost a year now, and I must say... I usually wax myself and when I started not having enough time to wax my bikini area, I started looking for an electric shaver (ideally), wishing women had one like the ones men use on their face - giving them that smooth, satin feel. But to all of our dismay, we do not have one! :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is a TRIMMER - not a shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the precision trimmer and comb A LOT! The best desciption for its result is that it gives a soft stubly feel after use instead of having a bushy area. It makes it easier, too, prior to shaving!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The epilator I use regularly on my axillaries instead of shaving. It pulls out all of the hair except for the really fine ones. I&#x27;ve used it on my legs, and it does hurt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyebrow comb... I think it would be good for people with thick eyebrows. Becareful not to trim your eyebrows into one lengthed shape, though, or it will look weird! Can be used for guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The precision trimmer... I&#x27;ve only used about 3 times to trim stray eyebrows when I&#x27;m in a rush. It&#x27;s very tiny, so becareful with this one, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gloves I have not used. The illuminating tweezer was a major disapointment!! Worked only once right when I received the package, and never again. So, that was useless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love the fact that this trimmer can be recharged and is cordless for use. I charge mine once every 1-2 months, and the batteries last a long time. You can use it wet/dry, but I&#x27;ve stuck to using it dry and only once in the shower (in avoidance and fear of it rusting out on me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the white bag that it comes with is very very flimsy. I use that to place my plastic heads in, but have opted in using a cushioned makeup bag instead for storage of the entire set for more protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every girl should have a bikini trimmer set. If you don&#x27;t have one yet, then you&#x27;re missing out! Get your bikini area in check, ladies!!!</li>
            <li> This razor does everything you need it to.  It is very easy to change out all the different heads. It holds a charge for a long time. And for me, the epilator is pretty awesome.  I&#x27;m not sure if I would do my whole leg with it, but for those problematic areas with random hair (for me, my inner thighs, and I&#x27;ve also used it on my bikini line and upper lip) it is so much less messy and time consuming than the waxing I was doing before!! Does it hurt you ask?  Well, yes, but if you are used to plucking or waxing it is no different than that. It also will make your skin red for a while afterwards, so I would not recommend doing it right before you are going out in public!  Other than that, it replaced and works better than the shaver I had before it.</li>
            <li> If they&#x27;re going to offer the razor itself with all these worthless attachments, at least they could let us know where to get a replacement charger. Mine has disappeared, but there is no replacement charger like the sites on Google claim. You click on them and all you get is the same old thing: the whole package or nothing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like it and it works, fine. But if you ever need a replacement charger, you&#x27;re SOL. I had to toss mine in the garbage. It&#x27;s worthless at this point</li>
            <li> This shaver was worth every cent! So many different attachments that can be used in multiple areas. I recommend getting Bliss Ingrown Eliminating Pads Hair Removal if you are planning to trim bikini lines.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor with high hopes despite the many reviews that told me not to.  Needless to say, the reviewers of this product that said not to buy it were totally right!  I don&#x27;t think I have seen such a worthless piece of equipment.  It does not shave anywhere near close enough, the trimmer is not that precise and sometimes grabs the hair rather than cutting it.  Even the eyebrow shaper is a joke.  I am not sure why Philips would sell such a lousy product.  I will be bagging up this razor and getting rid of it.  I am going back to using my old razor which does a much better job of shaving.  Seriously, don&#x27;t waste you money on this.  It really is not worth it. (BTW, I only gave the razor a star because I had to.  It is not worth any stars.)</li>
            <li> Love it! A little noisy..</li>
            <li> love it..best razor ever..much better than batteries</li>
            <li> I got these and for me they a bit difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I just got it and used it. Bad. I had to go back the same place over and over again.  But hair is still there. I read reviews before i bought it. Someone said she bought it anyway even though many people left bad reviews. She said she likes it. I wish I have not seen her review.  While I use it, the head part came out three times. Can I return it? Again, it just doesn&#x27;t work.... Sigh...</li>
            <li> Disappointed that the description did not make it clear that this only runs on 110V. Totally unsuitable for international customers. A  potential fire hazard should anyone attempt to use it at a higher voltage.</li>
            <li> Got it for my girlfriend and she loves it already.</li>
            <li> Nice little compact gentle and effective unit..does the job quickly and neatly down there... And is very gentle .all the attachments are great and useful. It holds the charge for a very long time. Love it</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to spend more than twenty bucks on a bikini trimmer, but I am so glad I did. I&#x27;ve gone through a couple of cheap ones, and this is by far the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. I have been using it for about 6 months now. It&#x27;s cordless, but is rechargeable so money isn&#x27;t wasted on batteries...and you don&#x27;t have to stop mid-shave to change out the batteries. It&#x27;s durable, waterproof, and truly well made. Most importantly, it works! Without going into too much uncomfortable detail, it&#x27;s easy to handle, intuitively designed, cuts very well without pulling, and has different length settings. In short, it&#x27;s the perfect trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3/2012: The charge doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long, but as long as I charge the trimmer before or after every use I don&#x27;t have an issue with it. I wouldn&#x27;t deduct a star, but it&#x27;s something to take note of.</li>
            <li> This product is of fair quality. I haven&#x27;t yet found another that would be better as far as usability and features, though I think this one could be of better quality. I had one before for about 5 years and it died, which I thought a trimmer like this would last longer. The packaging is a nightmare and and you need an atomic bomb to open it.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is not very good for a smooth finish. It has the advantage of being waterproof and rechargeable with interchangeable heads.</li>
            <li> Really nice. The various options really work.</li>
            <li> I would give this 3.5 stars but since i couldn&#x27;t i rounded up. I wish the shaver was able to trim my pubic hairs lower. But it cant .I dont really see much of a difference in the extensions that it comes with. It did help me out in eliminating razor Bumps but i still use a razor i Trim it down first then I use the razor to clean up. I guess because the razor has less work to do i lessen my chances of getting razor burn. Its a cute kit though. comes with many Many parts. Easy to clean .. You can use it in the bathroom which is good. My roommates probably think im doing something different in the bathroom when they hear the motor running. hahaha</li>
            <li> I bought this last year.  Used infrequently.  I&#x27;ve used an epliator on my legs for years and thought I&#x27;d try one for my bikini line.  The trimmer, etc were just extras for me.  The epilator was fine.  I used the eyebrow trimmer on occasion.  So, now it&#x27;s bathing suit season again and oh, the unit doesn&#x27;t work anymore.  It won&#x27;t hold a charge.  This isn&#x27;t an incredibly expensive piece but gosh, I haven&#x27;t owned it a year and it&#x27;s done.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the first \\&quot;bikini trimmer\\&quot; that I&#x27;ve bought, and I&#x27;m really happy with the initial results from this one. I like the multifunction aspect of this particular one (the various attachments), the fact that it can be used wet or dry, can be cleaned very well, is rechargeable, and the price is right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used the trimmer that was on it when I opened the package, but that has worked well without any pain, bumps, etc. I wear bathing suits with a fairly modest cut at the leg opening, so someone wearing a suit with a more revealing (high cut) leg opening may need a combination of waxing (or, my recommendation, electrolysis) with this trimmer to get the desired results, but, for me, the trim function was absolutely sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written by \\&quot;Mrs. Neighbor John\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It is small and very compact... it make my businesses easier and fast.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend to everyone to this product.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer for intimate place for women. My wife had a similar model from Philips, and for years she used. She was very satisfied, but the battery has lost capacity. This product has a longer operating time and better equipment.</li>
            <li> Although this product is covered by a two year warranty, and four years on the cutter, the warranty is useless. The product is discontinued and no parts are available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foil cutter head, which is used for general trimming developed holes and thus cannot be used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Philips through their website and the product is no longer listed. I then engaged customer service through their chat session and connected to a rep named Grace. I was told the part in question (part E) the cutter head is not covered because it is an \\&quot;accessory\\&quot; and is not available anyway. This is in direct contradiction to the written warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit failed after less than 11 months of infrequent use and the company will not stand behind it</li>
            <li> include everything you need</li>
            <li> Love this device. Attachments are versatile. Enjoying the purchase.</li>
            <li> It never worked. Was so cheap that i didn&#x27;t want to waste time sending it back so i just do not use it. Besides it makes a huge noise.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Do not hesitate to buy. I love the epilator attachment. It has a very long battery life. It&#x27;s powerful but not super noisy. I love all the attachments, the case and the little brush to clean. I use this mostly for underarms and bikini. If you want to use the epilator on larger areas like the legs, you can, but I would recommend getting a big epilator because it will take you forever. The personal groomers I&#x27;ve had in the past were battery operated and we&#x27;re just not as powerful and did not have all these attachment.</li>
            <li> I really like this bikini trimmer. It met my expectations. I am very glad that I purchased this item.It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> As many reviewers have said - this does not hold a charge.  I charge it up for several hours and get maybe 2 minutes of shaving.  And none of the attachments get a close shave - completely worthless for legs or underarms.  Only slightly better for bikini area.</li>
            <li> this is the second time I&#x27;m purchasing this same product.  Got it as a gift years ago and it recently broke, but I&#x27;m so happy with it I had to buy another one.</li>
            <li> Works good and just what I expected!</li>
            <li> The good - The head is detachable and all of it is water proof so it&#x27;s easy to clean + hygienic. I love that this comes with an epilator. The not so good - when using the covers on these, it only cuts very long hair. I get a nick every time I use this thing - not terrible but annoying. I&#x27;ve never had an electric shaver before and feel this one is on the high-end quality wise so I&#x27;m not hopeful there&#x27;s better out there. I would recommend this to a friend but with the caveat just given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hint: shave until 1/4 to 1/3 in hair remains, then epilate. You&#x27;ll have better results and less pain.</li>
            <li> While this product may be a little expensive, it works as a bikini trimmer and I have no complaints. I don&#x27;t use any of the accessories/attachments so I probably would have just bought the razor without the extras. It&#x27;s waterproof so you can use it in the shower and rechargeable so no running out of batteries.</li>
            <li> I have never owned one before so I wasnt sure what I was getting into when I purchased this. I could never go back!</li>
            <li> For some reasons it did not work for me, a friend mine have and she is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older version of the same brand. My old trimmer had an issue where hair would get trapped inside the head of the trimmer and was all but impossible to get out. It would get gunked up and eventually the blades had trouble moving because of it. This version has a smaller head that seems to be designed to avoid that from happening. As for all the gadgets that come with they sure are all fun to try. The only ones I use on a regular basis though are the regular trimmer head, and the epilator has been great for all the random hairs that popped up due to pregnancy hormones. On occasion I&#x27;ll use the eyebrow trimmer. I don&#x27;t really understand the need for the LED tweezers unless I ever needed to tweeze in the dark I suppose. I prefer my trusty tweezerman tweezers though. Overall I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Does the job I was looking for.  Works in the shower. Seems great! No problems thus far. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I had a Remington cheap trimmer for about 7years until the charger quit connecting enough to charge the battery so I bought this.  I love it.  The epilator hear even made me go but a larget epilator for my legs.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the trimmer head clip.  It traps hair in it because it is so large and hollow, so I end up having to take it off a few times to rinse it out while I am using it.  I guess my smaller, tighter head on the old Remington trimmer spoiled me a little.  I like the power it has and its great to use both wet and dry.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those hard to reach areas and it is a great price and overall great product. No issues and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> This is the third product I&#x27;ve tried by this company and none of them have worked.  When I plug them in to charge them initially, the light comes on to signify it is charging but the product never actually starts working.  Complete waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I purchased one several years ago and it lasted really well.  I dropped it quite hard this time and it broke.  I liked it so much the first time that I bought another one.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of different brands and styles. It&#x27;s beginning to seem like they are all incredibly poor quality! Rechargeable batteries give out after 3-4 charges, plastic breaks, and only with normal use. I did some more research and decided to spring for the extra money to get this unit which seemed like higher quality. Higher quality should &#x3D; last longer, etc. Well, out of the box it didn&#x27;t even work. The power cord will not plug into the base of the trimmer. It just sort of hangs there loosely so the only way to supply power is to stand there and actually hold the cord into the unit. Obviously there is no way to charge it. It&#x27;s just so odd that a unit this expensive would have such a design flaw. There is no click or usual snugness or anything for the power cord to go into place. It kind of loosely hangs there like a ten cent item. Bummer because I thought the attachments looked cool.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, great customer service....what more could you want.</li>
            <li> It works well but it takes way too many strokes with the trimmer accessories. It cuts fine without the trimmers on but if you&#x27;re going for a certain length then it takes 3 times as long to even out your bikini area. It&#x27;s tedious. They just don&#x27;t make perfect bikini trimmers anymore.</li>
            <li> I tired the many different heads and product performs poorly. The trimming head with adjustable comb takes multiple swipes over the same area just to trim the hair. Even after multiple times going over the same area in different directions not all the hair was trimmed. I even cut myself while using the trimmer with adjustable comb. I tried using micro shaver on my leg to see how it worked and it did not cut any hair at all. I am returning the product.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  Does not shave as I anticipated.  Would not purchase</li>
            <li> I feel like the people who are giving this negative reviews are looking for a shaver and not a trimmer. That being said, this is the best trimmer i have ever bought. It does not pull or irritate at all. I have had this for two years now, and it worked amazingly until my husband broke it. I am going to buy it again because it is a grooming essential for me!</li>
            <li> First one worked good for about a month and then would not take a charge. Bought another one and right from the package would not take a charge. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Once you learn how to use this tool, it&#x27;s great! I have very sensitive skin but using this properly, I didn&#x27;t have any irritation at all.</li>
            <li> Efficient, quiet, long lasting battery.  Best of its type.</li>
            <li> The exactly product I was looking for. I love it! No problems with shipping, too.</li>
            <li> How did I ever live without this bikini trimmer!?!! It is perfect and it does the job much easier than any other method I have tried.</li>
            <li> My wife has been very happy with it.  Charge lasts forever.  Does a great job (no pulling, etc.) of keeping the hedges trimmed.</li>
            <li> Twizer light does not work. There are two tiny batteries inside that must not be in good working condition. If you are attracted to this product because of this neat twizer as an extra, I just want to caution you that you might be disappointed. I won&#x27;t send the product back because it is not worth the effort. But &amp;#34;bad out of the box&amp;#34; is the worst disappointment for any product.</li>
            <li> Note: it&#x27;s a trimmer, not a hair remover!! It trims your hair to a shorter length. I use it alongside a razor to get a perfect bikini zone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine for two years and it&#x27;s amazing! I just got out of the shower today and used it. While trimming, I realized I&#x27;d had it a really long time now, and decided to make a review. It can give you a close trim, but it won&#x27;t be as smooth as a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re like me and you keep some hair down there but you want it to be shorter and less bushy, then get this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say the only downside is that there&#x27;s not much warning when it&#x27;s dying. So sometimes I have to put trimming off if I planned on doing it but the battery is dead.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just haven&#x27;t explored how to use this product enough, but I have barely used it at all.  I find I would much rather just go get a wax, than waste my time using this thing.</li>
            <li> I always was nervous shaving down there. But this is perfect. No nicks, cuts. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Easy to use - easy to clean. I like that you can use it in the shower. I don&#x27;t like that the guard is flimsy - makes me a little nervous around the lady parts.&lt;br /&gt;And whatever you do - do NOT use it without the guard, against any sensitive area... you will get cut.</li>
            <li> I like it does the job but not too wide and takes more time for my legs than usual.</li>
            <li> Awesome electric shaver. Every girl needs this in their bathroom. Comes with everything you need to trim that difficult area. Plus mine came with a case, lighted eyebrow tweezers, and a exfoliating glove.</li>
            <li> I received mine and I am a little concerned that while inspecting this &amp;#34;brand new&amp;#34; product, I found short pieces of hair in the attached piece! I took everything apart and washed all of the components, but I am not sure they are sanitized and I am weary of using this product.  I came back to amazon and cannot find any evidence that it is used or refurbished - and the packaging was completely new - giant plastic sealed in... I am not sure I want a used bikini shaver....</li>
            <li> It was so disgusting when I want to use it and found there was body hair in the product. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works but I feel like when the trimmer has the guard on it doesn&#x27;t do much trimming. Also if it doesn&#x27;t have the guard It&#x27;s easy to cut myself. The micro shaver does not shave but I like it better than the trimmer because it can&#x27;t cut you and it trims shorter. Not the best product in the world but it works</li>
            <li> I choose it for price and other reviews.  Purchased for myself.  I should not have anymore ingrown hairs.  I am pleased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my needs. Trims very close or use the plastic guard for a longer length.</li>
            <li> I wanted to replace an old Remington 5-in-1 personal grooming kit when it started to die. I fell for the good reviews and spent a lot of money for the Philips kit. It is awful. It hurts and irritates the skin while leaving the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did!</li>
            <li> It fulfilled and exceeded my expectations. I definetely recommended it. Easy to use. It runs for a long time. it  is cordless</li>
    </ol>
