            <li>excellent product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The seller was good and excellent, however I was expecting a different smell on this</li>
            <li>Best part is I&#x27;ve never found anyone else who wears it either, so you will smell distinct and unique, one of the advantages of wearing a perfume that was released years ago.</li>
            <li>Knowing that it smells good ahead of time, I wasn&#x27;t worried this was a cheap cologne even though it is inexpensive.</li>

            <li>Good price and real product!</li>
            <li>, rather it&#x27;s more of a bright, fruit scent, but STILL MASCULINE.</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING NICE PRODUCT</li>
            <li>but here of course it&#x27;s available ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li>Very fresh and cool spice scent.</li>
            <li>Refreshing scent that lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li>this smells different but in a good way.</li>
            <li>It dissipates or evaporates too quickly.</li>
            <li>The scent runs out quick</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the same amazing smell</li>
            <li>You could call this a fresh scent of a different kind, don&#x27;t think lemon/lime kinds.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s self is a soft mist and applies appropriate amount of the product per press.  </li>
            <li>but Im not crazy about it.</li>
            <li>Great scent by a great brand that&#x27;s still a little secret, and cheap.</li>
            <li>Although they say that lighter scents are for summer/day time, heavier woodsy scents better for winter/nighttime, I wear this year round, day or night, and gotten many compliments.</li>
            <li>The fragrance smells great, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Used to wear this cologne several years ago, glad I found it again.</li>
            <li>Came on time and was exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fresh, crisp almost sweet but masculine scent.</li>
            <li>Not sweet and not annoying, really cool!</li>
            <li>item as described, fast shipping, thanks.</li>
            <li>Wares off fast</li>
            <li>but it definitely wears off pretty quick.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t expect it to last the entire day for $13.99, but at least give me 5 hours before I have to reapply the fragrance.</li>
            <li> the bottle was empty!</li>
            <li> I like the smaller size too, makes it compact and can be carried around if you are traveling (not sure if carry on though!).</li>
            <li> it was hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> Hello, this is the worst purchase I made, not recommended at all, I tube this perfume before and this buy anything to do its frangancia, this parese that is not authentic but that been filled till your box came badly stuck.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a casual Scent.</li>
            <li> Despite some bad reviews on here, my man had this on when I met him</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed.</li>

            <li> The fragrance smells great, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last long. It dissipates or evaporates too quickly. I don&#x27;t expect it to last the entire day for $13.99, but at least give me 5 hours before I have to reapply the fragrance. And if this is fragrance is similar to One Million, I would prefer to spend the money to have One Million instead.</li>
            <li> Wasnt the same scent as the original. Kinda disappointed.</li>
            <li> timely delivery, very satisfied</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, although the scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all</li>

            <li> Hello, this is the worst purchase I made, not recommended at all, I tube this perfume before and this buy anything to do its frangancia, this parese that is not authentic but that been filled till your box came badly stuck.</li>
            <li> I love this smell this was my perfume back in middle school i had forgotten about it until i smelled it while looking through some old stuff i had in storage so i just bought it again and it&#x27;s the same amazing smell</li>

            <li> Wonderful experience:)</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne ever !</li>
            <li> A very soft and fruity smell yet at the same time not overly done.  It is a change from the army of wood/citrus based scents that are on the market.  You could call this a fresh scent of a different kind, don&#x27;t think lemon/lime kinds.  The sprayer it&#x27;s self is a soft mist and applies appropriate amount of the product per press.  I like the smaller size too, makes it compact and can be carried around if you are traveling (not sure if carry on though!).</li>
            <li> conforme con el producto ,en perfecto estado , los recomiendo</li>
            <li> I love that!!! Great seller!</li>
            <li> No smell the same,there are no make in germani</li>
            <li> This has been my signature fragrance for over 13 years... I haven&#x27;t found anything better anywhere!</li>
            <li> I order this item for valentines day and my husband love it it arrived fast and stay on for long time</li>
            <li> The Scent is Amazing! If You&#x27;ve never tried it before, go ahead and try it. It&#x27;s a casual Scent.</li>
            <li> i order it for my husband birthday and surprise .... the bottle was empty! and my mistake I put the box in the garbage!!!!!! I cannot return it anymore!</li>
            <li> Despite some bad reviews on here, my man had this on when I met him and I thought WOW this smells different but in a good way. Knowing that it smells good ahead of time, I wasn&#x27;t worried this was a cheap cologne even though it is inexpensive. It&#x27;s a fresh, crisp almost sweet but masculine scent. It&#x27;s sexy and not boyish. I&#x27;m very glad I found it on Amazon for a great price cuz most delicious colognes are pricey.</li>
            <li> Excellent choice for a gift, great Ã­tem for a gift</li>
            <li> this is my 4th bottle...whish they never discontinue this product</li>
            <li> Very reasonable and good fragrance. I like it.</li>
            <li> LADIES LUV THAT DIESEL..........</li>
            <li> I think with this purchase, solving the mysteries of the universe is well within range!</li>
            <li> I love this one a lot</li>
            <li> My brother in,aw bought this and he loves it, but Im not crazy about it.</li>
            <li> Mmmmmmmm! This smells so sexy! I am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Great smelling and sporty scent. Very fresh and cool spice scent.</li>
            <li> The seller was good and excellent, however I was expecting a different smell on this</li>
            <li> excellent product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Good cologne but it definitely wears off pretty quick.</li>
            <li> Not like the I used to it. ...</li>
            <li> Best cologne I&#x27;ve ever found, only cologne I&#x27;ve worn for four years. I like it because it&#x27;s not a musky, woodsy scent, rather it&#x27;s more of a bright, fruit scent, but STILL MASCULINE. That&#x27;s the perfect cologne in my opinion. Although they say that lighter scents are for summer/day time, heavier woodsy scents better for winter/nighttime, I wear this year round, day or night, and gotten many compliments. More compliments than any other. Best part is I&#x27;ve never found anyone else who wears it either, so you will smell distinct and unique, one of the advantages of wearing a perfume that was released years ago. Don&#x27;t go with the popular colognes or the new ones, that&#x27;s lame. Great scent by a great brand that&#x27;s still a little secret, and cheap. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> It is an amazing fragrance</li>
    </ol>
