            <li>I&#x27;m happy for that.</li>
            <li>I ordered this after reading a lot of great reviews on this product.</li>
            <li>then i tried get the babyliss one, and thought it was great, but it was  not prime eligible.  </li>
            <li>This is a great straightener.  </li>
            <li>I am happy that I did.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see what all the great reviews are about.  </li>
            <li>The wider surface is really great.</li>
            <li>Moreover, the price was great.</li>
            <li>Leaves me hair feeling and looking great.</li>
            <li>I bought the Remington based on all the great reviews and the price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with straightener.</li>

            <li>I got this for my sister and worked great</li>
            <li>Good price, good product!</li>
            <li>I love this straightener!!</li>
            <li>It does NOT get ANY better than this one!!</li>
            <li>awesome straightener, works great, love it.  </li>
            <li>This straightener is amazing!  </li>
            <li>This product is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>They both said it is working amazing and had ZERO complaints about it!</li>
            <li>Amazing hair straightener!  </li>
            <li>It works really nice!</li>
            <li>Nice machine!</li>
            <li>I love it and believe the reviews, it&#x27;s that good!!</li>
            <li>I was impressed this morning at how easily this iron glides through my hair.</li>
            <li>Plus it has a swivel cord that is always good.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull or snag my hair, and leaves it perfectly silky, shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Then I saw this one on here, and with mostly good reviews.</li>
            <li>This brand alone is definitely good</li>
            <li>I got this straightener because I read reviews and compared it to the chi, and trust me you don&#x27;t need to spend 100 dollars for a good straightener.</li>
            <li>I was in need of a good hair straightener</li>
            <li>I searched and searched before I found this one that had really good reviews</li>
            <li>Her hair looks really good after she uses it</li>
            <li>saving myself about 50 bucks and burning my fingers and scalp every time i try to straighten my hair didn&#x27;t seem like a really good deal to me.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good iron, has substantial weight, and does a good job.  </li>
            <li>and it does a good job.</li>
            <li>MADE A GOOD BUY AND RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d heard good things about ceramic and tourmaline</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>very easy to use and its great for the price ...</li>
            <li>I would have gladly paid more for this straightener seeing how wonderfully this works although I loved the price.</li>
            <li>Worthy of money and excellent product.</li>
            <li>This one is just wonderful and does such a great job!</li>
            <li>I love love love it!!!</li>
            <li>This baby works awesome and fast!!  </li>
            <li>better yet, price or not, it works great.</li>
            <li>Since this review, I have used the item at length and am very satisfied:    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments about how great my hair looks.</li>

            <li>Best of luck with the decision as I know all of these things come with a ton of positive reviews to sift through!</li>
            <li>She has beautiful curly hair that can be easily flatten with this gadget.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>But I am so glad I got it!</li>
            <li>It gets hot almost immediately and does a great job on my hair!</li>
            <li>I love the price too!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>It does get hot, so it takes a while to find the perfect temperature.</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this straightener!</li>
            <li>but this one works sooooo much better!</li>
            <li>I had ZERO issues with the product and love it!</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time today and it was EXCELLENT...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did!  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it!</li>
            <li>I figured this one was the best choice, good reviews and decent price.</li>
            <li>This item works great and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly &amp; has very nice results.</li>
            <li>Amazing results.</li>
            <li>It still does an amazing job.</li>
            <li>it was amazing.  </li>
            <li>My hair, which is prone to frizzing in humidity, still looks amazing after using this straightener.</li>
            <li>This straightener is amazing.</li>
            <li>perfect heat works on all kinds of hair,makes my hair fast, but my hands get burnt every time I use it</li>
            <li>I was planning on spending way more for a straightener, but the reviews for this one were so good</li>
            <li>and I liked the wider plates,</li>
            <li>Once you get used to where the buttons are (and learn how to handle the iron without accidentally pushing buttons), it works nicely.    </li>
            <li>I wish it had some kind of lock on it</li>
            <li>And some of the tech features are nice.   </li>
            <li>I saw many good reviews and that is why I purchased.  </li>
            <li>I have been SEARCHING for 20 years for an effective way to straighten that doesn&#x27;t take forever or prevent me from having my morning shower.</li>
            <li>- swivel cord is great - so the cord doesn&#x27;t tangle  - sleek and stylish looking with brown / purple   - auto shut-off after 60 seconds  - able to lock it</li>
            <li>and she liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>The pros are plenty, however, and more than enough to make this product close to the best salon ones, at a great price.</li>
            <li>so I needed something that could make my hair look great quickly.</li>
            <li>Very easy.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to burn yourself.  </li>
            <li>But after trying it for the first time, I loved it!</li>
            <li>, she liked it Better</li>
            <li>This is an amazing straightener and I love it to death.</li>
            <li>By far the best iron i&#x27;ve ever had!!!</li>
            <li>This is a great straightener, it gets nice and hot and smooths my hair while I&#x27;m using it.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, just below my shoulders.  </li>
            <li>I was worried that I&#x27;d have to invest more money in a more high end straighter to get the results I wanted, but this one works great!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fast as it claims, good quality and YES!</li>
            <li>Great coverage for quick and easy styling.</li>
            <li>and I knew I liked that one pretty good</li>
            <li>fortunately this was a phenomenal accident!    </li>
            <li>You would think this would cost more than it did when you see the end results.</li>
            <li>pro: heats up real fast, straightens hairs really good.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
            <li>buy it because even the chi branded ones dont have the digital temp adjust, which is awesome.</li>
            <li>I love this straightener.  </li>
            <li>Great product and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>but I love it.  </li>
            <li>I\\&quot;m even able to create curls on the ends of my hair by finishing with a flip.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have the CHI and paid about $100 for it and the Remington works much better.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s ceramic and has Tourmaline.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love the lock feature.</li>
            <li>I finally have beautiful sleek and shiny hair!</li>
            <li>For the price, you cannot do any better.</li>
            <li>I used the Remington once, returned it and then purchased a titanium iron made by Corioliss that I found on HSN that has more rounded plates, etc.  </li>
            <li>Much better iron that I would recommend way more than the Remington.      </li>
            <li>Many temp.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>But I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I was able to straighten the front sections in a matter of nanoseconds.</li>
            <li>The bonus features are a 4 year warranty, LED read out on top of unit, lock feature, and I like purple - eggplant color of the unit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still way better than the ouch I would get from trying to comb through my curly, frizzy, ratted ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>I wlll use it until I find something better</li>
            <li>Shiny, silky, and smooth!  </li>
            <li>I feel a lot better now.</li>
            <li>For this price, this is definitely one of the best.</li>
            <li>Plus this has a digital read out of the temperature on the handle to allow you to find what temperature works best for your hair</li>
            <li>Be sure to read the directions...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if you have longer hair</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>OK, here&#x27;s what you do....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten soooooo many compliments on my hair since I bought these two pieces of equipment and started straightening this way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better than those skinny ones.</li>
            <li>no need to spend more.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can choose my heat settings on it and then lock the buttons so that I don&#x27;t keep turning it hotter or cooler.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love? :)</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>and i love love love</li>
            <li>My hair looks so shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I love that you can decide what temp to set the heat at</li>
            <li>I decided to withhold judgment for a couple more weeks not wanting to jinx the product or something...</li>
            <li>I have been getting many compliments @</li>
            <li>I like this one better.  </li>

            <li>This is the best flat iron I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>With my old straighteners, it would take me a good 45-60 minutes to fix my hair AT SHOULDER LENGTH!</li>
            <li>Best flat iron on the market.</li>
            <li>Im pretty dissappointed as the product got many good reviews.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast, is easy to use, makes my hair look great</li>
            <li>and I had it for so long, but this iron is just as good!!!</li>
            <li>I had my hair up in a pony tail so my hair was fairly crimped and in not so hot condition because I didn&#x27;t bother drying it before I put it up</li>
            <li>The build quality is also pretty good and sturdy.</li>
            <li>People always wonder how I get my hair this straight, its all thanks to this wonderful straightener. :)</li>
            <li>for best results use after you shampoo and condition your hair apply Chi silk infusion on your damp hair and then blow dry</li>
            <li>Its still alittle bit frizzy, but not alot at all, it keeps my hair in place all day and it stays really nice, and it was hot today!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too confident when I bought this straightener since it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the Smooth, Silky, look of my hair and all I have to do is comb through it</li>
            <li>I also like what the straightner feels like; It is made with quality parts, unlike the cheap plastic parts that are used to make most straighteners.</li>
            <li>she loved it so much she almost cried.</li>
            <li>Good buy, I really like this item because it helps me fix my hair as in i went to the salon.</li>
            <li>The good points of the iron is that it heats up really fast and that you can lock the temperature to avoid accidentally adjusting it or turning the iron off.</li>
            <li>, she loved it is much she is buying one now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have the option of all the temperatures since I&#x27;m sure certain types of hair require the hotter setting.    </li>
            <li>Other than that, excellent straightener!</li>
            <li>The plates are nice and large as well!</li>
            <li>Easy to work with..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very quick &amp; easy to use.  </li>
            <li>-Iron heats up VERY quickly...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li>There is nothing on the sides to protect nearby areas from the heat of the iron, making it extremely easy to burn your scalp and fingers.      </li>
            <li>I guess the product is good but they should be more clear in their manual about this issue.</li>
            <li>The controls are easy to use.    </li>
            <li>A very quick pass or two</li>
            <li>It is easy to hold, no burns</li>
            <li>This curling iron works so well on her hair and with the width, very quickly.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This thing is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>The Remington S-9400 is just a great flat iron and the price make sit even better.  </li>
            <li>Multiple Settings, Works Great, Good Quality, Durable, Creates Shine, Smooths Frizz, Heats Up Fast  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for about 2 years now, still works great still love it.</li>
            <li>The placement of the heat controls is fine for me</li>
            <li>this one works fine without damaging hair.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and works better than any one I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I picked this up on a whim at Target since it was on super clearance, and I&#x27;m so glad I decided to get it.</li>
            <li>It heats up really quickly, and I love the lock feature.</li>
            <li>So my wonderful hot tools flat iron died after like 7 years, so I searched for another.</li>
            <li>Not with this iron; my hair is beautifully pin-straight (a real first for the ends not to curl up at all) even after I sleep on it, and it saves me a ton of time from not needing to restraighten it the next day.</li>
            <li>I think one this large would not be as effective on shorter styles, and it&#x27;s going to take me a while to get used to smoothing my bangs out with it.</li>
            <li>it leaves her hair very smooth, works very quickly and is not too hot.</li>
            <li>The wide plates help get more hair at once, and the adjustable temp gage is great.</li>
            <li>I used it at 410 degrees with the CHI straight guard cream (first time using the cream as well) and it was amazing!</li>
            <li>When I am done straightening my hair its nice and silky an straight.</li>
            <li>I was scared to replace my current one because it was so great</li>
            <li>Would recommend this product to anyone looking for a reasonably priced and yet effective straightener.</li>
            <li>Also, it dosn&#x27;t pull my hair like the cheap ones did.</li>
            <li>and yet my hair remained frizz free.    </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still running great after daily usage.</li>
            <li>I thought the Wet2Straight was great, but it&#x27;s not even in the same league as the Remington S-9400.    </li>
            <li>My hair came out silky smooth, like I just walked out of the salon.</li>
            <li>- gentle curves in the plates can curl your hair under nicely at the ends.    </li>
            <li>After straightening, I use a dab of bio silk to smooth everything</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair so smooth.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant over the price tag but after finding it locally for a great bargain, I purchased it for what I hoped to be a long-term relationship.</li>
            <li>I now straighten my hair fast and effectively.</li>
            <li>Got this for a good price on Amazon after my old straightener died.  </li>
            <li>My old straightening time was about 1-1.5 hours on a good day.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best flat iron on the market.</li>
            <li>its quick its easy</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly and I&#x27;m pregnant</li>
            <li>The product is very easy to use, heats up quick and stays hot even on the lowest temp.  </li>
            <li>It may have something to do that the plates are tourmaline ceramic vs regular ceramic, but it does heat up quickly and does a great job.</li>
            <li>This flat iron works wonderfully to make it super straight.</li>
            <li>Amazing flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot believe that so many features are packed into such a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>i was so excited and</li>
            <li>It is also user friendly.</li>
            <li>However, the end result it worth it!</li>
            <li>Worth the thirty dollars!</li>
            <li>It rained the first day I was able to use it</li>
            <li>I purchased this straightener based on the ratings and it has not disappointed us.  </li>
            <li>but I wanted a product that worked better than my hot tools straightener that now longer worked.  </li>
            <li>It gets VERY hot quickly!  </li>
            <li>I Love Love Love this flat iron!  </li>
            <li>super smooth    cons:  </li>
            <li>Make sure to brush before and after really make its looks smooth.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is amazing!</li>
            <li>This one gets VERY hot and the plates go all the way to the edge, which allows you to give the hair a wave, light curl or flip if desired.  </li>
            <li>Even though quite careful and experienced with straighteners, I have already burnt my fingers twice</li>
            <li>guess some guys can hear a good present idea when it presents itself.</li>
            <li>My pervious straightener, the conair infinity had a good run but its time to send it into retirement and use it as a back up, in case of emergencies.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the high temp (I have the thickest hair!)</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves this product for the heat settings and the fact that she can do more hair at one time.  </li>
            <li>I love the digital readout that allows you to be more precise with your heat settings rather than just a dial that you turn and hope</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite hair straightener.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome and my hair stays done for at least two days.  </li>
            <li>but my hair is so straight and soooo smooth!</li>
            <li>2) Don&#x27;t get the smaller plates version of this straightener because for some reason it does not work as good.</li>
            <li>I can only give good grades.</li>
            <li>Perfect for thick hair.  </li>
            <li>It heats up super fast and it is VERY HOT!!  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend using a good product to protect your hair from the heat though, as this baby gets as high as 430 degrees (F).</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good flat iron.</li>
            <li>This straightener is seriously the best straighter ever.</li>
            <li>Pros:  - HUGE titanium plates cover a lot of hair and make my hair super straight and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quick.</li>
            <li>My straightened came in a decent amount of time and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a lot of different straighteners, but this one has definitely been the best.</li>
            <li>-   It heats up quickly  -   </li>
            <li>I read the reviews about this product&gt; one quick question.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>I did notice that my hair seems to have held a lot more moisture with this particular straightener.</li>
            <li>bigtime!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Heats up quick and works as described.  </li>
            <li>Gets very hot quickly.  </li>
            <li>In the sea of Hot Irons boiling with little money, I searched for the best hot iron for the price.</li>
            <li>I love this one better than any of there newer T-studio flat irons.</li>
            <li>It does get very hot, but you can adjust the temp.  </li>
            <li>I own a Gold N Hot and that works wonders- perfectly straight hair the first time and the plates are flush with one another.   </li>
            <li>I like them very much!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t fry my hair, yet it gets very hot.</li>
            <li>Overall very pleased and would buy again.</li>
            <li>---that&#x27;s very hot).  </li>
            <li>And I was very satisfied with this product - it has several temperatures, the buttons can be blocked.</li>
            <li>and I always accidentally turn it off in the middle of curling my hair, but I was very pleased that never happened with this straightener.</li>
            <li>the straightener on a heat safe towel when in use, it will help your product and your countertop.&lt;br /&gt;Practice with the different heat settings, you can get some great styles if you know how your hair responds to different temperatures.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought it long time ago and until now still working good.</li>
            <li>As far as the Remington - it&#x27;s OK - nothing special.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several straighteners like an older Conair model, Revlon Perfect Heat Professional 1\\&quot; Ceramic Straightener - RV062C, and even Remington Wet2Straight.</li>
            <li>is the first iron that was able to give me the pin straight look.</li>
            <li>Product is good when you use on dry hair.</li>
            <li>Works better than the chi for sure if you have long hair.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t compare but this product is really easy to use</li>
            <li>It straightened my hair beautifully and left it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Overall, I would buy this again for sure!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair super straight, shiny, and frizz free.</li>
            <li>- can be hot to the touch  - can easily burn your hair if you have the heat setting too hot    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different flat irons &amp; this one is amazing!</li>
            <li>I have spent a long time finding a good flat iron and this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Love the wide plates &amp; really does a nice job straightening curly, course hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this straightener a few years ago, it always works great.</li>
            <li>She says that it leaves her hair smooth &amp; manageable without too much effort.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the temperature control setting, the temp lock, fast heat up, and locking handle.</li>
            <li>After using many straighteners for my thick and wavy hair, i finally found the perfect one.  </li>
            <li>Plus the pink tourmaline makes it cute:)    </li>
            <li>But I think this was worth getting.</li>
            <li>Wish the price was lower but was soooo worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Straightens hair in no time with the wide plates and good heat</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The vast majority of the time, my straightened hair would become wavy if I slept on it, if it got hit with any kind of moisture, or sometimes just as the day went on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying.  </li>
            <li>Definitely was a wise investment and would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>the brown and pink are cute together :)</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t think I would need anything this powerful.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite one yet - and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and straightens very fast</li>
            <li>It seems like others on here have had very positive results,</li>
            <li>Gets super hot</li>
            <li>This flat iron gives me amazing results.</li>
            <li>is about right.</li>
            <li>I always read the reviews of a product before purchasing from amazon, and I have to say the reviews for this product are right on.  </li>
            <li>right-</li>
            <li>all the reviews were right on.</li>
            <li>This is my first flat iron, before this I have always gone to the salon, and I love this one!   </li>
            <li>This product would be amazing if it didn&#x27;t have two major problems: 1-The ceramic plates have minimal buffer from the edges and therefore can burn you very easily.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it because the plates are huge, or that it heats up to a really high temperature, or the material of the plates.</li>
            <li>The size of the iron is great for longer hair; mine is just past my shoulders.</li>
            <li>if you hold it at the very end by the \\&quot;grip\\&quot;, it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li>and super fast and super hot in seconds really!.</li>
            <li>I get my whole finished in under half an hour, and I get SO many compliments!!  </li>
            <li>:  Heats up quickly (and to a very high temp.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have with it, is that it takes a while to heat up compared to my old one, but that&#x27;s probably why this one works so much better, because it actually heats up to an effective temperature!  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, but a lot of it, and I live in a very humid area very close to the ocean, so my hair always gets frizzy after I wash and blow-dry it.</li>
            <li>but the results are super straight hair that lasts two days.</li>
            <li>It heats up extremely fast and makes the straightening process really quick in the morning.</li>
            <li>My hair lasted all night - and I live in humid Miami!!!</li>
            <li>The straightener heats up SUPER fast and gets extremely hot.</li>
            <li>Straightening is very fast because of the size and heat level that it gives.  </li>
            <li>It heats up very fast, and straigtens my hair with just one go-over.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned it for 2 months now, and so far its working perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the world of flat irons and after much research on what the best features on when looking to purchase a flat iron, I chose the Remington S-9400.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and for a wide iron, is very light and maneuverable.</li>
            <li>cause it&#x27;s too hot and makes the hair burn</li>
            <li>Probably my favorite part is that I only have to pass over each section of hair once.</li>
            <li>it actually added a sexy smooth sheen and a natural flowyness to her hair too.</li>
            <li>Maybe my hair is too short and this iron would be better for longer hair.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it! :)</li>
            <li>The result its fantastic, for me we dont need to buy expensive straightener just to be beautiful try this product and it wont disappoint you...</li>
            <li>it first arrived in the mail, i did not hesitate to try it out.</li>
            <li>-Cant hold the iron too close to the plates because it gets too hot.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair really hot though (like burning my fingers)</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this wouldn&#x27;t be a dude, and it&#x27;s not!  </li>
            <li>It turns my thick frizzy hair into beautiful straight sleek hair.  </li>
            <li>This iron works well to straighten your hair but the handle gets way too hot.</li>
            <li>I had felt the need to update my old conair silver because it felt more as if it was burning my hair and really took a bit of time and repeat passes to make my hair straight.</li>
            <li>I will report back on whether it stood up to the environment:-)    </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn, but it&#x27;s hot.  </li>
            <li>It gets really hot which I like.</li>
            <li>I like that it gets closer to your hair (unlike some like Hot Tools).  </li>
            <li>and I actually like this one much better.</li>
            <li>;)    </li>
            <li>Does exactly as it should straightens hair</li>
            <li>Dont go to hot</li>
            <li>In order for it to close all the way I had to put my hand onto the iron part which is hot.  </li>
            <li>and although it cost more, i went and ordered another one the very next day.</li>
            <li>I also like that you can increase or decrease in 10 degree increments, so you can get exactly the heat you need</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>Use the hair dryer exactly as intended</li>
            <li>At first my hair would get stuck in the sides of this straightener but over time I got used to it.</li>
            <li>that was fast!</li>
            <li>today was my first day using this</li>
            <li>it does get really hot</li>
            <li>I also appreciate the digital adjustment, so you can raise the heat if your hair is more stubborn or lower if your hair is getting fried.</li>
            <li>She seems to be enjoying it, though she&#x27;s only had it for a week.</li>
            <li>I have bought it twice because my first one got ruined in a flood.</li>
            <li>First one lasted 4 years, and she abuses it</li>
            <li>(Purchased in 2010), Digitable adjustable heat and doesn&#x27;t keep your hair too hot.</li>
            <li>The heat is not twice as hot</li>
            <li>Your better off going with a smaller one, it just takes a bit longer.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many flat irons and most of them do not work well on my coarse curly fuzzy hair.  </li>
            <li>Before this flat iron in had bought the kiyosaki flat iron and to me thats another one of the best ones but its not worth paying that much money for hair straightener!!!</li>
            <li>Plus I love the face that you can close the flat iron when you need to store it while its not in use.</li>
            <li>I kind of like it, as any other product it&#x27;s got it&#x27;s pros and cons ...</li>
            <li>Love the way my hair looks and feels with this flat iron.</li>
            <li>Love this Flat Iron..</li>
            <li>I love this 2 1/4 inch flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I took the plunge and got this flat iron.</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron for waist length hair!</li>
            <li>i didnt expect such a high quality straightener for that price: 4 yr warranty!, huge heating plates!</li>
            <li>I have never had straight, volumized, frizz free hair like this without going to a salon and having a professional blow out.</li>
            <li>It does the job easily and does not dry out the hair.</li>
            <li>These plates are really really big, much longer than most plates  </li>
            <li>I expected my hair to have returned to its normal wavy state, but again was pleased to see perfectly straight and frizz free hair.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron so much.</li>
            <li>I travel for work and love this flat iron so much</li>
            <li>OK, We are 3 women with long curly hair in this house.</li>
            <li>I may start flat ironing my hair more often because its so much faster and easier.  </li>
            <li>Not as pin straight, but pretty close.   </li>
            <li>I purchased this flat iron only because the good reviews.</li>
            <li>i heard amazing things about fh1 and was about to put down the $400+ for it.  </li>
            <li>But it heats up very quickly and the wide plates make straightening a quick job.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant, because the price was so reasonable, but I talked myself into it and very glad I did.</li>
            <li>But this one, is faster, wider, cheaper in price, and does an amazing job in half of the time.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very satisfied, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>Cons:  While there is a setting that will lock the iron on a set temperature while you work, the placement of the buttons makes it easy to accidentally \\&quot;unlock\\&quot; the temperature control, so you may end up with an entirely different temperature and not know it.  </li>
            <li>I had an older white Revlon model that had the huge gold ceramic plates (that is a GREAT one also but discontinued and really hard to find).  </li>
            <li>BUT the plates are large, which is what I wanted</li>
            <li>It has three heat settings and gets hot fast, which is good for thick hair.</li>
            <li>high chance of rain--a nice, hot 12 hour drive round trip.  </li>
            <li>Also it stays straight all day</li>
            <li>lasts whole day.</li>
            <li>It only takes me 20 minutes to straighten my hair and everytime it looks shiny, smooth, and it doesn&#x27;t look like I have an afro.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair shining and straight.</li>
            <li>I know the whole idea of this straightener is the curved plates that allow you to flip the ends of your hair.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Design of the iron is very sleek and</li>
            <li>Heats up fast</li>
            <li>She loves it so much and praises me for getting it for her.</li>
            <li>but it really didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li>So the result..dead straight, shiny hair in about 15 minutes.    </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this one to anyone!</li>
            <li>But with this straightener, it stayed straight throughout the day.    </li>
            <li>&quot; you can see in the hair, as well as stick straight ends.  </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much of a guard around the plates making burns on the scalp and fingers a bit of a problem even for pros    </li>
            <li>I have to use something to hold it with and it is a real problem.</li>
            <li>The time it takes to heat up does depend on your power source, as I have found that it takes much longer to reach the desired temp at places like hotels and airports</li>
            <li>, it gets my hair straight in no time.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go for the day.</li>
            <li>No frizz, just straight silky hair.</li>
            <li>and I really have to used force to flatten them when I use it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>fast even heating  salon quality look  </li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>, everyone now comments that my hair looks so much fuller even though it is now bone straight.  </li>
            <li>Plus, even though I sometimes work in really humid environments, my hair stays straight through all kinds of conditions, even in the rain.</li>
            <li>This straightener makes it SOOOOOOOOOOOO much easier to get my hair done.</li>
            <li>It is fast to heat up and the buttons are in degrees electronically.</li>
            <li>I did not really believe the reviews on here that this flatiron is better than the 100 dollar ones</li>
            <li>It will straighten anything FAST.</li>
            <li>I also love how wide it is.</li>
            <li>how much i like it.&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon, got the item in three days...</li>
            <li>works really well.</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>MUCH AND ALL PERFECT.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My daughter had this on her wishlist for her birthday, she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>Heats up really fast and using it once keeps my hair straight for days.</li>
            <li>For someone who wants to upgrade from something that just wasn&#x27;t working anymore, but can&#x27;t afford to invest in a GHD or a CHI</li>
            <li>its wide plates makes your job lot more easier and quicker..</li>
            <li>Thanks, Mom!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Did I mention that I LOVE the brown and pink color scheme??</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and the price is cherry!</li>
            <li>The plates heat up fast and the temperature is salon style up to 410.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it makes my hair more smooth than any other straightener I&#x27;ve tried, and my hair seems to even be less frizzy after I wash it the next day.</li>
            <li>It took me 25 minutes maximum with the S-9400, and my hair has grown out a good 5 inches past my shoulders!</li>
            <li>Also spray your wet hair with a heat protecting flat iron spray for good measure.</li>
            <li>It also seems to be much more gentle on my hair than other straighteners.</li>
            <li>This flat iron has all the right coatings and it heats up great for unruly thick hair.</li>
            <li>It gets super hot, super fast even with slightly damp hair.    </li>
            <li>My other straighteners always pulled my hair causing damage and my hair would have static.</li>
            <li>I like the digital temperature and user friendly keys.  </li>
            <li>Because of this iron, I&#x27;ve bought other Remington products and have been pleased with all of my purchases from them.</li>
            <li>There is also NO REASON to spend more money than this on other brands.  </li>
            <li>Like many of the other reviews below, I bought this at Target because the straightener I went to buy was sold out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s girly but not over the top like other brands.</li>
            <li>Heats up really fast and remains steady as you use the item.</li>
            <li>If you have thick hair this is perfect it straightens in about half the time.</li>
            <li>I say, \\&quot;Thank you, Remington, for being sensitive to the trends in hot irons and knowing how to price things</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous other flat irons through the years and this is definitely the best one if you have a lot of wavy or curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I do feel like it&#x27;s easy to burn your scalp with the exposed siding, or even just the expulsion of steam as the plates move, but it just calls to be careful.    </li>
            <li>Does a better job in half the time.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the Remington S-9400 straightener, mainly for the price &amp; also based on the rave reviews I found on this site.  </li>
            <li>The sheer size of this one makes straightening go quickly.  </li>
            <li>I bought this unit at Target when I couldn&#x27;t find the Conair my friend recommended mainly because it was on sale.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a expensive one, but after noticing a lot of people claiming that it was worth it to buy this product and also the good price, I decided to get it.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve probably had over 15 and gone through buying them, trying them, and taking them back more than enough times.</li>
            <li>After reading several reviews on many different brands, I determined this was the one.</li>
            <li>that is one of the main reason i bought this one because it can be used worldwide..</li>
            <li>This product is a bit lighter in weight than the older version.</li>
            <li>The older version heats up to 200 and this one goes up to 410.</li>
            <li>but it does feel a bit hotter than the older version.</li>
            <li>It heats up pretty quickly too, and is very convenient to use, especially on long hair!  </li>
            <li>I have long, thick hair and the 2 1/4\\&quot; width of this is perfect, anything smaller in width would take hours to get this type of a result.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li>Also, It&#x27;s cheaper than most of other offers.</li>
            <li>the other thing that i loved about this product is its 2 1/4\\&quot; wide plates....</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>smooth and shine  Con: a gap between the plate makes it harder to hold the hair        </li>
            <li>my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz or gets curly after a couple hours (or minutes as mi old one)I really like it.</li>
            <li>My hair is not nearly as thick as hers</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first one that I&#x27;ve found that will actually straighten my hair and it stays straight.  </li>
            <li>I have long thick hair and my hair looks great when done.</li>
            <li>The only con is your ends can get really fried if you use while hair is wet    shines hair and makes it look healthy</li>
            <li>I also have the Tstudio collection blow dryer that I love and has lasted me years of everyday use.</li>
            <li>This was had all the same specs, so i decided \\&quot;what the heck, for $30 its worth a shot\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>* twice slow for each section, dont put to much hair in it, make sure it can close properly, i do four sections starting at the bottom and work my way to the top.</li>
            <li>Nice thick plates</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe that it cut my hair styling time in more than half!</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s not hard at all-</li>
            <li>I bought it at Target for $39.99, significantly less than the cost of more &#x27;professional&#x27; straighteners.    </li>
            <li>I have thick, curly/wavy hair, and this straightener works really smoothly and quickly.</li>
            <li>I have fine, mostly straight hair with just a little wave to it.</li>
            <li>I usually have to turn the heat up super high on most flat irons, but not this one!  </li>
            <li>This flat iron warms up pretty fast</li>
            <li>I really have nothing to compare this iron to, as it is my first ceramic flat iron.</li>
            <li>It would probably be too big for someone with fine or short hair though.  </li>
            <li>With such a large iron and fast heating</li>
            <li>I am in the process of looking for a new one.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a new iron to replace the one I had for like 6 years.</li>
            <li>and I live in the Caribbean where it&#x27;s always humid</li>
            <li>well, her name isn&#x27;t repunzel, but she sure has long hair, so when she straitens it, it takes a long time.</li>
            <li>: sleek design, lightweight, digital temperature setting (up to 430 F), lock feature to keep the product closed when not in use, swivel cord, x-large plates for more coverage and quicker prep time, heats up within 30 seconds, automatic shut off&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the wide plates as it definitely speeds things up.</li>
            <li>My hair stayed straight all day, into the night and was still straight the next morning!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it died especially when I wasn&#x27;t using it as often, letting my hair go naturally wavy for a while, but it died right after my mom gave me a new haircut</li>
            <li>The new one worked exactly the same, and I have had it for a year now.</li>
            <li>I have very dry hair which I put lots of product on before, so this is just fabulous that I only had to send 15 blow drying, then 5 minutes to straight iron</li>
            <li>her smooth silky hair is now all straight and tame without needing alot of product to make her all helmet headed.</li>
            <li>Ive owned a wigo before and this one beats it by far!</li>
            <li>Then about 3 months later, i noticed that it didnt get as hot as it used to.</li>
            <li>The end result, my hair was transformed from frizzy and tangled (due to sleeping on the curls from the night before) into a  fresh, sleek pin straight do.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It heats up pretty fast and your hair gets DEAD STRAIGHT after passing the iron just once!</li>
            <li>know - the roots are usually the coarsest &amp; need straightening the most.  </li>
            <li>The outside of the device also got way too hot when pressing together to straighten &amp; burned my fingers.  </li>
            <li>Digital display means you know exactly what temperature you are using on your hair.  </li>
            <li>The outside of the appliance doesn&#x27;t get hot  </li>
            <li>There is such thing as too hot, people, and the Chi</li>
            <li>I have a pink BedHead flat iron I used before then and decided to return this and just keep using the one I had before as it worked much better.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say am not sure if those people were dreaming or if they have just never used better products</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t get hot enough and the plates don&#x27;t go all the way to the end.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to straighten my hair so many times and tried numerous creams and sprays to tame the frizz and keep it straight.</li>
            <li>Has to put very little effort into getting straight hair and it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>I compared this iron to the Chi and other flat irons and the Remington comes out on top.</li>
            <li>My daughter swore by Hot tools and then she tried my Remington Flat Iron and i had to buy her one of these too</li>
            <li>This is my first flat iron and it works as well as my sister&#x27;s Chi.</li>
            <li>Smooth and shiny with no special products.</li>
            <li>I had a really good flat iron that finally quit working, but due to the price, it wasn&#x27;t feasible for me to replace it with the same model.  </li>
            <li>then her Hot Tool Flat Iron!</li>
            <li>If you are clumsy like me, just make sure to be super careful.</li>
            <li>Only problem is getting the roots since it is so large.</li>
            <li>This straightener does a much better job and takes a lot less time -- I don&#x27;t have to redo the back of my head ten times like I did before because I could never get it straight</li>
            <li>Now, before reading any negative reviews (their aren&#x27;t many though)....keep in mind that it doesn&#x27;t make sense to complain that a flat iron burns your hair or is so hot &amp; burns your fingers.</li>
            <li>I would have gladly purchased the same flat iron if I could, but it&#x27;s long been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The temp variations is a real plus so everyone from fine hair to thick hair like myself can use it.     </li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it still doesn&#x27;t get my hair as shiny and straight as my old H2Pro.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re ironing your hair with direct heat and, thus, burning it.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft &amp; shiny every time.</li>
            <li>i bought this just in time for her birthday, and even let her have it a day early</li>
            <li>The only thing worth nothing is if you have a short fringe, you may not be able to use this one on it, as the hair strands have to be at least two inches.  </li>
            <li>am replacing my 3 yr old rusty 1 1/2 inch Revlon hair straightener.</li>
            <li>I transitioned to natural hair (no chemicals), but still need to straigthen my hair for job interviews etc,.  </li>
            <li>The real test was to see if my hair actually remained that way.</li>
            <li>Also, DO NOT let this iron anywhere near your scalp.  </li>
            <li>I read all the reviews before purchasing it, but I&#x27;ve had no trouble with the iron burning my fingers-</li>
            <li>Thats why I used directly in my country.</li>
            <li>I have a spot near my scalp where I got too close and burned my skin.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to the digital readout</li>
            <li>old daughter</li>
            <li>I tend to wear my hair up a lot after showers so the next day it gets very curly and wavy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for 3 years thus far</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy, coarse, and wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I would not waste $100</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s a mother of two young children</li>
            <li>It has not dried out or damaged my hair at all.  </li>
            <li>Daughter wanted a straightener and has used it nearly every day since.  </li>
            <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this straightener if it wasn&#x27;t for my adult daughter.  </li>
            <li>Make my hair soft and shinny after i used it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it frequently</li>
            <li>I have a LOT of thick wavy hair and this straightener gives me silky smooth straight hair within FIFTEEN minutes.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get hot enough; not hot enough fast enough; not user friendly.</li>
            <li>After using it for a few months my hair was in such better condition.</li>
            <li>We already tried Corioliss, which is good but not awesome.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick coarse and abundant.</li>
            <li>Cord is an adequate length (not too short, not too long)    </li>
            <li>It took me less than half the time to do my whole head and it looks much more professional.  </li>
            <li>right away i did tried on dump and wet hair.</li>
            <li>This iron straightens my hair and makes it shiny and silky without having to blow dry first.</li>
            <li>I bought it when my old flat iron (which cost almost 3 times as much) broke.</li>
            <li>I usually just flatten out the top part of my hair to make it really glossy and to tame the little curly hairs on top.</li>
            <li>chi silk infusion also leaves a fantastic smell on your hair..its way better than those expensive branded flat irons like sedu, solia which just takes all the hype!!</li>
            <li>Best Uses: Straight Hair, Frizzy Hair, Humid Conditions, Long Hair, Curly Hair, Thick Hair, Thin Hair  Bottom Line:</li>
            <li>Very irritating with our a really good tool.  </li>

            <li>A very well made flat iron.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron is a miracle worker (and the CHI straight guard too</li>
            <li>This flat iron works very well for straightening my hair.</li>

            <li>According to the beauty blogs and the \\&quot;expert opinions\\&quot;, plus reading what other purchasers have written, I found the desirable features of Ceramic with Tourmaline plate (to prevent frizzing and better for your hair), adjustable temperatures up to 430 degrees, auto shut off, and larger than 1 3/4 inches for long hair.</li>

            <li>Exactly what was expected.</li>
            <li>but here I am today writing this review several weeks later with the same smile on my face.     </li>
            <li>The very first day I was impressed with its speed and smoothness since I am often let down by straighteners that fail to handle my wavy thick hair.</li>
            <li>I also have their small curling wand, large curling wand and hot rollers in this pink/brown pearl style.</li>
            <li>this would be ok if you don&#x27;t mind how hard it is to pull hair through the plates, but for short hair or shoulder length</li>
            <li>This straightener keeps it straight and silky all day long!</li>
            <li>I have very long, very wavy hair</li>
            <li>I have very long hair, so the Remington straightener really holds up to the job.</li>
            <li>The first time i tried to use it, i could barely hold it because when you heat it up, the entire flat iron heats up!</li>
            <li>It takes me 15-20 minutes, which is a solid time but not as fast as I had hoped with the big plates.</li>
            <li>I have EXTREMELY thick and curly hair (think Curly Sue or Shirley Temple) and this straightener had no problem making my hair extremely soft, smooth, touchable and shiny.</li>
            <li>the job done for the most part- but would not recommend to someone who has thick hair as you have to straighten numerous times in one spot.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty thick wavy hair, and I have tried about a dozen hair straigteners in my life, some pretty pricey, and non of them compare to the Remington.  </li>
            <li>pretty- the plates are pink!   </li>
            <li>and I thought no other straightener could beat its performance until I tried this straightener.</li>
            <li>- HOT digital temperature guage (I only need about 390 degrees and have coarse hair - and it goes even hotter than that)  </li>
            <li>Its so sleek look too, and with the wide plates it make straightening my long thick hair easy and fun.</li>
            <li>This week, it died and so I needed to go out and buy a new flat iron.</li>
            <li>GENERAL:  </li>
            <li>She would tell you her hair is generally unmanageable.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m back to my old iron.     </li>
            <li>Going back to my old straightener.</li>
            <li>Completely blows my last straigthener out of the water.</li>
            <li>Also, it has quite wide plates - very convenient.</li>
            <li>The result is fantastic.just one time action is enough to have silky hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this straightener because my old, trusty H2Pro was falling apart after being dropped and overall wear and tear.</li>
            <li>I was able to straighten my long layered thick tresses in under 20 miniutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too hot, I always have to turn it down.</li>
            <li>And let me warn you that this flat iron gets hot and it can be hard to hold the end of the plates together when you need to but it can be done if you don&#x27;t get too close to the hot spot.</li>
            <li>The plates heat up very well, the heat setting locks and can&#x27;t be changed or turned off by accident as in some other products (such as the Conair Infiniti straightener), there is virtually no static and the end result is silky and smooth hair.</li>
            <li>Since i was 13 I&#x27;ve had trouble finding the right straighter....</li>
            <li>I previously was using a hot tools iron that i had borrowed from a friend.  </li>
            <li>, that is fine, and it is hard to find a straightener that will actually make it go the way I want it to.</li>
            <li>I usually use irons on the highest setting (my old iron went up to 410 degrees), but that same temp on this iron was far too hot, to the risk of burning the ends.</li>
            <li>as far as flat irons go)  </li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning my hair is a hot mess.  </li>
            <li>with my old flat iron.</li>
            <li>I initially bought this product due to all the positive reviews i read about it.</li>
            <li>Wet to silky straight takes about 25 minutes total if you follow this advice.</li>
            <li>Now, two and a half years later it still performs as well as it did when I first bought it.</li>
            <li>If not hot enough, it won&#x27;t straighten your hair or keep it straight</li>
            <li>It used to take me 15 minutes to get my hair straight with other products and this one only takes about 5.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that you have to be careful when you are holding it because when you are gripping the handle, you can accidentally change the heat settings.</li>
            <li>I have long thick full hair that is naturally wavy</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical with purchasing this product, partly because it was so inexpensive, I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work good.  </li>
            <li>It heated up fast, it made my hair completely straight in one go (and it had already dried curly at the time of my test...really hard to get it very straight once it has dried curly normally)!</li>
            <li>am suprised (and lucky) that this straightener is priced so affordably, especially since it is in the same league (if not better)</li>
            <li>This gets my hair sooo much straighter and silkier than the Chi did, and uses less time to straighten.  </li>
            <li>now I can let my hair dry naturally and just use the straightener and don&#x27;t have to do anything for a couple days.  </li>
            <li>They always break or dry out my hair completely.</li>
            <li>How long does the straightened hair last How frequently do u have to straighten your hair?</li>
            <li>You sort of have to push the plates together a few times before actually straightening, it caught my hair the first couple of times till I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li>I liked the wide plates, but it was very difficult to reach the root of the hair, which as those of us with very kinky curly hair</li>
            <li>My main problem with it is that it does not close all the way down on my hair at the point closest to the \\&quot;handle\\&quot; of the iron.  </li>
            <li>Altough I want my hair as straight as possible, I also want some body to it and a little healthy-looking curl at the ends.  </li>

            <li> This is a great straightener.  </li>
            <li> I am happy that I did.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see what all the great reviews are about.  </li>
            <li> The wider surface is really great.</li>
            <li> Moreover, the price was great.</li>
            <li> Leaves me hair feeling and looking great.</li>
            <li> I bought the Remington based on all the great reviews and the price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with straightener.</li>

            <li> I got this for my sister and worked great</li>
            <li> Good price, good product!</li>
            <li> I love this straightener!!</li>
            <li> It does NOT get ANY better than this one!!</li>
            <li> awesome straightener, works great, love it.  </li>
            <li> This straightener is amazing!  </li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> They both said it is working amazing and had ZERO complaints about it!</li>
            <li> Amazing hair straightener!  </li>
            <li> It works really nice!</li>
            <li> Nice machine!</li>
            <li> I love it and believe the reviews, it&#x27;s that good!!</li>
            <li> I was impressed this morning at how easily this iron glides through my hair.</li>
            <li> Plus it has a swivel cord that is always good.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull or snag my hair, and leaves it perfectly silky, shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Then I saw this one on here, and with mostly good reviews.</li>
            <li> This brand alone is definitely good</li>
            <li> I got this straightener because I read reviews and compared it to the chi, and trust me you don&#x27;t need to spend 100 dollars for a good straightener.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a good hair straightener</li>
            <li> I searched and searched before I found this one that had really good reviews</li>
            <li> Her hair looks really good after she uses it</li>
            <li> saving myself about 50 bucks and burning my fingers and scalp every time i try to straighten my hair didn&#x27;t seem like a really good deal to me.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good iron, has substantial weight, and does a good job.  </li>
            <li> and it does a good job.</li>
            <li> MADE A GOOD BUY AND RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard good things about ceramic and tourmaline</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> very easy to use and its great for the price ...</li>
            <li> I would have gladly paid more for this straightener seeing how wonderfully this works although I loved the price.</li>
            <li> Worthy of money and excellent product.</li>
            <li> This one is just wonderful and does such a great job!</li>
            <li> I love love love it!!!</li>
            <li> This baby works awesome and fast!!  </li>
            <li> better yet, price or not, it works great.</li>
            <li> Since this review, I have used the item at length and am very satisfied:    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments about how great my hair looks.</li>

            <li> Best of luck with the decision as I know all of these things come with a ton of positive reviews to sift through!</li>
            <li> She has beautiful curly hair that can be easily flatten with this gadget.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair!  </li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> But I am so glad I got it!</li>
            <li> It gets hot almost immediately and does a great job on my hair!</li>
            <li> I love the price too!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> It does get hot, so it takes a while to find the perfect temperature.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this straightener!</li>
            <li> but this one works sooooo much better!</li>
            <li> I had ZERO issues with the product and love it!</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time today and it was EXCELLENT...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did!  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> I figured this one was the best choice, good reviews and decent price.</li>
            <li> This item works great and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Heats up very quickly &amp; has very nice results.</li>
            <li> Amazing results.</li>
            <li> It still does an amazing job.</li>
            <li> it was amazing.  </li>
            <li> My hair, which is prone to frizzing in humidity, still looks amazing after using this straightener.</li>
            <li> This straightener is amazing.</li>
            <li> perfect heat works on all kinds of hair,makes my hair fast, but my hands get burnt every time I use it</li>
            <li> I was planning on spending way more for a straightener, but the reviews for this one were so good</li>
            <li> and I liked the wider plates,</li>
            <li> Once you get used to where the buttons are (and learn how to handle the iron without accidentally pushing buttons), it works nicely.    </li>
            <li> I wish it had some kind of lock on it</li>
            <li> And some of the tech features are nice.   </li>
            <li> I saw many good reviews and that is why I purchased.  </li>
            <li> I have been SEARCHING for 20 years for an effective way to straighten that doesn&#x27;t take forever or prevent me from having my morning shower.</li>
            <li> - swivel cord is great - so the cord doesn&#x27;t tangle  - sleek and stylish looking with brown / purple   - auto shut-off after 60 seconds  - able to lock it</li>
            <li> and she liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> The pros are plenty, however, and more than enough to make this product close to the best salon ones, at a great price.</li>
            <li> so I needed something that could make my hair look great quickly.</li>
            <li> Very easy.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to burn yourself.  </li>
            <li> But after trying it for the first time, I loved it!</li>
            <li> , she liked it Better</li>
            <li> This is an amazing straightener and I love it to death.</li>
            <li> By far the best iron i&#x27;ve ever had!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great straightener, it gets nice and hot and smooths my hair while I&#x27;m using it.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, just below my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that I&#x27;d have to invest more money in a more high end straighter to get the results I wanted, but this one works great!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fast as it claims, good quality and YES!</li>
            <li> Great coverage for quick and easy styling.</li>
            <li> and I knew I liked that one pretty good</li>
            <li> fortunately this was a phenomenal accident!    </li>
            <li> You would think this would cost more than it did when you see the end results.</li>
            <li> pro: heats up real fast, straightens hairs really good.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
            <li> buy it because even the chi branded ones dont have the digital temp adjust, which is awesome.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener.  </li>
            <li> Great product and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> but I love it.  </li>
            <li> I\\&quot;m even able to create curls on the ends of my hair by finishing with a flip.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have the CHI and paid about $100 for it and the Remington works much better.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s ceramic and has Tourmaline.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I love the lock feature.</li>
            <li> I finally have beautiful sleek and shiny hair!</li>
            <li> For the price, you cannot do any better.</li>
            <li> I used the Remington once, returned it and then purchased a titanium iron made by Corioliss that I found on HSN that has more rounded plates, etc.  </li>
            <li> Much better iron that I would recommend way more than the Remington.      </li>
            <li> Many temp.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> But I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I was able to straighten the front sections in a matter of nanoseconds.</li>
            <li> The bonus features are a 4 year warranty, LED read out on top of unit, lock feature, and I like purple - eggplant color of the unit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still way better than the ouch I would get from trying to comb through my curly, frizzy, ratted ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> I wlll use it until I find something better</li>
            <li> Shiny, silky, and smooth!  </li>
            <li> I feel a lot better now.</li>
            <li> For this price, this is definitely one of the best.</li>
            <li> Plus this has a digital read out of the temperature on the handle to allow you to find what temperature works best for your hair</li>
            <li> Be sure to read the directions...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if you have longer hair</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> OK, here&#x27;s what you do....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten soooooo many compliments on my hair since I bought these two pieces of equipment and started straightening this way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much better than those skinny ones.</li>
            <li> no need to spend more.  </li>
            <li> I love that I can choose my heat settings on it and then lock the buttons so that I don&#x27;t keep turning it hotter or cooler.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love? :)</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> and i love love love</li>
            <li> My hair looks so shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I love that you can decide what temp to set the heat at</li>
            <li> I decided to withhold judgment for a couple more weeks not wanting to jinx the product or something...</li>
            <li> I have been getting many compliments @</li>
            <li> I like this one better.  </li>
            <li> *  :)  </li>

            <li> I have to admit that I&#x27;ve used it several times as well and am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I absolutly love this.</li>
            <li> I just love this Remington S-900 T-Studio straightener...</li>
            <li> then see it makes a magic on your hair...</li>
            <li> and my hair is sleek and shiny and looks FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> so I decided on this one, mostly because of the price.</li>
            <li> For what I paid, I&#x27;m really pleased.</li>
            <li> I lovethe many adjustable temperatures.</li>
            <li> It works so well,  and I get many compliments.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> She seems to LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> i love this straightener.</li>
            <li> so glad I did my research</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have always been greatly satisfied with Remington hair products.</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> She thinks this one is really good, gets hot quickly and does a good job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got it because this is one of the best flat irons I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
            <li> ANYTHING HOT WILL BURN YOUR HAIR!!!</li>
            <li> My hair has shine and stayed straight ALL day!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this Flat Iron because my friend told me it was the best one she ever used!</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s WONDERFUL), buy the Remington T3 Tourmaline flat iron and buy some Chi Silk Fusion or Biosilk.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> With my old straighteners, it would take me a good 45-60 minutes to fix my hair AT SHOULDER LENGTH!</li>
            <li> Best flat iron on the market.</li>
            <li> Im pretty dissappointed as the product got many good reviews.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast, is easy to use, makes my hair look great</li>
            <li> and I had it for so long, but this iron is just as good!!!</li>
            <li> I had my hair up in a pony tail so my hair was fairly crimped and in not so hot condition because I didn&#x27;t bother drying it before I put it up</li>
            <li> The build quality is also pretty good and sturdy.</li>
            <li> People always wonder how I get my hair this straight, its all thanks to this wonderful straightener. :)</li>
            <li> for best results use after you shampoo and condition your hair apply Chi silk infusion on your damp hair and then blow dry</li>
            <li> Its still alittle bit frizzy, but not alot at all, it keeps my hair in place all day and it stays really nice, and it was hot today!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too confident when I bought this straightener since it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Smooth, Silky, look of my hair and all I have to do is comb through it</li>
            <li> I also like what the straightner feels like; It is made with quality parts, unlike the cheap plastic parts that are used to make most straighteners.</li>
            <li> she loved it so much she almost cried.</li>
            <li> Good buy, I really like this item because it helps me fix my hair as in i went to the salon.</li>
            <li> The good points of the iron is that it heats up really fast and that you can lock the temperature to avoid accidentally adjusting it or turning the iron off.</li>
            <li> , she loved it is much she is buying one now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have the option of all the temperatures since I&#x27;m sure certain types of hair require the hotter setting.    </li>
            <li> Other than that, excellent straightener!</li>
            <li> The plates are nice and large as well!</li>
            <li> Easy to work with..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very quick &amp; easy to use.  </li>
            <li> -Iron heats up VERY quickly...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> There is nothing on the sides to protect nearby areas from the heat of the iron, making it extremely easy to burn your scalp and fingers.      </li>
            <li> I guess the product is good but they should be more clear in their manual about this issue.</li>
            <li> The controls are easy to use.    </li>
            <li> A very quick pass or two</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold, no burns</li>
            <li> This curling iron works so well on her hair and with the width, very quickly.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> The Remington S-9400 is just a great flat iron and the price make sit even better.  </li>
            <li> Multiple Settings, Works Great, Good Quality, Durable, Creates Shine, Smooths Frizz, Heats Up Fast  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for about 2 years now, still works great still love it.</li>
            <li> The placement of the heat controls is fine for me</li>
            <li> this one works fine without damaging hair.  </li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and works better than any one I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I picked this up on a whim at Target since it was on super clearance, and I&#x27;m so glad I decided to get it.</li>
            <li> It heats up really quickly, and I love the lock feature.</li>
            <li> So my wonderful hot tools flat iron died after like 7 years, so I searched for another.</li>
            <li> Not with this iron; my hair is beautifully pin-straight (a real first for the ends not to curl up at all) even after I sleep on it, and it saves me a ton of time from not needing to restraighten it the next day.</li>
            <li> I think one this large would not be as effective on shorter styles, and it&#x27;s going to take me a while to get used to smoothing my bangs out with it.</li>
            <li> it leaves her hair very smooth, works very quickly and is not too hot.</li>
            <li> The wide plates help get more hair at once, and the adjustable temp gage is great.</li>
            <li> I used it at 410 degrees with the CHI straight guard cream (first time using the cream as well) and it was amazing!</li>
            <li> When I am done straightening my hair its nice and silky an straight.</li>
            <li> I was scared to replace my current one because it was so great</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product to anyone looking for a reasonably priced and yet effective straightener.</li>
            <li> Also, it dosn&#x27;t pull my hair like the cheap ones did.</li>
            <li> and yet my hair remained frizz free.    </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still running great after daily usage.</li>
            <li> I thought the Wet2Straight was great, but it&#x27;s not even in the same league as the Remington S-9400.    </li>
            <li> My hair came out silky smooth, like I just walked out of the salon.</li>
            <li> - gentle curves in the plates can curl your hair under nicely at the ends.    </li>
            <li> After straightening, I use a dab of bio silk to smooth everything</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair so smooth.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant over the price tag but after finding it locally for a great bargain, I purchased it for what I hoped to be a long-term relationship.</li>
            <li> I now straighten my hair fast and effectively.</li>
            <li> Got this for a good price on Amazon after my old straightener died.  </li>
            <li> My old straightening time was about 1-1.5 hours on a good day.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best flat iron on the market.</li>
            <li> its quick its easy</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly and I&#x27;m pregnant</li>
            <li> The product is very easy to use, heats up quick and stays hot even on the lowest temp.  </li>
            <li> It may have something to do that the plates are tourmaline ceramic vs regular ceramic, but it does heat up quickly and does a great job.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works wonderfully to make it super straight.</li>
            <li> Amazing flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot believe that so many features are packed into such a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> i was so excited and</li>
            <li> It is also user friendly.</li>
            <li> However, the end result it worth it!</li>
            <li> Worth the thirty dollars!</li>
            <li> It rained the first day I was able to use it</li>
            <li> I purchased this straightener based on the ratings and it has not disappointed us.  </li>
            <li> but I wanted a product that worked better than my hot tools straightener that now longer worked.  </li>
            <li> It gets VERY hot quickly!  </li>
            <li> I Love Love Love this flat iron!  </li>
            <li> super smooth    cons:  </li>
            <li> Make sure to brush before and after really make its looks smooth.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is amazing!</li>
            <li> This one gets VERY hot and the plates go all the way to the edge, which allows you to give the hair a wave, light curl or flip if desired.  </li>
            <li> Even though quite careful and experienced with straighteners, I have already burnt my fingers twice</li>
            <li> guess some guys can hear a good present idea when it presents itself.</li>
            <li> My pervious straightener, the conair infinity had a good run but its time to send it into retirement and use it as a back up, in case of emergencies.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the high temp (I have the thickest hair!)</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves this product for the heat settings and the fact that she can do more hair at one time.  </li>
            <li> I love the digital readout that allows you to be more precise with your heat settings rather than just a dial that you turn and hope</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite hair straightener.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome and my hair stays done for at least two days.  </li>
            <li> but my hair is so straight and soooo smooth!</li>
            <li> 2) Don&#x27;t get the smaller plates version of this straightener because for some reason it does not work as good.</li>
            <li> I can only give good grades.</li>
            <li> Perfect for thick hair.  </li>
            <li> It heats up super fast and it is VERY HOT!!  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend using a good product to protect your hair from the heat though, as this baby gets as high as 430 degrees (F).</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good flat iron.</li>
            <li> This straightener is seriously the best straighter ever.</li>
            <li> Pros:  - HUGE titanium plates cover a lot of hair and make my hair super straight and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Heats up quick.</li>
            <li> My straightened came in a decent amount of time and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of different straighteners, but this one has definitely been the best.</li>
            <li> -   It heats up quickly  -   </li>
            <li> I read the reviews about this product&gt; one quick question.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> I did notice that my hair seems to have held a lot more moisture with this particular straightener.</li>
            <li> bigtime!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Heats up quick and works as described.  </li>
            <li> Gets very hot quickly.  </li>
            <li> In the sea of Hot Irons boiling with little money, I searched for the best hot iron for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this one better than any of there newer T-studio flat irons.</li>
            <li> It does get very hot, but you can adjust the temp.  </li>
            <li> I own a Gold N Hot and that works wonders- perfectly straight hair the first time and the plates are flush with one another.   </li>
            <li> I like them very much!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t fry my hair, yet it gets very hot.</li>
            <li> Overall very pleased and would buy again.</li>
            <li> ---that&#x27;s very hot).  </li>
            <li> And I was very satisfied with this product - it has several temperatures, the buttons can be blocked.</li>
            <li> and I always accidentally turn it off in the middle of curling my hair, but I was very pleased that never happened with this straightener.</li>
            <li> the straightener on a heat safe towel when in use, it will help your product and your countertop.&lt;br /&gt;Practice with the different heat settings, you can get some great styles if you know how your hair responds to different temperatures.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought it long time ago and until now still working good.</li>
            <li> As far as the Remington - it&#x27;s OK - nothing special.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several straighteners like an older Conair model, Revlon Perfect Heat Professional 1\\&quot; Ceramic Straightener - RV062C, and even Remington Wet2Straight.</li>
            <li> is the first iron that was able to give me the pin straight look.</li>
            <li> Product is good when you use on dry hair.</li>
            <li> Works better than the chi for sure if you have long hair.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t compare but this product is really easy to use</li>
            <li> It straightened my hair beautifully and left it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Overall, I would buy this again for sure!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair super straight, shiny, and frizz free.</li>
            <li> - can be hot to the touch  - can easily burn your hair if you have the heat setting too hot    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different flat irons &amp; this one is amazing!</li>
            <li> I have spent a long time finding a good flat iron and this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Love the wide plates &amp; really does a nice job straightening curly, course hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener a few years ago, it always works great.</li>
            <li> She says that it leaves her hair smooth &amp; manageable without too much effort.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the temperature control setting, the temp lock, fast heat up, and locking handle.</li>
            <li> After using many straighteners for my thick and wavy hair, i finally found the perfect one.  </li>
            <li> Plus the pink tourmaline makes it cute:)    </li>
            <li> But I think this was worth getting.</li>
            <li> Wish the price was lower but was soooo worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Straightens hair in no time with the wide plates and good heat</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The vast majority of the time, my straightened hair would become wavy if I slept on it, if it got hit with any kind of moisture, or sometimes just as the day went on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying.  </li>
            <li> Definitely was a wise investment and would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> the brown and pink are cute together :)</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t think I would need anything this powerful.  </li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite one yet - and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and straightens very fast</li>
            <li> It seems like others on here have had very positive results,</li>
            <li> Gets super hot</li>
            <li> This flat iron gives me amazing results.</li>
            <li> is about right.</li>
            <li> I always read the reviews of a product before purchasing from amazon, and I have to say the reviews for this product are right on.  </li>
            <li> right-</li>
            <li> all the reviews were right on.</li>
            <li> This is my first flat iron, before this I have always gone to the salon, and I love this one!   </li>
            <li> This product would be amazing if it didn&#x27;t have two major problems: 1-The ceramic plates have minimal buffer from the edges and therefore can burn you very easily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it because the plates are huge, or that it heats up to a really high temperature, or the material of the plates.</li>
            <li> The size of the iron is great for longer hair; mine is just past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> if you hold it at the very end by the \\&quot;grip\\&quot;, it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li> and super fast and super hot in seconds really!.</li>
            <li> I get my whole finished in under half an hour, and I get SO many compliments!!  </li>
            <li> :  Heats up quickly (and to a very high temp.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with it, is that it takes a while to heat up compared to my old one, but that&#x27;s probably why this one works so much better, because it actually heats up to an effective temperature!  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, but a lot of it, and I live in a very humid area very close to the ocean, so my hair always gets frizzy after I wash and blow-dry it.</li>
            <li> but the results are super straight hair that lasts two days.</li>
            <li> It heats up extremely fast and makes the straightening process really quick in the morning.</li>
            <li> My hair lasted all night - and I live in humid Miami!!!</li>
            <li> The straightener heats up SUPER fast and gets extremely hot.</li>
            <li> Straightening is very fast because of the size and heat level that it gives.  </li>
            <li> It heats up very fast, and straigtens my hair with just one go-over.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned it for 2 months now, and so far its working perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the world of flat irons and after much research on what the best features on when looking to purchase a flat iron, I chose the Remington S-9400.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and for a wide iron, is very light and maneuverable.</li>
            <li> cause it&#x27;s too hot and makes the hair burn</li>
            <li> Probably my favorite part is that I only have to pass over each section of hair once.</li>
            <li> it actually added a sexy smooth sheen and a natural flowyness to her hair too.</li>
            <li> Maybe my hair is too short and this iron would be better for longer hair.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it! :)</li>
            <li> The result its fantastic, for me we dont need to buy expensive straightener just to be beautiful try this product and it wont disappoint you...</li>
            <li> it first arrived in the mail, i did not hesitate to try it out.</li>
            <li> -Cant hold the iron too close to the plates because it gets too hot.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair really hot though (like burning my fingers)</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this wouldn&#x27;t be a dude, and it&#x27;s not!  </li>
            <li> It turns my thick frizzy hair into beautiful straight sleek hair.  </li>
            <li> This iron works well to straighten your hair but the handle gets way too hot.</li>
            <li> I had felt the need to update my old conair silver because it felt more as if it was burning my hair and really took a bit of time and repeat passes to make my hair straight.</li>
            <li> I will report back on whether it stood up to the environment:-)    </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn, but it&#x27;s hot.  </li>
            <li> It gets really hot which I like.</li>
            <li> I like that it gets closer to your hair (unlike some like Hot Tools).  </li>
            <li> and I actually like this one much better.</li>
            <li> ;)    </li>
            <li> Does exactly as it should straightens hair</li>
            <li> Dont go to hot</li>
            <li> In order for it to close all the way I had to put my hand onto the iron part which is hot.  </li>
            <li> and although it cost more, i went and ordered another one the very next day.</li>
            <li> I also like that you can increase or decrease in 10 degree increments, so you can get exactly the heat you need</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Use the hair dryer exactly as intended</li>
            <li> At first my hair would get stuck in the sides of this straightener but over time I got used to it.</li>
            <li> that was fast!</li>
            <li> today was my first day using this</li>
            <li> it does get really hot</li>
            <li> I also appreciate the digital adjustment, so you can raise the heat if your hair is more stubborn or lower if your hair is getting fried.</li>
            <li> She seems to be enjoying it, though she&#x27;s only had it for a week.</li>
            <li> I have bought it twice because my first one got ruined in a flood.</li>
            <li> First one lasted 4 years, and she abuses it</li>
            <li> (Purchased in 2010), Digitable adjustable heat and doesn&#x27;t keep your hair too hot.</li>
            <li> The heat is not twice as hot</li>
            <li> Your better off going with a smaller one, it just takes a bit longer.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many flat irons and most of them do not work well on my coarse curly fuzzy hair.  </li>
            <li> Before this flat iron in had bought the kiyosaki flat iron and to me thats another one of the best ones but its not worth paying that much money for hair straightener!!!</li>
            <li> Plus I love the face that you can close the flat iron when you need to store it while its not in use.</li>
            <li> I kind of like it, as any other product it&#x27;s got it&#x27;s pros and cons ...</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair looks and feels with this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Love this Flat Iron..</li>
            <li> I love this 2 1/4 inch flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I took the plunge and got this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron for waist length hair!</li>
            <li> i didnt expect such a high quality straightener for that price: 4 yr warranty!, huge heating plates!</li>
            <li> I have never had straight, volumized, frizz free hair like this without going to a salon and having a professional blow out.</li>
            <li> It does the job easily and does not dry out the hair.</li>
            <li> These plates are really really big, much longer than most plates  </li>
            <li> I expected my hair to have returned to its normal wavy state, but again was pleased to see perfectly straight and frizz free hair.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron so much.</li>
            <li> I travel for work and love this flat iron so much</li>
            <li> OK, We are 3 women with long curly hair in this house.</li>
            <li> I may start flat ironing my hair more often because its so much faster and easier.  </li>
            <li> Not as pin straight, but pretty close.   </li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron only because the good reviews.</li>
            <li> i heard amazing things about fh1 and was about to put down the $400+ for it.  </li>
            <li> But it heats up very quickly and the wide plates make straightening a quick job.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant, because the price was so reasonable, but I talked myself into it and very glad I did.</li>
            <li> But this one, is faster, wider, cheaper in price, and does an amazing job in half of the time.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very satisfied, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> Cons:  While there is a setting that will lock the iron on a set temperature while you work, the placement of the buttons makes it easy to accidentally \\&quot;unlock\\&quot; the temperature control, so you may end up with an entirely different temperature and not know it.  </li>
            <li> I had an older white Revlon model that had the huge gold ceramic plates (that is a GREAT one also but discontinued and really hard to find).  </li>
            <li> BUT the plates are large, which is what I wanted</li>
            <li> It has three heat settings and gets hot fast, which is good for thick hair.</li>
            <li> high chance of rain--a nice, hot 12 hour drive round trip.  </li>
            <li> Also it stays straight all day</li>
            <li> lasts whole day.</li>
            <li> It only takes me 20 minutes to straighten my hair and everytime it looks shiny, smooth, and it doesn&#x27;t look like I have an afro.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair shining and straight.</li>
            <li> I know the whole idea of this straightener is the curved plates that allow you to flip the ends of your hair.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Design of the iron is very sleek and</li>
            <li> Heats up fast</li>
            <li> She loves it so much and praises me for getting it for her.</li>
            <li> but it really didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li> So the result..dead straight, shiny hair in about 15 minutes.    </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this one to anyone!</li>
            <li> But with this straightener, it stayed straight throughout the day.    </li>
            <li> &quot; you can see in the hair, as well as stick straight ends.  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much of a guard around the plates making burns on the scalp and fingers a bit of a problem even for pros    </li>
            <li> I have to use something to hold it with and it is a real problem.</li>
            <li> The time it takes to heat up does depend on your power source, as I have found that it takes much longer to reach the desired temp at places like hotels and airports</li>
            <li> , it gets my hair straight in no time.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go for the day.</li>
            <li> No frizz, just straight silky hair.</li>
            <li> and I really have to used force to flatten them when I use it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> fast even heating  salon quality look  </li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> , everyone now comments that my hair looks so much fuller even though it is now bone straight.  </li>
            <li> Plus, even though I sometimes work in really humid environments, my hair stays straight through all kinds of conditions, even in the rain.</li>
            <li> This straightener makes it SOOOOOOOOOOOO much easier to get my hair done.</li>
            <li> It is fast to heat up and the buttons are in degrees electronically.</li>
            <li> I did not really believe the reviews on here that this flatiron is better than the 100 dollar ones</li>
            <li> It will straighten anything FAST.</li>
            <li> I also love how wide it is.</li>
            <li> how much i like it.&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon, got the item in three days...</li>
            <li> works really well.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> MUCH AND ALL PERFECT.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My daughter had this on her wishlist for her birthday, she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> Heats up really fast and using it once keeps my hair straight for days.</li>
            <li> For someone who wants to upgrade from something that just wasn&#x27;t working anymore, but can&#x27;t afford to invest in a GHD or a CHI</li>
            <li> its wide plates makes your job lot more easier and quicker..</li>
            <li> Thanks, Mom!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Did I mention that I LOVE the brown and pink color scheme??</li>
            <li> Highly recommended and the price is cherry!</li>
            <li> The plates heat up fast and the temperature is salon style up to 410.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it makes my hair more smooth than any other straightener I&#x27;ve tried, and my hair seems to even be less frizzy after I wash it the next day.</li>
            <li> It took me 25 minutes maximum with the S-9400, and my hair has grown out a good 5 inches past my shoulders!</li>
            <li> Also spray your wet hair with a heat protecting flat iron spray for good measure.</li>
            <li> It also seems to be much more gentle on my hair than other straighteners.</li>
            <li> This flat iron has all the right coatings and it heats up great for unruly thick hair.</li>
            <li> It gets super hot, super fast even with slightly damp hair.    </li>
            <li> My other straighteners always pulled my hair causing damage and my hair would have static.</li>
            <li> I like the digital temperature and user friendly keys.  </li>
            <li> Because of this iron, I&#x27;ve bought other Remington products and have been pleased with all of my purchases from them.</li>
            <li> There is also NO REASON to spend more money than this on other brands.  </li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviews below, I bought this at Target because the straightener I went to buy was sold out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s girly but not over the top like other brands.</li>
            <li> Heats up really fast and remains steady as you use the item.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair this is perfect it straightens in about half the time.</li>
            <li> I say, \\&quot;Thank you, Remington, for being sensitive to the trends in hot irons and knowing how to price things</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous other flat irons through the years and this is definitely the best one if you have a lot of wavy or curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I do feel like it&#x27;s easy to burn your scalp with the exposed siding, or even just the expulsion of steam as the plates move, but it just calls to be careful.    </li>
            <li> Does a better job in half the time.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Remington S-9400 straightener, mainly for the price &amp; also based on the rave reviews I found on this site.  </li>
            <li> The sheer size of this one makes straightening go quickly.  </li>
            <li> I bought this unit at Target when I couldn&#x27;t find the Conair my friend recommended mainly because it was on sale.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a expensive one, but after noticing a lot of people claiming that it was worth it to buy this product and also the good price, I decided to get it.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve probably had over 15 and gone through buying them, trying them, and taking them back more than enough times.</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews on many different brands, I determined this was the one.</li>
            <li> that is one of the main reason i bought this one because it can be used worldwide..</li>
            <li> This product is a bit lighter in weight than the older version.</li>
            <li> The older version heats up to 200 and this one goes up to 410.</li>
            <li> but it does feel a bit hotter than the older version.</li>
            <li> It heats up pretty quickly too, and is very convenient to use, especially on long hair!  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and the 2 1/4\\&quot; width of this is perfect, anything smaller in width would take hours to get this type of a result.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li> Also, It&#x27;s cheaper than most of other offers.</li>
            <li> the other thing that i loved about this product is its 2 1/4\\&quot; wide plates....</li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> smooth and shine  Con: a gap between the plate makes it harder to hold the hair        </li>
            <li> my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz or gets curly after a couple hours (or minutes as mi old one)I really like it.</li>
            <li> My hair is not nearly as thick as hers</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first one that I&#x27;ve found that will actually straighten my hair and it stays straight.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and my hair looks great when done.</li>
            <li> The only con is your ends can get really fried if you use while hair is wet    shines hair and makes it look healthy</li>
            <li> I also have the Tstudio collection blow dryer that I love and has lasted me years of everyday use.</li>
            <li> This was had all the same specs, so i decided \\&quot;what the heck, for $30 its worth a shot\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> * twice slow for each section, dont put to much hair in it, make sure it can close properly, i do four sections starting at the bottom and work my way to the top.</li>
            <li> Nice thick plates</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe that it cut my hair styling time in more than half!</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s not hard at all-</li>
            <li> I bought it at Target for $39.99, significantly less than the cost of more &#x27;professional&#x27; straighteners.    </li>
            <li> I have thick, curly/wavy hair, and this straightener works really smoothly and quickly.</li>
            <li> I have fine, mostly straight hair with just a little wave to it.</li>
            <li> I usually have to turn the heat up super high on most flat irons, but not this one!  </li>
            <li> This flat iron warms up pretty fast</li>
            <li> I really have nothing to compare this iron to, as it is my first ceramic flat iron.</li>
            <li> It would probably be too big for someone with fine or short hair though.  </li>
            <li> With such a large iron and fast heating</li>
            <li> I am in the process of looking for a new one.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a new iron to replace the one I had for like 6 years.</li>
            <li> and I live in the Caribbean where it&#x27;s always humid</li>
            <li> well, her name isn&#x27;t repunzel, but she sure has long hair, so when she straitens it, it takes a long time.</li>
            <li> : sleek design, lightweight, digital temperature setting (up to 430 F), lock feature to keep the product closed when not in use, swivel cord, x-large plates for more coverage and quicker prep time, heats up within 30 seconds, automatic shut off&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the wide plates as it definitely speeds things up.</li>
            <li> My hair stayed straight all day, into the night and was still straight the next morning!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it died especially when I wasn&#x27;t using it as often, letting my hair go naturally wavy for a while, but it died right after my mom gave me a new haircut</li>
            <li> The new one worked exactly the same, and I have had it for a year now.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair which I put lots of product on before, so this is just fabulous that I only had to send 15 blow drying, then 5 minutes to straight iron</li>
            <li> her smooth silky hair is now all straight and tame without needing alot of product to make her all helmet headed.</li>
            <li> Ive owned a wigo before and this one beats it by far!</li>
            <li> Then about 3 months later, i noticed that it didnt get as hot as it used to.</li>
            <li> The end result, my hair was transformed from frizzy and tangled (due to sleeping on the curls from the night before) into a  fresh, sleek pin straight do.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It heats up pretty fast and your hair gets DEAD STRAIGHT after passing the iron just once!</li>
            <li> know - the roots are usually the coarsest &amp; need straightening the most.  </li>
            <li> The outside of the device also got way too hot when pressing together to straighten &amp; burned my fingers.  </li>
            <li> Digital display means you know exactly what temperature you are using on your hair.  </li>
            <li> The outside of the appliance doesn&#x27;t get hot  </li>
            <li> There is such thing as too hot, people, and the Chi</li>
            <li> I have a pink BedHead flat iron I used before then and decided to return this and just keep using the one I had before as it worked much better.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say am not sure if those people were dreaming or if they have just never used better products</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t get hot enough and the plates don&#x27;t go all the way to the end.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to straighten my hair so many times and tried numerous creams and sprays to tame the frizz and keep it straight.</li>
            <li> Has to put very little effort into getting straight hair and it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> I compared this iron to the Chi and other flat irons and the Remington comes out on top.</li>
            <li> My daughter swore by Hot tools and then she tried my Remington Flat Iron and i had to buy her one of these too</li>
            <li> This is my first flat iron and it works as well as my sister&#x27;s Chi.</li>
            <li> Smooth and shiny with no special products.</li>
            <li> I had a really good flat iron that finally quit working, but due to the price, it wasn&#x27;t feasible for me to replace it with the same model.  </li>
            <li> then her Hot Tool Flat Iron!</li>
            <li> If you are clumsy like me, just make sure to be super careful.</li>
            <li> Only problem is getting the roots since it is so large.</li>
            <li> This straightener does a much better job and takes a lot less time -- I don&#x27;t have to redo the back of my head ten times like I did before because I could never get it straight</li>
            <li> Now, before reading any negative reviews (their aren&#x27;t many though)....keep in mind that it doesn&#x27;t make sense to complain that a flat iron burns your hair or is so hot &amp; burns your fingers.</li>
            <li> I would have gladly purchased the same flat iron if I could, but it&#x27;s long been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The temp variations is a real plus so everyone from fine hair to thick hair like myself can use it.     </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it still doesn&#x27;t get my hair as shiny and straight as my old H2Pro.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re ironing your hair with direct heat and, thus, burning it.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft &amp; shiny every time.</li>
            <li> i bought this just in time for her birthday, and even let her have it a day early</li>
            <li> The only thing worth nothing is if you have a short fringe, you may not be able to use this one on it, as the hair strands have to be at least two inches.  </li>
            <li> am replacing my 3 yr old rusty 1 1/2 inch Revlon hair straightener.</li>
            <li> I transitioned to natural hair (no chemicals), but still need to straigthen my hair for job interviews etc,.  </li>
            <li> The real test was to see if my hair actually remained that way.</li>
            <li> Also, DO NOT let this iron anywhere near your scalp.  </li>
            <li> I read all the reviews before purchasing it, but I&#x27;ve had no trouble with the iron burning my fingers-</li>
            <li> Thats why I used directly in my country.</li>
            <li> I have a spot near my scalp where I got too close and burned my skin.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to the digital readout</li>
            <li> old daughter</li>
            <li> I tend to wear my hair up a lot after showers so the next day it gets very curly and wavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 3 years thus far</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy, coarse, and wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I would not waste $100</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s a mother of two young children</li>
            <li> It has not dried out or damaged my hair at all.  </li>
            <li> Daughter wanted a straightener and has used it nearly every day since.  </li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this straightener if it wasn&#x27;t for my adult daughter.  </li>
            <li> Make my hair soft and shinny after i used it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it frequently</li>
            <li> I have a LOT of thick wavy hair and this straightener gives me silky smooth straight hair within FIFTEEN minutes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get hot enough; not hot enough fast enough; not user friendly.</li>
            <li> After using it for a few months my hair was in such better condition.</li>
            <li> We already tried Corioliss, which is good but not awesome.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick coarse and abundant.</li>
            <li> Cord is an adequate length (not too short, not too long)    </li>
            <li> It took me less than half the time to do my whole head and it looks much more professional.  </li>
            <li> right away i did tried on dump and wet hair.</li>
            <li> This iron straightens my hair and makes it shiny and silky without having to blow dry first.</li>
            <li> I bought it when my old flat iron (which cost almost 3 times as much) broke.</li>
            <li> I usually just flatten out the top part of my hair to make it really glossy and to tame the little curly hairs on top.</li>
            <li> chi silk infusion also leaves a fantastic smell on your hair..its way better than those expensive branded flat irons like sedu, solia which just takes all the hype!!</li>
            <li> Best Uses: Straight Hair, Frizzy Hair, Humid Conditions, Long Hair, Curly Hair, Thick Hair, Thin Hair  Bottom Line:</li>
            <li> Very irritating with our a really good tool.  </li>
            <li> So if you are looking for a flat iron that heats up fast and has an automatic shout off</li>
            <li> A very well made flat iron.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is a miracle worker (and the CHI straight guard too</li>
            <li> This flat iron works very well for straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> one of the features I really wanted in a flat iron was the ability to lock in the temperature I set.  </li>
            <li> - flat iron is gentle on my hair - doesn&#x27;t yank on my head or make my hair break off  </li>
            <li> I have super thick, long hair that will go right back to wavy if I get hot, or get rained on.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m in my twenties and did some extensive research for a new straightener, for almost a month!</li>
            <li> According to the beauty blogs and the \\&quot;expert opinions\\&quot;, plus reading what other purchasers have written, I found the desirable features of Ceramic with Tourmaline plate (to prevent frizzing and better for your hair), adjustable temperatures up to 430 degrees, auto shut off, and larger than 1 3/4 inches for long hair.</li>
            <li> the quality of materials is high so this iron will last.</li>
            <li> I did my hair in about 15 mins, I had pin straight results and my hair felt much smoother, and had less frizz compared to my conair.</li>
            <li> I had the older version and could not find a replacement that had the wide plates or the high heat.</li>
            <li> I have huge curly hair and it straightens my hair in 45 mins when usually its like a 2 hr process.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair so smooth with no static</li>
            <li> Exactly what was expected.</li>
            <li> but here I am today writing this review several weeks later with the same smile on my face.     </li>
            <li> The very first day I was impressed with its speed and smoothness since I am often let down by straighteners that fail to handle my wavy thick hair.</li>
            <li> I also have their small curling wand, large curling wand and hot rollers in this pink/brown pearl style.</li>
            <li> this would be ok if you don&#x27;t mind how hard it is to pull hair through the plates, but for short hair or shoulder length</li>
            <li> This straightener keeps it straight and silky all day long!</li>
            <li> I have very long, very wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, so the Remington straightener really holds up to the job.</li>
            <li> The first time i tried to use it, i could barely hold it because when you heat it up, the entire flat iron heats up!</li>
            <li> It takes me 15-20 minutes, which is a solid time but not as fast as I had hoped with the big plates.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY thick and curly hair (think Curly Sue or Shirley Temple) and this straightener had no problem making my hair extremely soft, smooth, touchable and shiny.</li>
            <li> the job done for the most part- but would not recommend to someone who has thick hair as you have to straighten numerous times in one spot.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty thick wavy hair, and I have tried about a dozen hair straigteners in my life, some pretty pricey, and non of them compare to the Remington.  </li>
            <li> pretty- the plates are pink!   </li>
            <li> and I thought no other straightener could beat its performance until I tried this straightener.</li>
            <li> - HOT digital temperature guage (I only need about 390 degrees and have coarse hair - and it goes even hotter than that)  </li>
            <li> Its so sleek look too, and with the wide plates it make straightening my long thick hair easy and fun.</li>
            <li> This week, it died and so I needed to go out and buy a new flat iron.</li>
            <li> GENERAL:  </li>
            <li> She would tell you her hair is generally unmanageable.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m back to my old iron.     </li>
            <li> Going back to my old straightener.</li>
            <li> Completely blows my last straigthener out of the water.</li>
            <li> Also, it has quite wide plates - very convenient.</li>
            <li> The result is fantastic.just one time action is enough to have silky hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener because my old, trusty H2Pro was falling apart after being dropped and overall wear and tear.</li>
            <li> I was able to straighten my long layered thick tresses in under 20 miniutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too hot, I always have to turn it down.</li>
            <li> And let me warn you that this flat iron gets hot and it can be hard to hold the end of the plates together when you need to but it can be done if you don&#x27;t get too close to the hot spot.</li>
            <li> The plates heat up very well, the heat setting locks and can&#x27;t be changed or turned off by accident as in some other products (such as the Conair Infiniti straightener), there is virtually no static and the end result is silky and smooth hair.</li>
            <li> Since i was 13 I&#x27;ve had trouble finding the right straighter....</li>
            <li> I previously was using a hot tools iron that i had borrowed from a friend.  </li>
            <li> , that is fine, and it is hard to find a straightener that will actually make it go the way I want it to.</li>
            <li> I usually use irons on the highest setting (my old iron went up to 410 degrees), but that same temp on this iron was far too hot, to the risk of burning the ends.</li>
            <li> as far as flat irons go)  </li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning my hair is a hot mess.  </li>
            <li> with my old flat iron.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this product due to all the positive reviews i read about it.</li>
            <li> Wet to silky straight takes about 25 minutes total if you follow this advice.</li>
            <li> Now, two and a half years later it still performs as well as it did when I first bought it.</li>
            <li> If not hot enough, it won&#x27;t straighten your hair or keep it straight</li>
            <li> It used to take me 15 minutes to get my hair straight with other products and this one only takes about 5.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that you have to be careful when you are holding it because when you are gripping the handle, you can accidentally change the heat settings.</li>
            <li> I have long thick full hair that is naturally wavy</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical with purchasing this product, partly because it was so inexpensive, I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work good.  </li>
            <li> It heated up fast, it made my hair completely straight in one go (and it had already dried curly at the time of my test...really hard to get it very straight once it has dried curly normally)!</li>
            <li> am suprised (and lucky) that this straightener is priced so affordably, especially since it is in the same league (if not better)</li>
            <li> This gets my hair sooo much straighter and silkier than the Chi did, and uses less time to straighten.  </li>
            <li> now I can let my hair dry naturally and just use the straightener and don&#x27;t have to do anything for a couple days.  </li>
            <li> They always break or dry out my hair completely.</li>
            <li> How long does the straightened hair last How frequently do u have to straighten your hair?</li>
            <li> You sort of have to push the plates together a few times before actually straightening, it caught my hair the first couple of times till I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I liked the wide plates, but it was very difficult to reach the root of the hair, which as those of us with very kinky curly hair</li>
            <li> My main problem with it is that it does not close all the way down on my hair at the point closest to the \\&quot;handle\\&quot; of the iron.  </li>
            <li> Altough I want my hair as straight as possible, I also want some body to it and a little healthy-looking curl at the ends.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and has cut my time down to half as opposed to other straighteners.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair and finding the right straightener is a chore.</li>
            <li> Since, it heats up quick and evenly, my entire hair gets done in half the time than my former straighteners.&lt;br /&gt;A few things to remember: read the booklet so you can know the proper care of the straightener, it will lengthen the life of the product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After several people telling me the only flat iron to buy is a Chi, I decided to give this one a try.  </li>
            <li> Everything you need is in the flat iron, no need to spend 100&#x27;s on more expensive ones it what you do with it that counts.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it does take a long time to heat up, but it&#x27;s definitely worth waiting an extra minute or so to use it.</li>
            <li> With a traditional (smaller) flat iron, it took me two hours!  </li>
            <li> and im the only one from my family that has thick, frizzy, dry, and hard to manage kind of hair</li>
            <li> I like how I could use this flat iron on bigger sections of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a flat iron that I didn&#x27;t have to pass over my hair several times.</li>
            <li> actually bought this flat iron at Target and got to use it this morning.</li>
            <li> Compared to my last flat iron, this one just seems to glide through my hair easier.</li>
            <li> THE ONLY complain is there is not a pouch or bag or holder wich can hold 2 1/4\\&quot; flat iron.</li>
            <li> However, after going over and over my head with my smaller, less quality straightener, I decided to try hers (this one) and WOW!  </li>
            <li> I was in the market for a new straightener and typically purchase mine at Ulta 3.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s long (mid back)</li>
            <li> Also, it gets extremely hot (430 degrees), which is necessary for thick hair like mine.  </li>
            <li> -  When in high settings, it&#x27;s hard to &#x27;clamp down&#x27; on the front tips of the iron without my fingers suffering the consequences of the intense heat.  </li>
            <li> so she has very little time to get ready.</li>
            <li> That is no biggie though cause I still like the flat iron.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a flat iron in the world that won&#x27;t damage your hair at all.</li>
            <li> However, I went to Target and got this Remington flat iron</li>
            <li> flat iron is the holy grail for ones beauty arsenal.</li>
            <li> So for this flat iron to cost $30</li>
            <li> I got this flat iron and immediately tried it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never trying another flat iron</li>
            <li> It heats up in 30 seconds flat.  </li>
            <li> and this flat iron tames my hair in no time.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for irons and have long enough hair to use this width, get this iron!</li>
            <li> My flat iron arrived yesterday.</li>
            <li> My sister borrowed my flat iron when she came to visit me and forgot hers</li>
            <li> I got this Remington Flat Iron for my niece, and she loves it.</li>
            <li> and then flat iron...</li>
            <li> I would recommend this remmington flat iron to a friend.</li>
            <li> However, It&#x27;s well made in my opinion, but this is for long hairs, not for short or mid-length hair.</li>
            <li> I have owned the T-Studio S-9400 flat iron for about 7 yrs</li>
            <li> I WILL NEVER USE ANOTHER BRAND FOR A FLAT IRON.</li>
            <li> reviewing after 2yr of purchase, shows that this product works and last long too.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and got it because it is larger</li>
            <li> -I have thick, wavy hair and had to straighten my hair numerous times in the same spot for it to be completely straight.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair</li>
            <li> Also the plates are hard to keep together, much pushing is involved to actually straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THIS FLAT IRON!</li>
            <li> Spend your money on another flat iron!  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that if you accidently burn yourself with it , you really burn yourself.</li>
            <li> I was usually left with dry hair at the end of it.</li>
            <li> The only con I would say is (depending on the temperature setting you use), it is possible to burn yourself so please be careful.</li>
            <li> Ever since I was in middle school, it was tough to find a hair straightener that did the job right; without causing damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> In the past, I would have to blow dry my hair straight and use a flat iron to make it straighter/silky.</li>
            <li> , I used to have a Remington flat iron a long time ago</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll be using this flat iron for a long time!</li>
            <li> I bought this iron shortly after my black Chi flat iron just suddenly didn&#x27;t go on anymore, after having it for two years.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that my hair smells burnt...but other then that i love it!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand the basis for the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Because it is so cheap, I thought the quality might be questionable.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair (which hangs till the mid-back)</li>
            <li> It feels and looks professional, not cheap at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this iron for the larger plates, but after only a few uses and burning myself several times, it sits in the drawer unused</li>
            <li> I would not recommend for long term use.</li>
            <li> The plates do not fit completely together as one reviewer mentioned, but it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, it&#x27;s wavy, and I have a lot of it.</li>
            <li> 4 year warranty is unusually long- look</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and not a lot of time to get ready in the morning</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair that has been really processed, and it looks shiny even after ironing.</li>
            <li> I have previously used much more expensive straighteners and they have not worked as well as this.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a flat iron before, so I can&#x27;t compare this to any other flat iron.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also no way to have a small tool heat up enough to straighten your hair effectively &amp; not have the outside of the plates be hot to the touch.</li>
            <li> The other thing I didn&#x27;t like was that the plates are square - which make for occasional \\&quot;lines\\</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this as long as I did!  </li>
            <li> , now I have a straightener that is here for the long haul!</li>
            <li> My hair is very long, all the way to my butt and this straightener handles my hair with ease.  </li>
            <li> If you have short hair it probably won&#x27;t work because it is very wide</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair silky and shiny even if it was dry before you straightened  </li>
            <li> I did let it air dry though.)</li>
            <li> Then take them out and dry the rest of your hair with the dryer.</li>
            <li> Seriously wash and then blow dry  still straight.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener even though it was a little expensive, because I was so tired of ones that would keep my hair straight for a few hours but then start going back to normal - and it is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> This flat iron allows me to sleep in a little later.  </li>
            <li> she hasn&#x27;t had a single split end in the months now that she&#x27;s been using it, and she uses it two to three times a week.</li>
            <li> If you have shoulder-length or longer hair, it&#x27;s easiest to put your hair in two ponytails (one behind each ear) and dry the ponytails first using this dryer.</li>
            <li> This one makes it look like my hair is professionally done, everyday!  </li>
            <li> I researched and used a few different flat irons before deciding on this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely getting one for the women in my life who complain their flat irons are useless!! :)))</li>
            <li> Even then I loose volume at the roots which I want.     </li>
            <li> you must hold the power button down for several seconds to turn it on or off)  </li>
            <li> The only \\&quot;con\\&quot; I can say is be careful!!  </li>
            <li> I used it for a few months but do not have time to fuss with this problem, I have very little time to get ready in the morning.</li>
            <li> The outside of the unit DOES get too hot to press together, but again, it works so well without pressing the plates together manually that it&#x27;s irrelevant.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, naturally curly (3b/3c) hair.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt recommend this for people with thin hair because you&#x27;d have to clamp pretty hard to straighten your hair completely.  </li>
            <li> This one takes about 15 TOTAL to go from frizzy mess to sleek and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to handle at first, due to I&#x27;m not use to using curling irons or styling products and</li>
            <li> Since mine had died the morning before and I have not gone a single morning in about 10 years without straightening my hair, a purchase was required!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used flat irons in the past (and even visited salons to have my hair flat ironed) and it usually stays dead straight for about 2 seconds before returning to the wavy frizz    </li>
            <li> Every product has some flaws but the flaws with this iron are not significant enough to sway me away from rating it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This may not be a problem for everyone but having two major surgeries on my arms/chest in the past year, I find myself having to take a break to rest my arms.  </li>
            <li> I previously owned a Sedu flat iron</li>
            <li> Every time my wife starts to straighten her huge bundle of hair, the hair straightener whine used to get me crazy.</li>
            <li> but it was really damaging to my hair, and my last 3 straighteners were useless.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> GF loves it and does the job as expected.</li>
            <li> But with wet hair,it is not as staright as the product claim.</li>
            <li> I thought the wide plates would make my time faster</li>
            <li> Plates are wide</li>
            <li> The only downfall I have found is that is is heavy.  </li>
            <li> yes when I wasn&#x27;t careful I did get the unit end to close to my head and got a burn.</li>
            <li> 2-The lack of a built-in (or detachable) comb makes it much harder for thicker hair to be straightened.</li>
            <li> can literally burn your hair off if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> I have tried a Chi and a Solia (those expensive ones that get all the hype) as well as several regular name brand ones including a Conair one (that worked alright) and the wet2straight one (that worked well, but would not last hours later) and nothing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really wide than I tought.  </li>
            <li> closed</li>
            <li> i just wish that it could be used with wet hair, but it cannot.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s expensive but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Be careful with not placing the iron too close to the scalp.</li>
            <li> and i definitely i recommend it to girls with frizzy and thick hair because it will definitely get it under control.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, coarse hair that sometimes requires several passes in order to get it tamed.</li>
            <li> But I did get to close to my skin and burnt my self just a little bit since there isn&#x27;t a buffer between the plates and the edge of the flat iron.</li>
            <li> Then when finished, spray a glossing spray on your dry hair and rub it down.</li>
            <li> Only minor complaint here is that the temperature buttons are where you hold the straightener, and I sometimes accidentally change the temp.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY thick, long, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> My granddaughters hair is very long, very very thick and has natural curl.  </li>
            <li> After showering, towel dry hair, and put the silk drops on your ends (don&#x27;t use too much---this will take a few tries).</li>
            <li> so be careful!</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s pink!</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, curly, frizzy hair, and with my old straightner, it would take at least 45 minutes the night before, along with another 45 minutes the next morning.  </li>
            <li> This was just like any other iron.  </li>
            <li> My other one was a Remington Wet2Dry-</li>
            <li> so be careful!</li>
            <li> and it worked extremely well on my hair, also.  </li>
            <li> Had to send it back :S not recommended</li>
            <li> I have wavy thin hair naturally and this worked wonders!</li>
            <li> I have used Maxius Maxiglide flat iron for the past 5 yrs</li>
            <li> It usually takes me about 45 minutes to flat iron it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad, especially since the temperature controls are right where you grab the iron to use it, so you can inadvertently raise or lower the temperature while you&#x27;re working on your hair.  </li>
            <li> Take care of your hair; condition it, don&#x27;t press the plates together too hard, and try to pass over strands of hair only once.</li>
            <li> i have really coarse wavy hair that is hard to straighten.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;(love that the iron is a dark chocolate brown and pink)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> the only complaint is that your hand sometimes changes the degrees while you are using it.</li>
            <li> This iron was recommended to me by my sister who also has very coarse thick hair like myself.</li>
            <li> someone with thick, coarse, or curly hair could turn it way up.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, very long hair, and usually when I straighten my hair it takes nearly an hour to finish up...</li>
            <li> It says to hold down the \\&quot;+\\&quot; button till the lock icon appears, then hold the \\&quot;-\\&quot; to turn it off.  </li>
            <li> (so you don&#x27;t accidentally burn down your house)  </li>
            <li> Wish they ahd put a plastic tip to help with the clamping down process.    </li>
            <li> I can turn it way down (</li>
            <li> Hands down</li>
            <li> you do have to hold the power button down for a couple seconds before the unit turns on.</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t let you down.</li>
            <li> so you can pack it away before it cools down    Cons:  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m never using any other products...ever!</li>
            <li> done in half the time.</li>
            <li> But I can get my hair done in less then 10 mins in the morning.</li>
            <li> She loves it and said it has cut the time in half that it takes for her to straighten her hair.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for this one and at less that $30</li>
            <li> so you spend less time straightening    </li>
            <li> It cut my hair time in half.</li>
            <li> I previously had a Remington</li>
            <li> It makes straightening my hair take much less time.  </li>
            <li> (I consider this a pro as my hair is thick and long and this cuts down on styling time)  </li>
            <li> then the high end expensive</li>
            <li> If I have been hanging out in my PJ&#x27;s and hair a mess all day &amp; my friends call to pick me up in 15</li>
            <li> (I have really long thick wavy hair).</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s got thick, wavy, long hair.</li>
            <li> With this flat iron, it took LESS than 15 minutes!!!</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone on a tight budget like myself.</li>
            <li> Until i washed it 4 days later (it probably would have stayed straight longer but it was getting a bit stinky :( )    </li>
            <li> she complained about her whimpy 1&#x27;&#x27; wide steel iron up and down one day, and i listened.</li>
            <li> The straightener indeed seems a little faster with ionic.  </li>
            <li> I saw a couple negative reviews which seemed weird compared to all the positive ones..</li>
            <li> Hard to straighten because its so big and hard to get underneath your hair.</li>
            <li> Only takes about 10-15 minutes this way (and I have VERY thick curly hair).     </li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair, and it took me 35 minutes to do my entire head!  </li>
            <li> No reason to spend $100+ on other straighteners!!</li>
            <li> hands hurts after a while, can get a lil heavy..</li>
            <li> and I almost use it everyday.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been using this everyday, for about a year, and loves it.</li>
            <li> I had a Vidal Sassoon 2 1/4\\&quot; ceramic straightener that I used religiously everyday for 6 years.</li>
            <li> Both times I did not enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> It is not too heavy and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that problem, being bald, but I remembered that a few times, my sister in law would straighten her hair</li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;ll write again in a few months after seeing it work a while.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t dried out anymore.</li>
            <li> Since it was right before Christmas too, this was bad timing.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair, and flat ironing</li>
            <li> With this one it takes less than 15!</li>
            <li> My hair got caught in the plates a few times and it was not easy to pull my hair through the plates even though tourmaline is supposed to be the easiest in regards to that aspect.  </li>
            <li> It works wonders and performs miracles for a bad hair day and eliminates the necessity to have to use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Users be advised, this iron heats up and gets really hot.</li>
            <li> I needed a new one desperately</li>
            <li> Or someone less clumsy.    </li>
            <li> She couldn&#x27;t believe how little it cost and worked like a charm!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African-American and my hair is thick with tight ringlets, and after blow drying</li>
            <li> Buttons are not able to be accidentally turned off or readjusted (example:</li>
            <li> i use it no more</li>
            <li> it usually takes about 45 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Now, I don&#x27;t feel lazy whenever I need to straighten it.</li>
            <li> With the tourmaline plates, my hair seems to be healthier and not as damaged as in the past.</li>
            <li> My friends have spent over a $100 on the big name brands and they have all been disappointed when they broke in less than a years time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never invested in an expensive flat iron and was considering one by CHI  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sorry to say it is NOT the flat iron is it probably you.</li>
            <li> Works as well as an expensive flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have to use small sections of hair and go over each part at least twice</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and always thought I needed to buy those skinny expensive straightners</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard finding a straightener that does what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> which the Remington had and for a price that was hard to argue with.</li>
            <li> I think this is a big scam selling damaged items, it&#x27;s disappointment</li>
            <li> Skinny straighteners never worked, thick ones would rip my hair out.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve got thick wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have medium thick, rigorously curly hair.</li>
            <li> i have thick course hair</li>
            <li> If you have hair shorter then your shoulders, buy the one inch, this is to thick</li>
            <li> so my hair is thick at the moment.</li>
            <li> Use the Remington T3 Tourmaline flatiron on 410 degrees (don&#x27;t pull it through too slowly</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair you should try it.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, wavy, and frizzy &amp;</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair</li>
            <li> I mean I never knew a gift like this</li>
            <li> With all the other straighteners I use, my hair just gets all frizzy and weird looking and eventually turns wavy.</li>
            <li> No more dial!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable, I tell you!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with THICK, CURLY, Hard the straighten hair!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately that&#x27;s what happened with the CHI, resulting in me chopping off quite a few inches.  </li>
            <li> Later, I was shocked to receive a ton of compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how much it SUCKS!</li>
            <li> so i decided i would once again get a remington and the dumb thing</li>
            <li> Very hard to manage.</li>
            <li> but i was greatly disappointed with this flat iron.    </li>
            <li> I have very thick har</li>
            <li> i have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I did use this product on the hightest setting and gradually decreased the temperature.</li>
            <li> Alas this one is not for my hair.</li>
            <li> I brought it to London with me and it blew out and was broken.</li>
            <li> The item came broken and did not work, its not great quality.</li>
            <li> seriously get this when on sale!.</li>
            <li> this is not ideal.</li>
            <li> The instructions on how to use the lock function were printed wrong though.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they also means they&#x27;re exposed and you have no protection against them.    </li>
            <li> I purchased one before this that was around the same price that was horrible and did nothing, I was so disapointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with this item.</li>
            <li> am i doing something wrong?</li>
            <li> She has been disappointed in all she&#x27;s owned in the past.</li>
            <li> No need to buy a really expensive one...</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> This flat iron was the worst one I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> Damages Hair, Bulky, Leaves hair smelling bad  </li>
            <li> This is especially annoying after 20 minutes of straightening your hair- your hands start to get tired.</li>
            <li> I am a bit disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> I also had this straighter: [...]  </li>
            <li> I started looking and ordered one from amazon that was horrible.</li>
            <li> I went on my trip and the hair stood up to the nasty weather.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to pay an outrageous price...</li>
            <li> and it leaves my hair smelling awful!</li>
            <li> I hate this straightner!</li>
            <li> but the hair dryer is horrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this flat iron so much. I like how I could use this flat iron on bigger sections of my hair. So because of that it only took me 10 t o 20 minutes to straighten all of my hair. I like how you can lock the temperature button so you don&#x27;t accidentally change the temperature while I am straightening my hair.  But I did get to close to my skin and burnt my self just a little bit since there isn&#x27;t a buffer between the plates and the edge of the flat iron. That is no biggie though cause I still like the flat iron. When I am done straightening my hair its nice and silky an straight. Plus I love the face that you can close the flat iron when you need to store it while its not in use. And let me warn you that this flat iron gets hot and it can be hard to hold the end of the plates together when you need to but it can be done if you don&#x27;t get too close to the hot spot. This flat iron warms up pretty fast that by the time I&#x27;ve got my hair in the sections that I need its already heated up to the temperature that I need it to be at. So if you are looking for a flat iron that heats up fast and has an automatic shout off just in cause you forget to turn it off then this is for you. I love this one better than any of there newer T-studio flat irons. Plus it has a swivel cord that is always good. My boyfriend bought this for me off here from his account.</li>
            <li> I kind of like it, as any other product it&#x27;s got it&#x27;s pros and cons ... perfect heat works on all kinds of hair,makes my hair fast, but my hands get burnt every time I use it cause it&#x27;s too hot and makes the hair burn</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different flat irons &amp; this one is amazing! Looks just like the salon jobs. Great price too! I wish it was easier to flip my hair under BUT the plates are large, which is what I wanted so it&#x27;s to be expected. Now, before reading any negative reviews (their aren&#x27;t many though)....keep in mind that it doesn&#x27;t make sense to complain that a flat iron burns your hair or is so hot &amp; burns your fingers. If not hot enough, it won&#x27;t straighten your hair or keep it straight &amp; then people complain about that. There&#x27;s also no way to have a small tool heat up enough to straighten your hair effectively &amp; not have the outside of the plates be hot to the touch. Try holding the handle, not the plates...it helps! ANYTHING HOT WILL BURN YOUR HAIR!!! You&#x27;re ironing your hair with direct heat and, thus, burning it. There isn&#x27;t a flat iron in the world that won&#x27;t damage your hair at all. Take care of your hair; condition it, don&#x27;t press the plates together too hard, and try to pass over strands of hair only once. This flat iron gives me amazing results. My hair is soft &amp; shiny every time. Also it stays straight all day (I work 12 hour shifts &amp; look the same at the end as I did in the beginning). Probably my favorite part is that I only have to pass over each section of hair once. Use it like you&#x27;re supposed to &amp; you&#x27;ll be happy!</li>
            <li> After using many straighteners for my thick and wavy hair, i finally found the perfect one.  It&#x27;s easy to use and has cut my time down to half as opposed to other straighteners.  It does get very hot, but you can adjust the temp.  Try to avoid the side plates and use only the handle,  For the price you cannot beat this deal.  It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> Amazing results. Love the way my hair looks and feels with this flat iron. Awesome price. You would think this would cost more than it did when you see the end results. So excited!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have owned several straightening irons in my life. I have owned \\&quot;designer\\&quot; brands and store brands such as conair. This iron was recommended to me by my sister who also has very coarse thick hair like myself. I have never had straight, volumized, frizz free hair like this without going to a salon and having a professional blow out. Even then I loose volume at the roots which I want.     If you are having ANY doubts about this iron GET IT!! You will not regret it. Sooooooooooooo happy with it and the quality of materials is high so this iron will last. Plus the pink tourmaline makes it cute:)    There is a digital face plate wich shows you what temp it is at or when it is heating up. The temp variations is a real plus so everyone from fine hair to thick hair like myself can use it.     Happy straightening!!!</li>
            <li> It is a very good product with the type of settings my wife needs. It has three heat settings and gets hot fast, which is good for thick hair.</li>
            <li> pro: heats up real fast, straightens hairs really good. lasts whole day. smooth and shine  Con: a gap between the plate makes it harder to hold the hair        hands hurts after a while, can get a lil heavy..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the price on this straightener.  It works like one that is $100.  Heats up quickly and works better than any one I have ever used.  Get this product!</li>
            <li> This was a great buy!  I was planning on spending way more for a straightener, but the reviews for this one were so good I decided to give it a try and I&#x27;m glad I did.  It&#x27;s fantastic!  I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair!  It doesn&#x27;t pull or snag my hair, and leaves it perfectly silky, shiny and smooth.  The only issue I have with it, is that it takes a while to heat up compared to my old one, but that&#x27;s probably why this one works so much better, because it actually heats up to an effective temperature!  The buttons are positioned where you may press them while using it, but there&#x27;s a lock function so it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.  The instructions on how to use the lock function were printed wrong though.  It says to hold down the \\&quot;+\\&quot; button till the lock icon appears, then hold the \\&quot;-\\&quot; to turn it off.  Pressing \\&quot;+\\&quot; sets it to turbo heat.  Holding the \\&quot;-\\&quot; button turns the lock both on and off.  Overall I am very satisfied, especially for the price.  I highly recommend it. Great product!</li>
            <li> well, her name isn&#x27;t repunzel, but she sure has long hair, so when she straitens it, it takes a long time. she complained about her whimpy 1&#x27;&#x27; wide steel iron up and down one day, and i listened. guess some guys can hear a good present idea when it presents itself. i bought this just in time for her birthday, and even let her have it a day early so she could use it before her birthday party. she loved it so much she almost cried. perfect! this thing works great for the money. better yet, price or not, it works great. her smooth silky hair is now all straight and tame without needing alot of product to make her all helmet headed. it actually added a sexy smooth sheen and a natural flowyness to her hair too. she hasn&#x27;t had a single split end in the months now that she&#x27;s been using it, and she uses it two to three times a week. buy it because even the chi branded ones dont have the digital temp adjust, which is awesome.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY thick, long, coarse hair.  Skinny straighteners never worked, thick ones would rip my hair out.  This one makes it look like my hair is professionally done, everyday!  It only takes me 20 minutes to straighten my hair and everytime it looks shiny, smooth, and it doesn&#x27;t look like I have an afro.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to all of my friends, you need to get it too!</li>
            <li> Love this Flat Iron..My daughter swore by Hot tools and then she tried my Remington Flat Iron and i had to buy her one of these too, she liked it Better then her Hot Tool Flat Iron! Easy to work with..Works Wonderful!</li>
            <li> This flat iron has all the right coatings and it heats up great for unruly thick hair. Just becareful it does heat up alot. Love it! done in half the time.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter after her last straightener broke.  She thinks this one is really good, gets hot quickly and does a good job.</li>
            <li> This straightener is seriously the best straighter ever. ever. It leaves my hair so smooth with no static i couldnt be happier with the straightener. Its so sleek look too, and with the wide plates it make straightening my long thick hair easy and fun.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener.  It&#x27;s the first one that I&#x27;ve found that will actually straighten my hair and it stays straight.  I like the automatic turn-off feature in case I were to leave it on.  Great product and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> It works really nice! Its still alittle bit frizzy, but not alot at all, it keeps my hair in place all day and it stays really nice, and it was hot today! The only bad thing is that my hair smells burnt...but other then that i love it!</li>
            <li> Good buy, I really like this item because it helps me fix my hair as in i went to the salon. I hope amazon can ship their items in the Philippines so it is easier for me to order products.</li>
            <li> This is my first flat iron, before this I have always gone to the salon, and I love this one!   I have long hair (which hangs till the mid-back) and I get done with it in 20 min. It heats up pretty quickly too, and is very convenient to use, especially on long hair!  The only thing worth nothing is if you have a short fringe, you may not be able to use this one on it, as the hair strands have to be at least two inches.  All in all, a great buy. Leaves my hair shining and straight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a flat iron before, so I can&#x27;t compare this to any other flat iron. But I think this was worth getting. It heats up fast, is easy to use, makes my hair look great (I have really long thick wavy hair). I&#x27;ve owned it for 2 months now, and so far its working perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this iron shortly after my black Chi flat iron just suddenly didn&#x27;t go on anymore, after having it for two years.  I don&#x27;t know why it died especially when I wasn&#x27;t using it as often, letting my hair go naturally wavy for a while, but it died right after my mom gave me a new haircut and I wanted to straighten it...(go figure)  Since it was right before Christmas too, this was bad timing.  However, I went to Target and got this Remington flat iron and it was the only one left on the shelf and I liked the wider plates, so I decided it couldn&#x27;t hurt to get it and try it out.  They had the same Chi one that died on sale for $99.99 but I wasn&#x27;t going to go through that again.  So I got this one at alittle under $40 and I have to say I am very impressed.  This gets my hair sooo much straighter and silkier than the Chi did, and uses less time to straighten.  It&#x27;s so easy to use.  I haven&#x27;t gotten my hair stuck in it or burned (yet, crosses fingers lol) but I love it.  I just hope it outlives the Chi.  It goes to show that it doesn&#x27;t always pay to buy the $100 iron.</li>
            <li> Bought for GF. It feels and looks professional, not cheap at all. Nice LED display and good ceramic plates. GF loves it and does the job as expected.</li>
            <li> I know the whole idea of this straightener is the curved plates that allow you to flip the ends of your hair. Unfortunately, they also means they&#x27;re exposed and you have no protection against them.    I bought this iron for the larger plates, but after only a few uses and burning myself several times, it sits in the drawer unused and I&#x27;m back to my old iron.     Maybe my hair is too short and this iron would be better for longer hair. Or someone less clumsy.    The good points of the iron is that it heats up really fast and that you can lock the temperature to avoid accidentally adjusting it or turning the iron off.</li>
            <li> This is my first flat iron and it works as well as my sister&#x27;s Chi. It heats up quickly and for a wide iron, is very light and maneuverable. I\\&quot;m even able to create curls on the ends of my hair by finishing with a flip. I usually just flatten out the top part of my hair to make it really glossy and to tame the little curly hairs on top.</li>
            <li> am replacing my 3 yr old rusty 1 1/2 inch Revlon hair straightener. what a steal! got this one for $19.99 on Aug 9th 2010 &amp; b/c of the great reviews. i didnt expect such a high quality straightener for that price: 4 yr warranty!, huge heating plates! and super fast and super hot in seconds really!. my hair is shiny and no longer frizzy! plus u get to adjust the temperature! seriously get this when on sale!. u wont regret!</li>
            <li> I love this 2 1/4 inch flat iron.  I have long thick hair and my hair looks great when done. It&#x27;s very quick &amp; easy to use.  A very well made flat iron.  Wish the price was lower but was soooo worth the money.  Fast shipping.  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing straightener and I love it to death. Ive owned a wigo before and this one beats it by far!</li>
            <li> My daughter &amp; I are are on our third straightener from Remington in 5 years. Holds up great with a lot of use. Love the wide plates &amp; really does a nice job straightening curly, course hair. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product. Arrived on time in perfect condition. Exactly what was expected. Straightener works great and smooths frizzy hair. I love it!</li>
            <li> So i bought this hair straigtner in april of this year. It was great! it straightend my hair and worked. I always put it on 360 degrees. Then about 3 months later, i noticed that it didnt get as hot as it used to. So i had to put it up to 410 degrees when i had to straigten my hair. Then 1 month later it started giving off the strangest smell ever. I am in the process of looking for a new one. I would not recommend for long term use.</li>
            <li> Very good product! Gets very hot quickly.  Has a lock to close it for safety.  Very easy.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a new iron to replace the one I had for like 6 years. I started looking and ordered one from amazon that was horrible. So I returned it and continued my search. This iron is so great! I was scared to replace my current one because it was so great and I had it for so long, but this iron is just as good!!! I love it. It leaves my hair super straight, shiny, and frizz free. My hair lasted all night - and I live in humid Miami!!! I have wavy thin hair naturally and this worked wonders! I definitely recommend it! :)</li>
            <li> As soon I got this product i was so excited and right away i did tried on dump and wet hair. The result its fantastic, for me we dont need to buy expensive straightener just to be beautiful try this product and it wont disappoint you... excellent!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot believe that so many features are packed into such a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: sleek design, lightweight, digital temperature setting (up to 430 F), lock feature to keep the product closed when not in use, swivel cord, x-large plates for more coverage and quicker prep time, heats up within 30 seconds, automatic shut off&lt;br /&gt;(love that the iron is a dark chocolate brown and pink)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: NONE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it first arrived in the mail, i did not hesitate to try it out. I was able to straighten my long layered thick tresses in under 20 miniutes. I did use this product on the hightest setting and gradually decreased the temperature. There was no need to continuously go over the same spot. The end result, my hair was transformed from frizzy and tangled (due to sleeping on the curls from the night before) into a  fresh, sleek pin straight do.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first iron that was able to give me the pin straight look. My pervious straightener, the conair infinity had a good run but its time to send it into retirement and use it as a back up, in case of emergencies.&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron is the holy grail for ones beauty arsenal. It works wonders and performs miracles for a bad hair day and eliminates the necessity to have to use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Users be advised, this iron heats up and gets really hot. Please be cautious of how you handle this product before during and after styling your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am suprised (and lucky) that this straightener is priced so affordably, especially since it is in the same league (if not better) then the high end expensive brands.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutley recommend that you the reader do not pass over this straightener, compare it with the pricer brands and the answer is all spelled out,&lt;br /&gt;BUT- I do wish it came with a travel sak (like the conair infinity)..just an suggestion!&lt;br /&gt;Good luck girls!</li>
            <li> So my wonderful hot tools flat iron died after like 7 years, so I searched for another. I purchased one before this that was around the same price that was horrible and did nothing, I was so disapointed. Then I saw this one on here, and with mostly good reviews. I&#x27;m so glad I got it because this is one of the best flat irons I&#x27;ve ever encountered. It heated up fast, it made my hair completely straight in one go (and it had already dried curly at the time of my test...really hard to get it very straight once it has dried curly normally)! I have thick, wavy hair that has been really processed, and it looks shiny even after ironing. You sort of have to push the plates together a few times before actually straightening, it caught my hair the first couple of times till I got the hang of it. The only negative is that if you accidently burn yourself with it , you really burn yourself. If you are clumsy like me, just make sure to be super careful.</li>
            <li> Wow!! this is the best deal ive gotten for a straightening iron. Before this flat iron in had bought the kiyosaki flat iron and to me thats another one of the best ones but its not worth paying that much money for hair straightener!!! Im hispanic and im the only one from my family that has thick, frizzy, dry, and hard to manage kind of hair and ive never dyed my hair. So for this flat iron to cost $30 it has to be THE BEST HAIR STRAIGHTENER and i definitely i recommend it to girls with frizzy and thick hair because it will definitely get it under control.</li>
            <li> Very good product... The only con is your ends can get really fried if you use while hair is wet    shines hair and makes it look healthy I get compliments all the time for my hair and the shine I would recommend this product to everyone</li>
            <li> Got this for a good price on Amazon after my old straightener died.  Straightens hair in no time with the wide plates and good heat and I&#x27;ve got thick wavy/curly hair.  Heats up quick.</li>
            <li> Nice machine! Bought it for my wife. Great coverage for quick and easy styling. Would recommend this product to anyone looking for a reasonably priced and yet effective straightener.</li>
            <li> This is a great straightener, it gets nice and hot and smooths my hair while I&#x27;m using it.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical with purchasing this product, partly because it was so inexpensive, I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work good.  But after trying it for the first time, I loved it!</li>
            <li> GENERAL:  Design of the iron is very sleek and pretty- the plates are pink!   PROS:  -Iron heats up VERY quickly...within a matter of seconds  -Gets the job done for the most part- but would not recommend to someone who has thick hair as you have to straighten numerous times in one spot.  CONS:  -The plates dont clamp together all the way so you have to force them together. This is especially annoying after 20 minutes of straightening your hair- your hands start to get tired. I wouldnt recommend this for people with thin hair because you&#x27;d have to clamp pretty hard to straighten your hair completely.  -Cant hold the iron too close to the plates because it gets too hot.  -I have thick, wavy hair and had to straighten my hair numerous times in the same spot for it to be completely straight. I own a Gold N Hot and that works wonders- perfectly straight hair the first time and the plates are flush with one another.   Im pretty dissappointed as the product got many good reviews. Would not buy again or as a gift.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener!! I needed a new one desperately and I had bought 3 and returned them before I finally found this one. I have long, thick hair and not a lot of time to get ready in the morning so I needed something that could make my hair look great quickly. This does the job! It makes my hair really hot though (like burning my fingers) so be careful! But I can get my hair done in less then 10 mins in the morning. The wide plates help get more hair at once, and the adjustable temp gage is great.</li>
            <li> BOUGHT IT FOR MY WIFE SHES HAD 4 SAYS THIS IS THE BEST YET.THE LAST ONE I BOUGHT HER LASTED 3 YEARS AND COST OVER $100.THIS IS A GREAT PRICE ON A GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Product is good when you use on dry hair.But with wet hair,it is not as staright as the product claim. It is also user friendly.You need to trial an error to get the best effect for your hair by adjusting the temperature 10 degrees at a time.Take the manual as a guide line for each hair type.Depending on your hair type and length it take about 10 min to 20min to straigent your hair.Worthy of money and excellent product.</li>
            <li> They are in very good quality and I almost use it everyday. Also, It&#x27;s cheaper than most of other offers. I like them very much!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  I transitioned to natural hair (no chemicals), but still need to straigthen my hair for job interviews etc,.  I have the CHI and paid about $100 for it and the Remington works much better.  Plus the Remington has a digital temperature reading so I don&#x27;t burn my hair.  Unfortunately that&#x27;s what happened with the CHI, resulting in me chopping off quite a few inches.  Also since the Remington has wides plates, it straightens my hair faster.  I love that it&#x27;s ceramic and has Tourmaline.  The Remington S-9400 is just a great flat iron and the price make sit even better.  It&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too confident when I bought this straightener since it was so cheap. But I am so glad I got it! I love the wide plates as it definitely speeds things up. I have a LOT of thick wavy hair and this straightener gives me silky smooth straight hair within FIFTEEN minutes. I couldn&#x27;t believe that it cut my hair styling time in more than half! I love it. I HIGHLY recommend using a good product to protect your hair from the heat though, as this baby gets as high as 430 degrees (F). I can proudly say that this has replaced my chi, and it&#x27;ll stay that way.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for her birthday. She loves it and said it has cut the time in half that it takes for her to straighten her hair. It also does a very good job at straightening her hair, as her hair looks great. It seems to last all day as well, maybe longer. Definitely purchase this item!</li>
            <li> I would have gladly paid more for this straightener seeing how wonderfully this works although I loved the price. It is well worth the money. Heats up fast and I love the lock feature. I finally have beautiful sleek and shiny hair! My other straighteners always pulled my hair causing damage and my hair would have static.</li>
            <li> My straightened came in a decent amount of time and I absolutely love it. It gets hot almost immediately and does a great job on my hair! This brand alone is definitely good no matter what model of it you get.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. She loves it so much and praises me for getting it for her. I mean I never knew a gift like this would get such a response. All I know is that she loves everything about the product. I&#x27;m happy for that.</li>
            <li> I like the automatic shutoff.      I thought the wide plates would make my time faster but it really didn&#x27;t help.  On all different settings the straightener fried my ends.  Going back to my old straightener.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is amazing! I read the reviews and was convinced that I should try this.  I&#x27;ve never invested in an expensive flat iron and was considering one by CHI  After reading the reviews for this one and at less that $30 i just had to give it a try  I have thick wavy hair that&#x27;s long (mid back) and I live in the Caribbean where it&#x27;s always humid and my hair is always frizzy!   I&#x27;ve used flat irons in the past (and even visited salons to have my hair flat ironed) and it usually stays dead straight for about 2 seconds before returning to the wavy frizz    I got this flat iron and immediately tried it out. I used it at 410 degrees with the CHI straight guard cream (first time using the cream as well) and it was amazing! It heats up pretty fast and your hair gets DEAD STRAIGHT after passing the iron just once! I&#x27;ve never used a flat iron that I didn&#x27;t have to pass over my hair several times. So the result..dead straight, shiny hair in about 15 minutes.    The real test was to see if my hair actually remained that way. And it did. Until i washed it 4 days later (it probably would have stayed straight longer but it was getting a bit stinky :( )    I&#x27;m never trying another flat iron and I highly recommend this one to anyone! I saw a couple negative reviews which seemed weird compared to all the positive ones..I really don&#x27;t understand the basis for the negative reviews. I&#x27;ve tried to straighten my hair so many times and tried numerous creams and sprays to tame the frizz and keep it straight. This flat iron is a miracle worker (and the CHI straight guard too i guess) and I&#x27;m never using any other products...ever!</li>
            <li> This straightener worked marvelously. I have previously used much more expensive straighteners and they have not worked as well as this.     The straightener heats up SUPER fast and gets extremely hot. I have super thick, long hair that will go right back to wavy if I get hot, or get rained on. But with this straightener, it stayed straight throughout the day.    I am very pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it to anyone. For the price, you cannot do any better.</li>
            <li> This flat iron was the worst one I&#x27;ve ever owned. It not only didn&#x27;t straighten my hair, but it actually fried it.  It seems like others on here have had very positive results, but for me it&#x27;s getting returned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of different straighteners, but this one has definitely been the best. This doesn&#x27;t fry my hair, yet it gets very hot. It has a digital temperature readout to select the heat you want, and also to know when it has reached temperature. Only minor complaint here is that the temperature buttons are where you hold the straightener, and I sometimes accidentally change the temp. But it heats up very quickly and the wide plates make straightening a quick job. It&#x27;s easy to hold and use. I&#x27;ve bought three for myself and daughters. Overall very pleased and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Remington S-9400 straightener, mainly for the price &amp; also based on the rave reviews I found on this site.  I had a really good flat iron that finally quit working, but due to the price, it wasn&#x27;t feasible for me to replace it with the same model.  As far as the Remington - it&#x27;s OK - nothing special.  I liked the wide plates, but it was very difficult to reach the root of the hair, which as those of us with very kinky curly hair know - the roots are usually the coarsest &amp; need straightening the most.  The outside of the device also got way too hot when pressing together to straighten &amp; burned my fingers.  The other thing I didn&#x27;t like was that the plates are square - which make for occasional \\&quot;lines\\&quot; you can see in the hair, as well as stick straight ends.  Altough I want my hair as straight as possible, I also want some body to it and a little healthy-looking curl at the ends.  I used the Remington once, returned it and then purchased a titanium iron made by Corioliss that I found on HSN that has more rounded plates, etc.  Much better iron that I would recommend way more than the Remington.      [...]</li>
            <li> Pros:  The sheer size of this one makes straightening go quickly.  Digital display means you know exactly what temperature you are using on your hair.  Once you get used to where the buttons are (and learn how to handle the iron without accidentally pushing buttons), it works nicely.    Cons:  While there is a setting that will lock the iron on a set temperature while you work, the placement of the buttons makes it easy to accidentally \\&quot;unlock\\&quot; the temperature control, so you may end up with an entirely different temperature and not know it.  Also, DO NOT let this iron anywhere near your scalp.  There is nothing on the sides to protect nearby areas from the heat of the iron, making it extremely easy to burn your scalp and fingers.      Overall:  As long as you use caution going into your first few uses, this iron does its job and does it well.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, very long hair, and usually when I straighten my hair it takes nearly an hour to finish up... I was really hoping this wouldn&#x27;t be a dude, and it&#x27;s not!  I get my whole finished in under half an hour, and I get SO many compliments!!  By far the best iron i&#x27;ve ever had!!!</li>
            <li> This is the second Remington S-9400 that I have ordered.  I travel for work and love this flat iron so much I wanted one for home and one for travel.  It is definitely dual voltage as I have used it around the world.  It heats up in 30 seconds flat.  I have long thick full hair that is naturally wavy and this flat iron tames my hair in no time.  When I&#x27;m finished no one ever guesses I have wavy hair.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous other flat irons through the years and this is definitely the best one if you have a lot of wavy or curly hair.  It would probably be too big for someone with fine or short hair though.  Bottom line... it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> Pros:  Heats up quickly (and to a very high temp. as far as flat irons go)  Many temp. settings  Digital readout tells you temp. and if tool is finished heating up or still needs time  Buttons are not able to be accidentally turned off or readjusted (example: you must hold the power button down for several seconds to turn it on or off)  Plates are wide (I consider this a pro as my hair is thick and long and this cuts down on styling time)  Has an auto shutoff timer (so you don&#x27;t accidentally burn down your house)  Cord is an adequate length (not too short, not too long)    Cons:  Ceramic coating on plates can get nicked and create snags  There isn&#x27;t much of a guard around the plates making burns on the scalp and fingers a bit of a problem even for pros    I have spent a long time finding a good flat iron and this is the best I&#x27;ve found. Every product has some flaws but the flaws with this iron are not significant enough to sway me away from rating it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> After several people telling me the only flat iron to buy is a Chi, I decided to give this one a try.  It turns my thick frizzy hair into beautiful straight sleek hair.  I love it.  The only downfall I have found is that is is heavy.  This may not be a problem for everyone but having two major surgeries on my arms/chest in the past year, I find myself having to take a break to rest my arms.  However, the end result it worth it!</li>
            <li> This iron works well to straighten your hair but the handle gets way too hot. I have to use something to hold it with and it is a real problem. I used it for a few months but do not have time to fuss with this problem, I have very little time to get ready in the morning. I ended up throwing it away.  Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I really have nothing to compare this iron to, as it is my first ceramic flat iron. But I absolutely LOVE it. I read all the reviews before purchasing it, but I&#x27;ve had no trouble with the iron burning my fingers- if you hold it at the very end by the \\&quot;grip\\&quot;, it&#x27;s not bad at all. Unless it dies on me today, I have nothing but wonderful things to say about this iron.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron for waist length hair! I&#x27;m still using the one I bought at BB&amp;B well over 3 years ago!! The time it takes to heat up does depend on your power source, as I have found that it takes much longer to reach the desired temp at places like hotels and airports (I tend to travel a lot!) Best value for the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Excelente producto. El año pasado compre una plancha de  este modelo y este año compre 2 más. A todas las personas que la usan les encanta.</li>
            <li> This was a great straightener! I had felt the need to update my old conair silver because it felt more as if it was burning my hair and really took a bit of time and repeat passes to make my hair straight. This Remington straightener is great! I did my hair in about 15 mins, I had pin straight results and my hair felt much smoother, and had less frizz compared to my conair. I got this straightener because I read reviews and compared it to the chi, and trust me you don&#x27;t need to spend 100 dollars for a good straightener. This one is just wonderful and does such a great job!</li>
            <li> I bought this unit at Target when I couldn&#x27;t find the Conair my friend recommended mainly because it was on sale.  I had my hair up in a pony tail so my hair was fairly crimped and in not so hot condition because I didn&#x27;t bother drying it before I put it up (I have kids).    I was able to straighten the front sections in a matter of nanoseconds. I&#x27;m amazed. I plan on going on a business trip tomorrow (forecast:  high chance of rain--a nice, hot 12 hour drive round trip.  I will report back on whether it stood up to the environment:-)    UPDATE:    I went on my trip and the hair stood up to the nasty weather.  Since this review, I have used the item at length and am very satisfied:    -   I like the digital temperature and user friendly keys.  -   It heats up quickly  -   It gets super hot, super fast even with slightly damp hair.    My only areas for improvement:    -  When in high settings, it&#x27;s hard to &#x27;clamp down&#x27; on the front tips of the iron without my fingers suffering the consequences of the intense heat.  It doesn&#x27;t burn, but it&#x27;s hot.  Wish they ahd put a plastic tip to help with the clamping down process.    -  I reaaaaaaaally wish it had a built in comb for some of my tougher hair days.    Other than that, it gets my hair straight in no time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the world of flat irons and after much research on what the best features on when looking to purchase a flat iron, I chose the Remington S-9400. According to the beauty blogs and the \\&quot;expert opinions\\&quot;, plus reading what other purchasers have written, I found the desirable features of Ceramic with Tourmaline plate (to prevent frizzing and better for your hair), adjustable temperatures up to 430 degrees, auto shut off, and larger than 1 3/4 inches for long hair. The bonus features are a 4 year warranty, LED read out on top of unit, lock feature, and I like purple - eggplant color of the unit. It&#x27;s a little hard to handle at first, due to I&#x27;m not use to using curling irons or styling products and yes when I wasn&#x27;t careful I did get the unit end to close to my head and got a burn. It&#x27;s still way better than the ouch I would get from trying to comb through my curly, frizzy, ratted ends of my hair. I LOVE the Smooth, Silky, look of my hair and all I have to do is comb through it and I&#x27;m ready to go for the day. I have very dry hair which I put lots of product on before, so this is just fabulous that I only had to send 15 blow drying, then 5 minutes to straight iron the air and it lasts for days. No frizz, just straight silky hair. I compared this iron to the Chi and other flat irons and the Remington comes out on top. I love the price too!</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair and finding the right straightener is a chore. This product would be amazing if it didn&#x27;t have two major problems: 1-The ceramic plates have minimal buffer from the edges and therefore can burn you very easily. Even though quite careful and experienced with straighteners, I have already burnt my fingers twice and my forehead once. 2-The lack of a built-in (or detachable) comb makes it much harder for thicker hair to be straightened. Frankly if it hadn&#x27;t been for the burning issues, I would have given it 5 stars, despite the lack of a comb. The pros are plenty, however, and more than enough to make this product close to the best salon ones, at a great price. The plates heat up very well, the heat setting locks and can&#x27;t be changed or turned off by accident as in some other products (such as the Conair Infiniti straightener), there is virtually no static and the end result is silky and smooth hair.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a good hair straightener and I didn&#x27;t want to pay an outrageous price...this was the answer to my prayers! I searched and searched before I found this one that had really good reviews, I used to have a Remington flat iron a long time ago and I knew I liked that one pretty good (it was a cheap-o) I also have the Tstudio collection blow dryer that I love and has lasted me years of everyday use. I figured this one was the best choice, good reviews and decent price. After I got it, I was sooo happy I went with this one! My hair stayed straight all day, into the night and was still straight the next morning! Also, it dosn&#x27;t pull my hair like the cheap ones did. My only complaint is that you have to be careful when you are holding it because when you are gripping the handle, you can accidentally change the heat settings. I wish it had some kind of lock on it so you don&#x27;t have to worry about pressing the buttons when you are using it. Other than that, excellent straightener!</li>
            <li> This hair straightener:    Heats up immediately  The outside of the appliance doesn&#x27;t get hot  Leaves your hair silky and shiny even if it was dry before you straightened  Has a digital screen so you can change the temperature that works for your hair  Nice thick plates so you spend less time straightening    Awesome! Worth the thirty dollars!</li>
            <li> I am a bit disappointed in this product.  The irons don&#x27;t meet flush and I really have to used force to flatten them when I use it.  Straightening is very fast because of the size and heat level that it gives.  And some of the tech features are nice.   I wlll use it until I find something better but I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought one of this to take with me in my country where the voltage rating is 220v.In their specification they said that it is a dual voltage product and it runs for 110v and 220v.Thats why I used directly in my country.But after some time it doesn&#x27;t work.Than I searched throughly in their manual and find out that it needs a adapter to run in 220V. Then whats the point of calling it a dual voltage product.I guess the product is good but they should be more clear in their manual about this issue.</li>
            <li> This product is great! If I have been hanging out in my PJ&#x27;s and hair a mess all day &amp; my friends call to pick me up in 15, I can straighten my hair in time! I absolutely love the high temp (I have the thickest hair!) and the ease of use.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading a lot of great reviews on this product. With all the other straighteners I use, my hair just gets all frizzy and weird looking and eventually turns wavy. This straightener keeps it straight and silky all day long! It gets really hot which I like. Excellent hair straightener! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I purchased this straightener for my daughter.  Her hair is medium length and semi-fine.  She absolutely loves this product for the heat settings and the fact that she can do more hair at one time.  Her hair looks really good after she uses it and she is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I got this item in hopes that it would replace my Tigi Rock Star straightener that they stopped making. Alas this one is not for my hair. It&#x27;s too hot, I always have to turn it down. Also the plates are hard to keep together, much pushing is involved to actually straighten my hair. Just not for me.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews for hair straighteners, I purchased this for my girlfriend. She&#x27;s been using this everyday, for about a year, and loves it. You won&#x27;t go wrong with this item.</li>
            <li> This straightener is amazing!  My hair is very long, all the way to my butt and this straightener handles my hair with ease.  I love it!  The only \\&quot;con\\&quot; I can say is be careful!!  It is very easy to burn yourself.  I have a spot near my scalp where I got too close and burned my skin.  When I wake up in the morning my hair is a hot mess.  I don&#x27;t even have to wash my hair, just use this straightener and it looks like I walked out of a salon.  Shiny, silky, and smooth!  It heats up super fast and it is VERY HOT!!  I love love love it!!! I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> The straightener indeed seems a little faster with ionic.  Every time my wife starts to straighten her huge bundle of hair, the hair straightener whine used to get me crazy.I feel a lot better now. The build quality is also pretty good and sturdy. For this price, this is definitely one of the best.</li>
            <li> Complacido con la compra a mi esposa le pareció excelente por lo ancho de la plancha y la graduación de calor de la misma, esto simplifica el tiempo y la capacidad de trabajo en el planchado es perfecto.  Saludos...</li>
            <li> i have really coarse wavy hair that is hard to straighten.  I had gotten chemical straightening done for the last couple years but it was really damaging to my hair, and my last 3 straighteners were useless.  i heard amazing things about fh1 and was about to put down the $400+ for it.  then i tried get the babyliss one, and thought it was great, but it was  not prime eligible.  This was had all the same specs, so i decided \\&quot;what the heck, for $30 its worth a shot\\&quot;.  omg i will never go back to another straightener!  pros:   fast even heating  salon quality look  glides through hair super smooth    cons:  can literally burn your hair off if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> I have medium thick, rigorously curly hair. The vast majority of the time, my straightened hair would become wavy if I slept on it, if it got hit with any kind of moisture, or sometimes just as the day went on. Not with this iron; my hair is beautifully pin-straight (a real first for the ends not to curl up at all) even after I sleep on it, and it saves me a ton of time from not needing to restraighten it the next day. I usually use irons on the highest setting (my old iron went up to 410 degrees), but that same temp on this iron was far too hot, to the risk of burning the ends. It&#x27;s nice to have the option of all the temperatures since I&#x27;m sure certain types of hair require the hotter setting.    It takes me 15-20 minutes, which is a solid time but not as fast as I had hoped with the big plates. I do feel like it&#x27;s easy to burn your scalp with the exposed siding, or even just the expulsion of steam as the plates move, but it just calls to be careful.    I picked this up on a whim at Target since it was on super clearance, and I&#x27;m so glad I decided to get it. Because of this iron, I&#x27;ve bought other Remington products and have been pleased with all of my purchases from them. If you&#x27;re looking for irons and have long enough hair to use this width, get this iron! It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> muy buena compra, primero quen nada el diseño es muy bonito y de muy buena calidad, la primera vez que lo use me fue muy bien... altamente recomendado</li>
            <li> This is a great straightener.  I have used it for a year now. I like that it gets closer to your hair (unlike some like Hot Tools).  Also, it gets extremely hot (430 degrees), which is necessary for thick hair like mine.  I always get compliments on my hair when I straighten it using this tool.     One thing to note is that there are no panels on the side to protect your fingers. Also, you can sometimes feel the heat through the panels.     Overall, I would buy this again for sure!</li>
            <li> I have fine, mostly straight hair with just a little wave to it. This flat iron works wonderfully to make it super straight. I love the digital readout that allows you to be more precise with your heat settings rather than just a dial that you turn and hope is about right. Thanks to the digital readout I can turn it way down (about 280)and someone with thick, coarse, or curly hair could turn it way up. I previously owned a Sedu flat iron and I actually like this one much better. I have used it almost every day for around a year and have no damage resulting from using it. Plus, it&#x27;s pink!</li>
            <li> Because it is so cheap, I thought the quality might be questionable.  I saw many good reviews and that is why I purchased.  I am happy that I did.  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THIS FLAT IRON!</li>
            <li> I purchased this straightener after using it at a friends one night. I couldn&#x27;t believe how great it made my hair look! I have EXTREMELY thick and curly hair (think Curly Sue or Shirley Temple) and this straightener had no problem making my hair extremely soft, smooth, touchable and shiny. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments about how great my hair looks. It rained the first day I was able to use it and yet my hair remained frizz free.    Hands down this is THE BEST straightener out there. It put my Chi straightener&#x27;s to shame.  Plus this has a digital read out of the temperature on the handle to allow you to find what temperature works best for your hair and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> My flat iron arrived yesterday. It is relatively heavy but very well-built. Be sure to read the directions...you do have to hold the power button down for a couple seconds before the unit turns on. The controls are easy to use.    I was impressed this morning at how easily this iron glides through my hair. I had it on about 360 degrees and next time I will try a lower temperature. There is such thing as too hot, people, and the Chi I had totally destroyed my hair even though it did work. ;)    The size of the iron is great for longer hair; mine is just past my shoulders. I think one this large would not be as effective on shorter styles, and it&#x27;s going to take me a while to get used to smoothing my bangs out with it. But I will say that this morning I left my house looking just like I do when I leave the salon, so that&#x27;s definitely a plus.    The plates do not fit completely together as one reviewer mentioned, but it doesn&#x27;t matter. It still does an amazing job. The outside of the unit DOES get too hot to press together, but again, it works so well without pressing the plates together manually that it&#x27;s irrelevant. You don&#x27;t even need to use the handle lock feature.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 16 yr. old daughter and she absolutely loves it.  I purchased this straightener based on the ratings and it has not disappointed us.  Definitely worth buying.  She couldn&#x27;t believe how little it cost and worked like a charm!</li>
            <li> This item works great and is easy to use.  I bought this for a gift for my granddaughter and she loves it.  It does the job easily and does not dry out the hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron only because the good reviews. I was looking for a expensive one, but after noticing a lot of people claiming that it was worth it to buy this product and also the good price, I decided to get it. it&#x27;s fast as it claims, good quality and YES! my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz or gets curly after a couple hours (or minutes as mi old one)I really like it.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works very well for straightening my hair. It does damage my hair a lot and leave it straw like and it leaves my hair smelling awful! I would not recommend this. Spend your money on another flat iron!  Pros: Multiple Settings, Works Great, Good Quality, Durable, Creates Shine, Smooths Frizz, Heats Up Fast  Cons: Damages Hair, Bulky, Leaves hair smelling bad  Best Uses: Straight Hair, Frizzy Hair, Humid Conditions, Long Hair, Curly Hair, Thick Hair, Thin Hair  Bottom Line: I would not recommend this to a friend, nor buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product works great!  I usually have to turn the heat up super high on most flat irons, but not this one!  It defaults to 360 degrees when you turn it on and you can increase or derease from there but I find it to be perfect!  The plates are nice and large as well!</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!  I have extremely thick, curly, frizzy hair, and with my old straightner, it would take at least 45 minutes the night before, along with another 45 minutes the next morning.  This one takes about 15 TOTAL to go from frizzy mess to sleek and shiny.  I love it!  It does get hot, so it takes a while to find the perfect temperature.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I always read the reviews of a product before purchasing from amazon, and I have to say the reviews for this product are right on.  I have thinner hair and I started using product to straighten my hair, everyone now comments that my hair looks so much fuller even though it is now bone straight.  The product is very easy to use, heats up quick and stays hot even on the lowest temp.  My sister borrowed my flat iron when she came to visit me and forgot hers, she loved it is much she is buying one now.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener a few years ago, it always works great. I have huge curly hair and it straightens my hair in 45 mins when usually its like a 2 hr process. People always wonder how I get my hair this straight, its all thanks to this wonderful straightener. :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this straightener! I have long, thick, naturally curly (3b/3c) hair. In the past, I would have to blow dry my hair straight and use a flat iron to make it straighter/silky. I was usually left with dry hair at the end of it. This iron straightens my hair and makes it shiny and silky without having to blow dry first. (Note: I did let it air dry though.) My old straightening time was about 1-1.5 hours on a good day. With this iron, it took me just over 30 minutes. The only con I would say is (depending on the temperature setting you use), it is possible to burn yourself so please be careful.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I purchased it because a friend had one I had to use once. Heats up really fast and remains steady as you use the item. No temperature changes. I&#x27;m looking to get one with smaller plates to use for bangs.</li>
            <li> I had a Vidal Sassoon 2 1/4\\&quot; ceramic straightener that I used religiously everyday for 6 years. This week, it died and so I needed to go out and buy a new flat iron. I would have gladly purchased the same flat iron if I could, but it&#x27;s long been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually bought this flat iron at Target and got to use it this morning. Compared to my last flat iron, this one just seems to glide through my hair easier. I have really thick, coarse hair that sometimes requires several passes in order to get it tamed. With this straighter, one pass and it was done. I could not believe it! It may have something to do that the plates are tourmaline ceramic vs regular ceramic, but it does heat up quickly and does a great job. Plus, it comes with a 4 year warranty so I&#x27;ll be using this flat iron for a long time!</li>
            <li> I just received this product about a week ago and have used it twice.  Both times I did not enjoy it.  My hair got caught in the plates a few times and it was not easy to pull my hair through the plates even though tourmaline is supposed to be the easiest in regards to that aspect.  I have a pink BedHead flat iron I used before then and decided to return this and just keep using the one I had before as it worked much better.  I would recommend a redesign of the plates to include a lip at the end make the hair not seem so stick straight-like so people could have the option to curl under a bit.  I&#x27;m sure if you have longer hair this would be ok if you don&#x27;t mind how hard it is to pull hair through the plates, but for short hair or shoulder length this is not ideal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for about 2 years now, still works great still love it. Does exactly as it should straightens hair its quick its easy it doesnt burn. If you have issues with this striaghten i&#x27;m sorry to say it is NOT the flat iron is it probably you. If your hair some how sticks on these plates you put to much product in or are using it wet, never use it wet on your hair thats how it kills your hair. Dont go to hot i have thick course hair i use it no more then 280* twice slow for each section, dont put to much hair in it, make sure it can close properly, i do four sections starting at the bottom and work my way to the top. I like redkin 05 straightening balm. Make sure to brush before and after really make its looks smooth. If you have hair shorter then your shoulders, buy the one inch, this is to thick and you will burn yourself and it will be a pain in the butt. Plus with the one inch you can do flippys. Everything you need is in the flat iron, no need to spend 100&#x27;s on more expensive ones it what you do with it that counts.</li>
            <li> OK, We are 3 women with long curly hair in this house. We already tried Corioliss, which is good but not awesome. We already tried Chi but so-so. But this one, is faster, wider, cheaper in price, and does an amazing job in half of the time. That&#x27;s the only recomendation that i can give you. Grace.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and always thought I needed to buy those skinny expensive straightners but this one works sooooo much better! I absolutely love it. It makes your hair so silky and has different heat settings. Works better than the chi for sure if you have long hair. If you have short hair it probably won&#x27;t work because it is very wide</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my sister, and she LOVES it! She indicated that it works excellent...it leaves her hair very smooth, works very quickly and is not too hot. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see what all the great reviews are about.  This was just like any other iron.  My main problem with it is that it does not close all the way down on my hair at the point closest to the \\&quot;handle\\&quot; of the iron.  In order for it to close all the way I had to put my hand onto the iron part which is hot.  I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I bought this Flat Iron because my friend told me it was the best one she ever used! So I bought it and let me tell you.... it was amazing.  I have very thick curly hair, and flat ironing it usually takes about 45 minutes.  With this flat iron, it took LESS than 15 minutes!!! And thats including heat up time!  I had ZERO issues with the product and love it! I may start flat ironing my hair more often because its so much faster and easier.  My hair has shine and stayed straight ALL day!!!! I would recommend this to anyone with THICK, CURLY, Hard the straighten hair!</li>
            <li> I initially bought this product due to all the positive reviews i read about it. Let&#x27;s just say am not sure if those people were dreaming or if they have just never used better products but i was greatly disappointed with this flat iron.    The first time i tried to use it, i could barely hold it because when you heat it up, the entire flat iron heats up! it didn&#x27;t straighten my hair at all but ended up burning my SCALP!!! Let&#x27;s just say i packed it up in the box and returned it the very next day.    I have used Maxius Maxiglide flat iron for the past 5 yrs and although it cost more, i went and ordered another one the very next day. saving myself about 50 bucks and burning my fingers and scalp every time i try to straighten my hair didn&#x27;t seem like a really good deal to me. If i could give this product ZERO stars i would that&#x27;s how much it SUCKS!</li>
            <li> La ame desde el primer dia, plancha mi cabello en 30 min y lo tengo largo semi liso hasta la cintura no deja marcas de zic zac ni se queda pegada al cabello ademas es hermosa</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener even though it was a little expensive, because I was so tired of ones that would keep my hair straight for a few hours but then start going back to normal - and it is totally worth it! I have thick, curly/wavy hair, and this straightener works really smoothly and quickly. It used to take me 15 minutes to get my hair straight with other products and this one only takes about 5. Plus, even though I sometimes work in really humid environments, my hair stays straight through all kinds of conditions, even in the rain. It&#x27;s awesome and I totally recommend it. The only complaint I have is that it does take a long time to heat up, but it&#x27;s definitely worth waiting an extra minute or so to use it.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite hair straightener. Heats up quickly and straightens very fast</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard finding a straightener that does what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do but this one is officially the best I&#x27;ve EVER owned. I tend to wear my hair up a lot after showers so the next day it gets very curly and wavy. Very hard to manage. This straightener makes it SOOOOOOOOOOOO much easier to get my hair done. I&#x27;m literally impressed by it. I got one off of HSN but it&#x27;s NOTHING against the Remington. I read the reviews over and over for about 2-3 days before buying this and I am very glad I did. I have had it for a month now and use it all the time. It heats up very quickly and I&#x27;m pregnant so my hair is thick at the moment. It usually takes me about 45 minutes to flat iron it. With this one it takes less than 15! It does NOT get ANY better than this one!! It&#x27;s HIGHLY recommended. I&#x27;m definitely getting one for the women in my life who complain their flat irons are useless!! :)))</li>
            <li> one of the features I really wanted in a flat iron was the ability to lock in the temperature I set.  This iron advertised that feature, but mine doesn&#x27;t work.  It&#x27;s too bad, especially since the temperature controls are right where you grab the iron to use it, so you can inadvertently raise or lower the temperature while you&#x27;re working on your hair.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good iron, has substantial weight, and does a good job.  I also like that you can increase or decrease in 10 degree increments, so you can get exactly the heat you need (except when you hit it accidently, as mentioned above!).</li>
            <li> No tengo palabras para describir lo maravilloso que ha sido este artículo, con el tiempo hasta mi cabello se ha alisado. como recomendación no subir tanto la temperatura pues no hace falta, plancha muy bien igual... estoy 200% satisfecha, tanto que esta es la segunda que compro para regalarsela a mi hermana...</li>
            <li> If you are on the edge of buying this do it! I have had this straightener for about 2-3 years and have had no problem with it. It is fast to heat up and the buttons are in degrees electronically. No more dial! If you have thick hair this is perfect it straightens in about half the time. Only problem is getting the roots since it is so large. The cord even swivels!!</li>
            <li> This flat iron allows me to sleep in a little later.  It cut my hair time in half. It&#x27;s awesome and my hair stays done for at least two days.  I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> exelente producto, a mi esposa e hija les encanto, recomiendo 100% calidad. Es tal cual las fotos que aparecen en la publicacion.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair straightener I&#x27;ve ever used so I really can&#x27;t compare but this product is really easy to use and I&#x27;m 100% satisfied. I have very long, very wavy hair and it does a good job. I have to use small sections of hair and go over each part at least twice but the results are super straight hair that lasts two days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned 2 CHI&#x27;s over the course of 5 years and I thought no other straightener could beat its performance until I tried this straightener. For the price, it can&#x27;t be beat. My hair, which is prone to frizzing in humidity, still looks amazing after using this straightener. Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> OK, here&#x27;s what you do....buy the CONAIR INFINITI Tourmaline straightening hair dryer (it&#x27;s WONDERFUL), buy the Remington T3 Tourmaline flat iron and buy some Chi Silk Fusion or Biosilk. Wet to silky straight takes about 25 minutes total if you follow this advice. After showering, towel dry hair, and put the silk drops on your ends (don&#x27;t use too much---this will take a few tries). Also spray your wet hair with a heat protecting flat iron spray for good measure. Use the hair dryer exactly as intended (it&#x27;s not hard at all- I don&#x27;t get the neg reviews). If you have shoulder-length or longer hair, it&#x27;s easiest to put your hair in two ponytails (one behind each ear) and dry the ponytails first using this dryer. Then take them out and dry the rest of your hair with the dryer. Only takes about 10-15 minutes this way (and I have VERY thick curly hair).     Use the Remington T3 Tourmaline flatiron on 410 degrees (don&#x27;t pull it through too slowly---that&#x27;s very hot).  Then when finished, spray a glossing spray on your dry hair and rub it down. FINISHED and your hair will be BEAUTIFUL!! I&#x27;ve gotten soooooo many compliments on my hair since I bought these two pieces of equipment and started straightening this way. I have been SEARCHING for 20 years for an effective way to straighten that doesn&#x27;t take forever or prevent me from having my morning shower. THIS IS IT PEOPLE.  TRY IT!    I did not really believe the reviews on here that this flatiron is better than the 100 dollar ones but, oh my goodness, THIS IS THE BEST FLATIRON I have ever owned. I will never pay for a Chi or Solia again after using this one. It will straighten anything FAST. Unbelievable, I tell you!</li>
            <li> I have long hair, it&#x27;s wavy, and I have a lot of it. I am so glad I took the plunge and got this flat iron. It&#x27;s so much better than those skinny ones. If you have thick hair you should try it. The wider surface is really great.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used.  My other one was a Remington Wet2Dry- it didn&#x27;t get hot enough and the plates don&#x27;t go all the way to the end.  This one gets VERY hot and the plates go all the way to the edge, which allows you to give the hair a wave, light curl or flip if desired.  And it is priced right- no need to spend more.  4 year warranty is unusually long- look no further- buy this one!</li>
            <li> At first my hair would get stuck in the sides of this straightener but over time I got used to it. I love that I can choose my heat settings on it and then lock the buttons so that I don&#x27;t keep turning it hotter or cooler. I also love how wide it is. With hair like mine I need a larger straightener. I will definitely buy this again if mine ever craps out. I&#x27;ve had it for 3 years thus far and it&#x27;s still running great after daily usage.</li>
            <li> this is the second time i ordered this straightener thats how much i like it.&lt;br /&gt;in my eyes the best on the market- im hooked!</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy, coarse, and wavy hair. Not only that, I have LOTS of it. I have tried several straighteners like an older Conair model, Revlon Perfect Heat Professional 1\\&quot; Ceramic Straightener - RV062C, and even Remington Wet2Straight. I thought the Wet2Straight was great, but it&#x27;s not even in the same league as the Remington S-9400.    With my old straighteners, it would take me a good 45-60 minutes to fix my hair AT SHOULDER LENGTH! It took me 25 minutes maximum with the S-9400, and my hair has grown out a good 5 inches past my shoulders! I don&#x27;t know if it because the plates are huge, or that it heats up to a really high temperature, or the material of the plates. All I know is that this is the sleekest and straightest my hair has EVER been. Now, I don&#x27;t feel lazy whenever I need to straighten it. Moreover, the price was great. I bought it at Target for $39.99, significantly less than the cost of more &#x27;professional&#x27; straighteners.    What&#x27;s not to love? :)</li>
            <li> I got this Remington Flat Iron for my niece, and she loves it. She says that it leaves her hair smooth &amp; manageable without too much effort. She has beautiful curly hair that can be easily flatten with this gadget. Thanks Amazon, got the item in three days... that was fast!</li>
            <li> love it. works really well. the only complaint is that your hand sometimes changes the degrees while you are using it.</li>
            <li> This is the best straightener I have ever gotten, and it was so resonably priced for its superior performance. It heats up extremely fast and makes the straightening process really quick in the morning. With the tourmaline plates, my hair seems to be healthier and not as damaged as in the past. I also like what the straightner feels like; It is made with quality parts, unlike the cheap plastic parts that are used to make most straighteners. I really couldn&#x27;t be happier. Definitely was a wise investment and would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I hate this straightner! I previously had a Remington and it lasted forever so i decided i would once again get a remington and the dumb thing wont work for me all the time! i plug it in and put it on the 430 and it wont heat up! am i doing something wrong?</li>
            <li> today was my first day using this and i love love love it!...it does get really hot so be careful! but my hair is so straight and soooo smooth!</li>
            <li> I bought two of these, one for my girlfriend and one for my sister! They both said it is working amazing and had ZERO complaints about it!</li>
            <li> I did alot of asking friends before I purchased this item.  I have long, thick hair and the 2 1/4\\&quot; width of this is perfect, anything smaller in width would take hours to get this type of a result.  I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this as long as I did!  My hair looks so shiny and healthy.  I love that you can decide what temp to set the heat at - you don&#x27;t have to fry your hair to straighten it.  There is also NO REASON to spend more money than this on other brands.  My friends have spent over a $100 on the big name brands and they have all been disappointed when they broke in less than a years time.  Buy this - it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> Wow!  I am very impressed with this product and the price.  I have very thick, curly hair, and it took me 35 minutes to do my entire head!  With a traditional (smaller) flat iron, it took me two hours!  No thank you.    I would not waste $100 + dollars on a brand name if you can get a product like this.  I also appreciate the digital adjustment, so you can raise the heat if your hair is more stubborn or lower if your hair is getting fried.</li>
            <li> I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;USE IT MUCH AND ALL PERFECT.&lt;br /&gt;I MADE A GOOD BUY AND RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Since i was 13 I&#x27;ve had trouble finding the right straighter....i&#x27;ve probably had over 15 and gone through buying them, trying them, and taking them back more than enough times. My hair is thick, wavy, and frizzy &amp; this straighter solves the problem. it won&#x27;t let you down. I also had this straighter: [...]  and it worked extremely well on my hair, also.  Get one of these, they won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviews below, I bought this at Target because the straightener I went to buy was sold out. Since mine had died the morning before and I have not gone a single morning in about 10 years without straightening my hair, a purchase was required! I bought this one and brought it home figuring I could return it if it proved a flop...fortunately this was a phenomenal accident!    This straightener is amazing. The very first day I was impressed with its speed and smoothness since I am often let down by straighteners that fail to handle my wavy thick hair. A very quick pass or two and I was done and out the door! Later, I was shocked to receive a ton of compliments on my hair. By the time I got home I expected my hair to have returned to its normal wavy state, but again was pleased to see perfectly straight and frizz free hair. I decided to withhold judgment for a couple more weeks not wanting to jinx the product or something...but here I am today writing this review several weeks later with the same smile on my face.     I have tried a Chi and a Solia (those expensive ones that get all the hype) as well as several regular name brand ones including a Conair one (that worked alright) and the wet2straight one (that worked well, but would not last hours later) and nothing was as good as this one! I have already recommended it to all my friends!     Best of luck with the decision as I know all of these things come with a ton of positive reviews to sift through! On price and quality, I do have to say that I cannot see anything beating this one!</li>
            <li> My daughter asked for a hair straightener for her birthday. She has been disappointed in all she&#x27;s owned in the past. Don&#x27;t get hot enough; not hot enough fast enough; not user friendly. After reading several reviews on many different brands, I determined this was the one. I was a little hesitant, because the price was so reasonable, but I talked myself into it and very glad I did. My daughter said this is the best straightener ever. Has to put very little effort into getting straight hair and it looks fantastic. Smooth and shiny with no special products. Only the straightener. She&#x27;s a mother of two young children so she has very little time to get ready. This fits the bill. I am very pleased with my purchase. I strongly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST straightner ever!! It gets up to 430 degrees and it doesnt burn your hair. I have very thick har and this straightner does wonders. if you want an awesome straightner and dont wanna pay $100 and up then get this one. ITS GREAT!!</li>
            <li> For the price it is excellent. Works as well as an expensive flat iron. Leaves me hair feeling and looking great. Only have to go over my hair once with it.</li>
            <li> I researched and used a few different flat irons before deciding on this one.  I have very fine hair, just below my shoulders.  I purchased it about a month ago and use it daily.  It has not dried out or damaged my hair at all.  Over all it only takes me about 10 minutes to straighten my hair.  The placement of the heat controls is fine for me and I have not yet pressed the temp button in error while using the iron.  I have been getting many compliments @ work on my hair after using this straightener.  I previously was using a hot tools iron that i had borrowed from a friend.  I like this one better.  It is easy to hold, no burns *yet*  :)  I would definitely recommend this product.  It is not too heavy and the brown and pink are cute together :)</li>
            <li> OK fellows,    I read the reviews about this product&gt; one quick question. How long does the straightened hair last How frequently do u have to straighten your hair? Thank you in advance for ur time to reply.</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty amazing. I bought it when my old flat iron (which cost almost 3 times as much) broke. I have very fine hair, but a lot of it, and I live in a very humid area very close to the ocean, so my hair always gets frizzy after I wash and blow-dry it. This straightener does a much better job and takes a lot less time -- I don&#x27;t have to redo the back of my head ten times like I did before because I could never get it straight with my old flat iron. I&#x27;m pretty sure it makes my hair more smooth than any other straightener I&#x27;ve tried, and my hair seems to even be less frizzy after I wash it the next day.</li>
            <li> Daughter wanted a straightener and has used it nearly every day since.  No need to buy a really expensive one...this one works fine without damaging hair.  Bought her a heatproof plate to rest it on since it burned the outside of her heat pocket holder as it heated up.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a new straightener and typically purchase mine at Ulta 3.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money but I wanted a product that worked better than my hot tools straightener that now longer worked.  I bought the Remington based on all the great reviews and the price.  I used it for the first time today and it was EXCELLENT...all the reviews were right on. This is the best product out there, and I have tried a lot of them. My hair came out silky smooth, like I just walked out of the salon. My hair looks healthy and not fried.  I love it and believe the reviews, it&#x27;s that good!!</li>
            <li> My daughter had this on her wishlist for her birthday, she absolutely loves it.  I have to admit that I&#x27;ve used it several times as well and am very happy with it.  Heats up quickly and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> My best friend ordered this &amp; she loves it &amp; so do I! Heats up very quickly &amp; has very nice results. I absolutly love this.</li>
            <li> A*mazing! Heats up really fast and using it once keeps my hair straight for days. Seriously wash and then blow dry  still straight. Not as pin straight, but pretty close.   I&#x27;m really happy with straightener. I was worried that I&#x27;d have to invest more money in a more high end straighter to get the results I wanted, but this one works great! Completely blows my last straigthener out of the water. For someone who wants to upgrade from something that just wasn&#x27;t working anymore, but can&#x27;t afford to invest in a GHD or a CHI I definitely recommend this Remington!</li>
            <li> I just love this Remington S-900 T-Studio straightener... I was looking to buy a Dual Voltage straightener since I had planned   India trip I wanted one that i can use there too that is one of the main reason i bought this one because it can be used worldwide.. the other thing that i loved about this product is its 2 1/4\\&quot; wide plates.... its wide plates makes your job lot more easier and quicker.. for best results use after you shampoo and condition your hair apply Chi silk infusion on your damp hair and then blow dry and then flat iron... then see it makes a magic on your hair... chi silk infusion also leaves a fantastic smell on your hair..its way better than those expensive branded flat irons like sedu, solia which just takes all the hype!! I would recommend this remmington flat iron to a friend.</li>
            <li> i bought it for my 18 y/o daughter. it is working on 220v too so I could take it with me to Israel. she said it is GREAT!</li>
            <li> My granddaughters hair is very long, very very thick and has natural curl.  This curling iron works so well on her hair and with the width, very quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really wide than I tought.  However, It&#x27;s well made in my opinion, but this is for long hairs, not for short or mid-length hair.</li>
            <li> I never tried any hair straightener before, so I just chose one of the best-selling on Amazon. And I was very satisfied with this product - it has several temperatures, the buttons can be blocked. Also, it has quite wide plates - very convenient. I definitely recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good flat iron. Haven&#x27;t tried others, so I don&#x27;t know if this one is one of the best.</li>
            <li> I Love Love Love this flat iron!  I had an older white Revlon model that had the huge gold ceramic plates (that is a GREAT one also but discontinued and really hard to find).  I have tried so many flat irons and most of them do not work well on my coarse curly fuzzy hair.  To summarize:    Pros:  - HUGE titanium plates cover a lot of hair and make my hair super straight and smooth.  These plates are really really big, much longer than most plates  - flat iron is gentle on my hair - doesn&#x27;t yank on my head or make my hair break off  - gentle curves in the plates can curl your hair under nicely at the ends.    - HOT digital temperature guage (I only need about 390 degrees and have coarse hair - and it goes even hotter than that)  - swivel cord is great - so the cord doesn&#x27;t tangle  - sleek and stylish looking with brown / purple   - auto shut-off after 60 seconds  - able to lock it closed so you can pack it away before it cools down    Cons:  - can be hot to the touch  - can easily burn your hair if you have the heat setting too hot    After straightening, I use a dab of bio silk to smooth everything and my hair is sleek and shiny and looks FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> So I bought this for my wife for Christmas. She would tell you her hair is generally unmanageable. I don&#x27;t have that problem, being bald, but I remembered that a few times, my sister in law would straighten her hair and she liked it a lot. I found the Remington while digging around Amazon. My sister in law gave me some tips on what to look for: specific temperature controls, etc. which the Remington had and for a price that was hard to argue with. She seems to be enjoying it, though she&#x27;s only had it for a week. Perhaps I&#x27;ll write again in a few months after seeing it work a while.</li>
            <li> In the sea of Hot Irons boiling with little money, I searched for the best hot iron for the price. After sensing I would have to get a home loan, my husband, protective of his bank account and weary wife on the internet, said, \\&quot;Have you heard of Remington&#x27;s model?\\&quot;.  My daughter, not knowing of my exhaustive search and eventual joy at finding this model says, \\&quot;Mom, this is the best straightener!  Does a better job in half the time.  Leaves my hair so smooth.  Don&#x27;t even have to turn it all the way up, either. Thanks, Mom!\\&quot;  She&#x27;s got thick, wavy, long hair. I say, \\&quot;Thank you, Remington, for being sensitive to the trends in hot irons and knowing how to price things so I won&#x27;t be owing my soul to the devil!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Wow...The moment I got the package , I started the job.The result is fantastic.just one time action is enough to have silky hair.THE ONLY complain is there is not a pouch or bag or holder wich can hold 2 1/4\\&quot; flat iron.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener because my old, trusty H2Pro was falling apart after being dropped and overall wear and tear. I&#x27;m growing my hair out, so I decided to get a 2in this time around. I&#x27;d heard good things about ceramic and tourmaline so I decided on this one, mostly because of the price. For what I paid, I&#x27;m really pleased. I&#x27;m African-American and my hair is thick with tight ringlets, and after blow drying I was impressed with how well it straightened my hair. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it still doesn&#x27;t get my hair as shiny and straight as my old H2Pro. I did notice that my hair seems to have held a lot more moisture with this particular straightener. It heats up really quickly, and I love the lock feature. Also, I have a curling iron that has buttons similar to this one and I always accidentally turn it off in the middle of curling my hair, but I was very pleased that never happened with this straightener. Did I mention that I LOVE the brown and pink color scheme?? It&#x27;s girly but not over the top like other brands. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and I would recommend it to anyone on a tight budget like myself.</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this straightener if it wasn&#x27;t for my adult daughter.  My hair is not nearly as thick as hers and I didn&#x27;t think I would need anything this powerful.  However, after going over and over my head with my smaller, less quality straightener, I decided to try hers (this one) and WOW!  What a difference! It took me less than half the time to do my whole head and it looks much more professional.  I had to get one for myself and I&#x27;m glad I did!  Good price, good product!</li>
            <li> Amazing hair straightener!  It gets VERY hot quickly!  This is by far my favorite one yet - and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I have pretty thick hair, that is fine, and it is hard to find a straightener that will actually make it go the way I want it to.</li>
            <li> Mi señora está muy contenta con esta plancha de Cabello. Dice que es perfecta su uso y su diseño son excelente. Gane puntos con ella gracias a Remington S-9400</li>
            <li> Best flat iron on the market. Me and all my friends use this one. I have bought it twice because my first one got ruined in a flood. I lovethe many adjustable temperatures. It works so well,  and I get many compliments.</li>
            <li> I have owned the T-Studio S-9400 flat iron for about 7 yrs and it just started giving me problems. I believe I have used this product to the wire. I WILL NEVER USE ANOTHER BRAND FOR A FLAT IRON. This is the absolute best flat iron on the market. I think this time I&#x27;ll buy 2, which should last me for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> My daughter introduced me to this product.  My hair is always frizzy no matter what I use.but with the remington s-9400 tstudio hair straightener I haven&#x27;t had any frizzy hair. now I can let my hair dry naturally and just use the straightener and don&#x27;t have to do anything for a couple days.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I was very happy when I bought it but when arrived this device never work, was damage and came in the sealed box I think this is a big scam selling damaged items, it&#x27;s disappointment</li>
            <li> Oy Me Goodness, I bought three hair straighter prior to this one and returned all of them.  None of them worked.  One of them took me and hour to do my hair but it was still fuzzy.  Very irritating with our a really good tool.  This baby works awesome and fast!!  I love it.  Highly recommended and the price is cherry!</li>
            <li> awesome straightener, works great, love it.  i just wish that it could be used with wet hair, but it cannot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for 5 years and it still works great.</li>
            <li> Second one I have bought for my wife.  First one lasted 4 years, and she abuses it bigtime!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Heats up quick and works as described.  Great value for the price.  She seems to LOVE it.  You won&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick wavy hair, and I have tried about a dozen hair straigteners in my life, some pretty pricey, and non of them compare to the Remington.  It heats up very fast, and straigtens my hair with just one go-over.  I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> remington is the only straightener that i can use. i have very thick hair and it&#x27;s frizzy as all get out. i can&#x27;t find this in the store anymore so i come to amazon to buy it. it&#x27;s expensive but worth every penny. i love this straightener.</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister and worked great she loves it but the hair dryer is horrible I reccomend you buy a sepperate hair dryer</li>
            <li> Lasts for years! (Purchased in 2010), Digitable adjustable heat and doesn&#x27;t keep your hair too hot. LOVE IT! Definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li> Ever since I was in middle school, it was tough to find a hair straightener that did the job right; without causing damage to my hair. Now, I&#x27;m in my twenties and did some extensive research for a new straightener, for almost a month! Almost every reviewer led me to the Remington S9400. I was hesitant over the price tag but after finding it locally for a great bargain, I purchased it for what I hoped to be a long-term relationship. I&#x27;m glad I bought it! Now, two and a half years later it still performs as well as it did when I first bought it. I enjoy the temperature control setting, the temp lock, fast heat up, and locking handle. It heats evenly and the plates do not damage my hair, it makes it look healthier. I have very long hair, so the Remington straightener really holds up to the job. Since, it heats up quick and evenly, my entire hair gets done in half the time than my former straighteners.&lt;br /&gt;A few things to remember: read the booklet so you can know the proper care of the straightener, it will lengthen the life of the product.&lt;br /&gt;Do not wrap the cord, fold it in a zig zag when storing.&lt;br /&gt;Keep the straightener on a heat safe towel when in use, it will help your product and your countertop.&lt;br /&gt;Practice with the different heat settings, you can get some great styles if you know how your hair responds to different temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;Do not lock the plates together when heating, this can cause plate damage and too-hot spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I did my research, now I have a straightener that is here for the long haul!</li>
            <li> Great item, it is excelent for gift or any event you made, i totaly recommend it, i just love it.</li>
            <li> I bought it long time ago and until now still working good. Make my hair soft and shinny after i used it.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I like the width a lot.  It makes straightening my hair take much less time.  It also seems to be much more gentle on my hair than other straighteners.</li>
            <li> AWESOME product. It is worth every penny. The plates heat up fast and the temperature is salon style up to 410. My hair is thick coarse and abundant. I had the older version and could not find a replacement that had the wide plates or the high heat. Be careful with not placing the iron too close to the scalp. This is the best product in the market for hair straightening that i have found. I now straighten my hair fast and effectively. This product is a bit lighter in weight than the older version. The older version heats up to 200 and this one goes up to 410. The heat is not twice as hot but it does feel a bit hotter than the older version.</li>
            <li> Muy buen articulo.De muy buena calidad. Envió satisfactorio. Llego sin ningún detalle. excelente elección. Muy buen precio. Gracias, agradecido. A!</li>
            <li> I think this works, so 5* to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And reviewing after 2yr of purchase, shows that this product works and last long too.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and I have purchased many expensive straighters. They always break or dry out my hair completely. I was reluctant to try this one because of the price, but my friend had it and raved about it. I bought it and it was perfect. It straightened my hair beautifully and left it soft and shiny. After using it for a few months my hair was in such better condition. It wasn&#x27;t dried out anymore. I brought it to London with me and it blew out and was broken. As soon as I got home I searched every store around me for it but could not find it so I came on amazon to buy it. The new one worked exactly the same, and I have had it for a year now. The one that blew in London I had for three years, but it probably would still be working if I didn&#x27;t try to use it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things: 1) don&#x27;t use it over seas, even with a converter, because the outlet amperage is different and it will break it. 2) Don&#x27;t get the smaller plates version of this straightener because for some reason it does not work as good.</li>
            <li> very easy to use and its great for the price ...I don&#x27;t use it frequently but when ever I do use it am very happy with this product</li>
            <li> I no longer have to spend an hour straightening my hair! With such a large iron and fast heating my curls are gone in no time! I have had it for 2 years now and no problem yet! (knock on wood)</li>
            <li> Muy buena esta plancha, el cabello me queda muy bonito.  Se debe utilizar preferiblemente para cabello largo y efectivamente no hace falta esperar a que seque completamente el cabello, se puede utilizar sin ningún riesgo.</li>
            <li> I can only give good grades. Good quality. My daughter  uses perfectly. I am going to buy another one for my friend&#x27;s daughter.</li>
            <li> I have always been greatly satisfied with Remington hair products. I also have their small curling wand, large curling wand and hot rollers in this pink/brown pearl style. Gets super hot so your style stays, without damaging your hair</li>
            <li> The item came broken and did not work, its not great quality. Had to send it back :S not recommended</li>
            <li> I ordered this straightener in 2011 and it is STILL working.  Perfect for thick hair.  No reason to spend $100+ on other straighteners!!</li>
            <li> I have long hair and got it because it is larger so figured it would do my hair ok. But didn&#x27;t. Hard to straighten because its so big and hard to get underneath your hair. Your better off going with a smaller one, it just takes a bit longer.</li>
