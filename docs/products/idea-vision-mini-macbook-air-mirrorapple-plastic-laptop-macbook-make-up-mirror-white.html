            <li>It&#x27;s cute</li>
            <li>Love, love these, they are a certain conversation piece.</li>
            <li>Great overall buy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually ridiculously detailed, from the keyboard to the markings for a USB hub on the side.</li>
            <li>Great little cute product and well worth the product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the seller!!!  </li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s a completely ripoff, even if the stuff is cute.</li>

            <li>Bet durable and so realistic, can&#x27;t wait to setup on my desk!</li>
            <li>I decided against giving the second mirror as a gift item to an adult as they&#x27;re rather cheap feeling, but they&#x27;re adorable for personal use or gag gifts/stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li>My 9 y/o is really into AG stuff</li>
            <li>The printing on them appears decently clear.</li>
            <li>but overall, i think it is a nice small present for someone</li>

            <li> The hinges are rather loose on these items (I ordered two), but it&#x27;s well worth it unless you need to prop it open at very wide or very narrow angles.</li>
            <li> Obviously the keyboard is a solid mold so the keys don&#x27;t depress at all, which is to be expected.</li>
            <li> It has a silver Apple logo on the outside center lid of the laptop, and says MacBook on the inside center underneath the mirror.</li>
            <li> Just ordered another one of these for my other daughter.</li>
            <li> BUT it is dirty with black stuff on it.</li>
            <li> I hate going to AG</li>
