            <li>It&#x27;s a very good product for the price.</li>
            <li>Size is good for price!</li>
            <li>Since it has all the varying shades it looks great summer or winter.  </li>
            <li>good color for me..  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>VERY SATISFIED WITH PURCHASE, IS AS DESCRIBED ON SITE.</li>
            <li>i buying more!</li>
            <li>nice</li>
            <li>I got kind of hooked on it when my sister gave me some years ago.  </li>
            <li>I give it five stars because it&#x27;s the longest wear blush I own and</li>
            <li>but nice anyhow</li>
            <li>It does not flake off like most inexpensive makeup does.</li>
            <li>So glad I found more of this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this color wheel.</li>
            <li>It is an OK product.  </li>
            <li>I would give 5 stars but breaks easily.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a nice pinky glow, nothing TOO harsh for fair skin like mine.</li>
            <li>good blend of different hues ..</li>
            <li>It gives me a slight glow and it&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful pink, healthy naturally looking blush.</li>
            <li>It goes on light to the skin, but it works very well with my light skin tone.</li>
            <li>This compact was too bright pink.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for years,so it&#x27;s worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>It is a nice color, but again, only as a blusher.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I will probably buy another in the future unless I find something better.</li>
            <li>I use a large makeup brush.</li>
            <li>Love this because you can vary the pink</li>
            <li>I not only use it as blush, but also all sometimes to get a nice glow over my regular makeup.</li>
            <li>my collection ranges from high end to low end.</li>

            <li> Nothing wrong with it but not any better than a single color blusher.  </li>
            <li> It should be only used as a blusher/rouge as otherwise you end up looking like you&#x27;ve been in the sun too long!</li>
            <li> This &#x27;mosaic&#x27;  compact arrived with ALL the different shades mixed in a powdery  heap in the center of the compact!</li>

            <li> This face powder was loosely packed in a box.</li>
            <li> It is a brightening pink blush.</li>
            <li> not quite what i expected...</li>
            <li> I thought it was the same shade I had ordered in the past.</li>
            <li> suddenly part is broken.  </li>
            <li> Arrived crushed up and useless</li>
            <li> It came on time, and it wasn&#x27;t broken for me, as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> This is NOT an allover face powder nor foundation base.</li>

            <li> good color for me..  good blend of different hues .. nice</li>
            <li> Works well. I use a large makeup brush.</li>
            <li> Bought this b/c I say it recommended on YouTube. It&#x27;s a good product. Wasn&#x27;t cracked or powdered upon delivery. Not TOO pigmented but it&#x27;s a nice pinky glow, nothing TOO harsh for fair skin like mine. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Very Good. Recomended!!! Thanks!</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful pink, healthy naturally looking blush. It does not flake off like most inexpensive makeup does. I would purchase it again after finishing this one.</li>
            <li> This face powder was loosely packed in a box. There was nothing but dust when it arrived. It is not usable. I would not recommend ordering this.</li>
            <li> Arrived crushed up and useless</li>
            <li> VERY SATISFIED WITH PURCHASE, IS AS DESCRIBED ON SITE.</li>
            <li> I would give 5 stars but breaks easily.  Just got my second one and poof! suddenly part is broken.  I use it for eye shadow and highlighting and contouring</li>
            <li> It came on time, and it wasn&#x27;t broken for me, as others have mentioned. It goes on light to the skin, but it works very well with my light skin tone. It gives me a slight glow and it&#x27;s beautiful. It&#x27;s a very good product for the price.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, so...Great!&lt;br /&gt;Second time she buys it.</li>
            <li> So glad I found more of this product.  I got kind of hooked on it when my sister gave me some years ago.  They must have stopped making it, but this is just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love this color wheel. I not only use it as blush, but also all sometimes to get a nice glow over my regular makeup. Note the price: You don&#x27;t always have to pay a lot to get quality. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> I like the quality and color of this blush. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t always find this rpoduct locally or they won&#x27;t have the color I need.  Love this because you can vary the pink/rose but swishing yur brush over different elements of it.  Since it has all the varying shades it looks great summer or winter.  The product lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This &#x27;mosaic&#x27;  compact arrived with ALL the different shades mixed in a powdery  heap in the center of the compact! No, this former&lt;br /&gt;Milani customer wll go back Home to MILANI!</li>
            <li> I received this product shattered.</li>
            <li> It is an OK product.  Nothing wrong with it but not any better than a single color blusher.  I will probably buy another in the future unless I find something better.</li>
            <li> so beautiful! i buying more!</li>
            <li> It is a brightening pink blush. I give it five stars because it&#x27;s the longest wear blush I own and my collection ranges from high end to low end. I&#x27;ve had mine for years,so it&#x27;s worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Color wheel looks like picture. Size is good for price! Would buy again!!</li>
            <li> not quite what i expected...but nice anyhow</li>
            <li> This compact was too bright pink. I thought it was the same shade I had ordered in the past.</li>
            <li> I obviously misinterpreted the intent of the description. This is NOT an allover face powder nor foundation base. It should be only used as a blusher/rouge as otherwise you end up looking like you&#x27;ve been in the sun too long! It is a nice color, but again, only as a blusher.</li>
