            <li>I love this prduct AWESOME for a first timer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;re much better off getting a better quality machine separately, no matter what your situation is.</li>
            <li>This Kit is much better than the ones I have.</li>
            <li>Machines and unit seem to be ok.</li>
            <li>I have better control than with the &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; machines that he likes.</li>
            <li>Everything runs smoothly and all!</li>
            <li>so I went ahead and bought another brand of ink just to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li>will be shopping on line for my equipment more often .I</li>
            <li>Very nice ready to go</li>
            <li>The 8 guns seem to be of good quality nad all else at first glance.</li>
            <li>He even said that this set is pretty good for its price.</li>
            <li>Me and my brother decided one day we wanted to try our hand at becoming tattoo artist, without any experience whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Excellent starter kit everything came as expected!</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say a whole lot about this product because I am sure plenty of others have, but everything in it is very cheap</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty decent set of machines, they all came in great working condition.</li>
            <li>The power supply is actually really cheap.  </li>
            <li>Foot switch seems a lil cheap.</li>
            <li>Great kit great price only gave 4stars because only a week of having it one of the adjusters broke on one of the guns.</li>
            <li>Most Deffenetly recommend this to all interested.  </li>
            <li>Well, it definitely works just fine, and I&#x27;m pretty much sure that even though theese are not the top professional tools, they&#x27;re great for the price.</li>
            <li>The machines were clean, but after using the tubes and grips i went to clean them and after I&#x27;d cleaned them they were rusty.</li>
            <li>If you want to start tattooing when this kit arrives make sure you order some green soap and vasoline; even some more gloves would be best for multiple tatoos.</li>
            <li>I got 8 machines some of them are in need of adjustments but overall a good product.</li>
            <li>I just dont want you to think you are getting somthing your not an dont use it to try and make quick cash</li>
            <li>Get better high quality inks (like Moms)</li>
            <li>It really has a cheap material build.  </li>
            <li>Was it well worth the money???  </li>
            <li>In ways its worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the money  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beiginers kit, and is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I bought this machine set because I want to learn the art of tattooing and my  tattoo artist is willing to teach me.</li>
            <li>Also, you are going to need some tattoo soap and ointment, so I guess I lied about being able to take it out of the box and starting a tattoo.</li>
            <li>kit was great checked all the guns and they worked fine except for a couple of guns needed to be tuned just a little bit other than that</li>
            <li>The DVD that comes with it really doesn&#x27;t teach you anything.  </li>
            <li>THANKS ALOT</li>
            <li>and he said, \\&quot;That&#x27;s crazy!\\&quot; when he heard how much I paid for it.</li>
            <li>Very well assembled kit everything in the case except the costumer to tag.  </li>
            <li>My rating is based on quality alone shipping was fast</li>
            <li>you get a lot of stuff at a really cheep price</li>
            <li>The dvd wouldn&#x27;t be much help to a beginner, but it is what it is.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in to tattooing, you really should look into getting this kit.</li>
            <li>Other then arriving later then planned am very pleased with products</li>
            <li>the power supply is really cheaply made it wont keep a steady flow it jumps all over the place the guns are your run of the mill cheap Chinese guns they have extremely cheep coils and binding posts with pos plastic screws  </li>
            <li>You will make a lot of enemies, and probably a bad rep for yourself unless you are amazingly good, which in that case, you should have money for a better set up.</li>
            <li>Well it looks decent in the pictures, but when you get it, its not all that.  </li>
            <li>The guns are decent.  </li>
            <li>I did not get any type of power supply cords to power the gun, how can I use it if I cant power it, luckily a friend had a couple of extra ones from his tattoo guns</li>
            <li>every thing in the kit is vary cheaply made even down to the grommets the ink is practice ink</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve emailed the company expecting to recieve a replcement DVD and so far recieved nothing.</li>
            <li>I showed it to a professional tatooer</li>
            <li>I receive the dirst one already waiting for the second one thanks , bev</li>
            <li>Very good for a beginner only bad thing is the quality of the pigments - Muy bueno para un principiante lo unico malo es la calidad de los pigmentos</li>
            <li>Last but not least the products is labeled to be made in China, really cheap material that will not last for the long run it you plan on becomming serious as a tattooist.</li>
            <li>The guns are heavy, almost like trying to tattoo with a brick weighing the gun down, the power supply is so cheap, it won&#x27;t stay plugged into the wall, and when I went to turn my supply off, the lights and numbers stayed on.</li>

            <li> I gave it 3 stars because it does come in a hard case that carries the whole kit, and all the tools you need to start a tattoo as soon as you take it out and set it up.</li>
            <li> Other than the minor things you need and need to know this set will get you are you way to Tattoo the WORLD!</li>
            <li> Had some questions before I spent money with them, they were prompt and respectfull.  </li>
            <li> But I would advise on studying/researching on other products that deal with tattooing before you decide to get this product.  </li>
            <li> Its been 3 weeks and after struggling with YouTube videos I&#x27;ve only done two imperfect/ amateur looking tattoos.</li>
            <li> If they would have remedeed this small problem my review would have been quite different.</li>
            <li> This is all poor quality stuff and you need to buy more products to replace these cheap needles and ink, because you will probably get some horrible infection using it.</li>
            <li> You may need to buy some other stuff too.</li>
            <li> Everything arrived in less then 3 days.</li>
            <li> The video doesn&#x27;t show you how to setup the liner or shader and doesn&#x27;t tell you to bend the needles slightly.</li>
            <li> you get a lot for a little</li>
            <li> I was missing 2 guns when I got it</li>
            <li> My friend gave me two of he machines because he thought they were too heavy, however I use them and like the weight.</li>
            <li> The coils are such poor quality that they usually won&#x27;t even start moving the needle until 7-8v.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It arrived a little late on the promise date but ups sux</li>
            <li> You open the case Its not a rip off or a bad deal</li>
            <li> (Duh!</li>
            <li> Merely hours after this decision I was on Amazon searching products and comparing prices.</li>
            <li> The practice skin was useless.</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE IN HUMANS its bad even for practice ink</li>
            <li> an apprenticeship!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set itself is terrible, the machines are all sub par, the ink is as Made In China as is comes, and the coils are the icing on the nasty cake.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Everything arrived in less then 3 days. Everything  that came with the kit was in the box. I love this prduct AWESOME for a first timer.</li>
            <li> Well it looks decent in the pictures, but when you get it, its not all that.  The power supply is actually really cheap.  The guns are decent.  The case is made of possibly cardboard/plastic.  It really has a cheap material build.  One of my guns/machine broke within using it for 4 hours practicing, but it does supply you with 8 guns.  In overall it worksout for a begginer.  It gives you a feel of tattooing.  Was it well worth the money???  In ways its worth the money.  But I would advise on studying/researching on other products that deal with tattooing before you decide to get this product.  Checkout actual tattoo websites.  Add another $100 to what this is and you can probably get a setup you would actually be more proud of. The DVD that comes with it really doesn&#x27;t teach you anything.  Its best go on youtube and learn how to do tattoos.  Last but not least the products is labeled to be made in China, really cheap material that will not last for the long run it you plan on becomming serious as a tattooist.</li>
            <li> Me and my brother decided one day we wanted to try our hand at becoming tattoo artist, without any experience whatsoever. Merely hours after this decision I was on Amazon searching products and comparing prices. After reading customer reviews etc. I decided on this Tattoo kit. When it arrived we were ecstatic. The 8 guns seem to be of good quality nad all else at first glance. However imagine our disappiontment when we realized the instructional dvd was blank! The practice skin was useless. Its been 3 weeks and after struggling with YouTube videos I&#x27;ve only done two imperfect/ amateur looking tattoos. I&#x27;ve emailed the company expecting to recieve a replcement DVD and so far recieved nothing. If they would have remedeed this small problem my review would have been quite different.</li>
            <li> All the stuff was not even in the case, so be carefull who you order from, and out of the 8 guns i only got 6 and 2 of them dont even work. I thought i could trust these people, i ordered from (EYEPOWER) bcas i have ordered from them before but i guess fancier studio are trying to find a way to cut corners like a lot of others are doing now AND there useing eyepower to do it,..They use to be one of the best to order from but now even when you try to contact eyepower they dont respond...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a self learning tattoo artist, so don&#x27;t take what I&#x27;m saying as &#x27;go to a shop and do an apprenticeship!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set itself is terrible, the machines are all sub par, the ink is as Made In China as is comes, and the coils are the icing on the nasty cake. The coils are such poor quality that they usually won&#x27;t even start moving the needle until 7-8v.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re much better off getting a better quality machine separately, no matter what your situation is.</li>
            <li> Good deal  for beginner&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Excellent starter kit everything came as expected! If you want to start tattooing when this kit arrives make sure you order some green soap and vasoline; even some more gloves would be best for multiple tatoos. The video doesn&#x27;t show you how to setup the liner or shader and doesn&#x27;t tell you to bend the needles slightly. You should probably get a how-to book on tattooing to learn the fundamentals and health precautions to use for safest tattoo procedures. Other than the minor things you need and need to know this set will get you are you way to Tattoo the WORLD!</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money  the guns are great wish the ink was better though</li>
            <li> The item is great all my tat machines were  ten wrap coils which works for shade or line and great for magnum ! shipping was fast and on time the best i have had from amazon ! THANKS ALOT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty decent set of machines, they all came in great working condition. I bought this machine set because I want to learn the art of tattooing and my  tattoo artist is willing to teach me. He even said that this set is pretty good for its price. I def recommend this product to anyone who wants to learn or to someone who needs a few replacement machines.</li>
            <li> I recieved this kit and couldn&#x27;t be happier with what I got for the money.  It&#x27;s a great starter kit and a perfect option for those interested in tattooing but not wanting to spend a bunch of money for a kit.  I showed it to a professional tatooer I know and he said, \\&quot;That&#x27;s crazy!\\&quot; when he heard how much I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Very well assembled kit everything in the case except the costumer to tag.  This Kit is much better than the ones I have. Most Deffenetly recommend this to all interested.  Rated A++</li>
            <li> Tubes and needles are not labled for size. Makes you guess and try. Machines and unit seem to be ok. Foot switch seems a lil cheap.</li>
            <li> This is all poor quality stuff and you need to buy more products to replace these cheap needles and ink, because you will probably get some horrible infection using it.</li>
            <li> It is a great item but one of the tattoo guns didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Well, it definitely works just fine, and I&#x27;m pretty much sure that even though theese are not the top professional tools, they&#x27;re great for the price. It&#x27;s a beiginers kit, and is definitely worth it. You may need to buy some other stuff too.</li>
            <li> I was missing 2 guns when I got it and I had it only 1 month and the power supply started to overheat and cot fire in the middle of tattoo will never buy again from this company</li>
            <li> It is a nice set. My friend gave me two of he machines because he thought they were too heavy, however I use them and like the weight. I have better control than with the &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; machines that he likes. So I am now waitng for a similar set that I ordered for myself.</li>
            <li> The best tattoo machine kit I have ever ran across! Everything runs smoothly and all! Machines aren&#x27;t have and fit the hand perfectly and tattoo&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> kit was great checked all the guns and they worked fine except for a couple of guns needed to be tuned just a little bit other than that great buy.oh,the ink,i was hesitant to use it don&#x27;t know the brand so I went ahead and bought another brand of ink just to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li> I receive the dirst one already waiting for the second one thanks , bev</li>
            <li> I did not get any type of power supply cords to power the gun, how can I use it if I cant power it, luckily a friend had a couple of extra ones from his tattoo guns</li>
            <li> My rating is based on quality alone shipping was fast the kit was well packaged and everything was there ive been tattooing for 3 years Ive got 6 pro guns I use I got the kit for a friend that has a lot of potential I wish I would of got him another kit even for practice the power supply is really cheaply made it wont keep a steady flow it jumps all over the place the guns are your run of the mill cheap Chinese guns they have extremely cheep coils and binding posts with pos plastic screws  every thing in the kit is vary cheaply made even down to the grommets the ink is practice ink DO NOT USE IN HUMANS its bad even for practice ink you get a lot of stuff at a really cheep price but the kit screams cheep from the second You open the case Its not a rip off or a bad deal you get a lot for a little but the kit is so cheeply made and could not be ran on humans nothing good would come out of it im not upset about ordering it I just dont want you to think you are getting somthing your not an dont use it to try and make quick cash you will just F someones S up and get your A beat</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say a whole lot about this product because I am sure plenty of others have, but everything in it is very cheap (Duh! look at the price.) The guns are heavy, almost like trying to tattoo with a brick weighing the gun down, the power supply is so cheap, it won&#x27;t stay plugged into the wall, and when I went to turn my supply off, the lights and numbers stayed on. The ink will stick, but it is definitely almost comparable to water with food coloring in it. I gave it 3 stars because it does come in a hard case that carries the whole kit, and all the tools you need to start a tattoo as soon as you take it out and set it up. Just don&#x27;t expect to buy this kit to go out and make some money. You will make a lot of enemies, and probably a bad rep for yourself unless you are amazingly good, which in that case, you should have money for a better set up. Also, you are going to need some tattoo soap and ointment, so I guess I lied about being able to take it out of the box and starting a tattoo. Don&#x27;t skip on the soap.</li>
            <li> The machines were clean, but after using the tubes and grips i went to clean them and after I&#x27;d cleaned them they were rusty.</li>
            <li> They were what I needed , shiped to me on time and did not have to pay a arm and leg for then like I would in a store .I will be shopping on line for my equipment more often .I would recommend this products to my friends .</li>
            <li> All of our equipment was there when we ordered the only thing is if you put a package on someone&#x27;s porch I would knock so they can retrieve it so the package doesn&#x27;t get stolen by neighbors.</li>
            <li> Check out Dragon Hawk, their set is guaranteed, and FDA certified.  Had some questions before I spent money with them, they were prompt and respectfull.  All inks FDA regulated.  Tattoo guns are one year guaranteed.  Six months on power supply.</li>
            <li> I got 8 machines some of them are in need of adjustments but overall a good product.</li>
            <li> Very nice ready to go kit everything you need an more!! It arrived a little late on the promise date but ups sux</li>
            <li> i bough it...As soon.I.opened the kit i started tattoing....Great kit From 9 to 10 ..for a starter kit,black ink set on well skin.but the colors I.personally womt recommend it for a big pro tattoo</li>
            <li> A really great deal for all you get, I wouldn&#x27;t use the inks on skin, I would recommend for practice. Get better high quality inks (like Moms) But This is a good deal for all you get, and the case is really nice. The dvd wouldn&#x27;t be much help to a beginner, but it is what it is.</li>
            <li> This was a gift also, can give a review, but have not received any complaints concerning this item, so it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> Had everything!  Great equipment</li>
            <li> This is the best deal ever! I still can&#x27;t believe I got all this great stuff for $79. If you&#x27;re in to tattooing, you really should look into getting this kit.</li>
            <li> Very good for a beginner only bad thing is the quality of the pigments - Muy bueno para un principiante lo unico malo es la calidad de los pigmentos</li>
            <li> Great kit great price only gave 4stars because only a week of having it one of the adjusters broke on one of the guns.</li>
            <li> Nice product, Satisfy with purchase</li>
            <li> Other then arriving later then planned am very pleased with products</li>
            <li> very good. excellent seller.</li>
