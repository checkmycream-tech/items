            <li> This is an amazing cleanser and is very mild on the face! I would recommend this to anyone.... It appears to help with breakouts, reduces oily skin, and I have also noticed my forehead skin tightening and fine lines fading...&lt;br /&gt;It is awesome...)</li>

            <li> I have combo skin, and this has helped clear up my hormonal and adult acne. A little bit goes a long ways, so a tube will last a good while.  Brought on some redness at first, but my skin has adjusted, and looks very clear now. My pore size has been reduced over the weeks, and I think my overall skin tone has improved. I can go out in public now with a \\&quot;naked\\&quot; face. I will reorder this product.</li>
