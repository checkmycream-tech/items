            <li>This product is excellent.</li>
            <li>I started using rapid lash, and had someone comment that I had beautiful lases!</li>
            <li>And they are perfectly curled upwards without doing anything.</li>
            <li>So very happy with RapidLash.</li>

            <li>I heard lilash one is the best, but it&#x27;s pricey.  </li>

            <li>Excellent it works,,,,,thank you.</li>
            <li>It began to work in 4 weeks and the results were excellent.</li>
            <li>I was very happy until I noticed that this product stopped working in about 8 months.</li>
            <li>So, do not count on your beautiful eye lashed for no longer then 6-8 months!</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and works wonderfully</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about 8 weeks into using this on a nightly basis, and I can say that I am very happy with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>It truly works &amp; the price is incredible at Amazon.</li>

            <li>Good luck guys!</li>
            <li>She said she didn&#x27;t think I need it because I have beautiful lashes already.  </li>
            <li>Then one of my friends suggested me this Beautiful Eyelash enhancing serum</li>
            <li>This product conditions and strengthens the eyelashes beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I looked like I didn&#x27;t have lashes without make up on before, and now you can see them beautifully.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the results, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay the exhorbitant price to try Latisse!</li>
            <li>Let me first say I &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 this stuff.</li>
            <li>Very pleased!</li>
            <li>A welcome plus.  </li>
            <li>My lashes look great.</li>
            <li>Why spend the money on Latisse when this works great and does not require a prescription?</li>
            <li>I had great hope for this.</li>
            <li>Still, it is a great product</li>
            <li>This was in my price range and I am so happy I got it.</li>
            <li>Happy happy customer</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m quite happy with this longer lashes.  </li>
            <li>Works great on eyelashes, they are longer than I can believe.</li>
            <li>and I have seen a great difference in my lashes.  </li>
            <li>The color has not lightened, and mascara makes them look great.</li>
            <li>this product was recommended to me that has had great results, so i&#x27;m hopeful that in time it will work well.</li>
            <li>I had heard great things about this product and was eager to try it.</li>

            <li>I also use it to thicken my eyebrows which are thinner than I would like and have had great results with that.</li>
            <li>With makeup on it has a great effect and each and every day</li>
            <li>Have experienced noticeable improvement in length.  </li>

            <li>I was so upset because I&#x27;ve always had great eyelashes</li>
            <li>It works great.  </li>
            <li>and I have been using a coating conditioner b4 applying my mascara, my lashes are great.</li>

            <li>It is a great product to buy.</li>
            <li>I read from another person&#x27;s review that castor oil works great at stimulating eye lash and brow growth.</li>

            <li>She was  really happy.</li>
            <li>and im really happy with the results.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a miracle worker, so you&#x27;re not going to have 2 inch lashes, but it&#x27;s great for filling in lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m soo happy I found it.</li>
            <li>Takes a couple of months, but works great.</li>

            <li>I have been using Rapidlash for just over 3 weeks and have seen a really nice results !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of years now and it&#x27;s honestly changed my life!</li>
            <li>Heck, they look nice even without mascara!</li>
            <li>Honestly I thought there was no hope, well I found it!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be happy you did!  :)</li>
            <li>I will keep using and see if continuous use will give me longer lashes :P crossing my fingers</li>
            <li>Filling in some sparse areas quite nicely!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting close to achieving the faux lash look with my own lashes, hoorah!</li>
            <li>The tips curl upwards on their own and I&#x27;ve never had that!</li>
            <li>Despite the \\&quot;hiccup\\&quot; in my Rapidlash experience, I can easily recommend it - the results were impressive!</li>
            <li>Rapid Lash its a great product that give us excellent and quickly results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has never done a good job on my thin,sparse brows,but that&#x27;s NOT why I purchased it in the beginning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>formula and loved Rapidlash.</li>
            <li>Labs Rapidlash Eyelash Enhancing Serum --- a good purchase...</li>
            <li>and I am happy with how effective it is judging by the cost.</li>
            <li>I tried RapidLash because I thought it might be a good alternative to Latisse....</li>
            <li>I loved it.    </li>
            <li>To begin with my eyelashes were a good length</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I have read a lot of good things about it.  </li>
            <li>This product does work good.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product, seems to work.  </li>
            <li>Plus, they burned after applying....no good.</li>
            <li>But good side is, my lashes were stronger than before.</li>
            <li>Not as good as Latise, but it doesn&#x27;t cost a $100 either.</li>
            <li>I stayed using latisse a couple years ago, then switched to RevitaLash, which i loved.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed by all of the good reviews here.</li>
            <li>The product lasted me a good 6 months when applied every night, so you get a lot for your money.</li>
            <li>my eyelashes are gorgeous.</li>
            <li>one may work good.  </li>
            <li>Rapid lash works just as good</li>
            <li>I feel like I gave this product a fair try.</li>
            <li>I orderes a bucnch of bottles now , since I am intending to give them a couple of good friends.</li>
            <li>Unopened product is good for 3 years from this date.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would give this product a try since it was getting good reviews.</li>
            <li>With continued use my lashes seem to stay looking good.  </li>
            <li>I saw Rapidlash price point and good reviews and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>good ladies tried it</li>
            <li>thats how good this product works and THANK GOD</li>
            <li>Good, my eyelash seems grew longer since I used 3 weeks ago.</li>
            <li>Absolutely as good as SmartLash.  </li>
            <li>This is a really good product.</li>
            <li>Good product and will buy it again soon&lt;</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look as good</li>
            <li>Good results.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s a good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 65 and still work to look good.</li>
            <li>I had read that it was good for sparse eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>Made my lashes fall out, would of loved to get a refund</li>
            <li>then i will desided if it good or</li>
            <li>Just as good as latisse</li>
            <li>Not just amazing, but AMAZING!</li>
            <li>and so I am very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and will continue to use it nightly.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for eyelashes and eyebrows and have been very satisfied with the product and the price.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Ordered Rapidlash before and have been very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>in all, I&#x27;m very glad</li>
            <li>I have used Rapidlash for 9 months now and am very pleased with my results.  </li>

            <li>I have been using this product for about a year now and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>However If I apply a nice mascara my lashes will look good.</li>
            <li>I did not believed in this kind of product but because of the good reviews I give it a try.</li>

            <li>that is probably the reason why i still have not seen results after more than 8 weeks of application!   </li>
            <li>I had them removed and lost even more eyelashes in the process!  </li>
            <li>and I have seen growth for sure!  </li>

            <li>I absolutely love this product and plan to continue using it until i reach my desired results!</li>
            <li>This product is very good and gives quick results</li>
            <li>It makes me feel much more beautiful and confident now.    </li>
            <li>Not as quick of results as others I have used, but it is good!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>i was using LiLash (which is amazing)</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s now been 3 months and the result is amazing.</li>
            <li>my eyelashes are amazing.</li>
            <li>It was just amazing...          </li>
            <li>given my experience with Latisse (amazing even after 3 weeks)</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This product worked amazingly.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>but they look amazing.</li>
            <li>A girlfriend has used Latisse and her lashes are amazing</li>
            <li>I have used lilash and had amazing results, I was hoping to find a cheaper alternative with Rapidlash.</li>
            <li>To receive 5 stars in my book a product would have to be out of this world amazing.</li>
            <li>I decided to try Rapidlash because the reviews on Amazon raved about how amazing Rapidlash was.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I never write reviews but this product was amazing.  </li>
            <li>amazing - brows are thicker and fuller a month +</li>
            <li>When I apply mascara it is amazing.</li>
            <li>It is amazing product and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li>my lashes look amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing product</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say, it is the Rapidlash.  </li>
            <li>Now they are full and beautiful again.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes did seem longer, which was a nice.  </li>
            <li>but nothing spectacular</li>
            <li>It does not look faked or anything, it&#x27;s just really nice.</li>
            <li>I do use the product probably 6 out of 7 nights and honestly did not see results until 8 weeks.</li>
            <li>So thrilled; I&#x27;ve been using this for just over TWO WEEKS</li>
            <li>I made sure to apply the serum throughout both top and bottom lashes and had great effects for both.</li>
            <li>To be honest I thought it was a racket, but to my amazement is works wonders.</li>
            <li>your lashes being so nice.</li>
            <li>But there is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>No, you will not keep the wonderful, long, beautiful eyelashes once you stop using the product.</li>
            <li>Excellent .. very ..</li>
            <li>I would rather stick with using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s lash serum and have conditioned, albeit normal-length lashes, than spend the money on BOTH Rapidlash and L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s lash serum, which is what I would need to do in order for Rapidlash to be effective on me at all.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product as not being as effective as the prescription product - but it does work and as I mentioned the prescription product does have its drawbacks.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m not worried to be honest.</li>
            <li>After seeing with my own eyes the results in just a week??</li>
            <li>This absolutely the best product for eyelashe enhancement !</li>
            <li>I will continue to use on eyebrows as it gives a really nice pump to them.</li>
            <li>Did not see a difference honestly.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say it works.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes throw their own shadow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no issues with any kind of irritation or color change in my lids.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say I see a difference when I put on my mascara.</li>
            <li>My wife loves this stuff and is effective for hair grown on her eyelashes and eyebrows.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it is as effective because of this.</li>
            <li>It might even make them fuller (I can&#x27;t judge based on my own eyes</li>
            <li>Not as effective as Latisse.</li>
            <li>Thrilled to find an affordable lash enhancer that works.</li>
            <li>I also found it effective for regrowing the tail of my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Great product that really works!!!</li>
            <li>Almost any mascara will do it&#x27;s job when the lashes are healthy and full!!!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product, particularly for the price.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are sooooo great and long and look wonderful with mascara.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It was pretty incredible.  </li>
            <li>So after I purchased this, I saw better improvements which Im very pleased with.</li>
            <li>Within 4 weeks I saw new growth that impressed me.</li>
            <li>I have used others, including mascaras, but this is by FAR the best, and is amazing.</li>
            <li>but I honestly think it strengthens them and makes any product you place on your lashes much more effective.  </li>
            <li>super great.</li>
            <li>and I had to take a very strong antibiotic.</li>
            <li>The packaging was sealed well and the applicator (which is a lot like eyeliner) was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are healthy so they cooperate much better!</li>
            <li>, they look more healthy and grew a lot and  after a couple of months!</li>
            <li>and I love being able to say no!</li>
            <li>Extremely satisfied! :-)</li>
            <li>That stuff works great, fast, and with noticable results!!</li>
            <li>My natural lashes have never looked so beautiful!  </li>
            <li>This is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>Probably not the best for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>One of the most amazing products I have ever encountered.  </li>
            <li>So pleased with the results I sent the company photos thanking them for the amazing product, and they asked to use my photos.</li>
            <li>I have to say so far I am impressed</li>
            <li>the best there is as far as im concerned.</li>
            <li>Since I was mostly concerned with my eyebrows, I am quite thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>that was more effective, but I can not remember the name of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m considering shopping around with another product and see if I can find one that is more effective.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>So far so good!!</li>
            <li>Will have to keep looking for something suitable for the lashes.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will continue using it.</li>
            <li>Not as effective as Latisse, but better than some versions.</li>
            <li>Not that they were perfect, but there was clearly some growth noticeable.  </li>
            <li>The price is reasonable (it&#x27;s an awesome product), it&#x27;s easy to apply at the lash line and</li>
            <li>Honestly, I was very excited reading the reviews...</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended!</li>
            <li>Love, love LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend!</li>
            <li>They, are now full and longer than the length that they were originally!!!</li>
            <li>Write me if you want to find out details about my wonderful experience (I didn&#x27;t have major side effects and look at the results!).     </li>
            <li>I am getting lots of compliments and everyone wants to know why my lashes look so good!</li>
            <li>Not as good as the original formula but still helps some...expensive too. )-:</li>
            <li>I see so many glowing reviews , but honestly I&#x27;ve had much better results with revitalash.</li>
            <li>First of all, I received it in great condition.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff that really works!</li>
            <li>First it arrive within 2 days which was great.</li>
            <li>It does make my lashes look curly, but I think it&#x27;s make my lashes off quickly too!!</li>
            <li>BUT  and this is very important...</li>
            <li>If you want a real good product that&#x27;s gonna give you a difference in length or fullness is gonna be Latisse, which is PRETTY PRICY but worth it</li>
            <li>The tube of rapidlash from this seller had a nice tube that is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>my lashes are huge!  </li>
            <li>Very happy with product overall and have reordered again.</li>
            <li>works better than one i tried that was more than twice the price.</li>
            <li>Best if used before bed, then it has all night to sit there on your skin, next to the root of the lashes, with no make-up or anything to get in the way.  </li>
            <li>I lost my eyebrows as a teenager to my best friend, who is now a PhD on molecular design: we had an accident at the lab, and the chemicals burned my forehead, leaving me without eyebrows for most of my teen years.</li>
            <li>and i love the results.  </li>
            <li>and they are almost touching my brows just after 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>i saw some growth in eyebrows more than eyelashes.</li>
            <li>my lashes looks so much better now with or without mascara.</li>
            <li>As soon as I got more I started applying it again</li>
            <li>Which would explain why so many rave about its effectiveness and others see no results.  </li>
            <li>I will update my review then : )</li>
            <li>I am going to order more soon, because I don&#x27;t want to be out of it.</li>
            <li>I am SO pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I wanted it more for my eyebrows than eyelashes, but using it on both.</li>
            <li>I applied it to both the top and bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>And I LOVE</li>
            <li>(I used to order this through another beauty website and paid much more for it - I&#x27;m SO GLAD</li>
            <li>So many industries these days have forgotten what &amp;#34;truth in advertising&amp;#34; means in pursuit of the almighty buck.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for my eyebrows mostly but tried it on my lashes as well.</li>
            <li>but I read all the product reviews on the many lash serums Amazon has to offer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many eyelash enhancers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read the instructions many times</li>
            <li>So I will buy aother tube again for sure.</li>
            <li>not as good as latisse but def worth the money.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it took more than two weeks to see the difference.</li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>this is my 4th tube of rapidlash, my second from amazon (they have the best prices)</li>
            <li>I will make sure that I never run out of Rapid Lash.</li>
            <li>One more note, there is more than a two month supply in each tube.  </li>
            <li>As with mascara, I think you can safely use this product for up to three months.</li>
            <li>I used the product every night on both my top and bottom lashes.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I do see improvement in my top lashes.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with this product and will continue to use.</li>
            <li>Buy it, wait for it, and LOVE it too.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s been more than 8 weeks</li>
            <li>Be patient and make sure you get a bottle that is not expired.</li>
            <li>everything looks better.</li>
            <li>Longer, more populated lash areas.</li>
            <li>maaan, okay, I&#x27;m going.</li>
            <li>and I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I should have known better than to apply some product to my eyes..</li>
            <li>so I wanted something to make my eyes pop more.</li>
            <li>I did not do it on my lower lashline, nor on my brows, so I do not know if the product gives you undereye circles or if it helps growing your brows (which I am sure it helps,</li>
            <li>I still apply the serum every night, just to see, if it can get even better.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this product elsewhere and have been pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>it was the most reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I try not to skip too many days.</li>
            <li>For best results you are supposed to apply it on daily</li>
            <li>I use it all the time, I&#x27;m on my 4th tube, I love the results.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll love the results.</li>
            <li>So after having used Latisse, it was interesting to see how this would match up.    </li>
            <li>so no eye lid pigmentation, which I love.      </li>
            <li>I love this product and it does work.</li>
            <li>As for my wish of having more eyelashes, that seems to be improving as well.</li>
            <li>I was sure</li>
            <li>I love that.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t afford to order more than one at a time.  </li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to spend over $100 on the lash lengthening with the dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>I knew it was truly working :)    </li>
            <li>Rapid Lash is such a wonderful and innovative product.</li>
            <li>They look so lovely.</li>
            <li>cheers  :)</li>
            <li>sure you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If ever you do, rinse out eyes throughly with appropriate eyewash or eyedrops and re-apply if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The effect is most noticeable with mascara.</li>
            <li>I feel I am getting better results.  </li>
            <li>love it product made my eyelashes and brows thicker and longer.</li>
            <li>With that said, I was still able to manage approx.</li>
            <li>The price on this site was fantastic; so I ordered two!</li>
            <li>it really works and i am really happy with the results.</li>
            <li>One downside is that my eyes are definitely more red/bloodshot after I started using this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li>I have not had any side effects with this product and have been generally pleased with the results and will buy another bottle as I am now coming to the end of mine after 6 weeks of use every night.</li>
            <li>love this product.  </li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>It worked fabulously for me!</li>
            <li>What are you waiting for?? :-)</li>
            <li>Reviews said it&#x27;d just make them longer, not fuller, but I feel like I do have more lashes, but I&#x27;ll have to check my before pix to make sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought it just might produce better results.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a better product yet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my lashes take to mascara a lot better.</li>
            <li>I have received so many compliments.</li>
            <li>had more product in it</li>
            <li>A sexy camel.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product.</li>
            <li>It was a better price</li>
            <li>In fact, my lashes seem more brittle than before.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the eye brows of my youth but what I do have now is much better than before.</li>
            <li>So 100% sure its helping my lashes to stay put.</li>
            <li>After using it for a couple more wks I had eye lashes w/o any gaps and they were a lot longer.     </li>
            <li>My brows are much better from it to.</li>
            <li>They love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Rapidlash for a couple of years now and love it.  </li>
            <li>and it seems like many ppl didn&#x27;t experience a side effect,</li>
            <li>but there was definitely more amount which made it look thicker,</li>
            <li>however i think this thing works exceptionally good for my lashes since i haven&#x27;t read any comments from ppl that stats lash growth in like 2 days, but do think this product is worth the money</li>
            <li>Based on all the great reviews, I ordered this and was really hoping that it would work.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found that Ardell&#x27;s Brow and Lash Accelerator works much better for me, at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love the product...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ussed this product for a couple of years and love it..</li>
            <li>I  re-read the directions one more time and decided to give it one more month trial</li>
            <li>Gave one to my sister love it.</li>
            <li>More tingling than anything.</li>
            <li>MORE LASHES FALL OUT,</li>
            <li>THANKS FOR A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure that it is having an effect on the eyebrow, but I will continue the treatment.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Rapidlash with good success for a couple of years now.  </li>
            <li>I have used LiLash previously w/ outstanding results.  </li>
            <li>But it DOES work:-)</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle and am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Although Rapidlash does work to extend eyelash growth, one or more of its ingredients can also darken the skin where it is applied.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more of this.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>ok need to try it longer</li>
            <li>It works, there is nothing more to say.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased this, I have seen a difference in the length of my lashes , just wonder if it can be used on the lower lashes, I would purchase this product again .</li>
            <li>I love to use eye lash enhancers.  </li>
            <li>I have used Lash MD products and like those a lot better.</li>
            <li>RapidLash works better than I could have ever hoped for.</li>
            <li>but we always want more.</li>
            <li>The visible difference in the length of the eyelashes has been the most noticeable part.</li>
            <li>Now, I love showing my lashes off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>I used Lash Genesis and that was definitely better, however about $20 more, so you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this every night as I should, it&#x27;s more like every couple of nights.</li>
            <li>I bought this many years ago while it costed me about $50 each.</li>
            <li>I applied it every night before bed, just the top eye lid.</li>
            <li>I love it  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>However, for 30 dollars it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I cannot recommend this product any more than I do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying the results.</li>
            <li>I love it though.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Vitamin E and Vaseline worked ok, both kept my eyelashes moisturized and a gave me a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; both to my skin and lashes.</li>
            <li>sure you use it every night</li>
            <li>I was so pleased that I ordered a bottle for my mom for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t lose so many.</li>
            <li>As a result, I have more lashes and they look fuller.</li>
            <li>That said, I enjoyed them while I had them.</li>
            <li>and I found my eyelashes and more prone to breakage</li>
            <li>I paid about $50 after shipping and I am thoroughly pleased by the product.</li>
            <li>Anyone used for a year or more that could weigh in?</li>
            <li>I applied it every night on my top lashes, bottom lashes, and brows.</li>
            <li>I did not gain Brooke Shields brows, just better healthier brows.</li>
            <li>Anything is better than what I had before.</li>
            <li>Most people saw results within 3-6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Maybe with more time.  </li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>It does work, so; therefore I reordered 2 more.</li>
            <li>I will give it 4 more</li>
            <li>I also made sure it doesn&#x27;t have prostaglandin or parabens which cause most side effect problems</li>
            <li>This product is worthwhile and you save a ton of money by purchasing on Amazon versus at a boutique.</li>
            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>The price is so much better through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Latisse is much, much better.</li>
            <li>I am still using it and hope to see greater changes ahead.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before, and I love it.</li>
            <li>This product has a lot more quantity, but the quality seems to be lacking.</li>
            <li>and I really love it</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still quite satisfied with this product  and will keep using it.</li>
            <li>I have 2 more weeks to see the ending results.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to use this and had hoped for great results.</li>
            <li>But I will say that if you aren&#x27;t allergic to it, it appears to work for many people.  </li>
            <li>Okay product.  </li>
            <li>(Rapidlash comes with an eyeliner brush-like wand in the tube, and you apply the product like you would eyeliner), so I tried applying the product more liberally.</li>
            <li>If I need thicker eyelashes. :)</li>
            <li>The effect is more noticeble with my make up on and now my morninig routine gives me so much pleasure,also during the day im so confident with my apperiance,cause my lashes look great.</li>
            <li>I have just recieved my product and before using it I looked on the bottom to make sure of the \\&quot;expiration date\\&quot;, since I&#x27;ve seen so many complaints about the product.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work whatsoever for my eyebrows, I was really hoping it would work since I saw all the great reviews for it.</li>
            <li>I have used Rapidlash for one month and just ordered more.</li>
            <li>I love this product , I can see the diference in my eyebrowns</li>
            <li>and I also started wearing the Grand Lash Mascara that was recommended</li>
            <li>Friends asked me what mascara I was using because my lashes looked that much better.</li>
            <li>Most customers say it takes 4 weeks to see results so the jury&#x27;s still out.</li>
            <li>Boy, am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>It anything, lost more lashes.</li>
            <li>They all work well, but some are easier to apply than others and some just work better.  </li>
            <li>If I had to choose a favorite, this would be it.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product that really works.  </li>
            <li>My eyelashes are longer-not thicker, but baby hairs are growing in which might result in a more voluminous effect.</li>
            <li>#*##* and boy am I glad I tried this.</li>
            <li>Wish I had taken before and after cuz I think it works better than La#*##*...</li>
            <li>MUCH better than 3 layers of mascara and a prayer, like on most mornings.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I just wish it would fill in the bald spots more.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;ve had it about a week, and so I waited to write this review.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s stunning.</li>
            <li>It worked better then Lattise did for me</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 2 years now, and love how my lashes look.</li>
            <li>I had tried a similiar product before but this one works much better.  </li>
            <li>and then when I put mascara they even look better.  </li>
            <li>It took about a month to show, but it has maintained and really looks great.  </li>
            <li>Mac&#x27;s lash serum worked WAY better for me.</li>
            <li>whereas before it was more of a futile exercise.</li>
            <li>I am buying more and I hope they never stop making it, because I am never again going to quit using it.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>FABULOUS!  </li>
            <li>Not all that pleased with item.</li>
            <li>It was Ok</li>
            <li>I am glad I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this product.</li>
            <li>I will say that I have had much better results on my eyelashes than eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I love this product ,and have tried many.........</li>
            <li>i love this</li>
            <li>will sure buy again and also I have recommended to friends.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several brands of eyelash enhancing serum and this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>I was not so sure about how it works when I was reading reviews.</li>
            <li>surely helps my eyelash and eyebrow to grow longer.</li>
            <li>and I am sure you will notice much more length.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So glad I did.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s anything to complain about, it&#x27;s that the product works better and faster than advertised.</li>
            <li>You can see my picture below for the after results! :)</li>
            <li>I now have better lashes than when I was in my 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li>eyebrows looks better now&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months, and I love what it&#x27;s done for my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>so I mostly use the serum for my eye brows ...</li>
            <li>It does build up, so for best results, exfoliate the area regularly.</li>
            <li>I saw that many people rated it 5.</li>
            <li>and im glad i did.</li>
            <li>I feel like they&#x27;re softer and in better condition too.</li>
            <li>I guess from the description of the product, I was expecting much more.</li>
            <li>Yeah, sure.  </li>
            <li>I did not have any discomfort using the product, besides that i thought it gave me more eye crust in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I also use the Ardell lash conditioner before mascara (got it here-super cheap!)</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Surely I will continue buying the product..</li>
            <li>My girlfriend bought this product through my account, and it&#x27;s her writing this review. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>And it seems like I have more lashes.</li>
            <li>You see the difference more with mascara.</li>
            <li>No type of mascara would make my lashes look any better.</li>
            <li>I consider it one of my best daily beauty rituals.</li>
            <li>I put it on brows and top and bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>The eyelash extensions ruined my eyelashes and broke/made most of them fall out.</li>
            <li>They are closer to my idea of perfection. :)</li>
            <li>, just hope they don&#x27;t catch on start charging more...</li>
            <li>If you are healthy and take vitamins it will work faster.</li>
            <li>For the price I thought I&#x27;d try it sure am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 yrs and love the results.</li>
            <li>This works phenomenally well for both</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>helps make my lashes look so much better (with the help of mascara).  </li>
            <li>This product more than lived up to my expectations</li>
            <li>still i love the results i got.</li>
            <li>the instructions say to apply the product on the top lid lashes, in doing this i also put the product on the bottom side of my top lid lashes (if you can stand to get some in your eye).</li>
            <li>AND IT WORKED EVEN BETTER FOR HER.</li>
            <li>i did apply one coat of mascara so you can see the length much better.</li>
            <li>I used Latisse and it worked much MUCH better.</li>
            <li>Just be patient and you will love the results.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Lashes held mascara better.</li>
            <li>I read many beauty blogs and this was recommended on more than one.  </li>
            <li>I noticed it most when I was using my eye lash curler.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my lashes.</li>
            <li>I would say this product is okay.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>So based off our experiences I would say it works better for growing your eyelashes vs brows.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars on the off chance it will be better if I use it longer.</li>
            <li>My best friend has been using it for years, and I finally decided to try it for myself!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems that correct application, right at the roots, helps keep the hair follicles in good condition.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, you&#x27;ll see results after a week, my lashes grew fuller and longer, I&#x27;ve tried other products that make you&#x27;re lashes look stringing, this one is great</li>
            <li>I was very excited about my eyelash enhance serum</li>
            <li>and she has noticed a very significant difference.</li>
            <li>It has barely no odor which is awesome</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>i get so many compliments on my lashes and it makes putting on mascara so fun!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now much more fun to apply mascara!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that with consistent use, this does indeed help my lashes look more visible (with a good mascara, of course).</li>
            <li>I have been using it for three months now and happy and excited to say that I now have recognizable brows and lashes.</li>
            <li>I have experienced eyelash regrowth of normal eyelashes; like they used to be.  </li>
            <li>Using it for 3 days, I already could feel my eyelids becoming a bit more sensative and developing pinkish circles under my eyelids.</li>
            <li>and now they are long and beautiful!!  </li>
            <li>and now after a month, I have wonderful long lashes.</li>
            <li>I am extremely impressed and will continue to use this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li>After four weeks my eyelashes looked long and beautiful!  </li>
            <li>and together they are doing a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product.  </li>
            <li>Every morning I&#x27;m excited to put on my mascara and play them up!</li>
            <li>Within a month my eyelashes looked significantly longer!</li>
            <li>I am just excited to see how my eyelashes will look after a month!</li>
            <li>I am happy to see the new growth, and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>On the bright side, my right eye seems fine.</li>
            <li>With age, my lashes have thinned and seem to fall out more easily.  </li>
            <li>This is the best single cosmetic item I have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I can see a huge diffrence in my eye lashes:)</li>
            <li>Given the fantastic results with my brows, I was hoping for a more &amp;#34;falsie&amp;#34; eyelash look, but I&#x27;m still happy with what I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
            <li>Why, when a company has a great product, do they always cheap out later and lesses the effective product...</li>
            <li>But I decided to give this a try since my lashes were becoming sparser and shorter.  </li>
            <li>Mascara goes on and comes off more smoothly, resulting in fewer lashes coming off.</li>
            <li>Lashes were becoming sparce as were my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Amazon offers a great price(around 23 dollars) too</li>
            <li>but so far I haven&#x27;t experienced that.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes, which is great, but shows the serum is on the weaker side.</li>
            <li>I thought Walgreens was more credible.</li>
            <li>I am amazed to see that it is so cheap on amazon because this product really works, honestly I would have continued paying $50 to get it!</li>
            <li>They were also incredibly swollen and red.</li>
            <li>After about four months of use, I do not even wear ANY mascara and have had many people comment on how beautifully i apply my &amp;#34;false lashes.&amp;#34;  I am telling you this because I have never had anything actually work like it promised</li>
            <li>So far this product is working great.</li>
            <li>Oh yea it works longer grows brows also love this product just have to keep using it no fake lashes for me or extensions to break my own lashes</li>
            <li>Great delivered quick been using for a month noticed a real difference in my eyebrows not my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it</li>
            <li>My original lashes are okay</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an experienced user of different brands of lash growth serum, and a huge advocate because they&#x27;ve all worked!</li>
            <li>it is easy to apply and I have never gotten any in my eye..</li>
            <li>Received product very quick.</li>
            <li>So it works, and I found it easy to apply with no stinging etc.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply each evening.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, once a day before bed.  </li>
            <li>If you can put eyeliner on then you can do this, it&#x27;s that easy.</li>
            <li>What I am noticing now is the lashes are not breaking as easily, will continue.</li>
            <li>It came very quick, I started using it immediately, and started seeing results within 4 days.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, just apply before going to bed at night.</li>
            <li>so I access it easily before going to sleep.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and produced the results I wanted.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and observable results in 2 weeks or so.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply easy to use too.</li>
            <li>Very quickly too</li>
            <li>The serum is easy to apply and I didn&#x27;t experience any stinging or burning.</li>
            <li>It works to condition that skin very quickly.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this to keep my lashes strong.</li>
            <li>I have a  fair complexion and older thus my hair and eyelashes are thinning a often brittle.  </li>
            <li>Initially, I liked this product very much.</li>
            <li>They were long, strong, and looked incredible.</li>
            <li>and apparently this isn&#x27;t that uncommon with this product.</li>
            <li>It is true, that when you wake up in the morning, your eyes have more of that</li>
            <li>Within a week I saw my eyebrows starting to fill in beautifully.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for 4 years on and off mostly on , but take breaks to get full effect again when restarting.</li>
            <li>and I honestly didn&#x27;t feel like it was working until 2 months after my first use.</li>
            <li>Rapidlash is hands down the best!  </li>
            <li>I though have to say that if you stop using it they will look exactly the same as before, so you must use it permanently if you want to keep that wonderful look.</li>
            <li>I am not super impressed.  </li>
            <li>My first tube of Rapidlash from a local housewares store was awesome.  </li>
            <li>Overall, im pretty happy with this product!</li>
            <li>but that is fine with me.</li>
            <li>i LOVE the product, it really works! :)</li>
            <li>Quick delivery!  </li>
            <li>the price - can&#x27;t beat it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly and neatly packaged!</li>
            <li>Works quickly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those lucky ones!</li>
            <li>This works super well!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t seem much thicker, but they are for sure longer and darker!</li>
            <li>So glad I checked here first!</li>
            <li>I can say they have a very pretty curl now!</li>
            <li>At first I used a safety pin to separate them, but I discovered a used, clean mascara wand does an effective job of detangling all the knots.</li>
            <li>wrote to the company to ask a question about ingredients, and got a very quick, friendly</li>
            <li>They are darker, too which is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>I am not saying this is a miracle for your lashes, but it is a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li>and I have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>So here is what made a HUGE difference once I figured things out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They make a huge difference in my look.</li>
            <li>I started using this and after about a month I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Just started it so can&#x27;t give it an accurate rating as of yet...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced no side-effects; only fabulous lashes.</li>
            <li>and I have been telling everyone I know about this fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>with free shipping.</li>
            <li>One happy customer did the research for customers looking and talked about the peptides in this product and only 2 others.</li>
            <li>My brows have filled in too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to follw the direction as noted on the package.</li>
            <li>Ita has shown great improvement in her overall legnth and thickness in her lashes.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m really happy that it helped me grow the hair in my brows back.</li>
            <li>After using 1 month each night, my gap is now filled in, and my lashes are noticeably longer.  </li>
            <li>My lashes were thicker(and somewhat coarser), and some sparse areas actually filled in.</li>
            <li>, I inspect every day in day light.</li>
            <li>Renewlash is no longer available on the market .</li>
            <li>Lashes are important to me.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using rapid lash, they have filled in and grown.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and one that actually does what promises!</li>
            <li>I came really close to forking out the $100 a month and getting those amazing eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li>Knowing how fast and effective</li>
            <li>I used this product after trying the &amp;#34;more expensive&amp;#34; brand that is available.  </li>
            <li>Feel free to drop a comment and let me know if you like it.</li>
            <li>and if I&#x27;m having a makeup free weekend day I&#x27;ll apply it in the morning as well.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes used to be sparse and light and now they&#x27;re fuller and longer.</li>
            <li>So be sure to apply this when all make-up is removed on a freshly washed face.</li>
            <li>In fact, I don&#x27;t even have to use some advanced mascaras anymore.</li>
            <li>I bought it to replace Revitalash, which was no longer available.</li>
            <li>But they really did curl my lashes nicely.  </li>
            <li>It took about 3 weeks for me to notice a change in the lenth of lashes and my brows filled in where I applied product.</li>
            <li>It is a fantastic feel to know that I have the longest lashes in my family now.    </li>
            <li>but I started with LiLash product and got fantastic results.</li>
            <li>It took about two weeks of daily usage (for the lashes themselves to grow out), but once they started growing my lashes looked great.</li>
            <li>After 8 weeks it completely filled in.</li>
            <li>So I was using lumigan for eyelash growth because I had this hookup with this doctor who gave me all sorts of free samples of the stuff...  </li>
            <li>My eyelashes looked fantastic with lumigan</li>
            <li>I bought RapidLash primarily for eyebrow growth.</li>
            <li>Without mascara there isn&#x27;t a difference because my lashes are light brown.</li>
            <li>It has really filled in my lashes.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product and think it works.</li>
            <li>It is so obvious that I am happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>, I can say it worth waiting :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m soooo happy with Rapid Lash that I will be reordering as soon as I start to run low on it!  </li>
            <li>It even grew my lower lashes, which I never had any of my entire makeup wearing life, lol.</li>
            <li>Since I have light eyes</li>
            <li>I want to make sure I don&#x27;t have any darkening of the pupil which can happen to some people on rare occasions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Being a former Latisse user and had GREAT results I thought I would try this in an effort to save some money.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Now, if this serum could make my eyelashes thicker (or more plentiful), it would be worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li>After all ladies, we all deserve to look fabulous.</li>
            <li>Used daily, works great.</li>
            <li>I used it every night for a month and one day realized my lashes were darker and longer, which is great because I am a blonde.</li>
            <li>and I have long beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li>People were complimenting me on my long, beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>Yes, Latiisse did work,  made my eyelashes darker and longer, but good lord, I just could not, with a clear conscience , keep paying the $125 a month upkeep it required.</li>
            <li>People tell me all the time what beautiful long lashes I have</li>
            <li>I had some good results and by the second month I can truthfully say I  know this product works for me.</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle of SmartLash at an entry level price elsewhere, and loved it, but could not afford to buy more at the regular price.  </li>
            <li>but I just want my own lashes as nice as possible</li>
            <li>With this, so far so good....</li>
            <li>So far so good, about 3-4 weeks using it</li>
            <li>and I have beautiful LONG lashes now!</li>
            <li>Of the two products I was interested in, I selected this one because it had a lot of positive reviews and cost wise</li>
            <li>Was so excited about using this product with all the great reviews until I saw a recent post regarding product being expired.</li>
            <li>I originally started using this product a few years ago and was impressed by the results.</li>
            <li>Very allergic!!!</li>
            <li>one tube lasted me two months, i have purchased my second tube and can&#x27;t wait to see even better results!!</li>
            <li>Very useful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The public response to my eyelashes has been so strong that I am bolder, more assertive, and more confident than ever before.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference within two weeks and today, after 3 months of use before bed each night, my lashes are full, long and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Wow!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>then I kept putting more, twice a day, and I have really long and full lashes!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27; doesn&#x27;t itch if when it comes in contact with eyes which is a good thing because am super sensitive.</li>
            <li>Such an amazing product!</li>
            <li>and I am still working on the original tube from August.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to order more, however it did not work like it did the first time I bought it.</li>
            <li>I thought it was fun to have longer lashes!</li>
            <li>I was so excited by the outcome.</li>
            <li>It is DEFINITELY worth a try!</li>
            <li>Have to say that I&#x27;m pretty pleased with my results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and have noticed a significant amount of growth in both lashes and brows.</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey, but it is worth it!</li>
            <li>I was so excited about this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to share my experience with everyone that I even posted my photo that I took today.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes grew some, and they looked pretty healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a month, twice a day on most days (esp the first 2 wks)..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li>After using the product since July I&#x27;ve seen a significant change in hair growth.</li>
            <li>So I just finished my first one ( making sure I get every drop)</li>
            <li>Hopefully, I will see results by the time I&#x27;m finished with the first tube, at which time I will be able to give it a rating.</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>and I can see significant change on my eyelash</li>
            <li>My lashes were twice as long and looked great with mascara on.</li>
            <li>but I lost a significant amount , I continued to use though thinking I just need to persist  ; but  after  3 wks without any improvement I&#x27;ve stopped.</li>
            <li>with that I saw a significant growth in the length though no changes in the thickness.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a significant difference in the length of my lashes.</li>
            <li>I noticed the most effect within the first two months of use, and now it&#x27;s just part of my bedtime routine</li>
            <li>they are real! :)</li>
            <li>Original Review:  </li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>SIGNIFICANTLY.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get better faster results, your lashes won&#x27;t shed as much and your results lasts!</li>
            <li>Although I do not see an AMAZING amount of new eye lashes...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hooked and for fear of losing these new lashes, which honestly feel like someone else&#x27;s lashes</li>
            <li>Rapid Lash serum was recommended by a friend who saw results with new lashes (she lost her own)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different lash growth products but this one has the best results by far.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll get so many compliments for your eyelashes, you&#x27;ll get tired of hearing them, LOL!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t experience the kind of length you get with Latisse, but for a fraction of the price, I&#x27;m pleased with Rapid Lash and have ordered a second tube.      </li>
            <li>I use it nightly on clean lashes</li>
            <li>I would love this product so much more if it didn&#x27;t make me completely miserable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its light and the liquid dries fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 3 weeks of continuous use and my natural lashes are definitely more uniform and longer!  </li>
            <li>After reading many reviews, I had a feeling that barely no one claimed to have these kind of side effects.</li>
            <li>I run out of this bottle, I certainly plan on buying more</li>
            <li>and YES, I will buy another bottle right now, just to keep my lashes the way they are now!</li>
            <li>The price is right!</li>
            <li>My daughter noticed right away after I hadn&#x27;t seen her for a month, with no mascara on!  </li>
            <li>I have never had lashes this full and long and my eyebrows which previously were skimpy at best, have filled in nicely.   </li>
            <li>After years of trying tons of products with minimal or no results I am happy to say I found this product.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m very happy with the improvement so far, still holding my breath tho, because I want to see how long the lashes will grow to.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it is because I don&#x27;t wear make-up every day that it took me so long to realize that this stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I used every night so far and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>I even used this for my 7 year old niece, and the result is amazing.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait until it&#x27;s been 6 weeks to see the full effect...</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, this actually works!</li>
            <li>Thats how much I love this product, it really work, and Ive tryed everything on the market.</li>
            <li>i absolutley love this product, i get comments all the time from people asking me if my lashes are real.</li>
            <li>It looked cool.</li>
            <li>I am truely amazed.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works - mostly for length.</li>
            <li>I bought this product to replace my love for the very costly Latisse.</li>
            <li>Last time it worked so good</li>
            <li>My lower lashes are MUCH longer than they used to be and my top lashes are denser and thicker.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought so many cosmetics that make the claim &amp;#34;You&#x27;ll see a difference!&amp;#34;, and I really didn&#x27;t see any difference at all.</li>
            <li>This one absolutely does what it claims - my lashes grew, and grew, to the extent that I could feel the ends of my lashes touch my eyelids, and could feel them touching the inside of my reading glasses.  </li>
            <li>Like others have commented, it seems like the tube wasn&#x27;t quite full</li>
            <li>It is true that there is side affects.</li>
            <li>Not quite as good as my last lash stuff, but still makes my lashes a bit darker and longer!</li>
            <li>My lashes are full and longer.</li>
            <li>Debated trying Latisse, but this is much more reasonable and the applicator is a cinch to use.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product</li>
            <li>Says you won&#x27;t see full effects for 16 weeks,  </li>
            <li>I used up a bottle of Latisse and noticed obvious good results.  </li>
            <li>Can not say enough good things.</li>
            <li>only good for length</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to invest this much in a product I wasn&#x27;t really sure of.  </li>
            <li>I am a fair skinned, blonde gal and</li>
            <li>I honestly could not tell if that was just the natural growth of my lashes.</li>
            <li>Well, I do not need a pic to see a difference, I have  much more and much longer lashes than ever before in my life.</li>
            <li>Once you have opened the product - it is only good for a year.  </li>
            <li>I still wear mascara, but now my lashes are very noticeable and I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li>I used mascara and it really made them &#x27;pop even more&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>One bottle will last a good two months</li>
            <li>That will be the real test :-)  </li>
            <li>I decided that I would give it a full 8 weeks before giving up use.</li>
            <li>but this is a true exception.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s good enough for now.</li>
            <li>It has really worked for me :)</li>
            <li>It does work, but it takes a good, solid month of application to see a difference.  </li>
            <li>I love that it works fast and doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn my eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now a true believer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I see the best results in the least amount of time.</li>
            <li>Full results around 8 weeks.</li>
            <li>I know that Latisse takes 16 weeks to see full effects</li>
            <li>my eyelashes are still full.</li>
            <li>This product made my eyes very itchy and I will not be able to use it for that reason.</li>
            <li>I apply it once per night, and I am still using my second tube in May, so I&#x27;d say it lasts a fair amount of time.  </li>
            <li>The product is good til last day of January 2015.</li>
            <li>I noticed my eyelashes weren&#x27;t as full as they used to be</li>
            <li>so over all  Rapidlash is not a bad product but doesn&#x27;t do what it claims</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.     </li>
            <li>No bad side effects at all.</li>
            <li>I rarely leave much feedback or reviews..unless it&#x27;s something that works!!!</li>
            <li>Used it previously with good results and now improving on those results with this latest purchase.</li>
            <li>Let me mention , I do have good lashes, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I live in South Korea and they are HUGE on lashes here, kinda funny.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work as quickly but it does work eventually</li>
            <li>I started to notice a difference after about a month but after consistent use for several months the result are amazing!</li>
            <li>, this product contains isopropyl cloprostenate, the main ingredient that makes lashes darker, fuller &amp; more youthful.</li>
            <li>I wanted this to be quick and</li>
            <li>so I stopped it and the eyes cleared up quickly.</li>
            <li>I was lucky, as I did not have an allergic reaction as some buyers explained.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was amazing, regular free shipping got the product to me in a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>but i wasn&#x27;t that lucky with it.</li>
            <li>I do not make any claims that it helps grow lashes, but I have noticed my eyelashes are not falling out as quickly as they were before I started using it.  </li>
            <li>I quickly reviewed before bc</li>
            <li>but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>I think this product mainly keeps your lashes nourished and in better shape</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of the lash enhancing products and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is, for the price I paid for Rapidlash and the expectations I had for it (based on the reviews), I do not find it a worthy product.</li>
            <li>and my lashes quickly became longer, fuller and curlier.</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to eyelash extensions which I had done once and loved but found too expensive to up</li>
            <li>Be sure to only apply along the lash line on TOP side of the lid to avoid getting it in your eye.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, I&#x27;ve  been using this product for several years and it definitely works.</li>
            <li>sure to only use this on the top lash line.</li>
            <li>I guess I expected more, lashes are bit longer but nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>This company lost a loyal customer for life.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both Latisse and the original Revitalash turned my eyelids red but gave me amazing full lashes.</li>
            <li>beautiful lashes little effort</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend Rapidlash and have to many of my friends after they noticed the difference.</li>
            <li>Also, by doubling up on the products, it&#x27;s so much more high maintenance, which is also annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Two years ago I used Lilash and love the results, but not having access to it this time I had high hopes for rapid lash.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend :)</li>
            <li>I finally spent the money to try Latisse after using Rapidlash successfully for 2 years.</li>
            <li>My lashes were falling out and becoming very sparse.</li>
            <li>Overall, though, I am very, very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Like so many others I was very surprised at the efficacy of this product and how quickly one can see results.</li>
            <li>Now at 12 weeks, my top lashes are more than 1/4\\&quot; long - some almost 1/2\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any impressive ingredients, but my lashes grew back long, thicker and darker.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the same tube for 5 months now and I am pretty good with applying it everynight.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the price because I JUST finished the first tube (it came 2 to a pack), so it&#x27;s very economical.</li>
            <li>it really works!!</li>
            <li>This really works!!</li>
            <li>Having long lashes does make you look younger and more attractive.  </li>
            <li>I only applied the serum to the top lashes first to make sure I wouldn&#x27;t break out in some sort of allergy.</li>
            <li>I am 62 and gave up on having pretty eyes, but now, even without mascara, I have lashes again!</li>
            <li>someone from the company must be sitting and typing these reviews all day, because it really does NOTHING!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any results at first but like everything else this product needs to be used with patience!</li>
            <li>I am still on my first tube of this stuff, and for the price you pay, this is so worth it!  </li>
            <li>My lashes are longer and look MUCH fuller!!</li>
            <li>It really works!!</li>
            <li>But....I was amazed to discover that after about using this for 4 weeks on my eyelashes and eyebrows, it really works!!</li>
            <li>I did use it during the day, when I did not wear make-up, (for the first 2 weeks), and I think maybe this gave me a jump start on results!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really like it!!</li>
            <li>Absolutely makes the lashes noticeably longer!!</li>
            <li>Thanks Rapidlash for making a quality product!!</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was just my imagination or the mascara I was using, but no matter what brand I used, my lashes were there!  </li>
            <li>It really does what it promises!!  </li>
            <li>I think this stuff worked after the first use!  </li>
            <li>I noticed my lashes were longer after the FIRST USE!  </li>
            <li>my first tube just ran out!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t actually see any new lashes but the length and thickness seemed greatly improved.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are not particularly longer (that I can tell) but they are thicker and fuller and look wonderful with brown/black mascara (I have blonde lashes</li>
            <li>Think, for the price ( even now it more expensive ) , it is very good</li>
            <li>Amazing is the only word I can find to describe, can&#x27;t imagine how this can work, but it does.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is intense even when you apply with a light hand.</li>
            <li>its MUCH MUCH cheaper then getting lashes done and filled every 2-3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>It works amazingly well and now several of my friends are trying it also!</li>
            <li>I used Eye-lite Double Lash Eyelash(which is also popular) before rapidlash, but eye-lite didn&#x27;t have the result as rapidlash.</li>
            <li>Worth a try, though.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>Make sure the serum dries completely before you go to sleep.    </li>
            <li>I have read a couple of times, that after more time, your lashes get a natural curl and tend to get darker than without using the product..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth doing at this price.  </li>
            <li>Worth a try</li>
            <li>I store mine upright, for what its worth.</li>
            <li>When I later had a question about dates on the product, the seller answered promptly and courteously.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product last year and was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I never write reviews, but this is worth writing about.  </li>
            <li>This is worth it.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, and believe me, it is so worth</li>
            <li>Of course, I thought it was probably a hoax, but worth a try.  </li>
            <li>She says its worth the money.</li>
            <li>Its worth the money</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems like Rapidlash works for a lot of people, but it may be worth it to give the Ardell Accelerator a try before spending money on this.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the $30.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely worth trying.</li>
            <li>I applied this product nightly and within 6 weeks noticed a nice lengthening and darkening to my upper lashes!</li>
            <li>Also worth noting that I got it in my eye a couple of times and didn&#x27;t have any burning.</li>
            <li>So worth it.</li>
            <li>As you see I think it&#x27;s worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>I am going to look for a more natural route for eye lash growth that will not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>I used to use Latisse, and got nice results, but Latisse irritates my eyes and I look blood shot with red veins running through my eyes, so I won&#x27;t use it anymore.  </li>
            <li>Best eyelash enhancement product I have ever tired-</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it if its effect stops working after a while.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it and</li>
            <li>(Don&#x27;t expect drastic miracles, but it&#x27;s worth a try if your lashes are struggling.)</li>
            <li>But, for me it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>It was worth the price</li>
            <li>I always loved my eye lashes, never really wanted or needed them to be longer or thicker.</li>
            <li>Worth a try.    </li>
            <li>stuff well worth it.</li>
            <li>I have seen many of these products on the market and the prices vary considerably.  </li>
            <li>I make sure I apply it directly on my lash line and in between the rows of hair.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>this one is worth the praise.  </li>
            <li>I do, however think it&#x27;s worth the shot.</li>
            <li>Better off using something natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product before and had success.</li>
            <li>have never have beautiful lashes, they are naturally straight down.</li>
            <li>I have some very sparse spots on my lower lashes, and now I am seeing very fine, stubby new growth.</li>
            <li>I had originally tried the prescription Latisse and found this product to actually work better for me.  </li>
            <li>It has significantly grown my lashes and just made them overall a better and fuller shape.</li>
            <li>I did experience a mild tingling sensation at first and occassional itching, but nothing that lasted longer than a minute.  </li>
            <li>When I first started using this, it did mildly sting my eyelids, but I would go away after a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>and I can really see my eyelash growing significantly.</li>
            <li>, how ever you have to keep using the product to kept the length of your lashes other wise</li>
            <li>I already had long eyelashes but this made them so much more voluminous!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced minor irritation, only in the first week of use, and easily resolved with eye drops.</li>
            <li>cause they were bugging me they&#x27;d come right out.</li>
            <li>It works, I noticed results right away.</li>
            <li>During those 5 weeks I started to get itchy right where I would apply it</li>
            <li>I got a infection in my right lid.</li>
            <li>All I do is gingerly comb through them with an eyelash brush and it comes right out, no problem.</li>
            <li>and it blends right in.</li>
            <li>This made me skip the treatment some nights, and then the growth effect wore right off.  </li>
            <li>I emailed the seller and amazon refunded my money right away.</li>
            <li>I got this within 2 days and right away I put it on.</li>
            <li>and my face went through the wind shield leaving me a scar right on my lash line</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it right now to plump my lashes for my upcoming wedding.</li>
            <li>To remember to apply at bedtime, I keep it right beside my skincare and lip balm.</li>
            <li>This was the right price</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have the dark lid effect some spoke of, and I put it on before bed on top of eye moisturizer right along the lash line, but I&#x27;m sure it smeared all over the place.</li>
            <li>I am pretty satisfied so far with the growth</li>
            <li>First of all, I started with ok lashes as far as length and thickness.</li>
            <li>I have long, straight and fair at the tips eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Experienced some itching and mild redness initially for only about a week when I started using it.</li>
            <li>But somewhere around the 2 month or so mark, I began to notice my marykay mascara (in which previously was \\&quot;just ok\\&quot; ) was looking better and better with each application.</li>
            <li>I have used Rapidlash in the past and it worked great.</li>
            <li>and I look much younger and more full of life thanks to my longer lashes!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>I now have my own beautiful thick, long lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 69 years young and have beautiful long lashes thanks to Rapidlash.</li>
            <li>My lashes have NEVER been so long and nice.</li>
            <li>Noticed lashes are more prominent and eyebrows a little thicker.  </li>
            <li>Within a week I could see that the patches that were completely missing lashes had filled in, after a month I saw significant growth - my lashes are longer and somewhat darker and MUCH better than they were before I started using this product.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when relatives started commenting on my lashes, asking what kind of mascara I was using because my lashes were looking long!</li>
            <li>but instead I will just order a new one...and not every give her something free again...</li>
            <li>I noticed results right after the first week.  </li>
            <li>It works great, especially when I remember to use it several nights in a row.  </li>
            <li>last week I noticed that my lashes were looking great with mascara, when I removed the mascara I saw that the ones I lost were back and</li>
            <li>application is really easy, no makeup on, and you apply that clear liquid all over your lash line (like if you were lining your eyes).</li>
            <li>I no longer wear black mascara-the results are that good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still a believer, though, so I purchased my third tube through Amazon last month (at a great price, too -</li>
            <li>I received it super fast and try to give everyone 5 stars..</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast though...</li>
            <li>I recently looked back at some close up face pictures of myself and couldn&#x27;t believe how great my lashes looked compared to the way they now looked.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with this product and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>Both my eyelashes and my brows are healthy and lush thanks to this stuff.</li>
            <li>I use it every night and my eyelashes look full, long and healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective - upper and bottom lashes are not much fuller but significantly longer.  </li>
            <li>All in all my eyeslashes have been short and brittle forever, this product made them long and beautiful, but I am not sure what is best, long, beautiful lashes with red bumps and bloodshot eyes or short lashes....??</li>
            <li>the delivery was VERY fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see very much result at all.</li>
            <li>and I noticed a very fast difference in my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>fell for the very reasonable pricing--</li>
            <li>Make sure your eyelids are free of other creams/chemical as well, since the serum would react with some eye creams that could result in redness and irritations.</li>
            <li>and I see such a huge difference!</li>
            <li>I first bought this on a whim, just to try it out.  </li>
            <li>It really does make your lashes, thicker, longer and fuller!</li>
            <li>I have eczema on my eyebrows (mostly on the left side)</li>
            <li>At first I couldn&#x27;t see any difference, but it has now been almost 12 weeks</li>
            <li>This does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t afford Latisse, and I worry about all the listed possible side effects, on top of the fact that you have to pay for a doctor visit to get it.  </li>
            <li>Bought it, used it daily for 31 days, the difference noted was more lashing fell out while using it than before use - stopped it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because I&#x27;m getting married in the fall</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d give this a shot first.  </li>
            <li>My first tube lasted for over 2 months.</li>
            <li>I have been using the same tube for almost 5 months and still have more to go.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>not so sure about the volume, but definitely length improvement.</li>
            <li>So I got a waxing done by taking a chunk of my eyebrow uuuggh but kinda funny.</li>
            <li>Ok already my brow is coming back and lashes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>I was dubious, but willing to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>It really works !</li>
            <li>In order for this to work, you need to be consistent and day to day with application...pricey...</li>
            <li>You have to patient with this and use it consistently.  </li>
            <li>I could definitely see the difference on my top lashes.  </li>
            <li>When I first started using Rapid Lash (10/10)</li>
            <li>I think it will help you grow your lashes back if they had been damaged but not if you didn&#x27;t have any lashes and magically they gonna appear.</li>
            <li>I have used this serum a total of 4 times-- 3 nights, and 1 morning, on both my top and bottom lash line.    </li>
            <li>haha!</li>
            <li>I figured it just gets better, so I tried it out in the following morning.</li>
            <li>It just depends on what you&#x27;re willing to put up with.</li>
            <li>and now I will go get my Rx from the doc and buy some Latisse which I should have done in the first place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it consistently on my lashes and brows since I received it around November 17.  </li>
            <li>and I think I almost ran out of the first tube...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely lengthening my lashes, the result is more pronounced with mascara application.</li>
            <li>I only used it on my top eyelash line in order to conserve it.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying this is my first review on any product ever.</li>
            <li>and I undoubtedly have way more lashes on both my upper and lower lash lines.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll expand more on this later.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll begin my second tube tonight and have ordered two more tubes.</li>
            <li>The first time the product lasted me three months</li>
            <li>I paid almost about $50 for my first tube, on another website.  </li>
            <li>Glad I checked with Amazon before buying the second one.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are exactly as they were before.  </li>
            <li>I think I will try Lilash next time because I know people who had better results with that brand.</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a change for the first month or so---</li>
            <li>My eyelashes were very damaged from a lifetime of sleeping with my face smooshed into the pillow!</li>
            <li>But after the first month I began feeling a difference in the texture of my lashes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to make sure she knows this stuff is out there and then cross my fingers that it doesn&#x27;t go away.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using RapidLash for a couple of years, but used it consistently for about 3 years.</li>
            <li>A couple of things to be aware of:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t believe it will work but after 1 or 2 weeks I saw the hair on my brows grow where I applied this serum.</li>
            <li>After only one week I saw more length in my lashes.  </li>
            <li>This was my first crack at lash/brow enhancers.  </li>
            <li>This product overall was okay.</li>
            <li>have missed a day here and there, but for the most part, have used it daily.  </li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>However, I plan to use it much more consistently on my eyebrows so that maybe they will actually show!  </li>
            <li>she had to tug them to see if they were really mine!</li>
            <li>I use it every night, only on the top lashes.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t experience any darking of my eyelids, but there was some tingling when I first started using it.</li>
            <li>i´ve used Latisse before and THAT really works!</li>
            <li>Mine are now thicker and stronger; they look really pretty if I do say so myself.</li>
            <li>I promptly ordered 3 more Rapidlash (a deal and no need to order for 6 months) to get my lashes back in order.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re stick straight which makes it appear like I don&#x27;t have any at all!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Rapidlash consistently for four months now.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes have grown so much that when I apply mascara they hit my eyebrows!</li>
            <li>haha!</li>
            <li>You will see results if you are willing to be patient.</li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>And a better price than my last stuff was.</li>
            <li>Make sure you put this on only where you want eyelashes to grow.</li>
            <li>LOL--no biggie, I just plucked them out and now I make sure I only put it where I expect hair to grow.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this was in July 2010.</li>
            <li>Ok no big deal.</li>
            <li>and I feel better using it, even with the problems I have had with it, then going back to my short/weird lashes.     </li>
            <li>For those of you who want to know: In the winter im extremely white and a more reddish tone.</li>
            <li>In the summer you would never now I could get that light and look completely olive toned.</li>
            <li>: First tried it because the salon I worked in sold it.</li>
            <li>It was cylindrical, but it had a slope to the cap that my first tube had not had.  </li>
            <li>I did not see the results nor maintain the results that I had gained from my first tube.    </li>
            <li>My lashes look so much better that when I went to the eye doctor recently for a check-up she asked me if I&#x27;d been using Latisse.  </li>
            <li>.. would really recommend this to others!</li>
            <li>she wants it!</li>
            <li>fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I guess cheap glue can ruin your natural lashes.</li>
            <li>Well I wasn&#x27;t willing to risk it.</li>
            <li>Hence: no results the first month.</li>
            <li>It is a nice product, but I just feel that the product is not as &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; than I have expected.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, I received my order of the RapidLash Eyelash Enhancing Serum and saw that it had expired in August!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>The results are taking some getting used to for me, but there are results most definitely!  </li>
            <li>have found that the product just didn&#x27;t work as well after the first tube.  </li>
            <li>But I can absolutely vouch for the eyebrows!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even take off my eye makeup first.  </li>
            <li>I did that at first and got a rash from all the makeup remover chemicals.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The most noticeable growth was on my lower, left eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I literally had about 5 lashes there when I first started.</li>
            <li>Okay so this product definitely works</li>
            <li>I get a better price checking on Amazon that I do at local stores.</li>
            <li>The first month to almost 2 months I couldn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li>This product really works!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Eyelashes felt more coarse but were longer and thicker.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see how much longer they will become!  </li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>It did work at first</li>
            <li>This was my first eyelash system to use and will probably try something else.</li>
            <li>I have used many others in the past that are much more exspensive.</li>
            <li>Almost immediately I noticed my lashes getting longer (really longer!)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it works as well as the first one I bought.</li>
            <li>No fake eyelashes ever.</li>
            <li>Very recommended!    </li>
            <li>At the end of 4 weeks they were definitely longer, and as an extra bonus they now also curl up on their own, no eyelash curler needed!</li>
            <li>I have turned on many friends who have had the same results!</li>
            <li>Within the first couple of weeks I could tell the difference in my lashes.</li>
            <li>It does itch when I first apply it</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t review the results yet since I just received my first tube, however I wanted to offer some clarification for those concerned about receiving an expired product.  </li>
            <li>This seems to really help with growing my eyelashes!</li>
            <li>;) Namaste</li>
            <li>My top lashes actually curl up and touch the lids!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Be patient nd consistent with the application nd</li>
            <li>It really does work!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>but this product has really made my eyelashes grow!  </li>
            <li>I used the product on my top and bottom lashes and definitely see a difference.  </li>
            <li>It really works for me!</li>
            <li>For the first couple of days, I had some itching.</li>
            <li>and I have used it religiously every night for 4 months and there is still more in the container.</li>
            <li>But it does work pretty well.</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t lost the progress I gained from the first product, so perhaps it is maintaining the level of growth I got, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in fullness/darkness of my brows, which is what I&#x27;m after.</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>;) &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I saw results within the end of the first week of using it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product will buy it myself next time</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle Int.</li>
            <li>I am still on my first bottle (3 ml), and I do use it almost every evening.</li>
            <li>And our lashes , both upper and lower, look better than ever before.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My lashes are definitely longer and darker :)</li>
            <li>Nope, I&#x27;m going back to Lilash, which isn&#x27;t that much more if you buy it on Ebay.</li>
            <li>This product starts to work from the first time you use it.  </li>
            <li>There arent many beauty products that actually do what they advertise, this one does!</li>
            <li>within the first week I noticed my lashes were looking healthier.  </li>
            <li>This product absolutely AMAZED me!  </li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>But this stuff seems to be working pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Spend $35 more and get Latisse that actually work.</li>
            <li>Thrilling, as my lashes need help.</li>
            <li>Tarte also has a serum that works pretty well</li>
            <li>Of course, you have to be consistent.</li>
            <li>:) I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>I was a bit discouraged at first, in fact, at one point I almost felt like my lashes were getting thinner.</li>
            <li>First eye lash enhancer I have ever used</li>
            <li>Maybe my eye skin just toughened up ; )  </li>
            <li>I must say that for the first time ever, I found somewhat</li>
            <li>There are starting to be more amazon items that are not as advertised.</li>
            <li>It really helped me!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re consistent with nightly use, you&#x27;ll see results.</li>
            <li>haha!</li>
            <li>Definitely going to order more of this.</li>
            <li>I used this product every night for two months before I really noticed a difference, so be patient!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first tube</li>
            <li>Since I began using it I have noticed that my lashes are definitely longer and more noticeable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of upset because my longer, thicker, darker lashes have all gone back to short, light stubbies and I can&#x27;t get my Rapidlash needs fulfilled.</li>
            <li>Have used the product for better part of last two years!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Anyway I switched to Revitalash again, and after many months I got my pretty lash back.</li>
            <li>They are starting to fill in more now.  </li>
            <li>I have applied it consistently each night before bedtime, and I plan to continue always.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it suppose to, no side effects at all.</li>
            <li>just cuz I felt the follicles or whatever were more open to allow the formula penetration.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>when I first used the product it was the height of spring allergy season and the product probably exacerbated already irritated eyes.  </li>
            <li>The first couple of weeks it didn&#x27;t bother me, then they began to itch.  </li>
            <li>Okay so I gave this product four stars because when you drench your eyelashes in it, it actually works!</li>
            <li>so be aware of that.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try this product at first</li>
            <li>NEVER angry pluck</li>
            <li>Magically grow lashes and brows back?  </li>
            <li>At first i notice some result after that it remaines at the first result and didnt improve</li>
            <li>I Lost my eye lashes after chemotherapy and this really helped!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this product before at my local beauty salon for quite a bit more money.</li>
            <li>I noticed NOTHING at first, but kept using it...and after about two months</li>
            <li>So this is a first time writing a review.</li>
            <li>So I lost most of my lashes with the individual glued-ones.</li>
            <li>so I am thinking I will continue to see some more improvements over the next 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>At first I used the serum twice a day, once in the morning and once at night.</li>
            <li>It REALLY works!  </li>
            <li>Now, it&#x27;s been 2 weeks, my lashes are definitely much longer and thicker!</li>
            <li>If applying to eyebrows, but sure to pluck off any outside hairs that are unwanted after overnight growth.</li>
            <li>Looks ten times better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 months (3-5 nights per week), and noticed a difference within the first month.</li>
            <li>So I am only doing the top now and finishing the tube...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been consistently applying the serum as instructed.</li>
            <li>Be aware; this product does NOT grow additional lashes or thicken existing lashes, but it does make the ones you have grown longer.  </li>
            <li>give the product time to do its job, because you wont see it in the first week.</li>
            <li>actually I didn&#x27;t believed it at the beginning but after 1 month I saw the result :)</li>
            <li>No appreciable results after many weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li>6 weeks in, I noticed it more, and now, at 8 weeks, they are definitely longer than they were pre-rapidlash!</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t feel like it works like it did when I first began using it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;During the first week, I found this to cause some itchiness around my eyes.</li>
            <li>That said, I persisted and used it fairly consistently, probably 4X a week based on my laziness.</li>
            <li>seems to work ok after a couple of weeks with constant use</li>
            <li>You can see them without mascara for the first time.</li>
            <li>This stuff really really works!  </li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>you just have to be consistent with it.</li>
            <li>So glad I finally decided to purchase this product!</li>
            <li>My eyelashes have already gotten so much longer and thicker in just two weeks!</li>
            <li>The reviews seem to be mostly good with a few negatives.  </li>
            <li>I realize that this may sound great, but in my case, new baby lashes are growing under my normal ones, straight down into my eye!</li>
            <li>I was browsing the web to see ways of growing lashes long and strong!</li>
            <li>I  hope the new formulation is as effective as the one I got initially.</li>
            <li>At first I think I was applying it too much on the lid, like you would eye liner, and now that it is right on the lash/lid line</li>
            <li>Works fast and eyelashes really do grow in quickly.</li>
            <li>Of course this isn&#x27;t the basis for my positive review, because the rest of my lashes were definitely longer and more dense.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a month and a half now and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty satisfied with my eyelashes before, but I wanted to see if I could make them more spectacular and reminiscent of false lashes with the help</li>
            <li>This is a great product doing essentially the same thing, without the high price and the doctor&#x27;s visit.</li>
            <li>I finally just got my brows professionally reshaped and have had many compliments on how full they look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice to have hair where it is supposed to be and don&#x27;t have to be hairless due to heredity or age.  </li>
            <li>After I  gave my mother this to try she called today, super excited, her lashes showed growing all by sudden after using it  for almost 8 weeks.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and the stuff was brand new.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve increased my star rating from 4 to 5 stars because I&#x27;m in the 5th week of using Rapid Lash and my lashes are definitely longer and fuller than when I wrote my original review!  </li>
            <li>not much comes out of it, soo far soo good</li>
            <li>I think for how cheap it is it&#x27;s kind of common sense that it won&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li>have been consistantly on this product for the last 3 years.its much cheaper than most of the lash growth serums out there in the market.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I had become a bit obsessed about them, hoping they would just start growing again on their own.</li>
            <li>OK, maybe I was asking too much, but this serum has definitely made my eyelashes longer.</li>
            <li>It took a little over a month to notice results, but I am very pleased with how my eyebrows look now.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the purchse, the eyelashes grew a little with no side effects, I have been using it over 2 years now.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I would recommend it to all those girls who want to feel more pretty and love a new style with natural longer eyelashes!</li>
            <li>I first starting using Rapidlash a couple years ago when it wasn&#x27;t as easy to find as it is now</li>
            <li>In two weeks I started to see positive effects.</li>
            <li>I bought this product instead of neulash because of the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>My eyelashes is already long and looks great when I&#x27;m wearing mascara but wearing a mascara everyday makes your eyelash fall off specially when it&#x27;s waterproof</li>
            <li>My first review I did not see much improvement ... which was about 1 month of use.  </li>
            <li>The first night my eye was really itchy</li>
            <li>I already have long eyelashes, so my goal was to increase the eyelash density to be more in keeping with what I had as a teenager.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other products with more success.</li>
            <li>but you had to be consistent for 2 months straight</li>
            <li>They are also LONG, and I love my eyelashes like this.</li>
            <li>During week 2 I noticed my top lashes were really long.</li>
            <li>It made my eyelashes longer, (no, not quite as long as Latisse), made them stronger, and more resistant to breakage.</li>
            <li>my eyes were very swollen from first application</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much change in my eyelash composition until about 8 weeks after I first started applying it.</li>
            <li>Results really are noticeable after 1 month of consistent use.  </li>
            <li>This product has a reasonable price and the product delivers exactly what it claims.  </li>
            <li>At first I really like this item</li>
            <li>i pretty much smothered the product all over my lash line and my lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used another brand for the past year and loved it.  </li>
            <li>not sure - my lashes look a bit longer but still waiting for them to look a good bit longer</li>
            <li>Overall, I love it and would highly recommend it if you want to buy something over the counter.</li>
            <li>I might just be super sensitive</li>
            <li>only ONE TUBE to start with; it lasts a couple of months, more than enough time to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Clean your eyes and face before you go to bed</li>
            <li>Actually I had more eyelashes fall out, than normal.  </li>
            <li>The tube lasted a long time; I bought it in September and am just now (in March) getting ready to order some more.  </li>
            <li>on time, easy to open.</li>
            <li>My lashes thinned out a bit..seems that they may not be putting in the product that they were before making it less effective.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, I actually use it twice per day not just at bedtime.</li>
            <li>and then it was changed  to a much less effective formula.</li>
            <li>Lashes are considerably longer fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>My lashes didn&#x27;t really grow long, but they are better than before.</li>
            <li>It worked but the results were not dramatic.</li>
            <li>I seen some results but not dramatic results</li>
            <li>My brows are dark, nicely shaped, and the hairs are dense yet very well-behaved.  </li>
            <li>They were already thick and long, but now they are even longer than before and very beautiful.  </li>
            <li>The results are not dramatic like with Latisse</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not super impressed, but it has made a little bit of improvement.</li>
            <li>Rapid Lash certainly worked for me.</li>
            <li>I certainly wasn&#x27;t going to pay for Latisse.</li>
            <li>I bought this eyelash enhancing serum with a large bit of skepticism that it was a bunch of malarky and snake oil salesman hooey.</li>
            <li>, if applied day and night, certainly gave me length.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>BUT once you stop using it get, get ready to say bye bye to those lashes that you love and going back to normal.</li>
            <li>My upper and lower lashes are longer and fuller, and my eyebrows are more full at the outside edges.  </li>
            <li>My daughter (14) who is infatuated with lashes (she spends more time on her lashes than her hair!)</li>
            <li>I hope that will happen in the next month, but only for getting LONGER and MORE lashes, I would definately recommend buying this product!    </li>
            <li>In the first couple of weeks I noticed my lashes got back to their original condition before I had extensions, and since have gradually grown longer.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve gotten thinner the older I&#x27;ve gotten, and I would like to look like I have brows without having to APPLY them each morning!</li>
            <li>It works a little slower than I would have liked...</li>
            <li>Wow this really works!!</li>
            <li>I probably should have backed off use to every other day or every third day instead of daily.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is I was very happy with the results, despite minor issues.</li>
            <li>I use mainly on my eye brows and they&#x27;re much fuller than they used to be and Rapid Lash does not irritate my brow ;-)</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not very pretty to curl and put mascara on as my eye lashes will point in many off ways.</li>
            <li>I actually had ordered 2 when I placed my original order (because of the positive feedback).</li>
            <li>My lashes were very sparse and short, now they have filled in some</li>
            <li>I am a very skeptical person, and this is the most amazing product I have ever bought!</li>
            <li>I immediately started using a second bottle that I had saved and once again within five to six weeks I saw a huge difference in my lashes.  </li>
            <li>it has grown them and made them so much stronger than I had hoped for -</li>
            <li>Well, it REALLY does work.  </li>
            <li>I notice if I stop using this my lashes fall out so much easier.</li>
            <li>My lashes have gotten much longer.  </li>
            <li>My eylashes are light, short, and sparse.  </li>
            <li>I really noticed a difference after using this product for 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>My lashes were very sparse</li>
            <li>My lashes are so much longer &amp; now appear to be getting thicker.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I know it is supposed to take six weeks to three months to really see a difference, but my lashes are already longer and thicker.  </li>
            <li>took a month to see results, but once my lashes got going, they really took off.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect much when I ordered this product but thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>However, the eyebrow that really needed it, has not improved.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t seemed to do much for me.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really expecting to see a change this soon</li>
            <li>I tried this on the recommendation of a friend who clearly had success with it.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t really thicker, but I&#x27;ll take what I can get.</li>
            <li>It dries fast tho.</li>
            <li>have been using for 2 weeks still have not seen much hair grow.</li>
            <li>absolutely NOTHING happens.</li>
            <li>which I had to deal with for the whole day.    </li>
            <li>Hopefully i would be able to report differently after a few more weeks.    </li>
            <li>this product is absolutely amazing,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have watched carefully, often adding my lower lashes as well, because they are getting thinner as I age, just like the top lashes.  </li>
            <li>Rapidlash really helps improve the health of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how much it has changed my lashes.  </li>
            <li>My lashes were VERY noticeably longer.  </li>
            <li>Saw real results with Latisse though.</li>
            <li>I really think it has been making my lashes longer and healthier.</li>
            <li>If you have ever used Latisse, do not expect this product to work as fast.     </li>
            <li>and it really worked.  </li>
            <li>so it hasn&#x27;t had time to really be visible.  </li>
            <li>It took 90 days to really notice a difference.</li>
            <li>for REAL.</li>
            <li>After a month I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference.  </li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t see much regrowth</li>
            <li>I really like this product, I have been using it for over an year now</li>
            <li>It really works and it will make people comment on your lashes.  </li>
            <li>more than slightly SLIGHTLY wet-</li>
            <li>really mush it around to find any wetness- about 20 times.    </li>
            <li>, when you have really sparse lashes, anything is an improvement.</li>
            <li>The product really works.  </li>
            <li>This does really work.</li>
            <li>i would recommend this product to anyone who wants longer lashes.</li>
            <li>Noticed about a 30% increase in lash length, which becomes very noticeable when wearing mascara.</li>
            <li>For maximum results, you really need to use this every night.     </li>
            <li>I started using this Rapidlash in January and my lashes are so much longer and thicker than they were before.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Lash and eyebrow growth was very noticeable after 2 months of use.</li>
            <li>As an FYI, I&#x27;m 62 but still working in retail management and have to keep up with the younger gals, so appearance is important.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice as much lash fall out.</li>
            <li>Rapidlash has improved the health of my eyelashes so much, that&#x27;s how I reply to these comments</li>
            <li>My lashes are longer and fuller thanks to Rapidlash.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 54 and have very sparse straight lashes.</li>
            <li>I did have to trim them once because some were so much longer then the rest.     </li>
            <li>Being more careful, and taking a damp q-tip and wiping off any not on the lash line has helped a lot to.</li>
            <li>I dont think to many people have the problem of overly curly lashes but just in case some one does be careful.     </li>
            <li>My lashes are not in circles, no crazy ones (so far), no redness, and im figuring out how to deal with the darkness.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonable priced and it works.</li>
            <li>My lashes are much longer but not thicker.  </li>
            <li>and i have to say this product really does what it says</li>
            <li>and you just have to stick with it for a while and really try to use it every night.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>my eye lashes didn&#x27;t seem to fall out as much</li>
            <li>and they seemed to thicken up a bit,but I didn&#x27;t see much addition to my length.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>This should really get no stars but that&#x27;s not an option.</li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>This product really does work, but with consequences.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very self-conscious because of this.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product straight from City Cosmetics and after awhile I found my lashes thickening up and noticed the length increasing.  </li>
            <li>I am also using it on  my very sparse brows and notice hair growing in.  </li>
            <li>I was very sceptical, but after using this product faithfully every day, I noticed a difference after 2-3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>After using the whole tube,  I still have no hair</li>
            <li>I even skipped nights thinking it doesn&#x27;t really matter any way.</li>
            <li>I began to use it and didn&#x27;t see much results but wanted to keep trying.</li>
            <li>That made me think the Rapidlash really worked.</li>
            <li>This stuff works very well.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>much make up.</li>
            <li>My lashes are about an 1/8 inch and 4 row wide, so I was spreading the product with my finger to make sure of coverage.</li>
            <li>I really can see a difference in the length.</li>
            <li>I will really see a difference.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>so did my real eyelashes.</li>
            <li>My lashes are really thicker</li>
            <li>After I used this serum, I noticed that my lashes didnt drop off as much, which always irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li>Although, I do not use the product as much now maybe a couple times a week.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>It is everything that I expected and more.</li>
            <li>I think Amazon is no worse.</li>
            <li>, my lashes has grown so much.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really purchase this again.</li>
            <li>They are much longer now as fuller.</li>
            <li>, I expected some because I have so many allergies to the preservatives in products.</li>
            <li>This product really works for me.  </li>
            <li>I started using it at the end of May, and didn&#x27;t really notice any change for about 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>and I really hope it works for you like it worked for me</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t review items very often, but I felt compelled to do so this time.</li>
            <li>My lashes are much longer and fuller, including the bottoms lashes.</li>
            <li>It really works,..</li>
            <li>This one really works.</li>
            <li>though they have improved much.</li>
            <li>You really have to be patient with it.</li>
            <li>It will take up to 8 weeks to really see results and I intend to use the product longer until I get the results I want.</li>
            <li>It really did the trick.</li>
            <li>Now I am ready to buy this product again and grow some lashes.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it is very noticeable.</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>Which does not happen very often.</li>
            <li>really wish it had made them fuller/lusher, too, as others have claimed it&#x27;s done for them, but it hasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>The shipment was also really fast.</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue using this product and see just how fabulous my lashes can be.</li>
            <li>So, I really don&#x27;t know if it was the product.</li>
            <li>It took a whole month of using this every night before I started seeing results.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that it really works.  </li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t get much curl</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing even though I used it as directed.  </li>
            <li>very ..</li>
            <li>I was using another lash serum that worked really well</li>
            <li>I really like Raptidlash serum.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that Rapidlash would be the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; lash thickener and growth product that was at a reasonable price (compared to Latisse).</li>
            <li>Rapidlash and L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s lash serum work REALLY well TOGETHER.</li>
            <li>But again, I absolutely WOULD NOT risk using Rapidlash alone.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t irritate, but my lashes absolutely grew NO longer.</li>
            <li>but really didn&#x27;t want to commit to a very pricey one or one that I had to get a prescription for.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as much length as it is the volume of my eyelashes</li>
            <li>And it was very dear -</li>
            <li>I much prefer the Rapidlash.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>Dermatologist said stick with the real stuff-Latisse</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to do much.  </li>
            <li>bottom lashes grew very well</li>
            <li>With nightly use, my lashes have absolutely grown much longer and they also are thicker and feel stronger.</li>
            <li>So much so that I ordered some for my daughter too.</li>
            <li>This really worked for me.</li>
            <li>I had been getting my lashes done for years until I had to stop because I was spending too much money.  </li>
            <li>and I am so glad I spent the money on it.  </li>
            <li>As much as I would really like to, it just did not do a thing</li>
            <li>my mornings a whole lot</li>
            <li>My mother also has light and short eyelashes</li>
            <li>that is a real plus...</li>
            <li>I have eye lashes and eyebrows thanks to this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Have used it for years and will continue to use it because it really works.  </li>
            <li>I bought a much cheaper serum from Rimmel and it works just as well.</li>
            <li>and I still really miss it.  </li>
            <li>If not, I don&#x27;t really know what I would do.</li>
            <li>but when it does, it makes a real difference.</li>
            <li>Save your money.&lt;br /&gt;Revitalash did work very well.</li>
            <li>This product really worked well for me.  </li>
            <li>so I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>My lashes are much longer and fuller and darker.  </li>
            <li>It really does work.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend this.</li>
            <li>This is one of the two products that I&#x27;ve ever use from a company that really works.</li>
            <li>that REALLY WORKS.  </li>
            <li>really like it</li>
            <li>This absolutely does what it says it does.  </li>
            <li>and I already notice that my eyelashes don&#x27;t fall out as much</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This stuff really does make your lashes grow noticeably longer.  </li>
            <li>Nope just very sore , swollen eyes from using Rapidlash.</li>
            <li>One tube lasts for much longer than it says - two months.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t spend this much money again on this product.  </li>
            <li>Within 2 weeks I saw a difference and now after 2 months I cant believe how much my lashes have grown and thickened.  </li>
            <li>however this time I don&#x27;t really see any difference in my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>it delivers results at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>BUT my eyes don&#x27;t care too much for the serum and seem to tear up ...</li>
            <li>This really works the way it says ...</li>
            <li>After a couple weeks I thought I noticed some improvement on my eyelashes, but where it was really noticeable, was my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>It really did.</li>
            <li>After applying the product twice a day for three weeks, I have not seen much progress.</li>
            <li>This product really works to grow lashes..</li>
            <li>I wish I had appreciated them when I had them.  </li>
            <li>But for $20, what did I really have to lose?  </li>
            <li>so I really haven&#x27;t used much at all</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>The lashes are much fuller and longer.</li>
            <li>I was considering Latisse but didn&#x27;t want to spend that much.</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY have longer lashes ...</li>
            <li>Not so much in fullness or in darkness of them, but hey that&#x27;s what mascara is for.  </li>
            <li>I do notice some growth, but not as much as I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s my real lashes.</li>
            <li>It took about 8 weeks to really start seeing the change.</li>
            <li>Fast forward to today (about 2 months after purchasing)</li>
            <li>It really does work..</li>
            <li>Very east to use</li>
            <li>and it was much cheaper on Amazon</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are much fuller and darker.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t have any side effects or real effects.</li>
            <li>She said it took her about a month to really notice.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I put too much on or something else.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve noted my lashes are longer and worked really fast on the brows</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are so much longer than they used to be.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to wear as much eye make-up as I used to.</li>
            <li>Used for 2+ months straight every night.  </li>
            <li>It DOES lengthen lashes, it really, really does.  </li>
            <li>After 6 months of use, I can confirm this does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it every night for six weeks and can&#x27;t really see much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>When I put on my mascara, it seems that some of the lashes seem a bit longer, but it&#x27;s very negligible.  </li>
            <li>It really works in making the lashes longer.</li>
            <li>I am very upset about it and wish I would of known about this side effect in advance.</li>
            <li>This item really works</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really work.</li>
            <li>Not so much thicker.</li>
            <li>but it gets finished fast</li>
            <li>You have to very patient with it and use it as directed.</li>
            <li>I have pretty full lashes already, but after only 3 weeks of using this product I can already tell that my lashes are thicker and longer.</li>
            <li>if you keep using it on a regular daily basis it honestly works.  </li>
            <li>I had been using Li Lash for a few months with spectacular results, longer, thicker, curlier.  </li>
            <li>After doing some more research online about rapidlash, it became clear to me that this product likely caused this.</li>
            <li>DAILY with the appropriate products i.e. make-up remover for waterproof make-up, sensitive eyes, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then I kind of got lazy and wasn&#x27;t consistent about using it.  </li>
            <li>I had been putting it on from corner to corner on my eyes until I noticed a few eyelash hairs growing the very inside of my eye, kind of on my nose....</li>
            <li>but it is the next best eyelash enhancer I&#x27;ve ever tired.</li>
            <li>I am a natural blonde so this has helped make my lashes stand out more.</li>
            <li>I only use once a day and have noticed immediate, impressive results on both my lashes and my eyebrows (which I had over plucked at one point into pencil thin shadows)</li>
            <li>not now... they are long and full.. fun to apply mascara now.</li>
            <li>The first week into using this product my lashes darkened, the second week my lashes started to fill in, by the third week i started noticing the length was becoming longer And by the end of the fourth week my lashes were looking more volumous, longer and darker just as advertised.</li>
            <li>The prescription serum is too high priced to use for cosmetic reasons but after 2 years of use I can tell you this is just about as good for far less.  </li>
            <li>I selected the right eye initially because on that side the eyelashes were slightly more sparse than those on the left.  </li>
            <li>almost too long and so many new lashes.</li>
            <li>I received my product early 10/14, which means it&#x27;s expired after 11/14 !!!</li>
            <li>My lashes are growing so fast, and long, and it is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Less than a month my eyelashes were long great product.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are long and full once again!</li>
            <li>I ordered a new tube - the first one lasted 2 1/2 months.  </li>
            <li>I think with my contacts and generally sensitive eyes, it may just not be the right product /method for me.</li>
            <li>Maybe one or two long ones grew but could easily be pulled out.  </li>
            <li>even after i stopped using lilash for about 8 months, my lashes stayed long and strong.</li>
            <li>Long, healthy and lush!</li>
            <li>This product worked extremely well on my eyelashes- have been applying it nightly for the better part of 2 months now and can absolutely see a difference.  </li>
            <li>my lashes are strong, long and thicker than before.</li>
            <li>and my lashes are still strong and long.</li>
            <li>Nothing super apparent, but I could tel</li>
            <li>this is a major one - growth of fine hair on upper cheeks right below eyes.  </li>
            <li>OK, I used this on my eyebrows because I thought &amp;#34;sperm&amp;#34; eyebrows were all the rage in high school, overtweezed, and am left with the aftermath now as an adult.</li>
            <li>I already tried out the Maybelline Jade lash growth serum (from that fancy Eva Longoria commercial) and was excited to get my lashes fuller and darker -</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products</li>
            <li>I do think when you stop using it though, your lashes go back to their original length.</li>
            <li>Due to chemotherapy I lost my brows and most of lashes.</li>
            <li>I originally bought these to see if I could grow my eye brows back</li>
            <li>Then now my eyelashes are all short as my original length.</li>
            <li>I started noticing significant growth after a couple of weeks of constant use.</li>
            <li>I find after 3-4 weeks of consistent, daily use my lashes are noticeable longer (not all of them at the same time) and are more voluminous.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to try other brands for more length and thickness.</li>
            <li>After only a month of using this product I saw significant growth.  </li>
            <li>Definitely and significantly longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other lash growth products and they worked ok.</li>
            <li>Half my lashes (top and bottom) did full circles after 6 weeks which wasnt that big of a deal just funny.</li>
            <li>its better that Smart Lash because you only need to apply it once per day instead of twice with Smart lash and you get the same results.</li>
            <li>So far, hasn&#x27;t really done anything for my eyebrows though, and that is the reason I bought it in the first place.</li>
            <li>At first the skin around my eyes were darkened but it went away after a few more days of application.</li>
            <li>however it&#x27;s great whenever you are low on lashes or missing any!</li>
            <li>I love it, they are thick and full.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this long enough to know what kind of results I can get, I now just apply 3-4 nights a week for maintenance.</li>
            <li>I have stopped curling my lashes before putting mascara on because they are long enough and curl on their own.  </li>
            <li>I think it has extended the time for &#x27;fills&#x27; to my extensions, but I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know if it has helped my own lashes.</li>
            <li>I also used it on one of my eyebrows which has been very sparse for decades (over-plucked in high school) - and sure enough, the bare spots where nothing has grown for years are filling in.  </li>
            <li>Does anybody have a positive (or any) experience to report about the new formula?</li>
            <li>As an adult I managed to grow a few more hairs, but for most of the last 10 years I had to rely on eyebrow pencils and stencils...  </li>
            <li>The product is easy to use - very similar to liquid eyeliner, except it&#x27;s clear.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that they are super lush, but at 60+ yrs old, I have lashes that 20 year olds compliment me on.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are so much thicker now that I only need a quick swipe of mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong, long!!</li>
            <li>and i see a HUGE differance!It has made my lashes almost twice as long and about 1/3 thicker but not any darker</li>
            <li>this stuff works took a couple months HUGE difference in lashes , never had  think or long ,, now I do</li>
            <li>My lashes grew long and curled, and my eyebrows filled in.  </li>
            <li>Aside from using this product on my lashes i have also been applying it on my eyebrows, they didn&#x27;t grow as fast as my eyelashes did, but i can definitely say after a month of application they start to come in together toward the center more, and the shorter brows at the beginning are also becoming longer and thicker, so i would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li>It takes about 5 to 6 weeks to see results, however after that, you can clearly see longer and fuller lashes with consistent use.</li>
            <li>Wow, thank you for making a product that really works and is so affordable!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a true blonde and</li>
            <li>I will go back to using Amplifeye, although more expensive, it works good for me.</li>
            <li>Read the entire information sheet for full detail (located inside box).</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving the length and no more tenderness.</li>
            <li>my lashes and brows started getting full only within 2-3 weeks</li>
            <li>that not only were my lashes longer, but had filled in nicely in the little bare patches.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed new eyelash growth in 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>Also i looked and the rapidlash it self had been opened and tampered with after being listed as new!</li>
            <li>It costs less than and works better than most other lash lentheners!</li>
            <li>And, really, it didn&#x27;t prompt any new growth in the areas where I&#x27;ve plucked either..</li>
            <li>I did notice a slight difference in growth (more length but not thickness).  </li>
            <li>Our local drugstore carries it for more than double the price &amp; they can&#x27;t keep it in.</li>
            <li>My eyes looked a lot better when I skipped a day, and since I figure the side effects aren&#x27;t permanent, I went ahead and tried it for the fourth time last night.     </li>
            <li>After many months of steady use, I noticed that my lashes had become slightly sparser.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend using on eyebrows if they are a decent length.</li>
            <li>I think I might be able to get it to go completely away if I keep being careful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though this is only .1 ounce, there is more than enough product for you to determine whether it works for you.  </li>
            <li>If you get even a tiny bit in your eye wash it out quickly or you&#x27;ll be wearing a pirate patch for a while, I am.  </li>
            <li>After a week, I had to give up because people were super concerned about me because of how red my eyes were!  </li>
            <li>And I actually bought some more for a gift for a friend who complains about her short eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I think it is important to give the body a break from chemically-based products (I stopped using underarm deodorant for 2 years and instead used the all-natural crystal stick and the toxins which had built up over the years completely disappeared along with the rashes and staining of my white clothing).</li>
            <li>I shopped around for eyelash enhancing products and realized that the ones that seem to be the most reccomended were also the most expensive.</li>
            <li>Length was my main goal.</li>
            <li>still had a good amount of Rapidlash product left, and I couldn&#x27;t bear to waste it, so I decided to use Rapidlash in conjunction with L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s lash</li>
            <li>I totally will be using this product,and the fact that is soo affordable is an extra bonus,i love it.</li>
            <li>My lashes quickly showed about 3mm length extension and that appears to be about it for them, but my brows are still showing signs of continued improvement, and I think I may get to a point some day where the ends are back to like</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it every night, mainly because I forget or fall asleep.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more expensive,  but atleast it&#x27;s safe.  </li>
            <li>I used on my eyebrows where they are thinning, mainly on the outer arch.  </li>
            <li>As I have gotten older, I noticed my lashes thinning out.  </li>
            <li>however I realize fairly quickly that if I&#x27;m not constantly applying this item</li>
            <li>Unlike Latisse, my eyes are not left discolored and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly for the eyebrows</li>
            <li>Had short, super sparse lashes.</li>
            <li>All women want beautiful long, thick eye lashes.</li>
            <li>It is very challenging to get these new lashes into my eyelash curler, but if I get the curler extremely close to where it is actually pinching my lash line, I can get them up.</li>
            <li>After 12 weeks, I actually had very pretty lashes.</li>
            <li>With this product, I have full, long lashes that are roughly equal in size and they are full.  </li>
            <li>My lashes don&#x27;t look super long, but they seem much stronger, healthier, and aren&#x27;t falling out so they are definately growing longer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this and will use it forever.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for lash lengthening.</li>
            <li>I just purchased high end mascara justifying the purchase with all that I saved using</li>
            <li>High recommend it, just be patient and keep using for 2 weeks</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it...</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t use it on high pollen days.  </li>
            <li>I have very light green eyes and haven&#x27;t noticed any color change.</li>
            <li>So between these 2 products I have lashes again almost like I had in high school.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this</li>
            <li>I will not say I highly recommend this because the affect varies from person to person.</li>
            <li>So far I think I am seeing a little change in my eyebrows and still hopeful for more positive results.</li>
            <li>Certain eyeliners do irritate my eyelids (not all - I can use mac gel and stila liquid liners), so it may be my somewhat sensitive skin reacting to the product.</li>
            <li>As I started to run out I tried to order more through Amazon, but nowhere will ship to New Zealand anymore, not even this seller that I previously bought Rapidlash off.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m a sucker for beauty adds, really nothing works as advertised, but this is just truly amazing, and NO I&#x27;m in no way associated with anyone from the company or amazon, just a 45 year old who cheaped out and was taught a beauty lesson!</li>
            <li>This is a terrific product that really works!!</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a little more than a month and have noticed results.</li>
            <li>i just noticed the expiration date of the product - it&#x27;s MAY 2010 while i ordered it early NOV 2010!!  </li>
            <li>I started using this product with a little skepticism, but hey I have $20.00 (okay, it was a little more, but</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say I was blown away by the results, but I did notice some lengthening and a little more volume.</li>
            <li>I have tried all different types of products, this is the first one that has lived up to its claims!</li>
            <li>I love this product...wish it was a little cheaper though.</li>
            <li>but, WOW!!  </li>
            <li>It took about 3-4 weeks to notice, but WOW!!  </li>
            <li>I always had long full lashes but the older we get</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and I didn&#x27;t have any burning or other side effects.  </li>
            <li>What I am seeing is not a uniform growth pattern of longer than normal lashes, but rather, a few eyelashes at the outside corners of my eyes having exceptional growth.</li>
            <li>As far as the results I have gotten from this product in a rather short time frame, I really think its worth a try.</li>
            <li>My problem was, that because I use a lash curler every day (my lashes are straight, they don&#x27;t have a natural curl</li>
            <li>I will measure the difference but looks promising so far.....</li>
            <li>I was scared of putting anything on my eye because there is always the possibility of side effects but so far there are really none.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find something that really helped my skimpy lashes.</li>
            <li>and my lashes are unbelieveably long, full and darker.  </li>
            <li>Long story short, I plan to order more of this product.</li>
            <li>I, of course have stopped using it and things have returned to normal.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I don&#x27;t use it everyday or maybe I should give it more time.  </li>
            <li>I even used it on my eyebrows which had become thin out from years of arching, and they have filled back in nicely too.</li>
            <li>just glad I didn&#x27;t give up after a few weeks because it isn&#x27;t an instantaneous change</li>
            <li>Be patient have to use it for a long time (like 7 months ) to get full effect.</li>
            <li>Without any results though, the daily discomfort just isn&#x27;t worth it for me - plus I&#x27;ve read that I may have to continue using this product to maintain lash improvement, if any.</li>
            <li>but that is normal for any hair/ lash product .</li>
            <li>but I had wondered if it was normal for my eyes to burn using it</li>
            <li>The skin returns to its normal color when application is halted (along with the eyelashes).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write reviews normally, but I had to set aside time to write this one.</li>
            <li>Once I stopped using it, my lashes returned to normal.  </li>
            <li>Of course your lashes will return to their normal length if you don&#x27;t apply the product like three times a week to keep your length.</li>
            <li>And within 1 month, I began to start having normal looking eyelashes by month 2</li>
            <li>The results will vary based upon the normal growth of your eyelashes and how you use the treatment.</li>
            <li>But it is worth the try especially for the price!!!</li>
            <li>Long and full again.</li>
            <li>and we don&#x27;t have long full lashes.</li>
            <li>When I first bought this product when it first came out, I couldn&#x27;t beleive how long my lashes were.  </li>
            <li>so I continued usage, thinking maybe I was shedding lashes naturally, but by the end of the 2nd week I didn&#x27;t have many lashes left to spare!!!</li>
            <li>Try it, you will be amazed how great you will look with long, thick lashes.</li>
            <li>You lashes will be so full and so long that you won&#x27;t believe it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and my lashes are almost as full and long as they were with Latisse.</li>
            <li>This made my eyelids swell, and I&#x27;m pretty sure at least a quarter of my existing eyelashes fell out.  </li>
            <li>Now my lashes are long and full.  </li>
            <li>This product worked better than the prescription Latisse which gave me &amp;#34;clumpy&amp;#34; uneven growth.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, give it a few months</li>
            <li>My lashes got so long I actually stopped using it for a while because they were touching my sunglass lenses and driving me nuts.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are normal but wanted thicker longer ones.</li>
            <li>I immediately stopped using the serum and, after a couple of weeks, looked normal again.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews bu</li>
            <li>I am sure to use my Rapid Lash everyday.</li>
            <li>It takes around 4 weeks before you start to see the growth, and sure enough I got long lashes.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise these lashes point straight down and look bizarre.</li>
            <li>If I do, I&#x27;ll go back to the original source with the cylinder tube with straight, parallel lines.</li>
            <li>Okay... so I found myself wanting to get fake individual eyelashes jumping on the band wagon of others which was a big mistake, especially since I already had long, full and beautiful eyelashes.</li>
            <li>We never has  really full or long lashes - but we have now!</li>
            <li>I think the lashes on my right eye are still longer than on my left, but I am hoping this will even out too.</li>
            <li>that after the next 4 weeks of using it THE RIGHT WAY I was amazed at the difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product on my upper and lower lashes once a day, right before bed.</li>
            <li>I uploaded it as a customer&#x27;s photo right next to the photo of the product.</li>
            <li>Having experienced all of this.... very thin lashes have grown in.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this product overall, my eyelashes are pretty long and thick for asians</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s done a good job of getting back to my normal thick lashes and made them longer than normal as well.</li>
            <li>I used this product exclusively on my eyebrows, which I am trying to thicken after too much plucking and generally getting older.</li>
            <li>and I have very sparse brows to start with and not dark.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, i tried it just for the sake of trying so far no significant change in my eyelash.</li>
            <li>They are just right, not weird and spidery like what some other products out there will do.</li>
            <li>It takes about 4-6 weeks for results, obviously NEW eyelashes have to grow in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a new tube on reserve and plan to continue using this.</li>
            <li>is  a new start...</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t notice any new lashes growing.  </li>
            <li>My lashes have even curled with the new growth spurt.</li>
            <li>So I returned them and asked for new ones that were not expired.  </li>
            <li>but I can live with that.</li>
            <li>and well I stopped using it already because I don&#x27;t want to risk loosing my eyelashes instead of gaining new ones</li>
            <li>She now uses rapid lash and my girl friend who lost all her lashes from cancer treatment now has lashes and feels like a new person.  </li>
            <li>Tried the new eyelash extensions.  </li>
            <li>Rapidlash has helped make my existing lashes longer, but I have not noticed them getting any fuller, so I don&#x27;t think it aids in the growth of new lashes.  </li>
            <li>When I couldn&#x27;t find it on Amazon, i tried a new product, can&#x27;t remember name, but came in gold colored tube.</li>
            <li>YOUR NEW LASHES WILL FALL OUT</li>
            <li>But, here in New Jersey, it is allergy season.</li>
            <li>Michelle   New Jersey</li>
            <li>In just two weeks I noticed my eyelashes were longer, and new lashes were growing out as well.</li>
            <li>New lashes came in like weeds</li>
            <li>so I know that it works, that is, unless it has \\&quot;new and</li>
            <li>I also noticed what seems to be new lashes growing in a bald spot on my bottom lash line.  </li>
            <li>BUT - this product also makes NEW lashes grow where there were none before.</li>
            <li>So, it might work for people trying to regrow hair they&#x27;ve already had, but it does not work to create new hair or thicken existing hair-for me, anyway.</li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>and I have new growth there too.</li>
            <li>also i noticed new growths, i thought this is like fertilizer or miracle gro for the eye lashes.</li>
            <li>After about 3 I had new eye brow hair</li>
            <li>The new formula is no improvement.  </li>
            <li>The extensions looked so fake too, and now my lashes just look real, healthy and full and long!  </li>
            <li>After a few weeks, the length of my lashes were significantly longer!</li>
            <li>Although I wouldn&#x27;t say they are thick, most of the spaces have filled in, I have almost twice as many as before and can see more new ones at the base.  </li>
            <li>My lashes completely filled in in the sparse areas and actually grew longer, especially at the corners of my eyes.  </li>
            <li>most recent delivery of the formula seemed much thinner than previous shipments</li>
            <li>so I really need to get into the habit of daily use to really maximize my lashes.</li>
            <li>, my top lashes have grow at least 30% longer and my bottom lashes grow so much espeically at the end since that&#x27;s the part with the least/shortest lashes.</li>
            <li>(I even watched youtube videos before I began applying it to make sure I knew how to do it properly) and saw absolutely no improvement in my eyelash length, color, or thickness.</li>
            <li>As a blonde I look naked without mascara on, but now I feel comfortable leaving the house without it</li>
            <li>I read reviews on it wasn&#x27;t sure if they were real or not, but thought I would at least try the product once.  </li>
            <li>Prior to using this, my eyelashes were never really a feature in my eye makeup, it was more so the eyeliner that made an impact.</li>
            <li>This is not this first time I received an empty tube of this product (the first was directly from the mfgr!).  </li>
            <li>I was amazed to have long eyelashes for the first time in my life!  </li>
            <li>I took 4 months before I could see a major difference in my lashes, but after that, my lashes look much, much longer and fuller.  </li>
            <li>, my eyelashes look good, but not incredible lush lashes nor super long, but definetly improvement for how they are normally.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes, and have never had a problem with it hurting my eyes in any way.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product for use on my eyebrows because my eyes are very sensitive</li>
            <li>I still wanted to take a break since I don&#x27;t see the point of having long beautiful lashes, if I have to deal with a bigger problem of dark red circles around my eyes.    </li>
            <li>But I must say it definitely improved mine with more growth after 4 months, but just not as dark, full and long as I hoped.</li>
            <li>I think plain old Vaseline might do more.</li>
            <li>but it made my lashes super LONG!!</li>
            <li>so I have sparse lashes that are super straight and grow down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable and way cheaper than other products and it actually works :)</li>
            <li>Ok unbelievably this product works.</li>
            <li>I took picture when i first use it and a month later</li>
            <li>When I first began to use it, the next morning I had problems with my eyes</li>
            <li>I started using it about 3 weeks ago pretty religiously for me, which means once a day</li>
            <li>I was skeptical, like a lot of other reviewers, and I don&#x27;t know why, but it worked great for me!  </li>
            <li>Now every morning when I do my makeup, I leave mascara for the last step and it transforms my whole look!</li>
            <li>My sister&#x27;s lashes are pretty short, but this made them longer and thicker.     </li>
            <li>You have to be consistent in applying daily to see results, and lashes don&#x27;t stay without continued use, BUT it does work.</li>
            <li>but I think I will pay for the higher quality one next time.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>Due to chemo, I know it took longer to show signs of working, but worth the wait!</li>
            <li>This product brought them back fast!  </li>
            <li>I called my mom and found out she had the same issue within the first week or so of use.</li>
            <li>Worked great for me after having fake eyelashes for over 2 years and noticed how it really ripped out some of my own.&lt;br /&gt;After only a week I have seen results</li>
            <li>My lashes grew longer than usual but I did not get any more lashes than what I already have.</li>
            <li>I first tried RapidLash last winter.</li>
            <li>This might have given some thickness to my lashes, not enough to be recognizable.  </li>
            <li>these were just my natural eyelashes!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different brands of eyelash growth products over the last several years, including Latise.  </li>
            <li>Even with curling and mascara they would end up sticking straight out and barely be noticeable.</li>
            <li>BTW, I&#x27;m 65 years old!</li>
            <li>Patience is the key and it will really pay off!  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s pretty inexpensive overall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I am growing more eyelashes</li>
            <li>But with mascara and primer -WOW!</li>
            <li>I have only used this for a few days, and have noticed my eyelids are a gross bright pink/red color there is not itchiness</li>
            <li>Anyway, this I would skip and actually put the $$ towards a product that&#x27;s more likely to actually WORK!</li>
            <li>However, I was told there would be a great or dramatic difference, which there definitely IS NOT.</li>
            <li>So Ladies, if your looking for a cheap and efficient eyelash grower, I suggest rapidlash HANDS DOWN</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t have high expectations for growing my eyelashes back with this product</li>
            <li>No bad side effects either, but not positive impact at all.</li>
            <li>It initially takes about four weeks for the full benefits, and my lashes are definitely longer and thicker.  </li>
            <li>The down side is that it gives me blood shot eyes and a pretty obvious dark circle under my eyes, i&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>I see the most dramatic difference when I am wearing mascara, but now I only use a tiny bit of mascara which is pretty exciting!</li>
            <li>I did not see any significant difference to my lashes with this product.my friend uses the other serum that costs entirely too much</li>
            <li>LIke I said I am on my first tube and it has been 5 months, so spending about $20 for a product that will last that long is really close to nothing!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say it does as much for the thickness, but I definitely have some new growth.</li>
            <li>Honestly, RapidLash is half the cost with absolutely NO side-effects.</li>
            <li>I received it, and tried it right away, but the brush was dry and there was nothing in there.  </li>
            <li>I had been struggling to find the right mascara that would really make the little corner lashes stand out, but after using this product I swear I&#x27;ve had brand new lashes grow</li>
            <li>They looked fine with mascara, however were quite limp.</li>
            <li>I did make another purchase to be ready when the initial tube runs out, but so far it is still going!  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s most likely why my eyes are so red and dry.  </li>
            <li>I have only noticed they seem in a little better condition, less likely to lose as many.  </li>
            <li>It works, but you really have to use it every single day for at least a month to see any kind of results on your lashes.</li>
            <li>My lashes are noticeably longer and my thinning eyebrows are filling back in, despite the fact that I am &amp;#34;a woman of a certain age.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving it three stars because for the price it&#x27;s certainly lasted me a while, especially given how often I apply it.</li>
            <li>So, I was desperate for a quick, fast and efficient solution to grow back my own lashes.</li>
            <li>My lashes grew longer and filled in a little.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended, especially combined with a dying product like Swiss O Par to darken...gives you virtually maintenance free, dark, lush lashes for days and even weeks.</li>
            <li>Unless you&#x27;re making serious bank, that&#x27;s a significant investment into something you don&#x27;t know very much about.     </li>
            <li>I rarely ever write reviews, good or bad, but I&#x27;ve made an exception.  </li>
            <li>great* idea and cutting them yourself.  </li>
            <li>If I forget to apply at night, I put it on in the morning, as it is clear.  </li>
            <li>As of now, I still don&#x27;t have a really clear idea of why it works, how well it works, but ...      </li>
            <li>My lashes are pretty long naturally</li>
            <li>Please note that the photographs do not show the difference as clearly as I can see it myself.</li>
            <li>He can clearly see the difference.  </li>
            <li>It is clear and as yet I see no change.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s not  false lash expectations but realist expectation, with product I would say gives your lashes a extra 40% thicker and 20% darker.</li>
            <li>area on the top of my lashes, and lately I have been putting it &amp;#34;under&amp;#34; my lower lashes, and</li>
            <li>I have really seen a definite difference.  </li>
            <li>After I had my extensions taken off I was left with gaps and very brittle eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>so far I don&#x27;t see that on mine.</li>
            <li>After using this for a month I was really pleasantly surprised to see</li>
            <li>I am 67 yrs old</li>
            <li>but because my lashes were so short I really can see an improvement.  </li>
            <li>After a couple of months I was ready to give up, when about the 3rd month some of my lashes started getting noticeably longer.</li>
            <li>only twice, feels like when your eyelash is getting ready to fall out itch.</li>
            <li>My bottom lashes are much longer and definitely thicker.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for a month and really did not see any different.</li>
            <li>Overall, a promising product, but there ARE side effects.</li>
            <li>No visible results so far.  </li>
            <li>you will be soooooo surprised.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed that my product is old.</li>
            <li>Also, when I reordered someone had rubbed off the expiration date, so be on the look out for old product, and remember that an expiration date should be on the bottom of this product.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t know anything about them, they tend to be short, straight, and sparse.</li>
            <li>, I was scared that I would get a product which would darken my natural eye colour, so I was hesitant to buy RapidLash.  </li>
            <li>The same product purchasd from Amazon does not seem to have as much product in the container as when I purchased it from a beautician.  </li>
            <li>I question if the product was old or evaporated.</li>
            <li>A 27 year old was jealous of my lashes, (I&#x27;m 54)</li>
            <li>After one use I have developed eyeball pain.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it on brows as I had them professionally tatooed as a Birthday gift.  </li>
            <li>After continued use, it went away completely.</li>
            <li>This product has performed well for me so far.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d imagine I should start seeing any changes, but there are none so far.</li>
            <li>I have doubts so far, but I will continue applying, and if anything changes or happens \\&quot;overnight\\</li>
            <li>So far, two stars.</li>
            <li>I did not put on any eye cream at night while using this, nothing that would interfere with the product&#x27;s action.  </li>
            <li>absolutely NOTHING happened, except some red burning eyes.  </li>
            <li>Fixed with a bit of concealer, foundation or eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>You have to be religious with it and use it as much as it says it you won&#x27;t see the effects.</li>
            <li>mascara couldn&#x27;t help much because they were so short.</li>
            <li>Just wish company would design tube so that you have some idea of how much you have left so that I can order in advance.  </li>
            <li>I have never had any lashes to speak of but with this product I can actually curl them and have much longer thicker eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>WOW...           </li>
            <li>It works for me, for my mom(80 years old) and my sister-and law.</li>
            <li>and I completely noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>(ie, you have to really work with the brush to get the product out of the tube for proper application).  </li>
            <li>I used to have very short eyelashes and after having eyelash extensions for 2 months, they were really out of condition.</li>
            <li>Where I really noticed the difference was in some recent head shot pictures taken of me.  </li>
            <li>By the way, I have had no itching or discomfort of any sort with this product and my eyes have always been sensitive.</li>
            <li>So far I guess it is helping a bit.</li>
            <li>Not so much as the last one I purchased.</li>
            <li>Try it - you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>The second round has been better by far.</li>
            <li>and WOW it made those bald spots disappear.</li>
            <li>recommend you do it early before bed</li>
            <li>So far there is no changes to lashes.  </li>
            <li>I used it for over 8 weeks never missing a day.</li>
            <li>As you blink and then go to sleep the product will naturally get onto the lower lashes on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>When i bought the second one, i didn&#x27;t notice as much of a change.</li>
            <li>I AM 73 YEARS OLD</li>
            <li>So far it has made the eyelashes on the treated eye look darker, and a bit thicker and longer.  </li>
            <li>My old tube is almost used up now.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product (this is a replenishment for me) hoping it would fill in my natural eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I noticed just how much my eyelashes have actually improved by volume and length.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely sold on this product now.</li>
            <li>someone can lend some insight into whether the reddish discoloration is commonly seen on the barrel, that might put my mind at ease a bit more about repurchasing and giving the product another chance.  </li>
            <li>I have tried grandlash and smartlash so far</li>
            <li>so I would say this product is not for those of us that have sensitive eyes or allergies.</li>
            <li>However I continued to us rapid lash , reluctantly as I had nearly given up on it working for me.</li>
            <li>I apply at night because after applying it, it dries and coats with a white film, very noticeable</li>
            <li>It did not bother my sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>Unfortunately my natural lashes went with them.  </li>
            <li>I use this product daily and haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference yet.  </li>
            <li>The cost is reasonable, especially compared to prescription alternatives.  </li>
            <li>So at least no permanent damage :-)</li>
            <li>When I stopped using this product my lashes started their natural curve again.  </li>
            <li>I was getting ready to get eyelash extensions prior to purchasing, now I just use this and my MAC Blacksplash</li>
            <li>I now have pretty long lashes.  </li>
            <li>and sometimes they grow in a lil wonky, but still extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>My whole life I&#x27;ve had short lashes.  </li>
            <li>With my luck, my natural lashes would get pulled out.  </li>
            <li>I also had the experience where it made my eyelashes sensitive</li>
            <li>This did not work for me as my skin seems to be too sensitive.</li>
            <li>finally, my eyes swelled so much, I could not ignore it and had to stop using it.</li>
            <li>Was it the serum or natural.... who knows.</li>
            <li>I see a marked improvement.</li>
            <li>I used it religiously for a month and it lengthened my lashes, so when I apply mascara, it really shows.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I noticed results as early as week 2.</li>
            <li>I give this product 4 stars because I was pleasantly surprised this stuff works.</li>
            <li>I have never had any irritation with it and have seriously sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>Like I stated in my title, it took about a month for me to start noticing results, I have straight short lashes.</li>
            <li>But the actual thickness of the hairs didn&#x27;t improve as much as I&#x27;d hoped it would, and this stuff is still a bit pricey.</li>
            <li>I like it so far ...</li>
            <li>and my eyelashes are pretty long.</li>
            <li>I is by not stretch of the imagination near the lengthening and thickening effects I got while using Latisse.  </li>
            <li>My natural lashes are medium-thick and straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping did come early too.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a young 54)</li>
            <li>My lashes have thickened and grown out considerably.</li>
            <li>I was actually really surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li>they were in the old days.  </li>
            <li>but so far there is no noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>no darkening around the eyes, itchy/dry eyes and sensitive eyelids like side effects the Lilash caused&lt;br</li>
            <li>With mascara, they nearly touch my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for 3 weeks but haven&#x27;t seen any change so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working well so far.</li>
            <li>I have been using this products for nearly 7 weeks</li>
            <li>Far exceeded my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>Maybe too early</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seventy years old.</li>
            <li>So far I have seen a noticeable difference in length and fullness.</li>
            <li>I am only wearing mascara, not eye liner so you can see what it is capable of turning out like.</li>
            <li>Only give it 3 stars bc of the burning and who wants to have to buy separate products for lashes and brows?</li>
            <li>, I was so surprised.</li>
            <li>I bought two of there so far and used non stop for about 6 months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 years old</li>
            <li>I really like the way this serum moisturizes my eye lids just above my lashes.</li>
            <li>It really works actually faster than it</li>
            <li>I have short &amp; straight eyelashes after a month</li>
            <li>they actually seem to be falling out &amp; my eyes are really irritated.</li>
            <li>The purpose for purchasing this product is because I wanted my lashes to be naturally longer.</li>
            <li>in ... seems to keep the growth so far (eyelashes)</li>
            <li>Been using now for several weeks and don&#x27;t see much change.  </li>
            <li>not so much so far.</li>
            <li>I thought wow</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had really short lashes my whole life that no amount of mascara could fix.  </li>
            <li>Makes lashes soft and easier when applying mascara.i use it on my eyebrows too.</li>
            <li>Buying directly from the manufacturer or distributors may allow it.</li>
            <li>, she&#x27;d probably try stealing it from me and 2, I don&#x27;t think she needs the product so young).</li>
            <li>expected more liquid inside the containers; applying it twice a day, the entire container did not last 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and often have allergic reactions to beauty products but not this.</li>
            <li>Maybe I am just sensitive to an ingredient, but I will no longer use this</li>
            <li>I kept using it anyway for another month and now discontinued completely because of no growth at all.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money I spent on this product.</li>
            <li>eyelashes have been growing out a lot more slowly, but the growth is still noticeable.</li>
            <li>My lashes have always been very blond in color and now as I have gotten older they have turned white but with a little mascara and having used this product they look thick long and beautiful.</li>
            <li>the first few days after starting this product, but it disappeared quickly.  </li>
            <li>I only used it on the upper eyelashes and eyebrow of my right eye.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise Amazon responded right away, within the same day, issued a credit back to my account.  </li>
            <li>With Rapidlash, my lashes are darker, more plentiful, longer, and the growth comes through with a natural curl, unlike other more expensive products I&#x27;ve tried that result in rogue lashes that make me look like the leader of the Droogs in A Clockwork Orange.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a little over 2 weeks and see significant growth in my lashes...</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the last two months but not regularly and still noticed a pretty big difference they are longer but not so much fuller</li>
            <li>I continued to apply a little eyeshadow on my brows while using this product and it stilled worked even though it is recommended to use on a clean brow.</li>
            <li>I was so anxious to start using this product due to so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>so i just use it everyday, usually twice a day even though it says your not supposed to lol the only downfall is it leaves my eyelids a bit puffy, even when i was using it as directed.</li>
            <li>the first week of my eyes a little allergy, anyway, I really like this product.</li>
            <li>After a few days of use, little blood vessels on my lids and under my eyes became very prominent and the areas looked bruised.</li>
            <li>Otherwise they would almost immediately lose the curl and return to their original limp state.</li>
            <li>I took pictures before starting rapidlash, well they were really just back to normal.</li>
            <li>I have been using this now for a few months and have noticed a significant difference in the number of eyelashes that I have and also their length.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited to see my lashes in another few weeks.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m willing to take, i mean for the price of this thing the result is so much more than what i have expected.</li>
            <li>I really would rather live with short, blonde lashes than none at all</li>
            <li>My daughter has asked me to purchase Rapid Lash as a Christmas gift for her because the difference in my lashes is so profound.  </li>
            <li>The first night I used this on my lashes, I woke up with bloodshot red eyes and the surrounding eye areas were red and puffy.</li>
            <li>At first, I put it on once at night and once during the day, only on the upper lash line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this product works or not, I was only able to use it for 3 days.  </li>
            <li>and I am not typically a patient person.</li>
            <li>My sister started it at the same time as me and has also had the exact same effects.</li>
            <li>But do not expect miracles, be realistic you should definitely see somewhat of a difference in your eyelashes from the before and after.</li>
            <li>The bare spot with missing lashed has filled in and grown out.  </li>
            <li>so my eyelashes are naturally not too long or full but this product</li>
            <li>fake lashes and lash glue have more problems than solutions so this serum is perfect--growth seen in first week and bottle lasts for months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered enough the first 4 weeks with my initial experience with Rapidlash</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t notice much but after a few weeks after washing my face I kept thinking I hadn&#x27;t fully removed my mascara.</li>
            <li>I have pretty short and sparse Asian lashes.</li>
            <li>I have only started using this in the past week or two, so I haven&#x27;t been able to see results yet.</li>
            <li>when i first tried it, it burned my eyes like hell, and the second day my eyes were red for</li>
            <li>my eyelashes were exactly the same way they were prior to using the product.</li>
            <li>You can have YOUR OWN LASHES, growing long and thick...</li>
            <li>After a month of consistent use, I have seen absolutely no new eyebrow growth or lengthening of current eyebrow hairs-beyond that of what normally grows in a month.</li>
            <li>After pretty much decimating my lashes with fake individuals, faithfully, for years (like 5) I found this stuff and it pretty much gave them life.</li>
            <li>I have been using it everyday, and the only side effects are slight dryness and mild very mild itching-</li>
            <li>I had heard very good things about Rapidlash but having used it for over a month now, I have to say I am disappointed as I have not noticed any visible results yet.</li>
            <li>I am not happy with this product, I seem to be losing more eyelashes than gaining any new ones.</li>
            <li>If your a mature woman with fine thinning hair, don&#x27;t expect to get long lush dramatic eyelashes quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s become part of my routine and is just too easy not to - takes only a few seconds and doesn&#x27;t burn at all.</li>
            <li>now i have long thick lashes with layers, kind of hard to remember what it was like before! :)</li>
            <li>I was even skeptical about the reviews because there were so many positive ones.  </li>
            <li>This product really works, and goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li>I have always had rather long lashes, but this makes them look even longer and fuller to where I don&#x27;t have to use so much mascara in the morning.</li>
            <li>I used it on my eyebrows because I have long eyelashes but very sparse eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>my lashes were so long that people really noticed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;My were growing so fast and long</li>
            <li>mascara people always ask if my eyelashes are real because they can&#x27;t believe how long my eyelashes are.</li>
            <li>Now I have straight long lashes</li>
            <li>I bought this not too long ago for my eyebrows (not so much my lashes).  </li>
            <li>I carefully read the reviews before purchasing this product because it seemed to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>But, if you quit using it, your lashes go back to normal in a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>, I try rapidlash and at first it looks like the bottle was empty but</li>
            <li>Within a few weeks the spots on my brows were COMPLETELY filled in and not long after that my eyebrows grew in thicker, darker, and longer.</li>
            <li>(so I can go back to Lilash), and glad I only wasted $20.</li>
            <li>It took 5 days after I stopped using this for my eyes to get back to normal.  </li>
            <li>As soon as you stop using Rapidlash, somehow your lashes go back to your normal length.</li>
            <li>What a true waste of money.  </li>
            <li>Early this year I started noticing that I started to loose many lashes and the ones I had left were half the size .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed the price has dropped considerably since I was using it regularly, so if anyone is interested in trying it, the cost is low enough.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really have a high expectations, but my eye lashes are really long now!!!!!</li>
            <li>I woke up at 3am last night to use the bathroom and ordered a new bottle</li>
            <li>I know some products only start working at the beginning of a new lash cycle (for ex: Latisse), which is why it can take up to 4 weeks to even begin seeing some results.</li>
            <li>The price is one that I can live with especially since I&#x27;m at the point where I don&#x27;t have to use it every night to get the results that I want.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll recommend this to my friend and purchase a new one when the current one is gone!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really work out for me because it made my eyes dry and itchy,</li>
            <li>My lashes tend to curl as a whole but there are a few rebel lashes that are straight.</li>
            <li>I use Rapidlash regularly and have for several years,  and it really does lengthen eyelashes and adds some fullness as well,  nothing else I have used even comes close.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Chinese and I have short stubby and straight lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m halfway through my third tube, and my eyelashes are short again, and rather straight.  </li>
            <li>Be consistent with your daily applications and you will be batting those LONG eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Perhaps more now than ever, although they are not as thick yet as I&#x27;d like them yet, and you wouldn&#x27;t necessarily notice them longer without mascara if you weren&#x27;t paying close attention</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect fast results, it&#x27;s a slow process but worth it.</li>
            <li>I used to have individual perma lashes on and off for several years and it has left my natural lashes bald in many spots and very very brittle and thin.</li>
            <li>My lashes only seem a little darker, so at first the difference wasn&#x27;t noticeable until I started wearing mascara a little more regularly.</li>
            <li>I would only ever stick with Latisse or an exact generic formulation in the future.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I notice a big difference with no makeup on, but when I put mascara on, wow!</li>
            <li>Then all of a sudden - wow!  </li>
            <li>I had some eye irritation but nothing major, no discoloration as some have reported.</li>
            <li>I noticed a major difference in my eyelashes within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>A couple of weeks later, my brows were back to normal~ phew!</li>
            <li>It seems to work on some people and not other.</li>
            <li>My brows paid the price and have become a source of major annoyance.  </li>
            <li>I know I started to loose lashes because how much I use mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>there have been spots where I would constantly loose lashes, which really gave me VISIBLE holes in my lashes when I put mascara on.</li>
            <li>The only drawback that I&#x27;ve noticed is the first 2 weeks of use left my right eyelid a brownish color and slightly puffy but after using another week, the color and puffyness seems to have improved so it must have been an initial reaction to the serum.</li>
            <li>Rapidlash is also easy to put on , You just have the little brush that goes back in the bottle, simple no fuss.</li>
            <li>Have used other products like City Lash with modest results but this stuff really does work.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased Rapidlash Serum about two years ago and after using it for a little over a month, I did see a marked improvement in my thin, light colored lashes.  </li>
            <li>For some reason, my right eye&#x27;s lashes is growing faster than my left eye, but it&#x27;s not an extremely noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>That product worked very well, but had very little product in the tube so there wasn&#x27;t much bang for the buck</li>
            <li>I had a bad day and decided it was a great time to do my brows.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know what is wrong with this product, cause I&#x27;ve used it before and the result was amazing.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical of this product but saw amazing results after 1-2 months of nightly use.</li>
            <li>I barely have any and have been, to the chagrin of my spouse, considering eyebrow tatoo-ing.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really noticeable when wet</li>
            <li>My bottom lashes which were barely visible are growing too.</li>
            <li>especially when Amazon offers it for under $26.</li>
            <li>I stopped using the Rapidlash and the next morning marked improvement.  </li>
            <li>I started using Rapidlash on both my eyelashes and on my brows and after 6 weeks my lashes have completely grown back in and are longer than before.</li>
            <li>I am only 20 years old, by the way.  </li>
            <li>and when it got here the box was closed but it was all written on and very wrinkly if that makes sence.</li>
            <li>I read reviews of different serums and was really surprised with the ones for Rapidlash.</li>
            <li>Can barely get it out.  </li>
            <li>I could barely even tell I had eyelashes,</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for me but the plus side it causes no irritation or minimal unlike latisse</li>
            <li>far I haven&#x27;t noticed anything, I started putting it on my upper lashes as well.</li>
            <li>No regrets here.</li>
            <li>but it is definitely an improvement on my old blah lashes.  </li>
            <li>I barely started using so</li>
            <li>I barely started to see some length after almost 8 weeks.  </li>
            <li>The skin around my eyes (eyelids &amp; under eyes) was even red and sensitive.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect to see completely changed lashes in 2 weeks because you are actually growing lashes!</li>
            <li>Note that I had also been continuing to apply Rapidlash LIBERALLY (which made application a bigger pain in the derriere because the teeny tiny wand only picks up so much product to begin with).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>and I even had bare spots.  </li>
            <li>It irritated my eyes and made my eyelid near the lash line go from red to a bruised purple.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for nearly a month and can definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li>I have actually made a pic every week and so far i can see NO change .I</li>
            <li>the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i stopped it for couple of days and used it again, but this time no burning &amp; no redness in my eyes, that is because i was careful not to put the solution inside my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>yet I barely ever wear makeup</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t theatrically long, but they are naturally and NOTICEABLY long, and very flattering.</li>
            <li>It took 2 months to see any results (which were barely noticeable).</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and blue eyes</li>
            <li>I took several \\&quot;before\\&quot; photos and made a mental note of exactly where my lashes went to on my eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>5th day they were slightly red, and the 6th they were back to normal.</li>
            <li>Well, couple months later, my lashes have gone back to their normal length and thickness.</li>
            <li>I used this exactly as instructed, daily for 8 weeks, and there was absolutely no difference in the length, thickness or otherwise appearance of my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>old woman who has had short, thin lashes for most of my life.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>It is kind of uncomfortable at the beginning</li>
            <li>I used to love those people with long and thick eyelashes..</li>
            <li>This is a product for which I have paid full retail in the past.</li>
            <li>I used to have nice eyelashes, but after getting fake eyelashes put on at a salon, that all changed.</li>
            <li>The end result is well worth those few seconds.  </li>
            <li>Now they are fully grown still somewhat thin but still so much better.</li>
            <li>I love this product my eyelashes are thicker and darker and I always had thin brown/blonde eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even tried lash extensions which were nice but temporary and expensive.</li>
            <li>I have always had nice long lashes but with age they were not as thick or as long.</li>
            <li>I had tried using false eyelashes twice and noticed that when they were removed they removed most of my lashes.</li>
            <li>I rated this product a 4 instead of a 5 because I developed these little red bumps/zit-looking things around my eye sockets right after I started using the product</li>
            <li>I can definitely see new hair growth especially on my lower lashes.</li>
            <li>It seems that everytime a product is new and improved, it is totally ruined and never works the same again.</li>
            <li>As long as you aren&#x27;t one of those reviewers who experience extreme irritation, a bit of early stage itchiness is worth the results, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes had started to fall out on one eye with bald spots and the other would break after wetting to a certain length.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an impatient person but you can definitely see quick results with this product.</li>
            <li>The new ones that have been nourished with Rapid Lash, are stronger and mine were almost twice as long, and CURLY.  </li>
            <li>first then the black mascara.</li>
            <li>me just say, the first week and a half I wanted to cry and give up on Rapidlash because my lashes started thinning (I could literally feel the loss of the conditioning from stopping L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s lash serum) and falling out.</li>
            <li>There was some slight itching at first</li>
            <li>the first week I used it, I did have some slight itching and irritation along my eye lids, but that did go away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for exactly a month and half.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unfortunate that you have to open the box to see the expired date but make sure you do it!  </li>
            <li>By twelve weeks, my lashes are longer and super dense (no more bald patches).  </li>
            <li>No more bold spots on my eyebrows and it made my eyelashes longer.</li>
            <li>Showed it to my eye doctor who confirmed this is the same as product used for high pressure in eyes that side effect is thick long lashes.do not put the drops in your eye!</li>
            <li>(I USE IT EVERY OTHER NIGHT), IT REALLY HELPS.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may try it again using it very sparingly and every other night or two</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 48 and naturally have dark eyelashes that are fairly short and straight.  </li>
            <li>BECAUSE I LOOKED A HOT MESS.</li>
            <li>I finally feel comfortable not wearing fake eyelashes after using this consistently for a couple months.</li>
            <li>(I wish I had appreciated all these little things when I was young).  </li>
            <li>you want the long, dark, full lashes of your youth, find a picture of yourself from way back then, and feel greatful that you even have eyelashes...</li>
            <li>Needless to say, the eyelashes pulled out my own during the removal process and left me barely with any eyelashes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not AMAZING and going to magically make your lashes super thick and long</li>
            <li>like i said in the beginning i saw little lashes growing out almost immediately after i start using this, the bald spot on both my under eyelashes have already been filled in, the new lashes are still not as long as the other ones</li>
            <li>I wanted that over-plucked look that was so popular for many years (which looked terrible on everyone, by the way.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I would get more dramatic results.</li>
            <li>While the product appeared clear as it came out of the tube, I noticed a reddish discoloration on a portion of the white plastic barrel directly above the brush.  </li>
            <li>Only long lashes not thick</li>
            <li>On the third day of usage I developed red oozing eyes</li>
            <li>They havent had the dark circle problem or the red irritated eyes for the first while.</li>
            <li>I  just have to be careful not to use too much or get in eye as it will irritate my eye the following day.&lt;br /&gt;Really improves length and thickness of eyelashes.</li>
            <li>(natural blonde my lashes are white).</li>
            <li>I will most likely keep using this product, however, if I see that there are worse side effects, I will discontinue use, and inform everyone through review.</li>
            <li>I also put it on my brows and they look way more fuller and defined, they say 1 bottle lasts 2 months, it probably does, but in the beginning I was so freaking out I kept putting it on a few times a day, they say it won&#x27;t help, so don&#x27;t waste it.</li>
            <li>and my eyes were a little irritated the first week.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>The first couple of days i did experience a little bit of irritation around my eyes</li>
            <li>When I first started using the product, I felt a little stinging along my lash line.</li>
            <li>I have to say i noticed little hair growing out on a bald spot on my bottom lash in as little as 2 days, the end of my top lashes were growing longer in about 3-4 days, i didn&#x27;t expect such a rapid growth from this product</li>
            <li>First, my &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; lashes began to look a little thicker.</li>
            <li>, so maybe these new lashes will just grow long enough eventually to blend in with the ones I already have.</li>
            <li>I tried another cheaper lash growth mavala which seemed to barely make lashes look alittle stronger, but this one makes a bigger difference.  </li>
            <li>Now when I wear mascara, my lashes look long and lush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to give it at least 16 weeks to determine the full effect</li>
            <li>i have noticed longer lashes after a few weeks of using the first bottle.</li>
            <li>I am getting married in a few months</li>
            <li>My lashes were becoming so thin with age, so I decided to give this product a try.  </li>
            <li>It took about a few months to start seeing results, and it worked really well!</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on Rapidlash before I purchased, so I was willing to wait a few weeks for results.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping this serum was going to give me incredibly full and thick lashes.</li>
            <li>BUT I&#x27;m really scared of all these stories of lashes falling out 3, 6, 9 months down the road.  </li>
            <li>i shacked and put it upside down, but nothing came out, very odd.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the past I&#x27;ve used prescription eyelash growers with excellent results, but I started using Rapidlash because it was less expensive.</li>
            <li>I have seen extreme growth on both my upper and lower lashes, This product really works it actually grow your lashes.</li>
            <li>have very &#x27;average&#x27; lashes, light brown in color and of average length and thickness.</li>
            <li>the ones that were half the size were really</li>
            <li>They seem thicker although I know hair follicles cannot be created, but they also seem much longer and healthier with less falling.  </li>
            <li>I used Lilash in the past and that stuff REALLY works, wish I could find the old version before they changed formula.</li>
            <li>But after using this for a month, my eyelashes have fully grown back in and they are so long and lush.</li>
            <li>I definitely noticed a difference in my lashes after the first few weeks.</li>
            <li>I have long, thick lashes ( they finally filled in and got denser).</li>
            <li>and I lost a few more of them then usual.</li>
            <li>I have really good lashes anyway, but now they are crazy long....</li>
            <li>I have pretty thick lashes naturally but have been experiencing some breakage from curling, so I stopped wearing all eye make up and ordered this,</li>
            <li>And if that doesn&#x27;t help you, find some easy to adhere false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is you have to be very diligent about using this every single night, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t seem like your lashes are as long the next morning.</li>
            <li>I finished my tiny Latisse bottle, seeing less positive effects and actually losing eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Started seeing positive results in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that I will end up with lush, long and darker lashes as my friend did, however, she did use a much more expensive product.  </li>
            <li>The health of my eyes is really something I don&#x27;t want to mess with</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had to use a lash curler before because my lashes were not long enough</li>
            <li>Not sure it makes lashes longer because mine are already long but definitely makes them stronger and keeps them full.</li>
            <li>once I applied in generously, like really wet lashes, WOW!</li>
            <li>With mascara, they are starting to look crazy long, but I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s really good mascara or this stuff making a difference.</li>
            <li>Before, I barely had any hair on my left brow and was annoyed at having to pencil in my brows which usually never looked quite right</li>
            <li>It was not they typical red, rashy itch, but was very persistent.  </li>
            <li>I saw the good reviews for this and decided to give it a try as it was MUCH less expensive.  </li>
            <li>but that has sort of settled down and now my lashes are thick and lovely and back to where they used to be.</li>
            <li>I actually use it to clear up some dry skin that occasionally starts developing on my eyelid at the lash line.  </li>
            <li>I have fine , thin, lashes, all my life, and this enhancing serum</li>
            <li>Just have a little patience, this stuff really does work.</li>
            <li>It might be a little bit thicker but nothing really change in length.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend applying the serum really close to the inside of your eye (where your eye meets your nose) because I started feeling a little tender when I got too close.</li>
            <li>I just read someone&#x27;s blog saying they developed the same problem and it turned out to be permanent dry eye!</li>
            <li>The only effect (if I&#x27;m not imagining a placebo effect) is my lashes seem a little stronger, I don&#x27;t notice them coming out as much as I used to.  </li>
            <li>and I still have a little bit of solution left in my tube so the product goes a pretty long way if you are just using it on your lashes.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are now so long and thick, that I have stopped wearing mascara unless I am dressing for special occasions.  </li>
            <li>So, after reading the good and bad reviews on Amazon about Rapidlash Eyelash Serum, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I was wary to try the product because of the potential side effects but I have experienced none of the negative side effects (brown discoloration of the eyelid and iris of the eye, pain, and falling out of eyelashes).</li>
            <li>Last week I had a few random lashes which were much longer than the others, however they all seem to have caught up and evened out better now.  </li>
            <li>I have used the Loreal Paris lash serum with the blue lid, gold middle and clear bottom and the Rimmel London Lash accelerator serum with the lime green metallic lid, gold middle and clear tube.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was very happy until I noticed that this product stopped working in about 8 months.</li>
            <li> So, do not count on your beautiful eye lashed for no longer then 6-8 months!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and works wonderfully</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about 8 weeks into using this on a nightly basis, and I can say that I am very happy with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Very good product.</li>
            <li> It truly works &amp; the price is incredible at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with the way my eyebrows have grown, but am also very happy with my eyelashes as well.  </li>

            <li> Good luck guys!</li>
            <li> She said she didn&#x27;t think I need it because I have beautiful lashes already.  </li>
            <li> Then one of my friends suggested me this Beautiful Eyelash enhancing serum</li>
            <li> This product conditions and strengthens the eyelashes beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I looked like I didn&#x27;t have lashes without make up on before, and now you can see them beautifully.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the results, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay the exhorbitant price to try Latisse!</li>
            <li> Let me first say I &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 this stuff.</li>
            <li> Very pleased!</li>
            <li> A welcome plus.  </li>
            <li> My lashes look great.</li>
            <li> Why spend the money on Latisse when this works great and does not require a prescription?</li>
            <li> I had great hope for this.</li>
            <li> Still, it is a great product</li>
            <li> This was in my price range and I am so happy I got it.</li>
            <li> Happy happy customer</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m quite happy with this longer lashes.  </li>
            <li> Works great on eyelashes, they are longer than I can believe.</li>
            <li> and I have seen a great difference in my lashes.  </li>
            <li> The color has not lightened, and mascara makes them look great.</li>
            <li> this product was recommended to me that has had great results, so i&#x27;m hopeful that in time it will work well.</li>
            <li> I had heard great things about this product and was eager to try it.</li>

            <li> It is a great product to buy.</li>
            <li> I read from another person&#x27;s review that castor oil works great at stimulating eye lash and brow growth.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m soo happy I found it.</li>
            <li> Takes a couple of months, but works great.</li>

            <li> Great to save $$</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and have had great results.</li>
            <li> I had great results from Revitalash</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s a huge difference!!!</li>
            <li> I love this serum, and will continue to buy!!</li>
            <li> Give it a month or so and enjoy lashes!!!  </li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re noticeably longer for sure!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many months, and can&#x27;t be happier with the results!!  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of years now and it&#x27;s honestly changed my life!</li>

            <li> Honestly I thought there was no hope, well I found it!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be happy you did!  :)</li>
            <li> I will keep using and see if continuous use will give me longer lashes :P crossing my fingers</li>
            <li> Filling in some sparse areas quite nicely!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting close to achieving the faux lash look with my own lashes, hoorah!</li>
            <li> The tips curl upwards on their own and I&#x27;ve never had that!</li>
            <li> Despite the \\&quot;hiccup\\&quot; in my Rapidlash experience, I can easily recommend it - the results were impressive!</li>
            <li> Rapid Lash its a great product that give us excellent and quickly results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has never done a good job on my thin,sparse brows,but that&#x27;s NOT why I purchased it in the beginning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> formula and loved Rapidlash.</li>
            <li> Labs Rapidlash Eyelash Enhancing Serum --- a good purchase...</li>
            <li> and I am happy with how effective it is judging by the cost.</li>
            <li> I tried RapidLash because I thought it might be a good alternative to Latisse....</li>
            <li> I loved it.    </li>
            <li> To begin with my eyelashes were a good length</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have read a lot of good things about it.  </li>
            <li> This product does work good.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product, seems to work.  </li>
            <li> Plus, they burned after applying....no good.</li>
            <li> But good side is, my lashes were stronger than before.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Latise, but it doesn&#x27;t cost a $100 either.</li>
            <li> I stayed using latisse a couple years ago, then switched to RevitaLash, which i loved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed by all of the good reviews here.</li>
            <li> The product lasted me a good 6 months when applied every night, so you get a lot for your money.</li>
            <li> my eyelashes are gorgeous.</li>
            <li> one may work good.  </li>
            <li> Rapid lash works just as good</li>
            <li> I feel like I gave this product a fair try.</li>
            <li> I orderes a bucnch of bottles now , since I am intending to give them a couple of good friends.</li>
            <li> Unopened product is good for 3 years from this date.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would give this product a try since it was getting good reviews.</li>
            <li> With continued use my lashes seem to stay looking good.  </li>
            <li> I saw Rapidlash price point and good reviews and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> good ladies tried it</li>
            <li> thats how good this product works and THANK GOD</li>
            <li> Good, my eyelash seems grew longer since I used 3 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Absolutely as good as SmartLash.  </li>
            <li> This is a really good product.</li>
            <li> Good product and will buy it again soon&lt;</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look as good</li>
            <li> Good results.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s a good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 65 and still work to look good.</li>
            <li> I had read that it was good for sparse eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Made my lashes fall out, would of loved to get a refund</li>
            <li> then i will desided if it good or</li>
            <li> Just as good as latisse</li>
            <li> Not just amazing, but AMAZING!</li>
            <li> and so I am very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and will continue to use it nightly.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for eyelashes and eyebrows and have been very satisfied with the product and the price.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Ordered Rapidlash before and have been very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> in all, I&#x27;m very glad</li>
            <li> I have used Rapidlash for 9 months now and am very pleased with my results.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year now and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> However If I apply a nice mascara my lashes will look good.</li>
            <li> I did not believed in this kind of product but because of the good reviews I give it a try.</li>

            <li> I love Rapid Lash because it works!</li>
            <li> that is probably the reason why i still have not seen results after more than 8 weeks of application!   </li>
            <li> I had them removed and lost even more eyelashes in the process!  </li>
            <li> and I have seen growth for sure!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m SO glad I did!  </li>

            <li> and I used it religiously (most mornings AND nights!)</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this product and plan to continue using it until i reach my desired results!</li>
            <li> This product is very good and gives quick results</li>
            <li> It makes me feel much more beautiful and confident now.    </li>
            <li> Not as quick of results as others I have used, but it is good!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> i was using LiLash (which is amazing)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s now been 3 months and the result is amazing.</li>
            <li> my eyelashes are amazing.</li>
            <li> It was just amazing...          </li>
            <li> given my experience with Latisse (amazing even after 3 weeks)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This product worked amazingly.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> but they look amazing.</li>
            <li> A girlfriend has used Latisse and her lashes are amazing</li>
            <li> I have used lilash and had amazing results, I was hoping to find a cheaper alternative with Rapidlash.</li>
            <li> To receive 5 stars in my book a product would have to be out of this world amazing.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Rapidlash because the reviews on Amazon raved about how amazing Rapidlash was.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but this product was amazing.  </li>
            <li> amazing - brows are thicker and fuller a month +</li>
            <li> When I apply mascara it is amazing.</li>
            <li> It is amazing product and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> my lashes look amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing product</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say, it is the Rapidlash.  </li>
            <li> Now they are full and beautiful again.  </li>
            <li> I am thrilled.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes did seem longer, which was a nice.  </li>
            <li> but nothing spectacular</li>
            <li> It does not look faked or anything, it&#x27;s just really nice.</li>
            <li> I do use the product probably 6 out of 7 nights and honestly did not see results until 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> So thrilled; I&#x27;ve been using this for just over TWO WEEKS</li>
            <li> I made sure to apply the serum throughout both top and bottom lashes and had great effects for both.</li>
            <li> To be honest I thought it was a racket, but to my amazement is works wonders.</li>
            <li> your lashes being so nice.</li>
            <li> But there is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> No, you will not keep the wonderful, long, beautiful eyelashes once you stop using the product.</li>
            <li> Excellent .. very ..</li>
            <li> I would rather stick with using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s lash serum and have conditioned, albeit normal-length lashes, than spend the money on BOTH Rapidlash and L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s lash serum, which is what I would need to do in order for Rapidlash to be effective on me at all.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product as not being as effective as the prescription product - but it does work and as I mentioned the prescription product does have its drawbacks.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not worried to be honest.</li>
            <li> After seeing with my own eyes the results in just a week??</li>
            <li> This absolutely the best product for eyelashe enhancement !</li>
            <li> I will continue to use on eyebrows as it gives a really nice pump to them.</li>
            <li> Did not see a difference honestly.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say it works.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes throw their own shadow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no issues with any kind of irritation or color change in my lids.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say I see a difference when I put on my mascara.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff and is effective for hair grown on her eyelashes and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it is as effective because of this.</li>
            <li> It might even make them fuller (I can&#x27;t judge based on my own eyes</li>
            <li> Not as effective as Latisse.</li>
            <li> Thrilled to find an affordable lash enhancer that works.</li>
            <li> I also found it effective for regrowing the tail of my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Great product that really works!!!</li>
            <li> Almost any mascara will do it&#x27;s job when the lashes are healthy and full!!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, particularly for the price.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are sooooo great and long and look wonderful with mascara.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It was pretty incredible.  </li>
            <li> So after I purchased this, I saw better improvements which Im very pleased with.</li>
            <li> Within 4 weeks I saw new growth that impressed me.</li>
            <li> I have used others, including mascaras, but this is by FAR the best, and is amazing.</li>
            <li> but I honestly think it strengthens them and makes any product you place on your lashes much more effective.  </li>
            <li> super great.</li>
            <li> and I had to take a very strong antibiotic.</li>
            <li> The packaging was sealed well and the applicator (which is a lot like eyeliner) was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are healthy so they cooperate much better!</li>
            <li> , they look more healthy and grew a lot and  after a couple of months!</li>
            <li> and I love being able to say no!</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied! :-)</li>
            <li> That stuff works great, fast, and with noticable results!!</li>
            <li> My natural lashes have never looked so beautiful!  </li>
            <li> This is the best by far.  </li>
            <li> Probably not the best for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> One of the most amazing products I have ever encountered.  </li>
            <li> So pleased with the results I sent the company photos thanking them for the amazing product, and they asked to use my photos.</li>
            <li> I have to say so far I am impressed</li>
            <li> the best there is as far as im concerned.</li>
            <li> Since I was mostly concerned with my eyebrows, I am quite thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> that was more effective, but I can not remember the name of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering shopping around with another product and see if I can find one that is more effective.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> So far so good!!</li>
            <li> Will have to keep looking for something suitable for the lashes.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Not as effective as Latisse, but better than some versions.</li>
            <li> Not that they were perfect, but there was clearly some growth noticeable.  </li>
            <li> The price is reasonable (it&#x27;s an awesome product), it&#x27;s easy to apply at the lash line and</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was very excited reading the reviews...</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended!</li>
            <li> Love, love LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> They, are now full and longer than the length that they were originally!!!</li>
            <li> Write me if you want to find out details about my wonderful experience (I didn&#x27;t have major side effects and look at the results!).     </li>
            <li> I am getting lots of compliments and everyone wants to know why my lashes look so good!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the original formula but still helps some...expensive too. )-:</li>
            <li> I see so many glowing reviews , but honestly I&#x27;ve had much better results with revitalash.</li>
            <li> First of all, I received it in great condition.  </li>
            <li> Great stuff that really works!</li>
            <li> First it arrive within 2 days which was great.</li>
            <li> It does make my lashes look curly, but I think it&#x27;s make my lashes off quickly too!!</li>
            <li> BUT  and this is very important...</li>
            <li> If you want a real good product that&#x27;s gonna give you a difference in length or fullness is gonna be Latisse, which is PRETTY PRICY but worth it</li>
            <li> The tube of rapidlash from this seller had a nice tube that is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> my lashes are huge!  </li>
            <li> Very happy with product overall and have reordered again.</li>
            <li> works better than one i tried that was more than twice the price.</li>
            <li> Best if used before bed, then it has all night to sit there on your skin, next to the root of the lashes, with no make-up or anything to get in the way.  </li>
            <li> I lost my eyebrows as a teenager to my best friend, who is now a PhD on molecular design: we had an accident at the lab, and the chemicals burned my forehead, leaving me without eyebrows for most of my teen years.</li>
            <li> and i love the results.  </li>
            <li> and they are almost touching my brows just after 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li> i saw some growth in eyebrows more than eyelashes.</li>
            <li> my lashes looks so much better now with or without mascara.</li>
            <li> As soon as I got more I started applying it again</li>
            <li> Which would explain why so many rave about its effectiveness and others see no results.  </li>
            <li> I will update my review then : )</li>
            <li> I am going to order more soon, because I don&#x27;t want to be out of it.</li>
            <li> I am SO pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I wanted it more for my eyebrows than eyelashes, but using it on both.</li>
            <li> I applied it to both the top and bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> And I LOVE</li>
            <li> (I used to order this through another beauty website and paid much more for it - I&#x27;m SO GLAD</li>
            <li> So many industries these days have forgotten what &amp;#34;truth in advertising&amp;#34; means in pursuit of the almighty buck.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for my eyebrows mostly but tried it on my lashes as well.</li>
            <li> but I read all the product reviews on the many lash serums Amazon has to offer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many eyelash enhancers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the instructions many times</li>
            <li> So I will buy aother tube again for sure.</li>
            <li> not as good as latisse but def worth the money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it took more than two weeks to see the difference.</li>
            <li> You will love it.</li>
            <li> this is my 4th tube of rapidlash, my second from amazon (they have the best prices)</li>
            <li> I will make sure that I never run out of Rapid Lash.</li>
            <li> One more note, there is more than a two month supply in each tube.  </li>
            <li> As with mascara, I think you can safely use this product for up to three months.</li>
            <li> I used the product every night on both my top and bottom lashes.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I do see improvement in my top lashes.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this product and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Buy it, wait for it, and LOVE it too.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been more than 8 weeks</li>
            <li> Be patient and make sure you get a bottle that is not expired.</li>
            <li> everything looks better.</li>
            <li> Longer, more populated lash areas.</li>
            <li> maaan, okay, I&#x27;m going.</li>
            <li> and I love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I should have known better than to apply some product to my eyes..</li>
            <li> so I wanted something to make my eyes pop more.</li>
            <li> I did not do it on my lower lashline, nor on my brows, so I do not know if the product gives you undereye circles or if it helps growing your brows (which I am sure it helps,</li>
            <li> I still apply the serum every night, just to see, if it can get even better.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this product elsewhere and have been pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> it was the most reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I try not to skip too many days.</li>
            <li> For best results you are supposed to apply it on daily</li>
            <li> I use it all the time, I&#x27;m on my 4th tube, I love the results.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll love the results.</li>
            <li> So after having used Latisse, it was interesting to see how this would match up.    </li>
            <li> so no eye lid pigmentation, which I love.      </li>
            <li> I love this product and it does work.</li>
            <li> As for my wish of having more eyelashes, that seems to be improving as well.</li>
            <li> I was sure</li>
            <li> I love that.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t afford to order more than one at a time.  </li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to spend over $100 on the lash lengthening with the dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> I knew it was truly working :)    </li>
            <li> Rapid Lash is such a wonderful and innovative product.</li>
            <li> They look so lovely.</li>
            <li> cheers  :)</li>
            <li> sure you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If ever you do, rinse out eyes throughly with appropriate eyewash or eyedrops and re-apply if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The effect is most noticeable with mascara.</li>
            <li> I feel I am getting better results.  </li>
            <li> love it product made my eyelashes and brows thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> With that said, I was still able to manage approx.</li>
            <li> The price on this site was fantastic; so I ordered two!</li>
            <li> it really works and i am really happy with the results.</li>
            <li> One downside is that my eyes are definitely more red/bloodshot after I started using this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I have not had any side effects with this product and have been generally pleased with the results and will buy another bottle as I am now coming to the end of mine after 6 weeks of use every night.</li>
            <li> love this product.  </li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> It worked fabulously for me!</li>
            <li> What are you waiting for?? :-)</li>
            <li> Reviews said it&#x27;d just make them longer, not fuller, but I feel like I do have more lashes, but I&#x27;ll have to check my before pix to make sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought it just might produce better results.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a better product yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my lashes take to mascara a lot better.</li>
            <li> I have received so many compliments.</li>
            <li> had more product in it</li>
            <li> A sexy camel.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product.</li>
            <li> It was a better price</li>
            <li> In fact, my lashes seem more brittle than before.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the eye brows of my youth but what I do have now is much better than before.</li>
            <li> So 100% sure its helping my lashes to stay put.</li>
            <li> After using it for a couple more wks I had eye lashes w/o any gaps and they were a lot longer.     </li>
            <li> My brows are much better from it to.</li>
            <li> They love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rapidlash for a couple of years now and love it.  </li>
            <li> and it seems like many ppl didn&#x27;t experience a side effect,</li>
            <li> but there was definitely more amount which made it look thicker,</li>
            <li> however i think this thing works exceptionally good for my lashes since i haven&#x27;t read any comments from ppl that stats lash growth in like 2 days, but do think this product is worth the money</li>
            <li> Based on all the great reviews, I ordered this and was really hoping that it would work.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that Ardell&#x27;s Brow and Lash Accelerator works much better for me, at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br</li>
            <li> love the product...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ussed this product for a couple of years and love it..</li>
            <li> I  re-read the directions one more time and decided to give it one more month trial</li>
            <li> Gave one to my sister love it.</li>
            <li> More tingling than anything.</li>
            <li> MORE LASHES FALL OUT,</li>
            <li> THANKS FOR A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure that it is having an effect on the eyebrow, but I will continue the treatment.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rapidlash with good success for a couple of years now.  </li>
            <li> I have used LiLash previously w/ outstanding results.  </li>
            <li> But it DOES work:-)</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle and am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Although Rapidlash does work to extend eyelash growth, one or more of its ingredients can also darken the skin where it is applied.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more of this.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> ok need to try it longer</li>
            <li> It works, there is nothing more to say.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased this, I have seen a difference in the length of my lashes , just wonder if it can be used on the lower lashes, I would purchase this product again .</li>
            <li> I love to use eye lash enhancers.  </li>
            <li> I have used Lash MD products and like those a lot better.</li>
            <li> RapidLash works better than I could have ever hoped for.</li>
            <li> but we always want more.</li>
            <li> The visible difference in the length of the eyelashes has been the most noticeable part.</li>
            <li> Now, I love showing my lashes off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> I used Lash Genesis and that was definitely better, however about $20 more, so you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this every night as I should, it&#x27;s more like every couple of nights.</li>
            <li> I bought this many years ago while it costed me about $50 each.</li>
            <li> I applied it every night before bed, just the top eye lid.</li>
            <li> I love it  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> However, for 30 dollars it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this product any more than I do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying the results.</li>
            <li> I love it though.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Vitamin E and Vaseline worked ok, both kept my eyelashes moisturized and a gave me a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; both to my skin and lashes.</li>
            <li> sure you use it every night</li>
            <li> I was so pleased that I ordered a bottle for my mom for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t lose so many.</li>
            <li> As a result, I have more lashes and they look fuller.</li>
            <li> That said, I enjoyed them while I had them.</li>
            <li> and I found my eyelashes and more prone to breakage</li>
            <li> I paid about $50 after shipping and I am thoroughly pleased by the product.</li>
            <li> Anyone used for a year or more that could weigh in?</li>
            <li> I applied it every night on my top lashes, bottom lashes, and brows.</li>
            <li> I did not gain Brooke Shields brows, just better healthier brows.</li>
            <li> Anything is better than what I had before.</li>
            <li> Most people saw results within 3-6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Maybe with more time.  </li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> It does work, so; therefore I reordered 2 more.</li>
            <li> I will give it 4 more</li>
            <li> I also made sure it doesn&#x27;t have prostaglandin or parabens which cause most side effect problems</li>
            <li> This product is worthwhile and you save a ton of money by purchasing on Amazon versus at a boutique.</li>
            <li> love it.  </li>
            <li> The price is so much better through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Latisse is much, much better.</li>
            <li> I am still using it and hope to see greater changes ahead.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before, and I love it.</li>
            <li> This product has a lot more quantity, but the quality seems to be lacking.</li>
            <li> and I really love it</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still quite satisfied with this product  and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I have 2 more weeks to see the ending results.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to use this and had hoped for great results.</li>
            <li> But I will say that if you aren&#x27;t allergic to it, it appears to work for many people.  </li>
            <li> Okay product.  </li>
            <li> (Rapidlash comes with an eyeliner brush-like wand in the tube, and you apply the product like you would eyeliner), so I tried applying the product more liberally.</li>
            <li> If I need thicker eyelashes. :)</li>
            <li> The effect is more noticeble with my make up on and now my morninig routine gives me so much pleasure,also during the day im so confident with my apperiance,cause my lashes look great.</li>
            <li> I have just recieved my product and before using it I looked on the bottom to make sure of the \\&quot;expiration date\\&quot;, since I&#x27;ve seen so many complaints about the product.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work whatsoever for my eyebrows, I was really hoping it would work since I saw all the great reviews for it.</li>
            <li> I have used Rapidlash for one month and just ordered more.</li>
            <li> I love this product , I can see the diference in my eyebrowns</li>
            <li> and I also started wearing the Grand Lash Mascara that was recommended</li>
            <li> Friends asked me what mascara I was using because my lashes looked that much better.</li>
            <li> Most customers say it takes 4 weeks to see results so the jury&#x27;s still out.</li>
            <li> Boy, am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> It anything, lost more lashes.</li>
            <li> They all work well, but some are easier to apply than others and some just work better.  </li>
            <li> If I had to choose a favorite, this would be it.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product that really works.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes are longer-not thicker, but baby hairs are growing in which might result in a more voluminous effect.</li>
            <li> #*##* and boy am I glad I tried this.</li>
            <li> Wish I had taken before and after cuz I think it works better than La#*##*...</li>
            <li> MUCH better than 3 layers of mascara and a prayer, like on most mornings.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I just wish it would fill in the bald spots more.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve had it about a week, and so I waited to write this review.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s stunning.</li>
            <li> It worked better then Lattise did for me</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 2 years now, and love how my lashes look.</li>
            <li> I had tried a similiar product before but this one works much better.  </li>
            <li> and then when I put mascara they even look better.  </li>
            <li> It took about a month to show, but it has maintained and really looks great.  </li>
            <li> Mac&#x27;s lash serum worked WAY better for me.</li>
            <li> whereas before it was more of a futile exercise.</li>
            <li> I am buying more and I hope they never stop making it, because I am never again going to quit using it.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> FABULOUS!  </li>
            <li> Not all that pleased with item.</li>
            <li> It was Ok</li>
            <li> I am glad I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this product.</li>
            <li> I will say that I have had much better results on my eyelashes than eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I love this product ,and have tried many.........</li>
            <li> i love this</li>
            <li> will sure buy again and also I have recommended to friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands of eyelash enhancing serum and this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I was not so sure about how it works when I was reading reviews.</li>
            <li> surely helps my eyelash and eyebrow to grow longer.</li>
            <li> and I am sure you will notice much more length.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So glad I did.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s anything to complain about, it&#x27;s that the product works better and faster than advertised.</li>
            <li> You can see my picture below for the after results! :)</li>
            <li> I now have better lashes than when I was in my 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> eyebrows looks better now&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months, and I love what it&#x27;s done for my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> so I mostly use the serum for my eye brows ...</li>
            <li> It does build up, so for best results, exfoliate the area regularly.</li>
            <li> I saw that many people rated it 5.</li>
            <li> and im glad i did.</li>
            <li> I feel like they&#x27;re softer and in better condition too.</li>
            <li> I guess from the description of the product, I was expecting much more.</li>
            <li> Yeah, sure.  </li>
            <li> I did not have any discomfort using the product, besides that i thought it gave me more eye crust in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I also use the Ardell lash conditioner before mascara (got it here-super cheap!)</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Surely I will continue buying the product..</li>
            <li> My girlfriend bought this product through my account, and it&#x27;s her writing this review. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> And it seems like I have more lashes.</li>
            <li> You see the difference more with mascara.</li>
            <li> No type of mascara would make my lashes look any better.</li>
            <li> I consider it one of my best daily beauty rituals.</li>
            <li> I put it on brows and top and bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> The eyelash extensions ruined my eyelashes and broke/made most of them fall out.</li>
            <li> They are closer to my idea of perfection. :)</li>
            <li> , just hope they don&#x27;t catch on start charging more...</li>
            <li> If you are healthy and take vitamins it will work faster.</li>
            <li> For the price I thought I&#x27;d try it sure am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 yrs and love the results.</li>
            <li> This works phenomenally well for both</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> helps make my lashes look so much better (with the help of mascara).  </li>
            <li> This product more than lived up to my expectations</li>
            <li> still i love the results i got.</li>
            <li> the instructions say to apply the product on the top lid lashes, in doing this i also put the product on the bottom side of my top lid lashes (if you can stand to get some in your eye).</li>
            <li> AND IT WORKED EVEN BETTER FOR HER.</li>
            <li> i did apply one coat of mascara so you can see the length much better.</li>
            <li> I used Latisse and it worked much MUCH better.</li>
            <li> Just be patient and you will love the results.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Lashes held mascara better.</li>
            <li> I read many beauty blogs and this was recommended on more than one.  </li>
            <li> I noticed it most when I was using my eye lash curler.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my lashes.</li>
            <li> I would say this product is okay.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> So based off our experiences I would say it works better for growing your eyelashes vs brows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars on the off chance it will be better if I use it longer.</li>
            <li> My best friend has been using it for years, and I finally decided to try it for myself!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems that correct application, right at the roots, helps keep the hair follicles in good condition.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, you&#x27;ll see results after a week, my lashes grew fuller and longer, I&#x27;ve tried other products that make you&#x27;re lashes look stringing, this one is great</li>
            <li> I was very excited about my eyelash enhance serum</li>
            <li> and she has noticed a very significant difference.</li>
            <li> It has barely no odor which is awesome</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> i get so many compliments on my lashes and it makes putting on mascara so fun!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now much more fun to apply mascara!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that with consistent use, this does indeed help my lashes look more visible (with a good mascara, of course).</li>
            <li> I have been using it for three months now and happy and excited to say that I now have recognizable brows and lashes.</li>
            <li> I have experienced eyelash regrowth of normal eyelashes; like they used to be.  </li>
            <li> Using it for 3 days, I already could feel my eyelids becoming a bit more sensative and developing pinkish circles under my eyelids.</li>
            <li> and now they are long and beautiful!!  </li>
            <li> and now after a month, I have wonderful long lashes.</li>
            <li> I am extremely impressed and will continue to use this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> After four weeks my eyelashes looked long and beautiful!  </li>
            <li> and together they are doing a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product.  </li>
            <li> Every morning I&#x27;m excited to put on my mascara and play them up!</li>
            <li> Within a month my eyelashes looked significantly longer!</li>
            <li> I am just excited to see how my eyelashes will look after a month!</li>
            <li> I am happy to see the new growth, and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> On the bright side, my right eye seems fine.</li>
            <li> With age, my lashes have thinned and seem to fall out more easily.  </li>
            <li> This is the best single cosmetic item I have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I can see a huge diffrence in my eye lashes:)</li>
            <li> Given the fantastic results with my brows, I was hoping for a more &amp;#34;falsie&amp;#34; eyelash look, but I&#x27;m still happy with what I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
            <li> Why, when a company has a great product, do they always cheap out later and lesses the effective product...</li>
            <li> But I decided to give this a try since my lashes were becoming sparser and shorter.  </li>
            <li> Mascara goes on and comes off more smoothly, resulting in fewer lashes coming off.</li>
            <li> Lashes were becoming sparce as were my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Amazon offers a great price(around 23 dollars) too</li>
            <li> but so far I haven&#x27;t experienced that.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes, which is great, but shows the serum is on the weaker side.</li>
            <li> I thought Walgreens was more credible.</li>
            <li> I am amazed to see that it is so cheap on amazon because this product really works, honestly I would have continued paying $50 to get it!</li>
            <li> They were also incredibly swollen and red.</li>
            <li> After about four months of use, I do not even wear ANY mascara and have had many people comment on how beautifully i apply my &amp;#34;false lashes.&amp;#34;  I am telling you this because I have never had anything actually work like it promised</li>
            <li> So far this product is working great.</li>
            <li> Oh yea it works longer grows brows also love this product just have to keep using it no fake lashes for me or extensions to break my own lashes</li>
            <li> Great delivered quick been using for a month noticed a real difference in my eyebrows not my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it</li>
            <li> My original lashes are okay</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an experienced user of different brands of lash growth serum, and a huge advocate because they&#x27;ve all worked!</li>
            <li> it is easy to apply and I have never gotten any in my eye..</li>
            <li> Received product very quick.</li>
            <li> So it works, and I found it easy to apply with no stinging etc.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply each evening.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, once a day before bed.  </li>
            <li> If you can put eyeliner on then you can do this, it&#x27;s that easy.</li>
            <li> What I am noticing now is the lashes are not breaking as easily, will continue.</li>
            <li> It came very quick, I started using it immediately, and started seeing results within 4 days.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, just apply before going to bed at night.</li>
            <li> so I access it easily before going to sleep.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and produced the results I wanted.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and observable results in 2 weeks or so.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply easy to use too.</li>
            <li> Very quickly too</li>
            <li> The serum is easy to apply and I didn&#x27;t experience any stinging or burning.</li>
            <li> It works to condition that skin very quickly.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this to keep my lashes strong.</li>
            <li> I have a  fair complexion and older thus my hair and eyelashes are thinning a often brittle.  </li>
            <li> Initially, I liked this product very much.</li>
            <li> They were long, strong, and looked incredible.</li>
            <li> and apparently this isn&#x27;t that uncommon with this product.</li>
            <li> It is true, that when you wake up in the morning, your eyes have more of that</li>
            <li> Within a week I saw my eyebrows starting to fill in beautifully.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for 4 years on and off mostly on , but take breaks to get full effect again when restarting.</li>
            <li> and I honestly didn&#x27;t feel like it was working until 2 months after my first use.</li>
            <li> Rapidlash is hands down the best!  </li>
            <li> I though have to say that if you stop using it they will look exactly the same as before, so you must use it permanently if you want to keep that wonderful look.</li>
            <li> I am not super impressed.  </li>
            <li> My first tube of Rapidlash from a local housewares store was awesome.  </li>
            <li> Overall, im pretty happy with this product!</li>
            <li> but that is fine with me.</li>
            <li> i LOVE the product, it really works! :)</li>
            <li> Quick delivery!  </li>
            <li> the price - can&#x27;t beat it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly and neatly packaged!</li>
            <li> Works quickly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those lucky ones!</li>
            <li> This works super well!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem much thicker, but they are for sure longer and darker!</li>
            <li> So glad I checked here first!</li>
            <li> I can say they have a very pretty curl now!</li>
            <li> At first I used a safety pin to separate them, but I discovered a used, clean mascara wand does an effective job of detangling all the knots.</li>
            <li> wrote to the company to ask a question about ingredients, and got a very quick, friendly</li>
            <li> They are darker, too which is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> I am not saying this is a miracle for your lashes, but it is a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> So here is what made a HUGE difference once I figured things out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They make a huge difference in my look.</li>
            <li> I started using this and after about a month I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Just started it so can&#x27;t give it an accurate rating as of yet...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced no side-effects; only fabulous lashes.</li>
            <li> and I have been telling everyone I know about this fabulous product.  </li>
            <li> with free shipping.</li>
            <li> One happy customer did the research for customers looking and talked about the peptides in this product and only 2 others.</li>
            <li> My brows have filled in too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to follw the direction as noted on the package.</li>
            <li> Ita has shown great improvement in her overall legnth and thickness in her lashes.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m really happy that it helped me grow the hair in my brows back.</li>
            <li> After using 1 month each night, my gap is now filled in, and my lashes are noticeably longer.  </li>
            <li> My lashes were thicker(and somewhat coarser), and some sparse areas actually filled in.</li>
            <li> , I inspect every day in day light.</li>
            <li> Renewlash is no longer available on the market .</li>
            <li> Lashes are important to me.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using rapid lash, they have filled in and grown.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and one that actually does what promises!</li>
            <li> I came really close to forking out the $100 a month and getting those amazing eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li> Knowing how fast and effective</li>
            <li> I used this product after trying the &amp;#34;more expensive&amp;#34; brand that is available.  </li>
            <li> Feel free to drop a comment and let me know if you like it.</li>
            <li> and if I&#x27;m having a makeup free weekend day I&#x27;ll apply it in the morning as well.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes used to be sparse and light and now they&#x27;re fuller and longer.</li>
            <li> So be sure to apply this when all make-up is removed on a freshly washed face.</li>
            <li> In fact, I don&#x27;t even have to use some advanced mascaras anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace Revitalash, which was no longer available.</li>
            <li> But they really did curl my lashes nicely.  </li>
            <li> It took about 3 weeks for me to notice a change in the lenth of lashes and my brows filled in where I applied product.</li>
            <li> It is a fantastic feel to know that I have the longest lashes in my family now.    </li>
            <li> but I started with LiLash product and got fantastic results.</li>
            <li> It took about two weeks of daily usage (for the lashes themselves to grow out), but once they started growing my lashes looked great.</li>
            <li> After 8 weeks it completely filled in.</li>
            <li> So I was using lumigan for eyelash growth because I had this hookup with this doctor who gave me all sorts of free samples of the stuff...  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes looked fantastic with lumigan</li>
            <li> I bought RapidLash primarily for eyebrow growth.</li>
            <li> Without mascara there isn&#x27;t a difference because my lashes are light brown.</li>
            <li> It has really filled in my lashes.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product and think it works.</li>
            <li> It is so obvious that I am happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> , I can say it worth waiting :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m soooo happy with Rapid Lash that I will be reordering as soon as I start to run low on it!  </li>
            <li> It even grew my lower lashes, which I never had any of my entire makeup wearing life, lol.</li>
            <li> Since I have light eyes</li>
            <li> I want to make sure I don&#x27;t have any darkening of the pupil which can happen to some people on rare occasions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being a former Latisse user and had GREAT results I thought I would try this in an effort to save some money.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Now, if this serum could make my eyelashes thicker (or more plentiful), it would be worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li> After all ladies, we all deserve to look fabulous.</li>
            <li> Used daily, works great.</li>
            <li> I used it every night for a month and one day realized my lashes were darker and longer, which is great because I am a blonde.</li>
            <li> and I have long beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li> People were complimenting me on my long, beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> Yes, Latiisse did work,  made my eyelashes darker and longer, but good lord, I just could not, with a clear conscience , keep paying the $125 a month upkeep it required.</li>
            <li> People tell me all the time what beautiful long lashes I have</li>
            <li> I had some good results and by the second month I can truthfully say I  know this product works for me.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of SmartLash at an entry level price elsewhere, and loved it, but could not afford to buy more at the regular price.  </li>
            <li> but I just want my own lashes as nice as possible</li>
            <li> With this, so far so good....</li>
            <li> So far so good, about 3-4 weeks using it</li>
            <li> and I have beautiful LONG lashes now!</li>
            <li> Of the two products I was interested in, I selected this one because it had a lot of positive reviews and cost wise</li>
            <li> Was so excited about using this product with all the great reviews until I saw a recent post regarding product being expired.</li>
            <li> I originally started using this product a few years ago and was impressed by the results.</li>
            <li> Very allergic!!!</li>
            <li> one tube lasted me two months, i have purchased my second tube and can&#x27;t wait to see even better results!!</li>
            <li> Very useful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The public response to my eyelashes has been so strong that I am bolder, more assertive, and more confident than ever before.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference within two weeks and today, after 3 months of use before bed each night, my lashes are full, long and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> then I kept putting more, twice a day, and I have really long and full lashes!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27; doesn&#x27;t itch if when it comes in contact with eyes which is a good thing because am super sensitive.</li>
            <li> Such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> and I am still working on the original tube from August.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to order more, however it did not work like it did the first time I bought it.</li>
            <li> I thought it was fun to have longer lashes!</li>
            <li> I was so excited by the outcome.</li>
            <li> It is DEFINITELY worth a try!</li>
            <li> Have to say that I&#x27;m pretty pleased with my results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and have noticed a significant amount of growth in both lashes and brows.</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey, but it is worth it!</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to share my experience with everyone that I even posted my photo that I took today.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes grew some, and they looked pretty healthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month, twice a day on most days (esp the first 2 wks)..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> After using the product since July I&#x27;ve seen a significant change in hair growth.</li>
            <li> So I just finished my first one ( making sure I get every drop)</li>
            <li> Hopefully, I will see results by the time I&#x27;m finished with the first tube, at which time I will be able to give it a rating.</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I can see significant change on my eyelash</li>
            <li> My lashes were twice as long and looked great with mascara on.</li>
            <li> but I lost a significant amount , I continued to use though thinking I just need to persist  ; but  after  3 wks without any improvement I&#x27;ve stopped.</li>
            <li> with that I saw a significant growth in the length though no changes in the thickness.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant difference in the length of my lashes.</li>
            <li> I noticed the most effect within the first two months of use, and now it&#x27;s just part of my bedtime routine</li>
            <li> they are real! :)</li>
            <li> Original Review:  </li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> SIGNIFICANTLY.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get better faster results, your lashes won&#x27;t shed as much and your results lasts!</li>
            <li> Although I do not see an AMAZING amount of new eye lashes...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked and for fear of losing these new lashes, which honestly feel like someone else&#x27;s lashes</li>
            <li> Rapid Lash serum was recommended by a friend who saw results with new lashes (she lost her own)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different lash growth products but this one has the best results by far.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll get so many compliments for your eyelashes, you&#x27;ll get tired of hearing them, LOL!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t experience the kind of length you get with Latisse, but for a fraction of the price, I&#x27;m pleased with Rapid Lash and have ordered a second tube.      </li>
            <li> I use it nightly on clean lashes</li>
            <li> I would love this product so much more if it didn&#x27;t make me completely miserable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its light and the liquid dries fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 3 weeks of continuous use and my natural lashes are definitely more uniform and longer!  </li>
            <li> After reading many reviews, I had a feeling that barely no one claimed to have these kind of side effects.</li>
            <li> I run out of this bottle, I certainly plan on buying more</li>
            <li> and YES, I will buy another bottle right now, just to keep my lashes the way they are now!</li>
            <li> The price is right!</li>
            <li> My daughter noticed right away after I hadn&#x27;t seen her for a month, with no mascara on!  </li>
            <li> I have never had lashes this full and long and my eyebrows which previously were skimpy at best, have filled in nicely.   </li>
            <li> After years of trying tons of products with minimal or no results I am happy to say I found this product.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m very happy with the improvement so far, still holding my breath tho, because I want to see how long the lashes will grow to.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is because I don&#x27;t wear make-up every day that it took me so long to realize that this stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li> I used every night so far and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> I even used this for my 7 year old niece, and the result is amazing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait until it&#x27;s been 6 weeks to see the full effect...</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, this actually works!</li>
            <li> Thats how much I love this product, it really work, and Ive tryed everything on the market.</li>
            <li> i absolutley love this product, i get comments all the time from people asking me if my lashes are real.</li>
            <li> It looked cool.</li>
            <li> I am truely amazed.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works - mostly for length.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to replace my love for the very costly Latisse.</li>
            <li> Last time it worked so good</li>
            <li> My lower lashes are MUCH longer than they used to be and my top lashes are denser and thicker.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought so many cosmetics that make the claim &amp;#34;You&#x27;ll see a difference!&amp;#34;, and I really didn&#x27;t see any difference at all.</li>
            <li> This one absolutely does what it claims - my lashes grew, and grew, to the extent that I could feel the ends of my lashes touch my eyelids, and could feel them touching the inside of my reading glasses.  </li>
            <li> Like others have commented, it seems like the tube wasn&#x27;t quite full</li>
            <li> It is true that there is side affects.</li>
            <li> Not quite as good as my last lash stuff, but still makes my lashes a bit darker and longer!</li>
            <li> My lashes are full and longer.</li>
            <li> Debated trying Latisse, but this is much more reasonable and the applicator is a cinch to use.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product</li>
            <li> Says you won&#x27;t see full effects for 16 weeks,  </li>
            <li> I used up a bottle of Latisse and noticed obvious good results.  </li>
            <li> Can not say enough good things.</li>
            <li> only good for length</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to invest this much in a product I wasn&#x27;t really sure of.  </li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned, blonde gal and</li>
            <li> I honestly could not tell if that was just the natural growth of my lashes.</li>
            <li> Well, I do not need a pic to see a difference, I have  much more and much longer lashes than ever before in my life.</li>
            <li> Once you have opened the product - it is only good for a year.  </li>
            <li> I still wear mascara, but now my lashes are very noticeable and I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> I used mascara and it really made them &#x27;pop even more&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> One bottle will last a good two months</li>
            <li> That will be the real test :-)  </li>
            <li> I decided that I would give it a full 8 weeks before giving up use.</li>
            <li> but this is a true exception.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s good enough for now.</li>
            <li> It has really worked for me :)</li>
            <li> It does work, but it takes a good, solid month of application to see a difference.  </li>
            <li> I love that it works fast and doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now a true believer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I see the best results in the least amount of time.</li>
            <li> Full results around 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> I know that Latisse takes 16 weeks to see full effects</li>
            <li> my eyelashes are still full.</li>
            <li> This product made my eyes very itchy and I will not be able to use it for that reason.</li>
            <li> I apply it once per night, and I am still using my second tube in May, so I&#x27;d say it lasts a fair amount of time.  </li>
            <li> The product is good til last day of January 2015.</li>
            <li> I noticed my eyelashes weren&#x27;t as full as they used to be</li>
            <li> so over all  Rapidlash is not a bad product but doesn&#x27;t do what it claims</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.     </li>
            <li> No bad side effects at all.</li>
            <li> I rarely leave much feedback or reviews..unless it&#x27;s something that works!!!</li>
            <li> Used it previously with good results and now improving on those results with this latest purchase.</li>
            <li> Let me mention , I do have good lashes, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I live in South Korea and they are HUGE on lashes here, kinda funny.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as quickly but it does work eventually</li>
            <li> I started to notice a difference after about a month but after consistent use for several months the result are amazing!</li>
            <li> , this product contains isopropyl cloprostenate, the main ingredient that makes lashes darker, fuller &amp; more youthful.</li>
            <li> I wanted this to be quick and</li>
            <li> so I stopped it and the eyes cleared up quickly.</li>
            <li> I was lucky, as I did not have an allergic reaction as some buyers explained.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was amazing, regular free shipping got the product to me in a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> but i wasn&#x27;t that lucky with it.</li>
            <li> I do not make any claims that it helps grow lashes, but I have noticed my eyelashes are not falling out as quickly as they were before I started using it.  </li>
            <li> I quickly reviewed before bc</li>
            <li> but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> I think this product mainly keeps your lashes nourished and in better shape</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of the lash enhancing products and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is, for the price I paid for Rapidlash and the expectations I had for it (based on the reviews), I do not find it a worthy product.</li>
            <li> and my lashes quickly became longer, fuller and curlier.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to eyelash extensions which I had done once and loved but found too expensive to up</li>
            <li> Be sure to only apply along the lash line on TOP side of the lid to avoid getting it in your eye.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I&#x27;ve  been using this product for several years and it definitely works.</li>
            <li> sure to only use this on the top lash line.</li>
            <li> I guess I expected more, lashes are bit longer but nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> This company lost a loyal customer for life.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both Latisse and the original Revitalash turned my eyelids red but gave me amazing full lashes.</li>
            <li> beautiful lashes little effort</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend Rapidlash and have to many of my friends after they noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> Also, by doubling up on the products, it&#x27;s so much more high maintenance, which is also annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Two years ago I used Lilash and love the results, but not having access to it this time I had high hopes for rapid lash.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> I finally spent the money to try Latisse after using Rapidlash successfully for 2 years.</li>
            <li> My lashes were falling out and becoming very sparse.</li>
            <li> Overall, though, I am very, very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Like so many others I was very surprised at the efficacy of this product and how quickly one can see results.</li>
            <li> Now at 12 weeks, my top lashes are more than 1/4\\&quot; long - some almost 1/2\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any impressive ingredients, but my lashes grew back long, thicker and darker.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the same tube for 5 months now and I am pretty good with applying it everynight.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the price because I JUST finished the first tube (it came 2 to a pack), so it&#x27;s very economical.</li>
            <li> it really works!!</li>
            <li> This really works!!</li>
            <li> Having long lashes does make you look younger and more attractive.  </li>
            <li> I only applied the serum to the top lashes first to make sure I wouldn&#x27;t break out in some sort of allergy.</li>
            <li> I am 62 and gave up on having pretty eyes, but now, even without mascara, I have lashes again!</li>
            <li> someone from the company must be sitting and typing these reviews all day, because it really does NOTHING!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results at first but like everything else this product needs to be used with patience!</li>
            <li> I am still on my first tube of this stuff, and for the price you pay, this is so worth it!  </li>
            <li> My lashes are longer and look MUCH fuller!!</li>
            <li> It really works!!</li>
            <li> But....I was amazed to discover that after about using this for 4 weeks on my eyelashes and eyebrows, it really works!!</li>
            <li> I did use it during the day, when I did not wear make-up, (for the first 2 weeks), and I think maybe this gave me a jump start on results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really like it!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely makes the lashes noticeably longer!!</li>
            <li> Thanks Rapidlash for making a quality product!!</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was just my imagination or the mascara I was using, but no matter what brand I used, my lashes were there!  </li>
            <li> It really does what it promises!!  </li>
            <li> I think this stuff worked after the first use!  </li>
            <li> I noticed my lashes were longer after the FIRST USE!  </li>
            <li> my first tube just ran out!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t actually see any new lashes but the length and thickness seemed greatly improved.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are not particularly longer (that I can tell) but they are thicker and fuller and look wonderful with brown/black mascara (I have blonde lashes</li>
            <li> Think, for the price ( even now it more expensive ) , it is very good</li>
            <li> Amazing is the only word I can find to describe, can&#x27;t imagine how this can work, but it does.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is intense even when you apply with a light hand.</li>
            <li> its MUCH MUCH cheaper then getting lashes done and filled every 2-3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> It works amazingly well and now several of my friends are trying it also!</li>
            <li> I used Eye-lite Double Lash Eyelash(which is also popular) before rapidlash, but eye-lite didn&#x27;t have the result as rapidlash.</li>
            <li> Worth a try, though.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price</li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> Make sure the serum dries completely before you go to sleep.    </li>
            <li> I have read a couple of times, that after more time, your lashes get a natural curl and tend to get darker than without using the product..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth doing at this price.  </li>
            <li> Worth a try</li>
            <li> I store mine upright, for what its worth.</li>
            <li> When I later had a question about dates on the product, the seller answered promptly and courteously.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product last year and was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but this is worth writing about.  </li>
            <li> This is worth it.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, and believe me, it is so worth</li>
            <li> Of course, I thought it was probably a hoax, but worth a try.  </li>
            <li> She says its worth the money.</li>
            <li> Its worth the money</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems like Rapidlash works for a lot of people, but it may be worth it to give the Ardell Accelerator a try before spending money on this.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the $30.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely worth trying.</li>
            <li> I applied this product nightly and within 6 weeks noticed a nice lengthening and darkening to my upper lashes!</li>
            <li> Also worth noting that I got it in my eye a couple of times and didn&#x27;t have any burning.</li>
            <li> So worth it.</li>
            <li> As you see I think it&#x27;s worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> I am going to look for a more natural route for eye lash growth that will not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> I used to use Latisse, and got nice results, but Latisse irritates my eyes and I look blood shot with red veins running through my eyes, so I won&#x27;t use it anymore.  </li>
            <li> Best eyelash enhancement product I have ever tired-</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it if its effect stops working after a while.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it and</li>
            <li> (Don&#x27;t expect drastic miracles, but it&#x27;s worth a try if your lashes are struggling.)</li>
            <li> But, for me it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> It was worth the price</li>
            <li> I always loved my eye lashes, never really wanted or needed them to be longer or thicker.</li>
            <li> Worth a try.    </li>
            <li> stuff well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have seen many of these products on the market and the prices vary considerably.  </li>
            <li> I make sure I apply it directly on my lash line and in between the rows of hair.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> this one is worth the praise.  </li>
            <li> I do, however think it&#x27;s worth the shot.</li>
            <li> Better off using something natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product before and had success.</li>
            <li> have never have beautiful lashes, they are naturally straight down.</li>
            <li> I have some very sparse spots on my lower lashes, and now I am seeing very fine, stubby new growth.</li>
            <li> I had originally tried the prescription Latisse and found this product to actually work better for me.  </li>
            <li> It has significantly grown my lashes and just made them overall a better and fuller shape.</li>
            <li> I did experience a mild tingling sensation at first and occassional itching, but nothing that lasted longer than a minute.  </li>
            <li> When I first started using this, it did mildly sting my eyelids, but I would go away after a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> and I can really see my eyelash growing significantly.</li>
            <li> , how ever you have to keep using the product to kept the length of your lashes other wise</li>
            <li> I already had long eyelashes but this made them so much more voluminous!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced minor irritation, only in the first week of use, and easily resolved with eye drops.</li>
            <li> cause they were bugging me they&#x27;d come right out.</li>
            <li> It works, I noticed results right away.</li>
            <li> During those 5 weeks I started to get itchy right where I would apply it</li>
            <li> I got a infection in my right lid.</li>
            <li> All I do is gingerly comb through them with an eyelash brush and it comes right out, no problem.</li>
            <li> and it blends right in.</li>
            <li> This made me skip the treatment some nights, and then the growth effect wore right off.  </li>
            <li> I emailed the seller and amazon refunded my money right away.</li>
            <li> I got this within 2 days and right away I put it on.</li>
            <li> and my face went through the wind shield leaving me a scar right on my lash line</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it right now to plump my lashes for my upcoming wedding.</li>
            <li> To remember to apply at bedtime, I keep it right beside my skincare and lip balm.</li>
            <li> This was the right price</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the dark lid effect some spoke of, and I put it on before bed on top of eye moisturizer right along the lash line, but I&#x27;m sure it smeared all over the place.</li>
            <li> I am pretty satisfied so far with the growth</li>
            <li> First of all, I started with ok lashes as far as length and thickness.</li>
            <li> I have long, straight and fair at the tips eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Experienced some itching and mild redness initially for only about a week when I started using it.</li>
            <li> But somewhere around the 2 month or so mark, I began to notice my marykay mascara (in which previously was \\&quot;just ok\\&quot; ) was looking better and better with each application.</li>
            <li> I have used Rapidlash in the past and it worked great.</li>
            <li> and I look much younger and more full of life thanks to my longer lashes!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I now have my own beautiful thick, long lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 69 years young and have beautiful long lashes thanks to Rapidlash.</li>
            <li> My lashes have NEVER been so long and nice.</li>
            <li> Noticed lashes are more prominent and eyebrows a little thicker.  </li>
            <li> Within a week I could see that the patches that were completely missing lashes had filled in, after a month I saw significant growth - my lashes are longer and somewhat darker and MUCH better than they were before I started using this product.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when relatives started commenting on my lashes, asking what kind of mascara I was using because my lashes were looking long!</li>
            <li> but instead I will just order a new one...and not every give her something free again...</li>
            <li> I noticed results right after the first week.  </li>
            <li> It works great, especially when I remember to use it several nights in a row.  </li>
            <li> last week I noticed that my lashes were looking great with mascara, when I removed the mascara I saw that the ones I lost were back and</li>
            <li> application is really easy, no makeup on, and you apply that clear liquid all over your lash line (like if you were lining your eyes).</li>
            <li> I no longer wear black mascara-the results are that good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still a believer, though, so I purchased my third tube through Amazon last month (at a great price, too -</li>
            <li> I received it super fast and try to give everyone 5 stars..</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast though...</li>
            <li> I recently looked back at some close up face pictures of myself and couldn&#x27;t believe how great my lashes looked compared to the way they now looked.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with this product and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Both my eyelashes and my brows are healthy and lush thanks to this stuff.</li>
            <li> I use it every night and my eyelashes look full, long and healthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very effective - upper and bottom lashes are not much fuller but significantly longer.  </li>
            <li> All in all my eyeslashes have been short and brittle forever, this product made them long and beautiful, but I am not sure what is best, long, beautiful lashes with red bumps and bloodshot eyes or short lashes....??</li>
            <li> the delivery was VERY fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see very much result at all.</li>
            <li> and I noticed a very fast difference in my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> fell for the very reasonable pricing--</li>
            <li> Make sure your eyelids are free of other creams/chemical as well, since the serum would react with some eye creams that could result in redness and irritations.</li>
            <li> and I see such a huge difference!</li>
            <li> I first bought this on a whim, just to try it out.  </li>
            <li> It really does make your lashes, thicker, longer and fuller!</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my eyebrows (mostly on the left side)</li>
            <li> At first I couldn&#x27;t see any difference, but it has now been almost 12 weeks</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford Latisse, and I worry about all the listed possible side effects, on top of the fact that you have to pay for a doctor visit to get it.  </li>
            <li> Bought it, used it daily for 31 days, the difference noted was more lashing fell out while using it than before use - stopped it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because I&#x27;m getting married in the fall</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d give this a shot first.  </li>
            <li> My first tube lasted for over 2 months.</li>
            <li> I have been using the same tube for almost 5 months and still have more to go.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> not so sure about the volume, but definitely length improvement.</li>
            <li> So I got a waxing done by taking a chunk of my eyebrow uuuggh but kinda funny.</li>
            <li> Ok already my brow is coming back and lashes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I was dubious, but willing to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> It really works !</li>
            <li> In order for this to work, you need to be consistent and day to day with application...pricey...</li>
            <li> You have to patient with this and use it consistently.  </li>
            <li> I could definitely see the difference on my top lashes.  </li>
            <li> When I first started using Rapid Lash (10/10)</li>
            <li> I think it will help you grow your lashes back if they had been damaged but not if you didn&#x27;t have any lashes and magically they gonna appear.</li>
            <li> I have used this serum a total of 4 times-- 3 nights, and 1 morning, on both my top and bottom lash line.    </li>
            <li> haha!</li>
            <li> I figured it just gets better, so I tried it out in the following morning.</li>
            <li> It just depends on what you&#x27;re willing to put up with.</li>
            <li> and now I will go get my Rx from the doc and buy some Latisse which I should have done in the first place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it consistently on my lashes and brows since I received it around November 17.  </li>
            <li> and I think I almost ran out of the first tube...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely lengthening my lashes, the result is more pronounced with mascara application.</li>
            <li> I only used it on my top eyelash line in order to conserve it.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying this is my first review on any product ever.</li>
            <li> and I undoubtedly have way more lashes on both my upper and lower lash lines.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll expand more on this later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll begin my second tube tonight and have ordered two more tubes.</li>
            <li> The first time the product lasted me three months</li>
            <li> I paid almost about $50 for my first tube, on another website.  </li>
            <li> Glad I checked with Amazon before buying the second one.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are exactly as they were before.  </li>
            <li> I think I will try Lilash next time because I know people who had better results with that brand.</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a change for the first month or so---</li>
            <li> My eyelashes were very damaged from a lifetime of sleeping with my face smooshed into the pillow!</li>
            <li> But after the first month I began feeling a difference in the texture of my lashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to make sure she knows this stuff is out there and then cross my fingers that it doesn&#x27;t go away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using RapidLash for a couple of years, but used it consistently for about 3 years.</li>
            <li> A couple of things to be aware of:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t believe it will work but after 1 or 2 weeks I saw the hair on my brows grow where I applied this serum.</li>
            <li> After only one week I saw more length in my lashes.  </li>
            <li> This was my first crack at lash/brow enhancers.  </li>
            <li> This product overall was okay.</li>
            <li> have missed a day here and there, but for the most part, have used it daily.  </li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> However, I plan to use it much more consistently on my eyebrows so that maybe they will actually show!  </li>
            <li> she had to tug them to see if they were really mine!</li>
            <li> I use it every night, only on the top lashes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any darking of my eyelids, but there was some tingling when I first started using it.</li>
            <li> i´ve used Latisse before and THAT really works!</li>
            <li> Mine are now thicker and stronger; they look really pretty if I do say so myself.</li>
            <li> I promptly ordered 3 more Rapidlash (a deal and no need to order for 6 months) to get my lashes back in order.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re stick straight which makes it appear like I don&#x27;t have any at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rapidlash consistently for four months now.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have grown so much that when I apply mascara they hit my eyebrows!</li>
            <li> haha!</li>
            <li> You will see results if you are willing to be patient.</li>
            <li> It really works!  </li>
            <li> And a better price than my last stuff was.</li>
            <li> Make sure you put this on only where you want eyelashes to grow.</li>
            <li> LOL--no biggie, I just plucked them out and now I make sure I only put it where I expect hair to grow.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this was in July 2010.</li>
            <li> Ok no big deal.</li>
            <li> and I feel better using it, even with the problems I have had with it, then going back to my short/weird lashes.     </li>
            <li> For those of you who want to know: In the winter im extremely white and a more reddish tone.</li>
            <li> In the summer you would never now I could get that light and look completely olive toned.</li>
            <li> : First tried it because the salon I worked in sold it.</li>
            <li> It was cylindrical, but it had a slope to the cap that my first tube had not had.  </li>
            <li> I did not see the results nor maintain the results that I had gained from my first tube.    </li>
            <li> My lashes look so much better that when I went to the eye doctor recently for a check-up she asked me if I&#x27;d been using Latisse.  </li>
            <li> .. would really recommend this to others!</li>
            <li> she wants it!</li>
            <li> fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I guess cheap glue can ruin your natural lashes.</li>
            <li> Well I wasn&#x27;t willing to risk it.</li>
            <li> Hence: no results the first month.</li>
            <li> It is a nice product, but I just feel that the product is not as &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; than I have expected.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, I received my order of the RapidLash Eyelash Enhancing Serum and saw that it had expired in August!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> The results are taking some getting used to for me, but there are results most definitely!  </li>
            <li> have found that the product just didn&#x27;t work as well after the first tube.  </li>
            <li> But I can absolutely vouch for the eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even take off my eye makeup first.  </li>
            <li> I did that at first and got a rash from all the makeup remover chemicals.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The most noticeable growth was on my lower, left eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I literally had about 5 lashes there when I first started.</li>
            <li> Okay so this product definitely works</li>
            <li> I get a better price checking on Amazon that I do at local stores.</li>
            <li> The first month to almost 2 months I couldn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> This product really works!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Eyelashes felt more coarse but were longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see how much longer they will become!  </li>
            <li> It really works!  </li>
            <li> It did work at first</li>
            <li> This was my first eyelash system to use and will probably try something else.</li>
            <li> I have used many others in the past that are much more exspensive.</li>
            <li> Almost immediately I noticed my lashes getting longer (really longer!)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it works as well as the first one I bought.</li>
            <li> No fake eyelashes ever.</li>
            <li> Very recommended!    </li>
            <li> At the end of 4 weeks they were definitely longer, and as an extra bonus they now also curl up on their own, no eyelash curler needed!</li>
            <li> I have turned on many friends who have had the same results!</li>
            <li> Within the first couple of weeks I could tell the difference in my lashes.</li>
            <li> It does itch when I first apply it</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t review the results yet since I just received my first tube, however I wanted to offer some clarification for those concerned about receiving an expired product.  </li>
            <li> This seems to really help with growing my eyelashes!</li>
            <li> ;) Namaste</li>
            <li> My top lashes actually curl up and touch the lids!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Be patient nd consistent with the application nd</li>
            <li> It really does work!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> but this product has really made my eyelashes grow!  </li>
            <li> I used the product on my top and bottom lashes and definitely see a difference.  </li>
            <li> It really works for me!</li>
            <li> For the first couple of days, I had some itching.</li>
            <li> and I have used it religiously every night for 4 months and there is still more in the container.</li>
            <li> But it does work pretty well.</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t lost the progress I gained from the first product, so perhaps it is maintaining the level of growth I got, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in fullness/darkness of my brows, which is what I&#x27;m after.</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> ;) &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I saw results within the end of the first week of using it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product will buy it myself next time</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle Int.</li>
            <li> I am still on my first bottle (3 ml), and I do use it almost every evening.</li>
            <li> And our lashes , both upper and lower, look better than ever before.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My lashes are definitely longer and darker :)</li>
            <li> Nope, I&#x27;m going back to Lilash, which isn&#x27;t that much more if you buy it on Ebay.</li>
            <li> This product starts to work from the first time you use it.  </li>
            <li> There arent many beauty products that actually do what they advertise, this one does!</li>
            <li> within the first week I noticed my lashes were looking healthier.  </li>
            <li> This product absolutely AMAZED me!  </li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> But this stuff seems to be working pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Spend $35 more and get Latisse that actually work.</li>
            <li> Thrilling, as my lashes need help.</li>
            <li> Tarte also has a serum that works pretty well</li>
            <li> Of course, you have to be consistent.</li>
            <li> :) I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was a bit discouraged at first, in fact, at one point I almost felt like my lashes were getting thinner.</li>
            <li> First eye lash enhancer I have ever used</li>
            <li> Maybe my eye skin just toughened up ; )  </li>
            <li> I must say that for the first time ever, I found somewhat</li>
            <li> There are starting to be more amazon items that are not as advertised.</li>
            <li> It really helped me!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re consistent with nightly use, you&#x27;ll see results.</li>
            <li> haha!</li>
            <li> Definitely going to order more of this.</li>
            <li> I used this product every night for two months before I really noticed a difference, so be patient!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first tube</li>
            <li> Since I began using it I have noticed that my lashes are definitely longer and more noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of upset because my longer, thicker, darker lashes have all gone back to short, light stubbies and I can&#x27;t get my Rapidlash needs fulfilled.</li>
            <li> Have used the product for better part of last two years!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Anyway I switched to Revitalash again, and after many months I got my pretty lash back.</li>
            <li> They are starting to fill in more now.  </li>
            <li> I have applied it consistently each night before bedtime, and I plan to continue always.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it suppose to, no side effects at all.</li>
            <li> just cuz I felt the follicles or whatever were more open to allow the formula penetration.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> when I first used the product it was the height of spring allergy season and the product probably exacerbated already irritated eyes.  </li>
            <li> The first couple of weeks it didn&#x27;t bother me, then they began to itch.  </li>
            <li> Okay so I gave this product four stars because when you drench your eyelashes in it, it actually works!</li>
            <li> so be aware of that.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this product at first</li>
            <li> NEVER angry pluck</li>
            <li> Magically grow lashes and brows back?  </li>
            <li> At first i notice some result after that it remaines at the first result and didnt improve</li>
            <li> I Lost my eye lashes after chemotherapy and this really helped!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product before at my local beauty salon for quite a bit more money.</li>
            <li> I noticed NOTHING at first, but kept using it...and after about two months</li>
            <li> So this is a first time writing a review.</li>
            <li> So I lost most of my lashes with the individual glued-ones.</li>
            <li> so I am thinking I will continue to see some more improvements over the next 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> At first I used the serum twice a day, once in the morning and once at night.</li>
            <li> It REALLY works!  </li>
            <li> Now, it&#x27;s been 2 weeks, my lashes are definitely much longer and thicker!</li>
            <li> If applying to eyebrows, but sure to pluck off any outside hairs that are unwanted after overnight growth.</li>
            <li> Looks ten times better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 months (3-5 nights per week), and noticed a difference within the first month.</li>
            <li> So I am only doing the top now and finishing the tube...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been consistently applying the serum as instructed.</li>
            <li> Be aware; this product does NOT grow additional lashes or thicken existing lashes, but it does make the ones you have grown longer.  </li>
            <li> give the product time to do its job, because you wont see it in the first week.</li>
            <li> actually I didn&#x27;t believed it at the beginning but after 1 month I saw the result :)</li>
            <li> No appreciable results after many weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> 6 weeks in, I noticed it more, and now, at 8 weeks, they are definitely longer than they were pre-rapidlash!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel like it works like it did when I first began using it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;During the first week, I found this to cause some itchiness around my eyes.</li>
            <li> That said, I persisted and used it fairly consistently, probably 4X a week based on my laziness.</li>
            <li> seems to work ok after a couple of weeks with constant use</li>
            <li> You can see them without mascara for the first time.</li>
            <li> This stuff really really works!  </li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> you just have to be consistent with it.</li>
            <li> So glad I finally decided to purchase this product!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have already gotten so much longer and thicker in just two weeks!</li>
            <li> The reviews seem to be mostly good with a few negatives.  </li>
            <li> I realize that this may sound great, but in my case, new baby lashes are growing under my normal ones, straight down into my eye!</li>
            <li> I was browsing the web to see ways of growing lashes long and strong!</li>
            <li> I  hope the new formulation is as effective as the one I got initially.</li>
            <li> At first I think I was applying it too much on the lid, like you would eye liner, and now that it is right on the lash/lid line</li>
            <li> Works fast and eyelashes really do grow in quickly.</li>
            <li> Of course this isn&#x27;t the basis for my positive review, because the rest of my lashes were definitely longer and more dense.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month and a half now and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty satisfied with my eyelashes before, but I wanted to see if I could make them more spectacular and reminiscent of false lashes with the help</li>
            <li> This is a great product doing essentially the same thing, without the high price and the doctor&#x27;s visit.</li>
            <li> I finally just got my brows professionally reshaped and have had many compliments on how full they look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice to have hair where it is supposed to be and don&#x27;t have to be hairless due to heredity or age.  </li>
            <li> After I  gave my mother this to try she called today, super excited, her lashes showed growing all by sudden after using it  for almost 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and the stuff was brand new.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve increased my star rating from 4 to 5 stars because I&#x27;m in the 5th week of using Rapid Lash and my lashes are definitely longer and fuller than when I wrote my original review!  </li>
            <li> not much comes out of it, soo far soo good</li>
            <li> I think for how cheap it is it&#x27;s kind of common sense that it won&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li> have been consistantly on this product for the last 3 years.its much cheaper than most of the lash growth serums out there in the market.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I had become a bit obsessed about them, hoping they would just start growing again on their own.</li>
            <li> OK, maybe I was asking too much, but this serum has definitely made my eyelashes longer.</li>
            <li> It took a little over a month to notice results, but I am very pleased with how my eyebrows look now.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the purchse, the eyelashes grew a little with no side effects, I have been using it over 2 years now.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I would recommend it to all those girls who want to feel more pretty and love a new style with natural longer eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I first starting using Rapidlash a couple years ago when it wasn&#x27;t as easy to find as it is now</li>
            <li> In two weeks I started to see positive effects.</li>
            <li> I bought this product instead of neulash because of the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes is already long and looks great when I&#x27;m wearing mascara but wearing a mascara everyday makes your eyelash fall off specially when it&#x27;s waterproof</li>
            <li> My first review I did not see much improvement ... which was about 1 month of use.  </li>
            <li> The first night my eye was really itchy</li>
            <li> I already have long eyelashes, so my goal was to increase the eyelash density to be more in keeping with what I had as a teenager.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products with more success.</li>
            <li> but you had to be consistent for 2 months straight</li>
            <li> They are also LONG, and I love my eyelashes like this.</li>
            <li> During week 2 I noticed my top lashes were really long.</li>
            <li> It made my eyelashes longer, (no, not quite as long as Latisse), made them stronger, and more resistant to breakage.</li>
            <li> my eyes were very swollen from first application</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much change in my eyelash composition until about 8 weeks after I first started applying it.</li>
            <li> Results really are noticeable after 1 month of consistent use.  </li>
            <li> This product has a reasonable price and the product delivers exactly what it claims.  </li>
            <li> At first I really like this item</li>
            <li> i pretty much smothered the product all over my lash line and my lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used another brand for the past year and loved it.  </li>
            <li> not sure - my lashes look a bit longer but still waiting for them to look a good bit longer</li>
            <li> Overall, I love it and would highly recommend it if you want to buy something over the counter.</li>
            <li> I might just be super sensitive</li>
            <li> only ONE TUBE to start with; it lasts a couple of months, more than enough time to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Clean your eyes and face before you go to bed</li>
            <li> Actually I had more eyelashes fall out, than normal.  </li>
            <li> The tube lasted a long time; I bought it in September and am just now (in March) getting ready to order some more.  </li>
            <li> on time, easy to open.</li>
            <li> My lashes thinned out a bit..seems that they may not be putting in the product that they were before making it less effective.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use, I actually use it twice per day not just at bedtime.</li>
            <li> and then it was changed  to a much less effective formula.</li>
            <li> Lashes are considerably longer fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> My lashes didn&#x27;t really grow long, but they are better than before.</li>
            <li> It worked but the results were not dramatic.</li>
            <li> I seen some results but not dramatic results</li>
            <li> My brows are dark, nicely shaped, and the hairs are dense yet very well-behaved.  </li>
            <li> They were already thick and long, but now they are even longer than before and very beautiful.  </li>
            <li> The results are not dramatic like with Latisse</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super impressed, but it has made a little bit of improvement.</li>
            <li> Rapid Lash certainly worked for me.</li>
            <li> I certainly wasn&#x27;t going to pay for Latisse.</li>
            <li> I bought this eyelash enhancing serum with a large bit of skepticism that it was a bunch of malarky and snake oil salesman hooey.</li>
            <li> , if applied day and night, certainly gave me length.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> BUT once you stop using it get, get ready to say bye bye to those lashes that you love and going back to normal.</li>
            <li> My upper and lower lashes are longer and fuller, and my eyebrows are more full at the outside edges.  </li>
            <li> My daughter (14) who is infatuated with lashes (she spends more time on her lashes than her hair!)</li>
            <li> I hope that will happen in the next month, but only for getting LONGER and MORE lashes, I would definately recommend buying this product!    </li>
            <li> In the first couple of weeks I noticed my lashes got back to their original condition before I had extensions, and since have gradually grown longer.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve gotten thinner the older I&#x27;ve gotten, and I would like to look like I have brows without having to APPLY them each morning!</li>
            <li> It works a little slower than I would have liked...</li>
            <li> Wow this really works!!</li>
            <li> I probably should have backed off use to every other day or every third day instead of daily.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is I was very happy with the results, despite minor issues.</li>
            <li> I use mainly on my eye brows and they&#x27;re much fuller than they used to be and Rapid Lash does not irritate my brow ;-)</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not very pretty to curl and put mascara on as my eye lashes will point in many off ways.</li>
            <li> I actually had ordered 2 when I placed my original order (because of the positive feedback).</li>
            <li> My lashes were very sparse and short, now they have filled in some</li>
            <li> I am a very skeptical person, and this is the most amazing product I have ever bought!</li>
            <li> I immediately started using a second bottle that I had saved and once again within five to six weeks I saw a huge difference in my lashes.  </li>
            <li> it has grown them and made them so much stronger than I had hoped for -</li>
            <li> Well, it REALLY does work.  </li>
            <li> I notice if I stop using this my lashes fall out so much easier.</li>
            <li> My lashes have gotten much longer.  </li>
            <li> My eylashes are light, short, and sparse.  </li>
            <li> I really noticed a difference after using this product for 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> My lashes were very sparse</li>
            <li> My lashes are so much longer &amp; now appear to be getting thicker.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I know it is supposed to take six weeks to three months to really see a difference, but my lashes are already longer and thicker.  </li>
            <li> took a month to see results, but once my lashes got going, they really took off.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect much when I ordered this product but thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> However, the eyebrow that really needed it, has not improved.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t seemed to do much for me.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really expecting to see a change this soon</li>
            <li> I tried this on the recommendation of a friend who clearly had success with it.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t really thicker, but I&#x27;ll take what I can get.</li>
            <li> It dries fast tho.</li>
            <li> have been using for 2 weeks still have not seen much hair grow.</li>
            <li> absolutely NOTHING happens.</li>
            <li> which I had to deal with for the whole day.    </li>
            <li> Hopefully i would be able to report differently after a few more weeks.    </li>
            <li> this product is absolutely amazing,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have watched carefully, often adding my lower lashes as well, because they are getting thinner as I age, just like the top lashes.  </li>
            <li> Rapidlash really helps improve the health of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how much it has changed my lashes.  </li>
            <li> My lashes were VERY noticeably longer.  </li>
            <li> Saw real results with Latisse though.</li>
            <li> I really think it has been making my lashes longer and healthier.</li>
            <li> If you have ever used Latisse, do not expect this product to work as fast.     </li>
            <li> and it really worked.  </li>
            <li> so it hasn&#x27;t had time to really be visible.  </li>
            <li> It took 90 days to really notice a difference.</li>
            <li> for REAL.</li>
            <li> After a month I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t see much regrowth</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I have been using it for over an year now</li>
            <li> It really works and it will make people comment on your lashes.  </li>
            <li> more than slightly SLIGHTLY wet-</li>
            <li> really mush it around to find any wetness- about 20 times.    </li>
            <li> , when you have really sparse lashes, anything is an improvement.</li>
            <li> The product really works.  </li>
            <li> This does really work.</li>
            <li> i would recommend this product to anyone who wants longer lashes.</li>
            <li> Noticed about a 30% increase in lash length, which becomes very noticeable when wearing mascara.</li>
            <li> For maximum results, you really need to use this every night.     </li>
            <li> I started using this Rapidlash in January and my lashes are so much longer and thicker than they were before.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Lash and eyebrow growth was very noticeable after 2 months of use.</li>
            <li> As an FYI, I&#x27;m 62 but still working in retail management and have to keep up with the younger gals, so appearance is important.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice as much lash fall out.</li>
            <li> Rapidlash has improved the health of my eyelashes so much, that&#x27;s how I reply to these comments</li>
            <li> My lashes are longer and fuller thanks to Rapidlash.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 and have very sparse straight lashes.</li>
            <li> I did have to trim them once because some were so much longer then the rest.     </li>
            <li> Being more careful, and taking a damp q-tip and wiping off any not on the lash line has helped a lot to.</li>
            <li> I dont think to many people have the problem of overly curly lashes but just in case some one does be careful.     </li>
            <li> My lashes are not in circles, no crazy ones (so far), no redness, and im figuring out how to deal with the darkness.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonable priced and it works.</li>
            <li> My lashes are much longer but not thicker.  </li>
            <li> and i have to say this product really does what it says</li>
            <li> and you just have to stick with it for a while and really try to use it every night.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> my eye lashes didn&#x27;t seem to fall out as much</li>
            <li> and they seemed to thicken up a bit,but I didn&#x27;t see much addition to my length.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> This should really get no stars but that&#x27;s not an option.</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> This product really does work, but with consequences.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very self-conscious because of this.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product straight from City Cosmetics and after awhile I found my lashes thickening up and noticed the length increasing.  </li>
            <li> I am also using it on  my very sparse brows and notice hair growing in.  </li>
            <li> I was very sceptical, but after using this product faithfully every day, I noticed a difference after 2-3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> After using the whole tube,  I still have no hair</li>
            <li> I even skipped nights thinking it doesn&#x27;t really matter any way.</li>
            <li> I began to use it and didn&#x27;t see much results but wanted to keep trying.</li>
            <li> That made me think the Rapidlash really worked.</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well.  </li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> much make up.</li>
            <li> My lashes are about an 1/8 inch and 4 row wide, so I was spreading the product with my finger to make sure of coverage.</li>
            <li> I really can see a difference in the length.</li>
            <li> I will really see a difference.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> so did my real eyelashes.</li>
            <li> My lashes are really thicker</li>
            <li> After I used this serum, I noticed that my lashes didnt drop off as much, which always irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> Although, I do not use the product as much now maybe a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> It is everything that I expected and more.</li>
            <li> I think Amazon is no worse.</li>
            <li> , my lashes has grown so much.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t really purchase this again.</li>
            <li> They are much longer now as fuller.</li>
            <li> , I expected some because I have so many allergies to the preservatives in products.</li>
            <li> This product really works for me.  </li>
            <li> I started using it at the end of May, and didn&#x27;t really notice any change for about 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li> and I really hope it works for you like it worked for me</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t review items very often, but I felt compelled to do so this time.</li>
            <li> My lashes are much longer and fuller, including the bottoms lashes.</li>
            <li> It really works,..</li>
            <li> This one really works.</li>
            <li> though they have improved much.</li>
            <li> You really have to be patient with it.</li>
            <li> It will take up to 8 weeks to really see results and I intend to use the product longer until I get the results I want.</li>
            <li> It really did the trick.</li>
            <li> Now I am ready to buy this product again and grow some lashes.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think it is very noticeable.</li>
            <li> fast shipping</li>
            <li> Which does not happen very often.</li>
            <li> really wish it had made them fuller/lusher, too, as others have claimed it&#x27;s done for them, but it hasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> The shipment was also really fast.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue using this product and see just how fabulous my lashes can be.</li>
            <li> So, I really don&#x27;t know if it was the product.</li>
            <li> It took a whole month of using this every night before I started seeing results.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that it really works.  </li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t get much curl</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing even though I used it as directed.  </li>
            <li> very ..</li>
            <li> I was using another lash serum that worked really well</li>
            <li> I really like Raptidlash serum.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that Rapidlash would be the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; lash thickener and growth product that was at a reasonable price (compared to Latisse).</li>
            <li> Rapidlash and L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s lash serum work REALLY well TOGETHER.</li>
            <li> But again, I absolutely WOULD NOT risk using Rapidlash alone.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t irritate, but my lashes absolutely grew NO longer.</li>
            <li> but really didn&#x27;t want to commit to a very pricey one or one that I had to get a prescription for.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as much length as it is the volume of my eyelashes</li>
            <li> And it was very dear -</li>
            <li> I much prefer the Rapidlash.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist said stick with the real stuff-Latisse</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do much.  </li>
            <li> bottom lashes grew very well</li>
            <li> With nightly use, my lashes have absolutely grown much longer and they also are thicker and feel stronger.</li>
            <li> So much so that I ordered some for my daughter too.</li>
            <li> This really worked for me.</li>
            <li> I had been getting my lashes done for years until I had to stop because I was spending too much money.  </li>
            <li> and I am so glad I spent the money on it.  </li>
            <li> As much as I would really like to, it just did not do a thing</li>
            <li> my mornings a whole lot</li>
            <li> My mother also has light and short eyelashes</li>
            <li> that is a real plus...</li>
            <li> I have eye lashes and eyebrows thanks to this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Have used it for years and will continue to use it because it really works.  </li>
            <li> I bought a much cheaper serum from Rimmel and it works just as well.</li>
            <li> and I still really miss it.  </li>
            <li> If not, I don&#x27;t really know what I would do.</li>
            <li> but when it does, it makes a real difference.</li>
            <li> Save your money.&lt;br /&gt;Revitalash did work very well.</li>
            <li> This product really worked well for me.  </li>
            <li> so I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My lashes are much longer and fuller and darker.  </li>
            <li> It really does work.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is one of the two products that I&#x27;ve ever use from a company that really works.</li>
            <li> that REALLY WORKS.  </li>
            <li> really like it</li>
            <li> This absolutely does what it says it does.  </li>
            <li> and I already notice that my eyelashes don&#x27;t fall out as much</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff really does make your lashes grow noticeably longer.  </li>
            <li> Nope just very sore , swollen eyes from using Rapidlash.</li>
            <li> One tube lasts for much longer than it says - two months.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t spend this much money again on this product.  </li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks I saw a difference and now after 2 months I cant believe how much my lashes have grown and thickened.  </li>
            <li> however this time I don&#x27;t really see any difference in my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> it delivers results at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> BUT my eyes don&#x27;t care too much for the serum and seem to tear up ...</li>
            <li> This really works the way it says ...</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks I thought I noticed some improvement on my eyelashes, but where it was really noticeable, was my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> It really did.</li>
            <li> After applying the product twice a day for three weeks, I have not seen much progress.</li>
            <li> This product really works to grow lashes..</li>
            <li> I wish I had appreciated them when I had them.  </li>
            <li> But for $20, what did I really have to lose?  </li>
            <li> so I really haven&#x27;t used much at all</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> The lashes are much fuller and longer.</li>
            <li> I was considering Latisse but didn&#x27;t want to spend that much.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY have longer lashes ...</li>
            <li> Not so much in fullness or in darkness of them, but hey that&#x27;s what mascara is for.  </li>
            <li> I do notice some growth, but not as much as I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s my real lashes.</li>
            <li> It took about 8 weeks to really start seeing the change.</li>
            <li> Fast forward to today (about 2 months after purchasing)</li>
            <li> It really does work..</li>
            <li> Very east to use</li>
            <li> and it was much cheaper on Amazon</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are much fuller and darker.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t have any side effects or real effects.</li>
            <li> She said it took her about a month to really notice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I put too much on or something else.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve noted my lashes are longer and worked really fast on the brows</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are so much longer than they used to be.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to wear as much eye make-up as I used to.</li>
            <li> Used for 2+ months straight every night.  </li>
            <li> It DOES lengthen lashes, it really, really does.  </li>
            <li> After 6 months of use, I can confirm this does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it every night for six weeks and can&#x27;t really see much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> When I put on my mascara, it seems that some of the lashes seem a bit longer, but it&#x27;s very negligible.  </li>
            <li> It really works in making the lashes longer.</li>
            <li> I am very upset about it and wish I would of known about this side effect in advance.</li>
            <li> This item really works</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really work.</li>
            <li> Not so much thicker.</li>
            <li> but it gets finished fast</li>
            <li> You have to very patient with it and use it as directed.</li>
            <li> I have pretty full lashes already, but after only 3 weeks of using this product I can already tell that my lashes are thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> if you keep using it on a regular daily basis it honestly works.  </li>
            <li> I had been using Li Lash for a few months with spectacular results, longer, thicker, curlier.  </li>
            <li> After doing some more research online about rapidlash, it became clear to me that this product likely caused this.</li>
            <li> DAILY with the appropriate products i.e. make-up remover for waterproof make-up, sensitive eyes, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I kind of got lazy and wasn&#x27;t consistent about using it.  </li>
            <li> I had been putting it on from corner to corner on my eyes until I noticed a few eyelash hairs growing the very inside of my eye, kind of on my nose....</li>
            <li> but it is the next best eyelash enhancer I&#x27;ve ever tired.</li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde so this has helped make my lashes stand out more.</li>
            <li> I only use once a day and have noticed immediate, impressive results on both my lashes and my eyebrows (which I had over plucked at one point into pencil thin shadows)</li>
            <li> not now... they are long and full.. fun to apply mascara now.</li>
            <li> The first week into using this product my lashes darkened, the second week my lashes started to fill in, by the third week i started noticing the length was becoming longer And by the end of the fourth week my lashes were looking more volumous, longer and darker just as advertised.</li>
            <li> The prescription serum is too high priced to use for cosmetic reasons but after 2 years of use I can tell you this is just about as good for far less.  </li>
            <li> I selected the right eye initially because on that side the eyelashes were slightly more sparse than those on the left.  </li>
            <li> almost too long and so many new lashes.</li>
            <li> I received my product early 10/14, which means it&#x27;s expired after 11/14 !!!</li>
            <li> My lashes are growing so fast, and long, and it is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Less than a month my eyelashes were long great product.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are long and full once again!</li>
            <li> I ordered a new tube - the first one lasted 2 1/2 months.  </li>
            <li> I think with my contacts and generally sensitive eyes, it may just not be the right product /method for me.</li>
            <li> Maybe one or two long ones grew but could easily be pulled out.  </li>
            <li> even after i stopped using lilash for about 8 months, my lashes stayed long and strong.</li>
            <li> Long, healthy and lush!</li>
            <li> This product worked extremely well on my eyelashes- have been applying it nightly for the better part of 2 months now and can absolutely see a difference.  </li>
            <li> my lashes are strong, long and thicker than before.</li>
            <li> and my lashes are still strong and long.</li>
            <li> Nothing super apparent, but I could tel</li>
            <li> this is a major one - growth of fine hair on upper cheeks right below eyes.  </li>
            <li> OK, I used this on my eyebrows because I thought &amp;#34;sperm&amp;#34; eyebrows were all the rage in high school, overtweezed, and am left with the aftermath now as an adult.</li>
            <li> I already tried out the Maybelline Jade lash growth serum (from that fancy Eva Longoria commercial) and was excited to get my lashes fuller and darker -</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products</li>
            <li> I do think when you stop using it though, your lashes go back to their original length.</li>
            <li> Due to chemotherapy I lost my brows and most of lashes.</li>
            <li> I originally bought these to see if I could grow my eye brows back</li>
            <li> Then now my eyelashes are all short as my original length.</li>
            <li> I started noticing significant growth after a couple of weeks of constant use.</li>
            <li> I find after 3-4 weeks of consistent, daily use my lashes are noticeable longer (not all of them at the same time) and are more voluminous.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to try other brands for more length and thickness.</li>
            <li> After only a month of using this product I saw significant growth.  </li>
            <li> Definitely and significantly longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other lash growth products and they worked ok.</li>
            <li> Half my lashes (top and bottom) did full circles after 6 weeks which wasnt that big of a deal just funny.</li>
            <li> its better that Smart Lash because you only need to apply it once per day instead of twice with Smart lash and you get the same results.</li>
            <li> So far, hasn&#x27;t really done anything for my eyebrows though, and that is the reason I bought it in the first place.</li>
            <li> At first the skin around my eyes were darkened but it went away after a few more days of application.</li>
            <li> however it&#x27;s great whenever you are low on lashes or missing any!</li>
            <li> I love it, they are thick and full.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this long enough to know what kind of results I can get, I now just apply 3-4 nights a week for maintenance.</li>
            <li> I have stopped curling my lashes before putting mascara on because they are long enough and curl on their own.  </li>
            <li> I think it has extended the time for &#x27;fills&#x27; to my extensions, but I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know if it has helped my own lashes.</li>
            <li> I also used it on one of my eyebrows which has been very sparse for decades (over-plucked in high school) - and sure enough, the bare spots where nothing has grown for years are filling in.  </li>
            <li> Does anybody have a positive (or any) experience to report about the new formula?</li>
            <li> As an adult I managed to grow a few more hairs, but for most of the last 10 years I had to rely on eyebrow pencils and stencils...  </li>
            <li> The product is easy to use - very similar to liquid eyeliner, except it&#x27;s clear.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that they are super lush, but at 60+ yrs old, I have lashes that 20 year olds compliment me on.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are so much thicker now that I only need a quick swipe of mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strong, long!!</li>
            <li> and i see a HUGE differance!It has made my lashes almost twice as long and about 1/3 thicker but not any darker</li>
            <li> this stuff works took a couple months HUGE difference in lashes , never had  think or long ,, now I do</li>
            <li> My lashes grew long and curled, and my eyebrows filled in.  </li>
            <li> Aside from using this product on my lashes i have also been applying it on my eyebrows, they didn&#x27;t grow as fast as my eyelashes did, but i can definitely say after a month of application they start to come in together toward the center more, and the shorter brows at the beginning are also becoming longer and thicker, so i would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> It takes about 5 to 6 weeks to see results, however after that, you can clearly see longer and fuller lashes with consistent use.</li>
            <li> Wow, thank you for making a product that really works and is so affordable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a true blonde and</li>
            <li> I will go back to using Amplifeye, although more expensive, it works good for me.</li>
            <li> Read the entire information sheet for full detail (located inside box).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving the length and no more tenderness.</li>
            <li> my lashes and brows started getting full only within 2-3 weeks</li>
            <li> that not only were my lashes longer, but had filled in nicely in the little bare patches.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed new eyelash growth in 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> Also i looked and the rapidlash it self had been opened and tampered with after being listed as new!</li>
            <li> It costs less than and works better than most other lash lentheners!</li>
            <li> And, really, it didn&#x27;t prompt any new growth in the areas where I&#x27;ve plucked either..</li>
            <li> I did notice a slight difference in growth (more length but not thickness).  </li>
            <li> Our local drugstore carries it for more than double the price &amp; they can&#x27;t keep it in.</li>
            <li> My eyes looked a lot better when I skipped a day, and since I figure the side effects aren&#x27;t permanent, I went ahead and tried it for the fourth time last night.     </li>
            <li> After many months of steady use, I noticed that my lashes had become slightly sparser.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend using on eyebrows if they are a decent length.</li>
            <li> I think I might be able to get it to go completely away if I keep being careful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though this is only .1 ounce, there is more than enough product for you to determine whether it works for you.  </li>
            <li> If you get even a tiny bit in your eye wash it out quickly or you&#x27;ll be wearing a pirate patch for a while, I am.  </li>
            <li> After a week, I had to give up because people were super concerned about me because of how red my eyes were!  </li>
            <li> And I actually bought some more for a gift for a friend who complains about her short eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I think it is important to give the body a break from chemically-based products (I stopped using underarm deodorant for 2 years and instead used the all-natural crystal stick and the toxins which had built up over the years completely disappeared along with the rashes and staining of my white clothing).</li>
            <li> I shopped around for eyelash enhancing products and realized that the ones that seem to be the most reccomended were also the most expensive.</li>
            <li> Length was my main goal.</li>
            <li> still had a good amount of Rapidlash product left, and I couldn&#x27;t bear to waste it, so I decided to use Rapidlash in conjunction with L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s lash</li>
            <li> I totally will be using this product,and the fact that is soo affordable is an extra bonus,i love it.</li>
            <li> My lashes quickly showed about 3mm length extension and that appears to be about it for them, but my brows are still showing signs of continued improvement, and I think I may get to a point some day where the ends are back to like</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every night, mainly because I forget or fall asleep.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more expensive,  but atleast it&#x27;s safe.  </li>
            <li> I used on my eyebrows where they are thinning, mainly on the outer arch.  </li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, I noticed my lashes thinning out.  </li>
            <li> however I realize fairly quickly that if I&#x27;m not constantly applying this item</li>
            <li> Unlike Latisse, my eyes are not left discolored and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly for the eyebrows</li>
            <li> Had short, super sparse lashes.</li>
            <li> All women want beautiful long, thick eye lashes.</li>
            <li> It is very challenging to get these new lashes into my eyelash curler, but if I get the curler extremely close to where it is actually pinching my lash line, I can get them up.</li>
            <li> After 12 weeks, I actually had very pretty lashes.</li>
            <li> With this product, I have full, long lashes that are roughly equal in size and they are full.  </li>
            <li> My lashes don&#x27;t look super long, but they seem much stronger, healthier, and aren&#x27;t falling out so they are definately growing longer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this and will use it forever.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for lash lengthening.</li>
            <li> I just purchased high end mascara justifying the purchase with all that I saved using</li>
            <li> High recommend it, just be patient and keep using for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it...</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t use it on high pollen days.  </li>
            <li> I have very light green eyes and haven&#x27;t noticed any color change.</li>
            <li> So between these 2 products I have lashes again almost like I had in high school.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this</li>
            <li> I will not say I highly recommend this because the affect varies from person to person.</li>
            <li> So far I think I am seeing a little change in my eyebrows and still hopeful for more positive results.</li>
            <li> Certain eyeliners do irritate my eyelids (not all - I can use mac gel and stila liquid liners), so it may be my somewhat sensitive skin reacting to the product.</li>
            <li> As I started to run out I tried to order more through Amazon, but nowhere will ship to New Zealand anymore, not even this seller that I previously bought Rapidlash off.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a sucker for beauty adds, really nothing works as advertised, but this is just truly amazing, and NO I&#x27;m in no way associated with anyone from the company or amazon, just a 45 year old who cheaped out and was taught a beauty lesson!</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product that really works!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little more than a month and have noticed results.</li>
            <li> i just noticed the expiration date of the product - it&#x27;s MAY 2010 while i ordered it early NOV 2010!!  </li>
            <li> I started using this product with a little skepticism, but hey I have $20.00 (okay, it was a little more, but</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I was blown away by the results, but I did notice some lengthening and a little more volume.</li>
            <li> I have tried all different types of products, this is the first one that has lived up to its claims!</li>
            <li> I love this product...wish it was a little cheaper though.</li>
            <li> but, WOW!!  </li>
            <li> It took about 3-4 weeks to notice, but WOW!!  </li>
            <li> I always had long full lashes but the older we get</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and I didn&#x27;t have any burning or other side effects.  </li>
            <li> What I am seeing is not a uniform growth pattern of longer than normal lashes, but rather, a few eyelashes at the outside corners of my eyes having exceptional growth.</li>
            <li> As far as the results I have gotten from this product in a rather short time frame, I really think its worth a try.</li>
            <li> My problem was, that because I use a lash curler every day (my lashes are straight, they don&#x27;t have a natural curl</li>
            <li> I will measure the difference but looks promising so far.....</li>
            <li> I was scared of putting anything on my eye because there is always the possibility of side effects but so far there are really none.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find something that really helped my skimpy lashes.</li>
            <li> and my lashes are unbelieveably long, full and darker.  </li>
            <li> Long story short, I plan to order more of this product.</li>
            <li> I, of course have stopped using it and things have returned to normal.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t use it everyday or maybe I should give it more time.  </li>
            <li> I even used it on my eyebrows which had become thin out from years of arching, and they have filled back in nicely too.</li>
            <li> just glad I didn&#x27;t give up after a few weeks because it isn&#x27;t an instantaneous change</li>
            <li> Be patient have to use it for a long time (like 7 months ) to get full effect.</li>
            <li> Without any results though, the daily discomfort just isn&#x27;t worth it for me - plus I&#x27;ve read that I may have to continue using this product to maintain lash improvement, if any.</li>
            <li> but that is normal for any hair/ lash product .</li>
            <li> but I had wondered if it was normal for my eyes to burn using it</li>
            <li> The skin returns to its normal color when application is halted (along with the eyelashes).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews normally, but I had to set aside time to write this one.</li>
            <li> Once I stopped using it, my lashes returned to normal.  </li>
            <li> Of course your lashes will return to their normal length if you don&#x27;t apply the product like three times a week to keep your length.</li>
            <li> And within 1 month, I began to start having normal looking eyelashes by month 2</li>
            <li> The results will vary based upon the normal growth of your eyelashes and how you use the treatment.</li>
            <li> But it is worth the try especially for the price!!!</li>
            <li> Long and full again.</li>
            <li> and we don&#x27;t have long full lashes.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product when it first came out, I couldn&#x27;t beleive how long my lashes were.  </li>
            <li> so I continued usage, thinking maybe I was shedding lashes naturally, but by the end of the 2nd week I didn&#x27;t have many lashes left to spare!!!</li>
            <li> Try it, you will be amazed how great you will look with long, thick lashes.</li>
            <li> You lashes will be so full and so long that you won&#x27;t believe it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and my lashes are almost as full and long as they were with Latisse.</li>
            <li> This made my eyelids swell, and I&#x27;m pretty sure at least a quarter of my existing eyelashes fell out.  </li>
            <li> Now my lashes are long and full.  </li>
            <li> This product worked better than the prescription Latisse which gave me &amp;#34;clumpy&amp;#34; uneven growth.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, give it a few months</li>
            <li> My lashes got so long I actually stopped using it for a while because they were touching my sunglass lenses and driving me nuts.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are normal but wanted thicker longer ones.</li>
            <li> I immediately stopped using the serum and, after a couple of weeks, looked normal again.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews bu</li>
            <li> I am sure to use my Rapid Lash everyday.</li>
            <li> It takes around 4 weeks before you start to see the growth, and sure enough I got long lashes.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise these lashes point straight down and look bizarre.</li>
            <li> If I do, I&#x27;ll go back to the original source with the cylinder tube with straight, parallel lines.</li>
            <li> Okay... so I found myself wanting to get fake individual eyelashes jumping on the band wagon of others which was a big mistake, especially since I already had long, full and beautiful eyelashes.</li>
            <li> We never has  really full or long lashes - but we have now!</li>
            <li> I think the lashes on my right eye are still longer than on my left, but I am hoping this will even out too.</li>
            <li> that after the next 4 weeks of using it THE RIGHT WAY I was amazed at the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on my upper and lower lashes once a day, right before bed.</li>
            <li> I uploaded it as a customer&#x27;s photo right next to the photo of the product.</li>
            <li> Having experienced all of this.... very thin lashes have grown in.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product overall, my eyelashes are pretty long and thick for asians</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s done a good job of getting back to my normal thick lashes and made them longer than normal as well.</li>
            <li> I used this product exclusively on my eyebrows, which I am trying to thicken after too much plucking and generally getting older.</li>
            <li> and I have very sparse brows to start with and not dark.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, i tried it just for the sake of trying so far no significant change in my eyelash.</li>
            <li> They are just right, not weird and spidery like what some other products out there will do.</li>
            <li> It takes about 4-6 weeks for results, obviously NEW eyelashes have to grow in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a new tube on reserve and plan to continue using this.</li>
            <li> is  a new start...</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t notice any new lashes growing.  </li>
            <li> My lashes have even curled with the new growth spurt.</li>
            <li> So I returned them and asked for new ones that were not expired.  </li>
            <li> but I can live with that.</li>
            <li> and well I stopped using it already because I don&#x27;t want to risk loosing my eyelashes instead of gaining new ones</li>
            <li> She now uses rapid lash and my girl friend who lost all her lashes from cancer treatment now has lashes and feels like a new person.  </li>
            <li> Tried the new eyelash extensions.  </li>
            <li> Rapidlash has helped make my existing lashes longer, but I have not noticed them getting any fuller, so I don&#x27;t think it aids in the growth of new lashes.  </li>
            <li> When I couldn&#x27;t find it on Amazon, i tried a new product, can&#x27;t remember name, but came in gold colored tube.</li>
            <li> YOUR NEW LASHES WILL FALL OUT</li>
            <li> But, here in New Jersey, it is allergy season.</li>
            <li> Michelle   New Jersey</li>
            <li> In just two weeks I noticed my eyelashes were longer, and new lashes were growing out as well.</li>
            <li> New lashes came in like weeds</li>
            <li> so I know that it works, that is, unless it has \\&quot;new and</li>
            <li> I also noticed what seems to be new lashes growing in a bald spot on my bottom lash line.  </li>
            <li> BUT - this product also makes NEW lashes grow where there were none before.</li>
            <li> So, it might work for people trying to regrow hair they&#x27;ve already had, but it does not work to create new hair or thicken existing hair-for me, anyway.</li>
            <li> Live and learn.</li>
            <li> and I have new growth there too.</li>
            <li> also i noticed new growths, i thought this is like fertilizer or miracle gro for the eye lashes.</li>
            <li> After about 3 I had new eye brow hair</li>
            <li> The new formula is no improvement.  </li>
            <li> The extensions looked so fake too, and now my lashes just look real, healthy and full and long!  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks, the length of my lashes were significantly longer!</li>
            <li> Although I wouldn&#x27;t say they are thick, most of the spaces have filled in, I have almost twice as many as before and can see more new ones at the base.  </li>
            <li> My lashes completely filled in in the sparse areas and actually grew longer, especially at the corners of my eyes.  </li>
            <li> most recent delivery of the formula seemed much thinner than previous shipments</li>
            <li> so I really need to get into the habit of daily use to really maximize my lashes.</li>
            <li> , my top lashes have grow at least 30% longer and my bottom lashes grow so much espeically at the end since that&#x27;s the part with the least/shortest lashes.</li>
            <li> (I even watched youtube videos before I began applying it to make sure I knew how to do it properly) and saw absolutely no improvement in my eyelash length, color, or thickness.</li>
            <li> As a blonde I look naked without mascara on, but now I feel comfortable leaving the house without it</li>
            <li> I read reviews on it wasn&#x27;t sure if they were real or not, but thought I would at least try the product once.  </li>
            <li> Prior to using this, my eyelashes were never really a feature in my eye makeup, it was more so the eyeliner that made an impact.</li>
            <li> This is not this first time I received an empty tube of this product (the first was directly from the mfgr!).  </li>
            <li> I was amazed to have long eyelashes for the first time in my life!  </li>
            <li> I took 4 months before I could see a major difference in my lashes, but after that, my lashes look much, much longer and fuller.  </li>
            <li> , my eyelashes look good, but not incredible lush lashes nor super long, but definetly improvement for how they are normally.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes, and have never had a problem with it hurting my eyes in any way.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product for use on my eyebrows because my eyes are very sensitive</li>
            <li> I still wanted to take a break since I don&#x27;t see the point of having long beautiful lashes, if I have to deal with a bigger problem of dark red circles around my eyes.    </li>
            <li> But I must say it definitely improved mine with more growth after 4 months, but just not as dark, full and long as I hoped.</li>
            <li> I think plain old Vaseline might do more.</li>
            <li> but it made my lashes super LONG!!</li>
            <li> so I have sparse lashes that are super straight and grow down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable and way cheaper than other products and it actually works :)</li>
            <li> Ok unbelievably this product works.</li>
            <li> I took picture when i first use it and a month later</li>
            <li> When I first began to use it, the next morning I had problems with my eyes</li>
            <li> I started using it about 3 weeks ago pretty religiously for me, which means once a day</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, like a lot of other reviewers, and I don&#x27;t know why, but it worked great for me!  </li>
            <li> Now every morning when I do my makeup, I leave mascara for the last step and it transforms my whole look!</li>
            <li> My sister&#x27;s lashes are pretty short, but this made them longer and thicker.     </li>
            <li> You have to be consistent in applying daily to see results, and lashes don&#x27;t stay without continued use, BUT it does work.</li>
            <li> but I think I will pay for the higher quality one next time.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> Due to chemo, I know it took longer to show signs of working, but worth the wait!</li>
            <li> This product brought them back fast!  </li>
            <li> I called my mom and found out she had the same issue within the first week or so of use.</li>
            <li> Worked great for me after having fake eyelashes for over 2 years and noticed how it really ripped out some of my own.&lt;br /&gt;After only a week I have seen results</li>
            <li> My lashes grew longer than usual but I did not get any more lashes than what I already have.</li>
            <li> I first tried RapidLash last winter.</li>
            <li> This might have given some thickness to my lashes, not enough to be recognizable.  </li>
            <li> these were just my natural eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different brands of eyelash growth products over the last several years, including Latise.  </li>
            <li> Even with curling and mascara they would end up sticking straight out and barely be noticeable.</li>
            <li> BTW, I&#x27;m 65 years old!</li>
            <li> Patience is the key and it will really pay off!  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s pretty inexpensive overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I am growing more eyelashes</li>
            <li> But with mascara and primer -WOW!</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a few days, and have noticed my eyelids are a gross bright pink/red color there is not itchiness</li>
            <li> Anyway, this I would skip and actually put the $$ towards a product that&#x27;s more likely to actually WORK!</li>
            <li> However, I was told there would be a great or dramatic difference, which there definitely IS NOT.</li>
            <li> So Ladies, if your looking for a cheap and efficient eyelash grower, I suggest rapidlash HANDS DOWN</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t have high expectations for growing my eyelashes back with this product</li>
            <li> No bad side effects either, but not positive impact at all.</li>
            <li> It initially takes about four weeks for the full benefits, and my lashes are definitely longer and thicker.  </li>
            <li> The down side is that it gives me blood shot eyes and a pretty obvious dark circle under my eyes, i&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> I see the most dramatic difference when I am wearing mascara, but now I only use a tiny bit of mascara which is pretty exciting!</li>
            <li> I did not see any significant difference to my lashes with this product.my friend uses the other serum that costs entirely too much</li>
            <li> LIke I said I am on my first tube and it has been 5 months, so spending about $20 for a product that will last that long is really close to nothing!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say it does as much for the thickness, but I definitely have some new growth.</li>
            <li> Honestly, RapidLash is half the cost with absolutely NO side-effects.</li>
            <li> I received it, and tried it right away, but the brush was dry and there was nothing in there.  </li>
            <li> I had been struggling to find the right mascara that would really make the little corner lashes stand out, but after using this product I swear I&#x27;ve had brand new lashes grow</li>
            <li> They looked fine with mascara, however were quite limp.</li>
            <li> I did make another purchase to be ready when the initial tube runs out, but so far it is still going!  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s most likely why my eyes are so red and dry.  </li>
            <li> I have only noticed they seem in a little better condition, less likely to lose as many.  </li>
            <li> It works, but you really have to use it every single day for at least a month to see any kind of results on your lashes.</li>
            <li> My lashes are noticeably longer and my thinning eyebrows are filling back in, despite the fact that I am &amp;#34;a woman of a certain age.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it three stars because for the price it&#x27;s certainly lasted me a while, especially given how often I apply it.</li>
            <li> So, I was desperate for a quick, fast and efficient solution to grow back my own lashes.</li>
            <li> My lashes grew longer and filled in a little.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended, especially combined with a dying product like Swiss O Par to darken...gives you virtually maintenance free, dark, lush lashes for days and even weeks.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re making serious bank, that&#x27;s a significant investment into something you don&#x27;t know very much about.     </li>
            <li> I rarely ever write reviews, good or bad, but I&#x27;ve made an exception.  </li>
            <li> great* idea and cutting them yourself.  </li>
            <li> If I forget to apply at night, I put it on in the morning, as it is clear.  </li>
            <li> As of now, I still don&#x27;t have a really clear idea of why it works, how well it works, but ...      </li>
            <li> My lashes are pretty long naturally</li>
            <li> Please note that the photographs do not show the difference as clearly as I can see it myself.</li>
            <li> He can clearly see the difference.  </li>
            <li> It is clear and as yet I see no change.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s not  false lash expectations but realist expectation, with product I would say gives your lashes a extra 40% thicker and 20% darker.</li>
            <li> area on the top of my lashes, and lately I have been putting it &amp;#34;under&amp;#34; my lower lashes, and</li>
            <li> I have really seen a definite difference.  </li>
            <li> After I had my extensions taken off I was left with gaps and very brittle eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> so far I don&#x27;t see that on mine.</li>
            <li> After using this for a month I was really pleasantly surprised to see</li>
            <li> I am 67 yrs old</li>
            <li> but because my lashes were so short I really can see an improvement.  </li>
            <li> After a couple of months I was ready to give up, when about the 3rd month some of my lashes started getting noticeably longer.</li>
            <li> only twice, feels like when your eyelash is getting ready to fall out itch.</li>
            <li> My bottom lashes are much longer and definitely thicker.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month and really did not see any different.</li>
            <li> Overall, a promising product, but there ARE side effects.</li>
            <li> No visible results so far.  </li>
            <li> you will be soooooo surprised.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that my product is old.</li>
            <li> Also, when I reordered someone had rubbed off the expiration date, so be on the look out for old product, and remember that an expiration date should be on the bottom of this product.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t know anything about them, they tend to be short, straight, and sparse.</li>
            <li> , I was scared that I would get a product which would darken my natural eye colour, so I was hesitant to buy RapidLash.  </li>
            <li> The same product purchasd from Amazon does not seem to have as much product in the container as when I purchased it from a beautician.  </li>
            <li> I question if the product was old or evaporated.</li>
            <li> A 27 year old was jealous of my lashes, (I&#x27;m 54)</li>
            <li> After one use I have developed eyeball pain.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it on brows as I had them professionally tatooed as a Birthday gift.  </li>
            <li> After continued use, it went away completely.</li>
            <li> This product has performed well for me so far.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d imagine I should start seeing any changes, but there are none so far.</li>
            <li> I have doubts so far, but I will continue applying, and if anything changes or happens \\&quot;overnight\\</li>
            <li> So far, two stars.</li>
            <li> I did not put on any eye cream at night while using this, nothing that would interfere with the product&#x27;s action.  </li>
            <li> absolutely NOTHING happened, except some red burning eyes.  </li>
            <li> Fixed with a bit of concealer, foundation or eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> You have to be religious with it and use it as much as it says it you won&#x27;t see the effects.</li>
            <li> mascara couldn&#x27;t help much because they were so short.</li>
            <li> Just wish company would design tube so that you have some idea of how much you have left so that I can order in advance.  </li>
            <li> I have never had any lashes to speak of but with this product I can actually curl them and have much longer thicker eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> WOW...           </li>
            <li> It works for me, for my mom(80 years old) and my sister-and law.</li>
            <li> and I completely noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> (ie, you have to really work with the brush to get the product out of the tube for proper application).  </li>
            <li> I used to have very short eyelashes and after having eyelash extensions for 2 months, they were really out of condition.</li>
            <li> Where I really noticed the difference was in some recent head shot pictures taken of me.  </li>
            <li> By the way, I have had no itching or discomfort of any sort with this product and my eyes have always been sensitive.</li>
            <li> So far I guess it is helping a bit.</li>
            <li> Not so much as the last one I purchased.</li>
            <li> Try it - you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> The second round has been better by far.</li>
            <li> and WOW it made those bald spots disappear.</li>
            <li> recommend you do it early before bed</li>
            <li> So far there is no changes to lashes.  </li>
            <li> I used it for over 8 weeks never missing a day.</li>
            <li> As you blink and then go to sleep the product will naturally get onto the lower lashes on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> When i bought the second one, i didn&#x27;t notice as much of a change.</li>
            <li> I AM 73 YEARS OLD</li>
            <li> So far it has made the eyelashes on the treated eye look darker, and a bit thicker and longer.  </li>
            <li> My old tube is almost used up now.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product (this is a replenishment for me) hoping it would fill in my natural eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I noticed just how much my eyelashes have actually improved by volume and length.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely sold on this product now.</li>
            <li> someone can lend some insight into whether the reddish discoloration is commonly seen on the barrel, that might put my mind at ease a bit more about repurchasing and giving the product another chance.  </li>
            <li> I have tried grandlash and smartlash so far</li>
            <li> so I would say this product is not for those of us that have sensitive eyes or allergies.</li>
            <li> However I continued to us rapid lash , reluctantly as I had nearly given up on it working for me.</li>
            <li> I apply at night because after applying it, it dries and coats with a white film, very noticeable</li>
            <li> It did not bother my sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my natural lashes went with them.  </li>
            <li> I use this product daily and haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference yet.  </li>
            <li> The cost is reasonable, especially compared to prescription alternatives.  </li>
            <li> So at least no permanent damage :-)</li>
            <li> When I stopped using this product my lashes started their natural curve again.  </li>
            <li> I was getting ready to get eyelash extensions prior to purchasing, now I just use this and my MAC Blacksplash</li>
            <li> I now have pretty long lashes.  </li>
            <li> and sometimes they grow in a lil wonky, but still extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> My whole life I&#x27;ve had short lashes.  </li>
            <li> With my luck, my natural lashes would get pulled out.  </li>
            <li> I also had the experience where it made my eyelashes sensitive</li>
            <li> This did not work for me as my skin seems to be too sensitive.</li>
            <li> finally, my eyes swelled so much, I could not ignore it and had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> Was it the serum or natural.... who knows.</li>
            <li> I see a marked improvement.</li>
            <li> I used it religiously for a month and it lengthened my lashes, so when I apply mascara, it really shows.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I noticed results as early as week 2.</li>
            <li> I give this product 4 stars because I was pleasantly surprised this stuff works.</li>
            <li> I have never had any irritation with it and have seriously sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> Like I stated in my title, it took about a month for me to start noticing results, I have straight short lashes.</li>
            <li> But the actual thickness of the hairs didn&#x27;t improve as much as I&#x27;d hoped it would, and this stuff is still a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I like it so far ...</li>
            <li> and my eyelashes are pretty long.</li>
            <li> I is by not stretch of the imagination near the lengthening and thickening effects I got while using Latisse.  </li>
            <li> My natural lashes are medium-thick and straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping did come early too.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a young 54)</li>
            <li> My lashes have thickened and grown out considerably.</li>
            <li> I was actually really surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li> they were in the old days.  </li>
            <li> but so far there is no noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> no darkening around the eyes, itchy/dry eyes and sensitive eyelids like side effects the Lilash caused&lt;br</li>
            <li> With mascara, they nearly touch my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for 3 weeks but haven&#x27;t seen any change so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working well so far.</li>
            <li> I have been using this products for nearly 7 weeks</li>
            <li> Far exceeded my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> Maybe too early</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seventy years old.</li>
            <li> So far I have seen a noticeable difference in length and fullness.</li>
            <li> I am only wearing mascara, not eye liner so you can see what it is capable of turning out like.</li>
            <li> Only give it 3 stars bc of the burning and who wants to have to buy separate products for lashes and brows?</li>
            <li> , I was so surprised.</li>
            <li> I bought two of there so far and used non stop for about 6 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 years old</li>
            <li> I really like the way this serum moisturizes my eye lids just above my lashes.</li>
            <li> It really works actually faster than it</li>
            <li> I have short &amp; straight eyelashes after a month</li>
            <li> they actually seem to be falling out &amp; my eyes are really irritated.</li>
            <li> The purpose for purchasing this product is because I wanted my lashes to be naturally longer.</li>
            <li> in ... seems to keep the growth so far (eyelashes)</li>
            <li> Been using now for several weeks and don&#x27;t see much change.  </li>
            <li> not so much so far.</li>
            <li> I thought wow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had really short lashes my whole life that no amount of mascara could fix.  </li>
            <li> Makes lashes soft and easier when applying mascara.i use it on my eyebrows too.</li>
            <li> Buying directly from the manufacturer or distributors may allow it.</li>
            <li> , she&#x27;d probably try stealing it from me and 2, I don&#x27;t think she needs the product so young).</li>
            <li> expected more liquid inside the containers; applying it twice a day, the entire container did not last 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and often have allergic reactions to beauty products but not this.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am just sensitive to an ingredient, but I will no longer use this</li>
            <li> I kept using it anyway for another month and now discontinued completely because of no growth at all.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money I spent on this product.</li>
            <li> eyelashes have been growing out a lot more slowly, but the growth is still noticeable.</li>
            <li> My lashes have always been very blond in color and now as I have gotten older they have turned white but with a little mascara and having used this product they look thick long and beautiful.</li>
            <li> the first few days after starting this product, but it disappeared quickly.  </li>
            <li> I only used it on the upper eyelashes and eyebrow of my right eye.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise Amazon responded right away, within the same day, issued a credit back to my account.  </li>
            <li> With Rapidlash, my lashes are darker, more plentiful, longer, and the growth comes through with a natural curl, unlike other more expensive products I&#x27;ve tried that result in rogue lashes that make me look like the leader of the Droogs in A Clockwork Orange.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over 2 weeks and see significant growth in my lashes...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last two months but not regularly and still noticed a pretty big difference they are longer but not so much fuller</li>
            <li> I continued to apply a little eyeshadow on my brows while using this product and it stilled worked even though it is recommended to use on a clean brow.</li>
            <li> I was so anxious to start using this product due to so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> so i just use it everyday, usually twice a day even though it says your not supposed to lol the only downfall is it leaves my eyelids a bit puffy, even when i was using it as directed.</li>
            <li> the first week of my eyes a little allergy, anyway, I really like this product.</li>
            <li> After a few days of use, little blood vessels on my lids and under my eyes became very prominent and the areas looked bruised.</li>
            <li> Otherwise they would almost immediately lose the curl and return to their original limp state.</li>
            <li> I took pictures before starting rapidlash, well they were really just back to normal.</li>
            <li> I have been using this now for a few months and have noticed a significant difference in the number of eyelashes that I have and also their length.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited to see my lashes in another few weeks.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m willing to take, i mean for the price of this thing the result is so much more than what i have expected.</li>
            <li> I really would rather live with short, blonde lashes than none at all</li>
            <li> My daughter has asked me to purchase Rapid Lash as a Christmas gift for her because the difference in my lashes is so profound.  </li>
            <li> The first night I used this on my lashes, I woke up with bloodshot red eyes and the surrounding eye areas were red and puffy.</li>
            <li> At first, I put it on once at night and once during the day, only on the upper lash line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product works or not, I was only able to use it for 3 days.  </li>
            <li> and I am not typically a patient person.</li>
            <li> My sister started it at the same time as me and has also had the exact same effects.</li>
            <li> But do not expect miracles, be realistic you should definitely see somewhat of a difference in your eyelashes from the before and after.</li>
            <li> The bare spot with missing lashed has filled in and grown out.  </li>
            <li> so my eyelashes are naturally not too long or full but this product</li>
            <li> fake lashes and lash glue have more problems than solutions so this serum is perfect--growth seen in first week and bottle lasts for months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered enough the first 4 weeks with my initial experience with Rapidlash</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t notice much but after a few weeks after washing my face I kept thinking I hadn&#x27;t fully removed my mascara.</li>
            <li> I have pretty short and sparse Asian lashes.</li>
            <li> I have only started using this in the past week or two, so I haven&#x27;t been able to see results yet.</li>
            <li> when i first tried it, it burned my eyes like hell, and the second day my eyes were red for</li>
            <li> my eyelashes were exactly the same way they were prior to using the product.</li>
            <li> You can have YOUR OWN LASHES, growing long and thick...</li>
            <li> After a month of consistent use, I have seen absolutely no new eyebrow growth or lengthening of current eyebrow hairs-beyond that of what normally grows in a month.</li>
            <li> After pretty much decimating my lashes with fake individuals, faithfully, for years (like 5) I found this stuff and it pretty much gave them life.</li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday, and the only side effects are slight dryness and mild very mild itching-</li>
            <li> I had heard very good things about Rapidlash but having used it for over a month now, I have to say I am disappointed as I have not noticed any visible results yet.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this product, I seem to be losing more eyelashes than gaining any new ones.</li>
            <li> If your a mature woman with fine thinning hair, don&#x27;t expect to get long lush dramatic eyelashes quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s become part of my routine and is just too easy not to - takes only a few seconds and doesn&#x27;t burn at all.</li>
            <li> now i have long thick lashes with layers, kind of hard to remember what it was like before! :)</li>
            <li> I was even skeptical about the reviews because there were so many positive ones.  </li>
            <li> This product really works, and goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> I have always had rather long lashes, but this makes them look even longer and fuller to where I don&#x27;t have to use so much mascara in the morning.</li>
            <li> I used it on my eyebrows because I have long eyelashes but very sparse eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> my lashes were so long that people really noticed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;My were growing so fast and long</li>
            <li> mascara people always ask if my eyelashes are real because they can&#x27;t believe how long my eyelashes are.</li>
            <li> Now I have straight long lashes</li>
            <li> I bought this not too long ago for my eyebrows (not so much my lashes).  </li>
            <li> I carefully read the reviews before purchasing this product because it seemed to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> But, if you quit using it, your lashes go back to normal in a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> , I try rapidlash and at first it looks like the bottle was empty but</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks the spots on my brows were COMPLETELY filled in and not long after that my eyebrows grew in thicker, darker, and longer.</li>
            <li> (so I can go back to Lilash), and glad I only wasted $20.</li>
            <li> It took 5 days after I stopped using this for my eyes to get back to normal.  </li>
            <li> As soon as you stop using Rapidlash, somehow your lashes go back to your normal length.</li>
            <li> What a true waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Early this year I started noticing that I started to loose many lashes and the ones I had left were half the size .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed the price has dropped considerably since I was using it regularly, so if anyone is interested in trying it, the cost is low enough.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really have a high expectations, but my eye lashes are really long now!!!!!</li>
            <li> I woke up at 3am last night to use the bathroom and ordered a new bottle</li>
            <li> I know some products only start working at the beginning of a new lash cycle (for ex: Latisse), which is why it can take up to 4 weeks to even begin seeing some results.</li>
            <li> The price is one that I can live with especially since I&#x27;m at the point where I don&#x27;t have to use it every night to get the results that I want.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll recommend this to my friend and purchase a new one when the current one is gone!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work out for me because it made my eyes dry and itchy,</li>
            <li> My lashes tend to curl as a whole but there are a few rebel lashes that are straight.</li>
            <li> I use Rapidlash regularly and have for several years,  and it really does lengthen eyelashes and adds some fullness as well,  nothing else I have used even comes close.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Chinese and I have short stubby and straight lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m halfway through my third tube, and my eyelashes are short again, and rather straight.  </li>
            <li> Be consistent with your daily applications and you will be batting those LONG eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Perhaps more now than ever, although they are not as thick yet as I&#x27;d like them yet, and you wouldn&#x27;t necessarily notice them longer without mascara if you weren&#x27;t paying close attention</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect fast results, it&#x27;s a slow process but worth it.</li>
            <li> I used to have individual perma lashes on and off for several years and it has left my natural lashes bald in many spots and very very brittle and thin.</li>
            <li> My lashes only seem a little darker, so at first the difference wasn&#x27;t noticeable until I started wearing mascara a little more regularly.</li>
            <li> I would only ever stick with Latisse or an exact generic formulation in the future.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I notice a big difference with no makeup on, but when I put mascara on, wow!</li>
            <li> Then all of a sudden - wow!  </li>
            <li> I had some eye irritation but nothing major, no discoloration as some have reported.</li>
            <li> I noticed a major difference in my eyelashes within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> A couple of weeks later, my brows were back to normal~ phew!</li>
            <li> It seems to work on some people and not other.</li>
            <li> My brows paid the price and have become a source of major annoyance.  </li>
            <li> I know I started to loose lashes because how much I use mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> there have been spots where I would constantly loose lashes, which really gave me VISIBLE holes in my lashes when I put mascara on.</li>
            <li> The only drawback that I&#x27;ve noticed is the first 2 weeks of use left my right eyelid a brownish color and slightly puffy but after using another week, the color and puffyness seems to have improved so it must have been an initial reaction to the serum.</li>
            <li> Rapidlash is also easy to put on , You just have the little brush that goes back in the bottle, simple no fuss.</li>
            <li> Have used other products like City Lash with modest results but this stuff really does work.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased Rapidlash Serum about two years ago and after using it for a little over a month, I did see a marked improvement in my thin, light colored lashes.  </li>
            <li> For some reason, my right eye&#x27;s lashes is growing faster than my left eye, but it&#x27;s not an extremely noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> That product worked very well, but had very little product in the tube so there wasn&#x27;t much bang for the buck</li>
            <li> I had a bad day and decided it was a great time to do my brows.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what is wrong with this product, cause I&#x27;ve used it before and the result was amazing.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product but saw amazing results after 1-2 months of nightly use.</li>
            <li> I barely have any and have been, to the chagrin of my spouse, considering eyebrow tatoo-ing.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really noticeable when wet</li>
            <li> My bottom lashes which were barely visible are growing too.</li>
            <li> especially when Amazon offers it for under $26.</li>
            <li> I stopped using the Rapidlash and the next morning marked improvement.  </li>
            <li> I started using Rapidlash on both my eyelashes and on my brows and after 6 weeks my lashes have completely grown back in and are longer than before.</li>
            <li> I am only 20 years old, by the way.  </li>
            <li> and when it got here the box was closed but it was all written on and very wrinkly if that makes sence.</li>
            <li> I read reviews of different serums and was really surprised with the ones for Rapidlash.</li>
            <li> Can barely get it out.  </li>
            <li> I could barely even tell I had eyelashes,</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me but the plus side it causes no irritation or minimal unlike latisse</li>
            <li> far I haven&#x27;t noticed anything, I started putting it on my upper lashes as well.</li>
            <li> No regrets here.</li>
            <li> but it is definitely an improvement on my old blah lashes.  </li>
            <li> I barely started using so</li>
            <li> I barely started to see some length after almost 8 weeks.  </li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes (eyelids &amp; under eyes) was even red and sensitive.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to see completely changed lashes in 2 weeks because you are actually growing lashes!</li>
            <li> Note that I had also been continuing to apply Rapidlash LIBERALLY (which made application a bigger pain in the derriere because the teeny tiny wand only picks up so much product to begin with).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> and I even had bare spots.  </li>
            <li> It irritated my eyes and made my eyelid near the lash line go from red to a bruised purple.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for nearly a month and can definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li> I have actually made a pic every week and so far i can see NO change .I</li>
            <li> the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i stopped it for couple of days and used it again, but this time no burning &amp; no redness in my eyes, that is because i was careful not to put the solution inside my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> yet I barely ever wear makeup</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t theatrically long, but they are naturally and NOTICEABLY long, and very flattering.</li>
            <li> It took 2 months to see any results (which were barely noticeable).</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and blue eyes</li>
            <li> I took several \\&quot;before\\&quot; photos and made a mental note of exactly where my lashes went to on my eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> 5th day they were slightly red, and the 6th they were back to normal.</li>
            <li> Well, couple months later, my lashes have gone back to their normal length and thickness.</li>
            <li> I used this exactly as instructed, daily for 8 weeks, and there was absolutely no difference in the length, thickness or otherwise appearance of my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> old woman who has had short, thin lashes for most of my life.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> It is kind of uncomfortable at the beginning</li>
            <li> I used to love those people with long and thick eyelashes..</li>
            <li> This is a product for which I have paid full retail in the past.</li>
            <li> I used to have nice eyelashes, but after getting fake eyelashes put on at a salon, that all changed.</li>
            <li> The end result is well worth those few seconds.  </li>
            <li> Now they are fully grown still somewhat thin but still so much better.</li>
            <li> I love this product my eyelashes are thicker and darker and I always had thin brown/blonde eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even tried lash extensions which were nice but temporary and expensive.</li>
            <li> I have always had nice long lashes but with age they were not as thick or as long.</li>
            <li> I had tried using false eyelashes twice and noticed that when they were removed they removed most of my lashes.</li>
            <li> I rated this product a 4 instead of a 5 because I developed these little red bumps/zit-looking things around my eye sockets right after I started using the product</li>
            <li> I can definitely see new hair growth especially on my lower lashes.</li>
            <li> It seems that everytime a product is new and improved, it is totally ruined and never works the same again.</li>
            <li> As long as you aren&#x27;t one of those reviewers who experience extreme irritation, a bit of early stage itchiness is worth the results, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes had started to fall out on one eye with bald spots and the other would break after wetting to a certain length.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an impatient person but you can definitely see quick results with this product.</li>
            <li> The new ones that have been nourished with Rapid Lash, are stronger and mine were almost twice as long, and CURLY.  </li>
            <li> first then the black mascara.</li>
            <li> me just say, the first week and a half I wanted to cry and give up on Rapidlash because my lashes started thinning (I could literally feel the loss of the conditioning from stopping L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s lash serum) and falling out.</li>
            <li> There was some slight itching at first</li>
            <li> the first week I used it, I did have some slight itching and irritation along my eye lids, but that did go away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for exactly a month and half.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate that you have to open the box to see the expired date but make sure you do it!  </li>
            <li> By twelve weeks, my lashes are longer and super dense (no more bald patches).  </li>
            <li> No more bold spots on my eyebrows and it made my eyelashes longer.</li>
            <li> Showed it to my eye doctor who confirmed this is the same as product used for high pressure in eyes that side effect is thick long lashes.do not put the drops in your eye!</li>
            <li> (I USE IT EVERY OTHER NIGHT), IT REALLY HELPS.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may try it again using it very sparingly and every other night or two</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 48 and naturally have dark eyelashes that are fairly short and straight.  </li>
            <li> BECAUSE I LOOKED A HOT MESS.</li>
            <li> I finally feel comfortable not wearing fake eyelashes after using this consistently for a couple months.</li>
            <li> (I wish I had appreciated all these little things when I was young).  </li>
            <li> you want the long, dark, full lashes of your youth, find a picture of yourself from way back then, and feel greatful that you even have eyelashes...</li>
            <li> Needless to say, the eyelashes pulled out my own during the removal process and left me barely with any eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not AMAZING and going to magically make your lashes super thick and long</li>
            <li> like i said in the beginning i saw little lashes growing out almost immediately after i start using this, the bald spot on both my under eyelashes have already been filled in, the new lashes are still not as long as the other ones</li>
            <li> I wanted that over-plucked look that was so popular for many years (which looked terrible on everyone, by the way.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I would get more dramatic results.</li>
            <li> While the product appeared clear as it came out of the tube, I noticed a reddish discoloration on a portion of the white plastic barrel directly above the brush.  </li>
            <li> Only long lashes not thick</li>
            <li> On the third day of usage I developed red oozing eyes</li>
            <li> They havent had the dark circle problem or the red irritated eyes for the first while.</li>
            <li> I  just have to be careful not to use too much or get in eye as it will irritate my eye the following day.&lt;br /&gt;Really improves length and thickness of eyelashes.</li>
            <li> (natural blonde my lashes are white).</li>
            <li> I will most likely keep using this product, however, if I see that there are worse side effects, I will discontinue use, and inform everyone through review.</li>
            <li> I also put it on my brows and they look way more fuller and defined, they say 1 bottle lasts 2 months, it probably does, but in the beginning I was so freaking out I kept putting it on a few times a day, they say it won&#x27;t help, so don&#x27;t waste it.</li>
            <li> and my eyes were a little irritated the first week.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> The first couple of days i did experience a little bit of irritation around my eyes</li>
            <li> When I first started using the product, I felt a little stinging along my lash line.</li>
            <li> I have to say i noticed little hair growing out on a bald spot on my bottom lash in as little as 2 days, the end of my top lashes were growing longer in about 3-4 days, i didn&#x27;t expect such a rapid growth from this product</li>
            <li> First, my &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; lashes began to look a little thicker.</li>
            <li> , so maybe these new lashes will just grow long enough eventually to blend in with the ones I already have.</li>
            <li> I tried another cheaper lash growth mavala which seemed to barely make lashes look alittle stronger, but this one makes a bigger difference.  </li>
            <li> Now when I wear mascara, my lashes look long and lush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give it at least 16 weeks to determine the full effect</li>
            <li> i have noticed longer lashes after a few weeks of using the first bottle.</li>
            <li> I am getting married in a few months</li>
            <li> My lashes were becoming so thin with age, so I decided to give this product a try.  </li>
            <li> It took about a few months to start seeing results, and it worked really well!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on Rapidlash before I purchased, so I was willing to wait a few weeks for results.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this serum was going to give me incredibly full and thick lashes.</li>
            <li> BUT I&#x27;m really scared of all these stories of lashes falling out 3, 6, 9 months down the road.  </li>
            <li> i shacked and put it upside down, but nothing came out, very odd.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used prescription eyelash growers with excellent results, but I started using Rapidlash because it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have seen extreme growth on both my upper and lower lashes, This product really works it actually grow your lashes.</li>
            <li> have very &#x27;average&#x27; lashes, light brown in color and of average length and thickness.</li>
            <li> the ones that were half the size were really</li>
            <li> They seem thicker although I know hair follicles cannot be created, but they also seem much longer and healthier with less falling.  </li>
            <li> I used Lilash in the past and that stuff REALLY works, wish I could find the old version before they changed formula.</li>
            <li> But after using this for a month, my eyelashes have fully grown back in and they are so long and lush.</li>
            <li> I definitely noticed a difference in my lashes after the first few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick lashes ( they finally filled in and got denser).</li>
            <li> and I lost a few more of them then usual.</li>
            <li> I have really good lashes anyway, but now they are crazy long....</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick lashes naturally but have been experiencing some breakage from curling, so I stopped wearing all eye make up and ordered this,</li>
            <li> And if that doesn&#x27;t help you, find some easy to adhere false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is you have to be very diligent about using this every single night, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t seem like your lashes are as long the next morning.</li>
            <li> I finished my tiny Latisse bottle, seeing less positive effects and actually losing eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Started seeing positive results in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that I will end up with lush, long and darker lashes as my friend did, however, she did use a much more expensive product.  </li>
            <li> The health of my eyes is really something I don&#x27;t want to mess with</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had to use a lash curler before because my lashes were not long enough</li>
            <li> Not sure it makes lashes longer because mine are already long but definitely makes them stronger and keeps them full.</li>
            <li> once I applied in generously, like really wet lashes, WOW!</li>
            <li> With mascara, they are starting to look crazy long, but I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s really good mascara or this stuff making a difference.</li>
            <li> Before, I barely had any hair on my left brow and was annoyed at having to pencil in my brows which usually never looked quite right</li>
            <li> It was not they typical red, rashy itch, but was very persistent.  </li>
            <li> I saw the good reviews for this and decided to give it a try as it was MUCH less expensive.  </li>
            <li> but that has sort of settled down and now my lashes are thick and lovely and back to where they used to be.</li>
            <li> I actually use it to clear up some dry skin that occasionally starts developing on my eyelid at the lash line.  </li>
            <li> I have fine , thin, lashes, all my life, and this enhancing serum</li>
            <li> Just have a little patience, this stuff really does work.</li>
            <li> It might be a little bit thicker but nothing really change in length.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend applying the serum really close to the inside of your eye (where your eye meets your nose) because I started feeling a little tender when I got too close.</li>
            <li> I just read someone&#x27;s blog saying they developed the same problem and it turned out to be permanent dry eye!</li>
            <li> The only effect (if I&#x27;m not imagining a placebo effect) is my lashes seem a little stronger, I don&#x27;t notice them coming out as much as I used to.  </li>
            <li> and I still have a little bit of solution left in my tube so the product goes a pretty long way if you are just using it on your lashes.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are now so long and thick, that I have stopped wearing mascara unless I am dressing for special occasions.  </li>
            <li> So, after reading the good and bad reviews on Amazon about Rapidlash Eyelash Serum, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I was wary to try the product because of the potential side effects but I have experienced none of the negative side effects (brown discoloration of the eyelid and iris of the eye, pain, and falling out of eyelashes).</li>
            <li> Last week I had a few random lashes which were much longer than the others, however they all seem to have caught up and evened out better now.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Loreal Paris lash serum with the blue lid, gold middle and clear bottom and the Rimmel London Lash accelerator serum with the lime green metallic lid, gold middle and clear tube.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are now at least twice as full and long and are even darker.</li>
            <li> but if you already have thick eye lashes and just want to lengthen it then this product might be worth a try.</li>
            <li> I apply the product nightly to the base of my lashes making sure that some of the product actually touches right where the lash and the lid meet.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought the broken ones were new growth, but after using it for over 4 months, I came to realize how damaged they were.</li>
            <li> obviously not any apparent difference since i havent used it for very long.</li>
            <li> Did not notice any itching/burning reaction or other allergic issues, and I usually have pretty sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Since my eyelashes were in such poor shape it was difficult to determine at first if my eyelashes were simply growing back on their own or if Rapidlash was working.</li>
            <li> Noticed a definite positive difference in my eyebrows, not sure on the lashes yet but I will keep using this product.</li>
            <li> Works great, lashes will have a two week period or so every few months where they thin a little, but for the price and safety, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not certain if it&#x27;s because they really think this or because I&#x27;m asking them every other day if they are.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and was concerned about some other reviews but decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I mean, I have the thing already, right?</li>
            <li> As others have noted, it does require consistent application for at least four weeks, but the tube can last for months.</li>
            <li> It really works, I was skeptical at first but the product proved itself with no problems</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but results really did begin to show within about 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> The only draw back is, you have to continue using this product to maintain long lashes.</li>
            <li> I have been using the same bottle for about six weeks and haven&#x27;t run out yet, so I don&#x27;t know how long the tube will last.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like say, false lashes, but it looks natural and pretty.</li>
            <li> Really useful, I get long and thick</li>
            <li> Be realistic, if you are seeking to obtain dramatic looking false lashes this product will not give you that kind of result.</li>
            <li> I had used Smart Lash in the past and decided to try this one instead when I ran out.  </li>
            <li> I am shocked at how fast my lashes grew and how full they are in just 1 month!  </li>
            <li> I thought at first that I was experiencing the brown discoloration on my skin that has been discussed here, but I don&#x27;t have any now so might just have been watching too hard for it.  </li>
            <li> Now that its been over a month since ive used this, the growth in length have slowed down a bit as i haven&#x27;t notice dramatic length improvement anymore, but theres still little new hairs popping out here and there which made my eyelashes look much more fuller overall.</li>
            <li> I realized that right from the beginning when I would get up in the morning I would feel shaky all over my body.  </li>
            <li> I bought Rapid Lash as an alternative to destroying my eyelashes with fake lashes and have been pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li> it worked for me at least with the first bottle.</li>
            <li> Mine are about average naturally, but this has made the thicker and longer.  </li>
            <li> Somewhat skeptical, but I have been plagued in my 50&#x27;s by lashes getting sparser and eyebrows becoming patchy.</li>
            <li> Product works really well if you get enough in container to last at least a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> However, it took me that long to figure out that the Rapidlash was causing some big problems.  </li>
            <li> the operator said they would not last as long because I would pull on my eyelids to put in my lenses.  </li>
            <li> but I left it all night long.</li>
            <li> I only give RapidLash 4 out of 5 stars, because I think that 4 weeks are a long time to see result,</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t use long enough to see results.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried long enough to know if this product works on eyelash growth.</li>
            <li> You will NOT regret buying this, just hang in there long enough to see the results!</li>
            <li> I had lashes this long and think only at the age of 18!</li>
            <li> they are a bit friendlier in price; they they seem to last for a long time.</li>
            <li> this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two months later with nightly use, my lashes are so long that they almost touch my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> My co-working actually asked me what mascara I was using to make my lashes so long.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t last for long.  </li>
            <li> I have to say Rapidlash will be part of my daily routine for as long as it&#x27;s in the market.  </li>
            <li> though she has not used it long enough to tell if it has helped her lashes to grow.</li>
            <li> I was actually going to stop using it until I noticed one really long eyelash on my lower lid.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Bimat and within a couple of weeks my lashes get so long that they hit my upper eye lids.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are now as long as they were when I was younger.</li>
            <li> Started using this product again and after a couple of weeks they were back to the long length they were when I stopped using this product.  </li>
            <li> Long lashes don&#x27;t matter if all anyone notices is how red my eyes are.</li>
            <li> After about two -three weeks my lashes are so long I need only swipe my mascara once or twice to darken them.  </li>
            <li> Two weeks later, my minor miracle happened.</li>
            <li> My eyes looked totally different with long lashes</li>
            <li> I can see the new hairs in my brows, they are coming in a little darker.</li>
            <li> and they fell out a little bit at first, but I continued and this product seems to have made my eyelashes stronger and less likely to fall out.</li>
            <li> I could see the AMAZING difference, it looks just like when I wear my expensive false lashes made of natural hair!!!  </li>
            <li> After several months of inconsistent use followed by about 3 weeks of daily use, I still see very little difference as far as my skimpy Asian lashes go.</li>
            <li> The tip of the applicator is a small thin brush and was very easy to get to the &amp;#34;bald&amp;#34; areas of my brows.</li>
            <li> I must admit, I was very skeptical, but after reading all the positive reviews, I definitely thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> lashes, NO BARE SPOTS!  </li>
            <li> They have not exactly been very short, nor were they very long... not too blond, but not very dark either.</li>
            <li> They were extremely dry and hurt to keep open.</li>
            <li> The last tube I received from another retailer, I noticed immediately that my eyes were really dry and bloodshot and still are.  </li>
            <li> The effect is not spectacular so far, but I&#x27;m in my early fifties, so to me</li>
            <li> My eyebrows have been very sparse for at  least 6 years, and my eyelashes have been getting shorter and thinner for several years.</li>
            <li> I used all different kinds of mascaras, cheap to mega expensive.  </li>
            <li> The only cons I can think of is my eyes feel dry in the morning when I wake up.</li>
            <li> However, I do see a noticeable difference in my eyebrows which was so unexpected in light of the disappointing performance with my lashes.</li>
            <li> The burning is much less frequent now.</li>
            <li> It is slightly longer but not to the point where I&#x27;m like WOW.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this product I had used a similarly priced one for eight weeks with no results (until the tube was empty).</li>
            <li> They curl back and touch my skin w/ my eyes open wide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days but it has made my eyes completely bloodshot.</li>
            <li> At first I was very skeptical but after just 3 weeks of use I started to notice a difference Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> and they said that I looked pretty because of the thick and long eyelashes...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t create stellar results of ridiculously long or luxuriously thick lashes, but fills in spaces where I had no growth at all.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m quick to pass along the secret.  </li>
            <li> No new growth, thickness, or extending length of current lashes.</li>
            <li> this helped my eyebrow hair grow a bit longer, no new growth and t no extra growth or length on my lashes.</li>
            <li> Although this products does what it claims--at least for eyelash growth--it has major side effects, especially if one has sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> When my long lashes eventually fell out and the Lilash expired I looked for a replacement (apparently it&#x27;s not sold in the US anymore).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to contacts I previously wore infrequently but now must wear daily because my thick, strong eyelashes push my glasses down my nose.</li>
            <li> Although I have tried other products that take less time to work, they are far more expensive.  </li>
            <li> Before this one I tried allure md ( i think thats what its called), it 1asts double the price and last only half the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several other brands with the same results, so</li>
            <li> The eye doctor did not think it was from mascara or eyelash extensions but the glue always did itch a little and that infection took three weeks to clear.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who uses it and had just a little bit of redness, but if you have sensitive eyes or skin, I would not use this product.</li>
            <li> Now I put just a little mascara and my lashes look so natural</li>
            <li> Slightly irritating to the eyes at first, but it works!</li>
            <li> My doctor is also not the only one to have said that the active ingredients in the two are similar.    </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do much, may have made my eyelashes a little longer, but not worth the uncomforted itching all the time.</li>
            <li> About a week later I noticed I DID actually have a little extra growth.</li>
            <li> It took at least 8 weeks but when it worked it really worked.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to use it since it is such an important area such as the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I had dark circles under my eyes and my upper lids got swollen and red.</li>
            <li> I had wanted to give the first one I bought to a friend as a gift but being late and crushed I could not.</li>
            <li> I had some minor redness and itchiness</li>
            <li> Within 2 months, they were twice as long as they had been since I was in my 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I have been amazed at how long my lashes have become....</li>
            <li> My lashes are already somewhat long</li>
            <li> It works , not nearly as fast as similar products I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait untill 4-6 weeks if my eyelashes are this long already who knows how long they will get.</li>
            <li> I stuck it out for the second night, and swept it on my lash line carefully.</li>
            <li> Now, when I put mascara on, my lashes are just gorgeously long.</li>
            <li> The second time I bought this product it seemed that the item was almost on empty.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes don&#x27;t stay long when I&#x27;m not using it</li>
            <li> It took a really long time to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I never had long lashes</li>
            <li> Everyone comments on how long my eyelashes are.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how long my lashes are.  </li>
            <li> they aren&#x27;t that long now</li>
            <li> Have to wait because last night I discovered it was empty.  </li>
            <li> when I apply mascara I am amazed at how long they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My lashes are twice as long now.</li>
            <li> The tube lasts a long time...</li>
            <li> Strange.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been known for my long fluttery lashes, nor have they ever been sparse.</li>
            <li> Works well on brows too, but I noticed that my eyebrows get too long a fall out.</li>
            <li> My lashes are on the long side to begin with and this made them even longer, but not thicker.</li>
            <li> They were short/medium length and now they are without a doubt long.</li>
            <li> and I asked how their lashes got so long</li>
            <li> But there are minor side affects if you pay attention.</li>
            <li> Now they are so long they bind when I am sleeping.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> How I manage to get them so long, how I avoid clumps and fan them out.</li>
            <li> I refuse to put on semi permanent lash extensions which end up destroying your lashes completely.</li>
            <li> your eyelashes are beautifully long...</li>
            <li> but after using Rapidlash I can notice how long my eyelashes are even without mascara and with</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time..</li>
            <li> My eyelashes long out, and begin to grow.</li>
            <li> I havent been keeping track of how long i been using this</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product as long as you don&#x27;t expect a miracle&lt;br /&gt;Overnight.</li>
            <li> Mine getting so long, I have to take a break for a while.  </li>
            <li> Considered Latisse for a long time but was too scared to use it, because of all of the disclaimers.</li>
            <li> but they are probably 3 times as long as they have ever been.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my lashes have ever been this long, ever.  </li>
            <li> Long lashes for sure.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> they were extremely long.</li>
            <li> As long as I use it, my lashes stay on my lids and are fuller and a bit longer than without.</li>
            <li> The eyelash grows not as long as I imagine.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product for as long as its in the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had never had lashes this long in my life.</li>
            <li> /&gt;About a week later, I got a small white bump on the upper lash line of my left eyelid.</li>
            <li> and you must be careful to only apply it to the lash line.</li>
            <li> I had bald spots in the center third of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product, even though it took twice as long to work for me.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use it indefinitely as long as the results stay.</li>
            <li> 3 ml lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My lashes had gotten rough and were falling out--this stuff conditioned them and helped them get back into growing.</li>
            <li> long version:</li>
            <li> I still have some left in the tube, so I will continue to use until the tube is completely empty.  </li>
            <li> and I have long eyelashes now.  </li>
            <li> Been using it every night and can&#x27;t believe how long my lashes are getting.</li>
            <li> My lashes were twice as long.  </li>
            <li> it did make my lashes about 30% longer w/ nightly use for almost a month, not as long as the Lilash but still noticeable</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t get fuller, but because they are so long, with mascara they do look thicker.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is something that is unavoidable, because I&#x27;ve heard anything from face washes to makeup products stop reacting with your face after using for a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a guy with lighter eyelashes that weren&#x27;t so long, until I started using Rapidlash.</li>
            <li> I hope and expect it will continue as long as I use it.</li>
            <li> I just want to have long lashes and volume.</li>
            <li> as long as my lashes keep improving.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re growing but you have to keep using eyelash enhancement products to keep the lashes long.</li>
            <li> I waited too long to return.  </li>
            <li> and so so so long.</li>
            <li> Because they are so long, the corner lashes often get tangled.</li>
            <li> I saw a my lashes longer than before after 4 weeks from using this prodect , i will continue using it and see how long it will grow .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent 5x that on various brow pencils.</li>
            <li> cuz I alr had long lashes, but seems to work well</li>
            <li> My lashes are LONG now.</li>
            <li> I am so surprised this works as well as it does, I was nervous that I was going to waste my money.</li>
            <li> my eyelashes do not stay long</li>
            <li> Please note that if you want this product be prepared to use it long term</li>
            <li> I have only seen minimal improvement for the eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I noticed the results after 1 month when my friends start giving me compliments on my long lashes.</li>
            <li> truly helps your lashes grow long</li>
            <li> Key is to apply the solution to the base of your lashes on the TOP lid only - where the lashes meet your skin - from outside of eye to inner corner.  </li>
            <li> (if it&#x27;s not clear, I&#x27;m being dramatic--can&#x27;t help my sarcasm sometimes).</li>
            <li> it causes slight discomfort but nothing major.</li>
            <li> I was getting down to an almost bare lash line -  </li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde with slightly less than average lashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60+ and never have had great lashes, but over the last few years they&#x27;ve gotten worse due to trying extensions and false strip lashes.</li>
            <li> This works so much better, and is much less expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rapid Lash (less than religiously, mind you) for about a month now can see a definite lash enhancement.</li>
            <li> I tried the expensive $120 one from the doctors office and this works better (I think) at a price that is so much less.</li>
            <li> especially since it is less than a fourth of the price for Latisse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent my money on other more expensive products (except latisse)</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed as all the reviews said I would see amazing results fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got those lashes that stick straight out, are thin and certainly not long.</li>
            <li> My lashes are LONG!  </li>
            <li> I got also purchased for my mother who had lost her eyebrows and lashes (due to menopause) and she actually has lashes now!!!</li>
            <li> Well by the 6th week I had to quit using it because my eyelashes were so long that I could not wear my glasses because they hit the lens!  </li>
            <li> I also saw similar complaints in other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it this summer also, and gave my eyelashes a \\&quot;rest\\&quot; from the eyelash curler, and couldn&#x27;t believe how long they grew!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t vouch for any other lash products, this is the only one I have used</li>
            <li> You only have to use it once every other day or so.</li>
            <li> Due to an inflamatory eye condition, I have been on several eye medications and the combination caused my eyelashes to fall out.</li>
            <li> I was not willing to risk the side effects of meds such as Latisse, so I thought I would give RapidLash a try.</li>
            <li> my friends are asking me how I got my long lashes!</li>
            <li> The other thing I noticed is that my eyelids started looking darker and growing tiny hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing it from other sites but decided to give Amazon a shot because of the low price.</li>
            <li> I think everyone have a different reaction with this product since ive read some of the other reviews</li>
            <li> there is no feel when I apply it in contrast to other similar products that you can feel what was applied.</li>
            <li> and my eyelashes are so long!</li>
            <li> Rapidlash does not make your eyes burn or turn them red unlike the other eyelash enhancing products.</li>
            <li> they are so long!</li>
            <li> but boy she has extremely long lashes now!</li>
            <li> When I first heard of Rapid Lash, I was a little skeptical that it would actually work, especially since other products such as Latisse required a doctor&#x27;s prescription and were much more expensive.  </li>
            <li> Due to 10+ years of over plucking my brows have frayed and grown in different directions.</li>
            <li> everyone keeps commenting on my long lashes!</li>
            <li> lashes get so long I need to trim them!</li>
            <li> In 6 weeks, I have long lashes!</li>
            <li> I have been using it regularly and unlike the other product, I don&#x27;t seem to be noticing any difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to the other serum.</li>
            <li> I have tried this and several other Lash Growth products.  </li>
            <li> I have tried one other lash growth product, Jan Marini&#x27;s Age Intervention Lash, 2nd generation formula.  </li>
            <li> I recently started to lose a lot of hair (head, eyelashes, eyebrows) due to stress and environment.</li>
            <li> The downside for me was that when I stopped using this every night, I noticed my lashes returning to their original sad state.</li>
            <li> Not to an extreme, but I could definitely notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I already had long lashes, but thin enough that it took 4-5 coats of mascara and to much time in the morning to get the look I wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had lashes this long in all of my 45 years!  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes seem to get tangled a bit now, so putting on mascara is a little more difficult.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think much of it, but a couple of days later a very painful stye developed on my right eyelid.</li>
            <li> They are very long.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes are very long.  </li>
            <li> No to very minor irritation was observed.</li>
            <li> Then allow to dry.  </li>
            <li> Pat face and eyes dry ,</li>
            <li> Do my hair and by then its dry.</li>
            <li> so they are kinda dry because it can run on to side of eyes and hair can grow there also...</li>
            <li> After using it for three days, I have intensely dry and irritated eyes.</li>
            <li> I tried to like this product, but my eyes became dry and scratchy after 1 week.</li>
            <li> when dry it leaves a crust</li>
            <li> I am serious, it really does work.</li>
            <li> She said to keep using it because the active ingredients in both are the same.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: Wow, by mid to late November</li>
            <li> but I started using regular mascara on my upper lashes during the day because I read that helps protect your lashes from the harsh weather.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Likely why active ingredient isopropyl cloprostenate is no longer used in this product and why it doesn&#x27;t work anymore.  </li>
            <li> so my lashes are short, straight and thin.  </li>
            <li> People have asked me if I have fake eyelashes added into my eyelashes because they are so long and full now.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully after a few more weeks, I&#x27;ll get that false lash effect!</li>
            <li> have several girlfriends who had spent a fortune on the real hair false long eyelashes over and over...</li>
            <li> , I have new hair growth long an thick .</li>
            <li> Use it every single night&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it for over 2 months, applying it every single night</li>
            <li> Used every single night for five weeks - didn&#x27;t see any results.  </li>
            <li> Apply thin coat carefully to lower eyelids right where your lashes grow, if desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To make a long story short, my lashes are slightly longer and thicker.  </li>
            <li> In other words no matter how much I curled and layered on the mascara, my eyelashes were hard to see.</li>
            <li> Does not grow or thicken lashes - complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> I would like to preface that I am the stereotypical Asian that has short, stumpy, straight eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product has made them not only longer, but they are dark lashes.</li>
            <li> I put on a thin layer every night before I go to bed and within maybe 3-5 days there was a pretty noticable difference on the condition of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes were quite thin; however, thanks to Rapidlash, my lashes are filling in!</li>
            <li> , I loose a lot of lashes..</li>
            <li> I just hope if I stop using it, I wont loose my lashes.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and said what the hell, I have nothing to loose.</li>
            <li> I am down to short stubs and am so upset.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only down side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been jealous of people with long eyelashes!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second tube, and after a little over 4 months, all my lashes are really long.</li>
            <li> The next morning there will be small, white, dry pieces on my eye.</li>
            <li> The product is a little irritating to my eyes, but not bad.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s 30 bucks but wasn&#x27;t taking any chances, today I curled and only put a little on the tips, my lashes looked crazy long, full and winged out!</li>
            <li> It may be that a month and a half of usage may not be enough time, hopefully I&#x27;m not prematurely &#x27;judging&#x27; but.....</li>
            <li> Using Rapidlash at the same frequency I had been using Li Lash, I lost ALL of the growth and results I had seen in previous months.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at the idea of a lash growing serum, but after all the advertisement and friend&#x27;s comments, I decided to give it a try, especially Rapidlash is quite cheap compared to latisse or some others.</li>
            <li> Now that I won&#x27;t be wasting any product on the brow area, I expect to get a solid 8 weeks, if not more, from my second tube.</li>
            <li> have long thick lashes that wing out naturally.</li>
            <li> So I go back to use my previous serum.</li>
            <li> a few weeks later I noticed the long eyelashes has gone</li>
            <li> If it were possible to rate less than one star</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied to only one eye as a test, and it does seem to show a slight difference.  </li>
            <li> Now, a month and a half later my lashes exceed the length they ever were before getting extensions.  </li>
            <li> I wear makeup and mascara on the daily; however, I am going to Cancun in a month and a half</li>
            <li> Also I only paid half of what costs elsewhere like CVS.</li>
            <li> I finally noticed the results in a big way this past weekend when I applied my Benefit mascara.</li>
            <li> It is not very easy to apply since you have to apply it just above the lashes.</li>
            <li> Lashes are growing, especially the really small ones in the inner corners of my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Now I will be obsessed with watching them grow back, but I guess everyone needs a hobby.  ;)</li>
            <li> The mascara you use is important as well, but whenever I get mistaken for wearing false lashes, I&#x27;m usually wearing just Lash Blast.</li>
            <li> They look natural, long and thick and they&#x27;re staying that way.</li>
            <li> And my eyes felt very dry and hurt alot.</li>
            <li> However, i was expecting them to grow really long like other customers had claimed, but they didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work too, because my lashes are short and don&#x27;t grow fast at all.  :(</li>
            <li> especially since, now that it has been a little more than a month, I am unable to return this product because I am not satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> I still have the same sparse eyelashes only a little bit longer and for some odd reasons, my eyelashes points out in all direction directions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying this product to my upper and lower lashes every night and even some mornings for at least 3 months now, and my eyelashes are about as short and thin as they were when I first started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried the new masccaras that are suppose to \\&quot;extend and magnify\\&quot; your lashes, but the mascara was so thick and heavy it actually pulled out my lashes!</li>
            <li> EDIT: less than 2 wks after posting my initial review, and continued faithful application - alas it really started to work.</li>
            <li> I have used it before as I have a medical issue that causes me to loose my eye brows and this works, it takes a few weeks</li>
            <li> Unlike latise which was such a pain to get on, with the the dropper and all the little brushes one for each eye.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only a little bit</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not drastic but it is a little noticeable.</li>
            <li> I would recommend only using it at night because sometimes when you wake up its tried on your eyelashes and looks a little like glue.</li>
            <li> Took me about 2 months to see several strands got little longer than the rest.</li>
            <li> Tried for two months and saw little to no change, except that my lashes seems to grow in all different directions.  </li>
            <li> After using this for a little over a month, my eyelashes went back to their pre-latisse length.</li>
            <li> I feel like my eyelashes definitely got a little fuller and longer.</li>
            <li> they will go back to the same original length :(</li>
            <li> My eye color looks a little different in the after because I am wearing contact lenses.</li>
            <li> but my eyes got a little red and irritated when I did that for a week-</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous when i saw on the package that it was only studied on like 45  people.  </li>
            <li> When i put on mascara my top lashes can actually touch my eyebrow if i frown a little which SHOCKED me.</li>
            <li> the only problem that i have with the product is that it is hard to tell if I applied the necessary amount on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> I had lost most of my lashes after a bad extension experience.</li>
            <li> It even filled in areas of my eyebrows that had been sparse and take years to grow back after a bad waxing job.</li>
            <li> Also my favorite mascara started looking all ugly.</li>
            <li> They sometimes were red, and lately I noticed what seemed like tiny blisters.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to put any eyeshadow over it, or the shadow will just absorb it, and not work.  </li>
            <li> Another product that promises big but is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I had eyelash extensions, and since i had a few left</li>
            <li> and I had a lot of empty spaces.  </li>
            <li> I think you just have to be extremely careful that this product does not seep into your eyes.    </li>
            <li> I immediately noticed that my lashes looked healthier but after 4 weeks of use, there is absolutely no difference in the length or fullness of my lashes.</li>
            <li> However a few days ago, I woke up and my eye was horribly red.</li>
            <li> My results appeared faster than expected...</li>
            <li> It gave me pink eye</li>
            <li> But even after a few months they were not growing back and the couple of lashes I would get would fall out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the results only took a few weeks....</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s empty.  </li>
            <li> I spent alot of money on this product for one application.</li>
            <li> I have only used the RapidLash on my eyebrows a few times, so</li>
            <li> Now, the window of opportunity to return it closed.  </li>
            <li> I apply the product carefully, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m getting any into my eyes, but some seepage must be happening.</li>
            <li> This product was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> The longer my eyelashes get the harder it gets to keep on the lash line and not every where else to.</li>
            <li> i bought this product a few weeks ago and have only used it for two weeks.</li>
            <li> It is now the beginning of February and there is absolutely NO doubt that the condition of my eyelashes has improved.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have only had this rapid eyelash enhancing serum a few week.</li>
            <li> After three weeks I have noticed minimal change.</li>
            <li> I have also been careful what I wash my face with.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not a hassle for me as I have added it to my nightly routine and it only adds a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not what I&#x27;ve expected , I say this product</li>
            <li> It takes just a few seconds to apply, so simple.</li>
            <li> me comments everytime I wear make up which is not very often.</li>
            <li> Box came totally crushed</li>
            <li> Not much to say.</li>
            <li> I always get it when my lashes are having a rough time.</li>
            <li> I have been using now for over 8 weeks and have seen absolutely no difference.  </li>
            <li> this was a big waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> From wearing daily mascara, my lashes were damaged and had missing spots.</li>
            <li> I went back into my order and seek a refund, the option for refund was not available for this product.  </li>
            <li> the solution dried up after the second week.</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely no change in my eyelashes using this for over two months.</li>
            <li> Watch carefully.  </li>
            <li> A few months back I had lost almost all my lashes</li>
            <li> I picked up this product with not much hope</li>
            <li> but I expected the growth to be faster,  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist noticed how long and dark they were; she thought I had changed makeup products.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it IMO.</li>
            <li> For me, this was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> My lashes were short and few...</li>
            <li> it is what I expected</li>
            <li> I put a line around my eyelash line at night and after a few weeks noticed that my eyelashes were definitely longer.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews carefully after I bought this eyelash serum.  </li>
            <li> The one I received was empty.</li>
            <li> I re-read instructions and was careful not to get the product in my eyes.</li>
            <li> But be careful:</li>
            <li> Did not really work for me.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It does actually work after a few weeks of routine use.</li>
            <li> I have noticed minimal changes in my eyelash length/thickness.</li>
            <li> I apply it generously (a couple of coats) at the base of my lashes and kind of brush it forward to the tips.</li>
            <li> I guess the effectiveness depends on age, and on how long before treatment hair growth started slowing down.</li>
            <li> Used it 2x, sometimes makes my eye a little bit red but other than that</li>
            <li> This is the first time ever that I have tried any eyelash serum and had previously been hooked on false lashes.</li>
            <li> I mean, I&#x27;m not in Cara Delevigne territory, but it&#x27;s a modest start.</li>
            <li> Then I became sick, and with meds I lost most of the brows I had.</li>
            <li> Now I know I won&#x27;t have model type of eyebrows, but they look better than the ones I had before I became sick.</li>
            <li> After literally 2-3 1/2 maybe less I noticed my eyelashes at the end of my eyes were Long and curl-up</li>
            <li> i will use this stuff for as long as they make it and its way way less money than the prescription eye lash enhancer.</li>
            <li> After a year and a half however the lash lengths were back to their previous condition before use.</li>
            <li> Originally I used Revitalash for about 6 months  and my lashes grew like crazy.  </li>
            <li> id recommend it, but it&#x27;s my little secret ;)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any itch or pink eye or secretions or anything read in other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> At first, it felt a little irritating on my lash line</li>
            <li> Still, as we get older our lashes do thin out.  </li>
            <li> They in no way are so long that they look fake, even with mascara, and no one I know has noticed a difference without me pointing it out, and then maybe I get an, \\&quot;Oh yeeeeaaah!\\&quot; after they really have to look at my lashes...</li>
            <li> As one gets older the eyebrows tend to thin and in my case I think some of my face cream with glycolic acid accidentally got onto one of my eyebrows and</li>
            <li> Thick, natural arch, dark...</li>
            <li> my lashes got so long i have to wear my glasses a little lower on my hose</li>
            <li> You probably won&#x27;t start seeing a major difference for at least 2 months.</li>
            <li> I have had very little eyelashes for several years.  </li>
            <li> The results with  Rapidlash are very subtle, Lash MD results are more dramatic.</li>
            <li> This is easy to apply by simply brushing across the base of your lashes.</li>
            <li> Should have heeded the 60 other reviewers who gave it one star.</li>
            <li> Other brands make me blink like I have ocd.</li>
            <li> Other brands end up flecking my lenses with bat guano.</li>
            <li> Other brands smear my face like a raccoon.</li>
            <li> so I use it every other night.</li>
            <li> I was  skeptical at first on whether it would work well or maybe irritate my eyes, but I hve found that netiher of the issues were a broblem.</li>
            <li> I have not read any other reviews on this product since I purchased it</li>
            <li> After about 5 weeks I saw extremely noticeable results as did everyone else.</li>
            <li> so I was using it every other night</li>
            <li> and I also start applying mascara every other day</li>
            <li> but my lashes haven&#x27;t grown like weeds like some other people</li>
            <li> Shake bottle, apply thin coat on the edge of your eyelids where your lashes grow, starting from inner corner to outer corner, be careful not to get any in your eyes.  </li>
            <li> I used it once a day at night for month to get  results, and the every other day after to sustain it.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long it took to notice effects, but on a few occasions, I did actually use a scissor to trim some lashes that had gotten out of control.</li>
            <li> I also used on my lower lashes and only see a small improvement there.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; since using this for the past several months.  </li>
            <li> Other people have also commented on this...</li>
            <li> then she saw them the other day and couldn&#x27;t believe it</li>
            <li> No discomfort or discoloration that other users have found.</li>
            <li> I wasted a whole month of this stuff because the dumb directions have an illustration that makes it appear that you should apply it to your lids.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other 1-star reviewers who said they received this product and it had already expired months ago.</li>
            <li> Other people have also noticed and made comments.</li>
            <li> And honestly, I only use it a few times a week!</li>
            <li> After almost 3 months of treatment, it is now the other way</li>
            <li> I applied the product as directed on the included package insert and, having used a similar product in the past without irritation or unwanted side effects, can not chalk the irritation up to &amp;#34;user</li>
            <li> I lost of my eyebrows due to my thyroid.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in lieu of latisse-type medications, due to the price of those Rx&#x27;s and also the side effects.</li>
            <li> So after seeing what other people were saying on here, I thought I should try it out.</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t work, it would be only a small investment</li>
            <li> I wish I would have listened to other reviews.</li>
            <li> But I found Rapidlash at a website other than amazon and decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I chose it because of the price and that it does not have the side effects of other lash enhancers.</li>
            <li> I read other 1-star reviews and found others reporting expired dates (@ bottom of tube).</li>
            <li> but that is extremely costly.  </li>
            <li> Considering the costs of other products on the market, Rapidlash is affordable.  </li>
            <li> It did not itch or give me any other side effects.</li>
            <li> It was not a pretty sight.</li>
            <li> I have not used any other product like it.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t irritate like other serums.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical</li>
            <li> I bought this due to the reviews and in hopes that it would lengthen and thicken my eye lashes.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews where people have had some adverse reactions.  </li>
            <li> I tried more expensive STINGING products daily because it was expensive.</li>
            <li> It works and it makes your eyelashes really long if you use it everyday</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> Rapidlash eyelash enhancing serum works without the itching and irritation that I had with other lash enhances.  </li>
            <li> I did not get the darkened appearance other people mentioned.  </li>
            <li> The ends won&#x27;t grow back, and I have a small bald hole where it is supposed to be the widest.  </li>
            <li> And here&#x27;s a tip: Since January, I just use it every other day</li>
            <li> Still using it every other day and pairing it with Ardell.</li>
            <li> and I used it every other night until I got use to it.  </li>
            <li> has commented a few times that my lashes are so long.</li>
            <li> Works the same if not better than Grande Lash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a day, so not sure</li>
            <li> And I recently started applying it on my eyebrows because I have very few hairs</li>
            <li> I used more expensive products in the past, and this out does them all!!</li>
            <li> after 3 weeks or so and after using this for a few months now they are still very long.</li>
            <li> I was using a much more expensive prescription product and got tired of paying $100/+ every time I ran out.  </li>
            <li> Only trouble is that my lashes didn&#x27;t grow in all at once, I did have a few that grew a bit slower, just like hair.  </li>
            <li> user mentioned that the active ingredient of this formulation is a chemical called isopropyl cloprostenate.  </li>
            <li> The active ingredients was taken out  when latisse took them to court.</li>
            <li> I thought that maybe the rubbing and subsequent movement of the entire eye area might be causing this product to shift and become irritating.</li>
            <li> and I hated the reddish brown discoloring of my skin above my top lashes.</li>
            <li> Finally, I have seen no problems with dark stains left behind due to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that my eyelashes are still thin and not thick like I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> I had to discontinue using it due to itching, eye irritation, and the dark under eye circles mentioned by another reviewer.</li>
            <li> I read some other reviews about dark staining around the eyes..</li>
            <li> This product works pretty well and is a lot less expensive than it&#x27;s competitors.  </li>
            <li> Also, the price on Amazon is 50% less expensive than buying it in store in Ulta (which is where I first heard of it).</li>
            <li> seems to work but little irritation with it seems to cause little minor beak out</li>
            <li> After actually using it and going through 2 bottles, I was left with less lashes and the ones I had were broken off.</li>
            <li> Some women say they get results with only using a very small amount, but like I said, when I did that I saw absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking into the black market of foreign online pharmacies...  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, buying this after a friend recommended it (she bought it at CVS for about $50).  </li>
            <li> The item looks legit but when you open it, there hardly any liquid inside.</li>
            <li> I also tried hard to just keep it on the last line.  </li>
            <li> It is a shame, since this product was a less expensive option and had received positive reviews from others.</li>
            <li> I have very thick long eyebrow hairs but short lashes.</li>
            <li> I have no real cons to report; keep it on the base of your top lashes without getting it into your eyes before it dries, otherwise it can sting a little.</li>
            <li> It does sting slightly at times when you apply but very minimal.</li>
            <li> I now have 5 (though they are still SO thin they&#x27;re almost invisible) and have gotten some random super long ones on other parts of my lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some reviews that it makes your eyelid and under eye dark,</li>
            <li> and I probably average 5 to 6 times per week.  </li>
            <li> Its difficult to tell just how much this has increased the length of my lashes, but it has.  </li>
            <li> This small bottle lasted for a long time ...</li>
            <li> The suckers had gone above and beyond their call of duty and were sticking out like a sore thumb.</li>
            <li> I average 50 dollars in gift cards a month</li>
            <li> My eyes looked weird with clumps out, and they thinned a lot too , I bought rapid lash not expecting much</li>
            <li> not worth the money, zero results</li>
            <li> the cause of it is from rapid lash because ive never had dark circles ever.</li>
            <li> If i&#x27;m going to have any complaints about this product it would be the dark circles but longer lashes comes with a price.</li>
            <li> When I went to take the fake eyelashes off, I wind up pulling all of my real eye lashes out.</li>
            <li> My lashes are short AND thin so long lashes are one of my obsessions.</li>
            <li> I thought my eyelids were getting dark and discolored but it turned out to be left-over mascara.</li>
            <li> Once my fake eyelashes fell so did my real ones.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not worth 30 bucks.</li>
            <li> I should have known and stick with the item from Costco for the same price, at least you can return it to costco.</li>
            <li> Did not make them quite as dark</li>
            <li> My eyes lids became dark from using it,  </li>
            <li> Not worth the purchase</li>
            <li> Well, my thought was: If I need a before pic to see a difference it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> So far it hasn&#x27;t done much for lengthening my lashes. :(</li>
            <li> I am 52 with dark brown eyes.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is it gets crusty by the time I wake up in the morning</li>
            <li> if I would of gotten an exchange I wouldn&#x27;t have left a negative return.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about this product is the amount in the container.  </li>
            <li> &amp; unless they change their formula or I suddenly develop a negative reaction, I plan to keep using it.</li>
            <li> Have tried few different brands looking for &amp;#34;something better&amp;#34;, but so far others failed to beat the performance and the price of this one.</li>
            <li> I did not have any dark line on where I have applied the serum for the lashes as I did with another brand, nor did I experience any itchiness.</li>
            <li> The effect is what I would have if I purchased and applied a few false eyelashes and applied only at the outside corners.</li>
            <li> : sometimes lashes grow crooked, but still look thick with mascara.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t hate it, but I didn&#x27;t love it either.</li>
            <li> I got it online for about $120 but retail was far worse at the time.  </li>
            <li> Complete strangers stop me on the street and in the mall to compliment my eyes; one woman asked where I purchased my FALSE eyelashes.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s slowly growing brows back.</li>
            <li> The slight stinging sensation felt at the lash line, however, can be irritating to sensitive individuals.</li>
            <li> When I run my finger over them without mascara, they feel thick and waxy - much less likely to fall out than before.</li>
            <li> I have had to have my lashes trimmed down, because they were growing up to my eye brows.</li>
            <li> I store it upside down, so thebrush will be dragged through the serum when I use the tube.&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li> After the swelling went down, I tested it out again and my eyes swelled up again.</li>
            <li> i thought i&#x27;d give rapid lash a try since all the other brands are WAY over priced!</li>
            <li> quit using it due to the cost of product plus the Dr. Fee to get the prescription!</li>
            <li> about 5 times but its not an extreme itchy sensation just wanting to rob my eyes a little.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used other eyelash enhancing serums, but I know this one works!</li>
            <li> Skip on nights when your eyes are very tired or strained due to other activities or if your eyelids are irritated from new make-up or cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it, but it&#x27;s a little hard to tell whether it&#x27;s actually making the hair grow, or if it&#x27;s just the fact that I&#x27;ve stopped plucking altogether</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they are a little spidery.</li>
            <li> I started losing my eyelashes,  and eyebrows a few years ago due to hypothyroidism.</li>
            <li> There are a few other differences.</li>
            <li> I needed to fill in a missing patch of eyebrow hair,  due to over plucking.  </li>
            <li> I still use every other day and pair it with the Ardell everyday.</li>
            <li> now, ill have to put this on auto-order since I cant live w/out!</li>
            <li> After using Rapid lash my lashes have slightly curled.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Rapidlash because it was about half the cost.  </li>
            <li> Many of my eyelashes and eyebrows fell out last year after I had a terrible bronchial infection that dragged on and on</li>
            <li> It takes less than 30 seconds to apply and it&#x27;s almost like water.  </li>
            <li> I used this product, typically nightly, for two months.  </li>
            <li> but of course, it is a GROWING, not a DARKENING serum, but that&#x27;s just what I think for now, after having used this product for one and a half month..</li>
            <li> Had no lashes previously, and now I do.</li>
            <li> I know it takes \\&quot;4-5 weeks\\&quot;, but being half way through that period</li>
            <li> seriously, i cannot say enough about this product.!    </li>
            <li> I started noticing the change after about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> It is less than 1/2 the price of what Latisse costs and package contains 2.  </li>
            <li> I saw results in less then 30 days.  </li>
            <li> It is cheaper than Latisse but less concentrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product less than a month</li>
            <li> I started using it on my eyebrows which were half grown</li>
            <li> You can find a 2-pack for less at your neighborhood big-box store (C) if you are a member.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product for two and half weeks.</li>
            <li> My mom had given me a half bottle of Lilash to try and I thought eyelash serums were snake oil</li>
            <li> Rapidlash seemed like it a cheaper alternative at half the price of the Lilash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> lashes did seem stronger and less prone to falling out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed a slight difference after about a month</li>
            <li> I keep using it for almost half a month</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes longer and slightly thicker.</li>
            <li> since it was half the price, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Whatever it was, the burning is much less.</li>
            <li> I applied it every night for less than a month.</li>
            <li> and I swear they&#x27;re slightly darker.</li>
            <li> Five and a half weeks ago, Rapidlash appeared in my mailbox.</li>
            <li> After about 3-4 weeks I could tell my lashes were slightly longer.  </li>
            <li> Can I go mascara less as I had hoped?  </li>
            <li> I have to say that it does work because I just started using this product like less than a week.</li>
            <li> I have noticed less lash loss.</li>
            <li> I would say the difference is subtle, but enough that I will continue to purchase it.  </li>
            <li> It did give me a slight curl to some of my lashes, but I do use lash curler.</li>
            <li> also, when I wear it in place of mascara, it&#x27;s lighter, not clumpy, and gives the appearance of *slightly* longer and fuller lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product mainly for eyebrows and eyelashes that wasn&#x27;t as expensive as Latisse.  </li>
            <li> It was so long that I thought that it was no longer attached to my lid and was simply caught in my other lashes, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Not super thick but long</li>
            <li> and it seems like my lashes are a little longer, nothing too dramatic so far</li>
            <li> My second tube (a drugstore purchase) didn&#x27;t work well - even the serum seemed different, so perhaps it was a bad batch, but my eyelashes lost the gains made earlier.</li>
            <li> Tube not full.  </li>
            <li> My daughter, who is blessed with thick and long lashes, may never need this in her lifetime.  </li>
            <li> I have always wanted to have thick and long eyelashes.           </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my lashes thick but did make them quite long.</li>
            <li> They are long and fairly thick compared to what they were to begin with.</li>
            <li> and they were thick and long...</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get the long thick lashes like some of the pictures I saw</li>
            <li> and I still have long, thick lashes.</li>
            <li> after only two weeks of applying a thin layer to the base of my eyelashes, as directed, my lashes were noticeably longer and more</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for 6 weeks now: I still have to use my eyebrow pencil, but I&#x27;ve noticed I have to use it less and less everyday.</li>
            <li> I had thin little lashes that were barely noticeable when i put on mascara but after using this for a little over two months</li>
            <li> People at work compliment my thick brows and long lashed and ask if I am wearing falsies!</li>
            <li> About two months in, my eyes started itching really badly and even became super swollen.</li>
            <li> Its easily covered but annoying when you want to go swimming or are not in the mood to put makeup on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it daily for well over a month with no discernible results--only the dark circles under my eyes have gotten worse.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Rapidlash for my eyebrows for a little over 2 months.</li>
            <li> A little mascara</li>
            <li> I decided to try RapidLash a little over a year ago.  </li>
            <li> , I still see it is growing a little by little.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now, my lashes have gotten a little longer.....</li>
            <li> My lashes seemed longer and a little thicker but not fuller.</li>
            <li> My brows still have some bald spots but the hair seems longer &amp; a little thicker so they aren&#x27;t so noticeable.</li>
            <li> The product does cause my brows to itch a little, but nothing nagging</li>
            <li> Although I received this item in a timely manner, the tube I received contains little or no product.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;dirt\\&quot;-stuff (little morning crumbs)</li>
            <li> I did have a little darkening color on my putter corner of my eye but</li>
            <li> Does not work not worth your money !</li>
            <li> I am now focusing on my lower lashes which were a little scarce.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> Fullness has improved somewhat but not significantly, however existing lashes are thicker and stronger.  </li>
            <li> I notice that they seem to be getting thicker, and maybe even a little longer.</li>
            <li> Had used nightly for months and saw no significant eyelash growth</li>
            <li> They are possibly a little darker</li>
            <li> I saw results as little as 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> lashes are stronger and healthier and maybe a little longer, nothing noticeable.</li>
            <li> A little eye makeup</li>
            <li> They seem a little darker and just a tad bit longer.</li>
            <li> I noticed I started getting little bumps around my eye</li>
            <li> if anything the seem to be a little sparse.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over 2 weeks applying it twice a day (morning before make up and at night before bed).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Noticed a couple of reviews about the product burning a little.</li>
            <li> I did notice my lashes are a little longer and thicker after 3 weeks of using it.  </li>
            <li> After 3 weeks they seemed a little longer.</li>
            <li> Rapidlash was little cheaper, so thought I&#x27;d use it.</li>
            <li> It took a little time but then</li>
            <li> I thought that maybe I was applying too little of the product</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are longer and seem a little thicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for well over 6 weeks with little</li>
            <li> Stopped using it for a little bit</li>
            <li> It takes a little time to start</li>
            <li> do want to warn that sometimes when I wake up in the morning my eyes look a little pinkish/reddish, and when I put it on before bedtime it can sting my skin a bit so</li>
            <li> I use this stuff on my eyebrows when they look a little sparse</li>
            <li> A couple of weeks after I quit using Rapidlash, I noticed that my eyelashes seemed a little longer.  </li>
            <li> Although my lashes do seem to be thicker and a little longer, the serum didn&#x27;t have any affect on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> and I started noticing that my brows were getting a little thinner.</li>
            <li> they are longer and a little darker, but they did not get thicker.</li>
            <li> AND A LITTLE THICKER.</li>
            <li> the product a little longer to see results.</li>
            <li> they were a little longer.</li>
            <li> Should insist on using a little effect?</li>
            <li> But it is not recommended to use on the eyebrows, because of too little</li>
            <li> I refuse to spend the amount of money it costs to purchase Latisse or one of the other, very expensive lash growth products on the market, but I really wanted to try something to get my lashes a little longer and a little thicker.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin and sparse eyelashes with some lashes missing here and there and not nearly the same lengths.</li>
            <li> It irritates the eyes for a few days</li>
            <li> Takes a few weeks or so....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had short thin lashes (as do my mother and sister).</li>
            <li> but I thought it was just a one time thing, but it continued everyday.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use everyday</li>
            <li> I am going to buy a few Rapidlashes  this time to have on hand.</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s a waste of money</li>
            <li> Maybe the product will kick-in in a few weeks but so far..no results.    </li>
            <li> and there would be a thin red line where I applied it as well.</li>
            <li> After a few days, I concluded that it does irritate my eyes</li>
            <li> I was looking in the mirror a few minutes ago</li>
            <li> I found this product a few years ago on line.</li>
            <li> It takes a few weeks but used every night before bed, it works.</li>
            <li> i had a baby a few months ago and needed something to pop on my face...</li>
            <li> It took a few days for the color to fade after I stopped using this thing.</li>
            <li> Even if you skip a few nights, it</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> You gave to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It stopped after a few days, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 70 and have always had rather thin, somewhat short eye lashes.</li>
            <li> My friend used Latisse , I showed her my lashes a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> Seemed dried out.  </li>
            <li> After using for a few weeks I did notice my lashes grew and thickened.</li>
            <li> I curl my lashes everyday and noticed that my lashes have not been falling out.</li>
            <li> It takes a few weeks dnt give up...</li>
            <li> It is a guessing game hoping you apply enough on your eye lids.</li>
            <li> , there are a lot of people leaving reviews that this product was a waste of money and did nothing for them.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using this product, I started noticing both my eyelashes and eyebrows growing.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s waste money and time .</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I used this product everyday for 6 weeks and received 0 results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for two months everyday but nothing happened.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.  </li>
            <li> To start I applied to my lashes everyday and also put some on the sparse spots on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use it for a few days though some lashes do fall out.</li>
            <li> Using it for a few years.</li>
            <li> I have tried the most expensive and the least expensive.  </li>
            <li> I missed quite a few days here and there.</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> Used it everyday for a month and saw no difference.  </li>
            <li> Then the trouble began.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this item a few years ago, it did not bother my eyes then made my lashes thicker.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t even wear make up everyday</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t have time to apply everyday.</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of money for me.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I had been using Latisse for approximately 4 months prior.</li>
            <li> My lashes were thin, short</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  </li>
            <li> Use it everyday</li>
            <li> I was using Latisse until a few months ago and when I saw my lashes thinning and losing length</li>
            <li> I wrote to Amazon direct to let them know this is a unfair practice.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I bought one a few years ago</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> And I have been using this product for a few months now....</li>
            <li> I discontinued use even though I had read that if you quit using it,your lashes would go back to thin and skimpy.  </li>
            <li> It might not fit me because nothing changed.</li>
            <li> It irritates my eyes so I can&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> I wear a ton on mascara everyday</li>
            <li> It is also irritating for up to several hours after application.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll start to see growth after a few weeks, and your lashes will stop falling out.  </li>
            <li> I even missed applications on a few nights.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to waste money on going to a salon to have eyelashes temporarily put on</li>
            <li> A few weeks after that, I decided to try it again.  </li>
            <li> I will this for a few months and then give my eyes a break from it.</li>
            <li> yet i dont use it everyday</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> but when I clicked on the return button it said THIS ITEM  IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR RETURNS.</li>
            <li> and it lasts all day everyday every since I started.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend you waste your money on the Rapidlash</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not do anything but waste time, hope and money..</li>
            <li> A waste of money because I had ordered TWO.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this one.</li>
            <li> A few people have commented on my lashes, but I do believe it is noticeable.</li>
            <li> my daughter asked me if I had been crying.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve wasted $</li>
            <li> In just a few weeks my eyelashes are thicker and longer....</li>
            <li> And I still got the results I wanted even with missing days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reached the point with the cosmetic, health and weight loss industries that I&#x27;m fed up with all the false claims and phoney testimonials and now only buy things that have been recommended by people I trust and who have proven results.  </li>
            <li> and hopefully, cross fingers, I won&#x27;t have to keep using false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Women and men ask me regularly if I&#x27;m wearing false lashes.  </li>
            <li> I get comments all the time, but only one asked if I was wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> I have uneven thin Asian lashes, but this serum not only increases my length, but it thickens it which makes it look like I am wearing false lashes after I applied mascara.</li>
            <li> I have never worn false eyelashes simply because I have never needed to.  </li>
            <li> and I plan to buy til my lashes are as long as the fake ones I used to wear - which is not far away either!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t dramatic at first, very subtle.</li>
            <li> A day later, my other eye started looking red too, although not as bad.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also half the price!</li>
            <li> Now, they&#x27;re growing and even slightly longer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a week and a half of nightly application, and to my amazement, this morning I see baby hairs growing!  </li>
            <li> As I have gotten older my lashes were so thin and scraggly that I was considering having to wear false ones.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any side effects and am over the freakin moon about how long the suckers are!  </li>
            <li> When I forget, or stop using, my lashes end up back to where I was, and then I am very sorry that I forgot, because it will take a few weeks to get them back.  </li>
            <li> and they are not as thick as they were with the other brand.  </li>
            <li> but my eye lashes are LONG AND THICK!</li>
            <li> Nothing dramatic, but it definitely helps.</li>
            <li> I had dramatic results after only 2 weeks of using the product.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are not as dramatic, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks now.</li>
            <li> The results are not as dramatic as using a prescription-strength product, but it definitely makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think its dramatic enough that another would notice, but it&#x27;s does</li>
            <li> Have even noticed a very slight upward curl in lashes.</li>
            <li> It is a very slight difference.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen very slight results.</li>
            <li> keep that goes with that mess!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I can achieve thickness with the serum, but I will continue to take it a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> Not cool!</li>
            <li> I used it typically at night and it hardly takes a few seconds for the application..</li>
            <li> Before I was unhappy with nearly every mascara I had tried, I am seeing now, that the lashes were the problem!!</li>
            <li> Anyway, my motivation for this comes from the fact that I was frustrated by the lack of information on exactly *</li>
            <li> I now have darkening around my eyes (there pretty ugly).</li>
            <li> I told her I was using Rapid Lash for the past few weeks.  </li>
            <li> So these past 3 weeks I have wasted my time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past few years.  </li>
            <li> There doesn&#x27;t appear to be much liquid at all in the bottle and seems to be very expensive for the quantity received.</li>
            <li> about the second week and a half mark, I did notice the TEENIEST bit of growth in my lashes, but also that my lashes were still VERY thin.</li>
            <li> and I wanted a little extra fullness in my lashes for wedding photos (without having to wear fake lashes).</li>
            <li> My lashes are so long, black and thick, they look false.</li>
            <li> Other than this, a waste of money and big disappointment.</li>
            <li> Not only did this one not work, I only got the bad &amp;#34;side effects&amp;#34; which is darker and sensitized eyelids and loss of lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve posted a picture of my one month mark results, on day one you can see how i barely had any lashes from excessive use of fake eyelashes, on day 30</li>
            <li> After 6 weeks, I would have to say that I think I saw a slight improvement in the eyebrow that needed it the least.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in as little as two weeks!</li>
            <li> I was afraid it might irritate my eyes, because I have very sensitive eyes, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li> Being a lover of long lashes, I decided to try this less expensive alternative to Latisse.  </li>
            <li> I think its about empty when it shouldn&#x27;t be--mainly because of a very thin brush and not much liquid adhering to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped using it during my pregnancy, and I hate that I now have my tiny thin short lashes back.</li>
            <li> However 2 months of use and now I have seen very little eyelash growth</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as instructed for about 2 months and have noticed very little improvement.</li>
            <li> Eyebrows improved very little, the ends still won&#x27;t grow out.  </li>
            <li> My eyelids have darkened a very little</li>
            <li> Maybe 3 very weak eyelashes left on each eye (what a sight).</li>
            <li> Purchased this product through Amazon and do not see results with use and also tube has very little in it.</li>
            <li> This time very little in container.  </li>
            <li> give 3 stars based on the slow result, and also on one note, it does, for some reason, made the under-eye skin area very dark...</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed especially having read a lot of positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> It seems to help eyelashes not fall out as much, thus getting thicker, but after about two months I haven&#x27;t grown starlet eyelashes, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> One thing it did seem to do though, was maintain the thickness of my lashes, so it wasn&#x27;t all bad, but what I was really hoping for was length.</li>
            <li> This has been an absolute revelation and I am still shocked that it works so well.</li>
            <li> she was so shocked how fast it started to work for me.</li>
            <li> I basically had no lashes and decided to suck it up take of my fake individual lashes and give this a try.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Worked in the past for me.</li>
            <li> It is less than 1/3 the price of Latisse, and there are no listed serious side effects as there are with the prescription product.  </li>
            <li> I am lazy ^^\\&quot; But i was amazed by this product.</li>
            <li> Can see some increase in eyebrow hair, but not sure about effect on lashes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had eyebrow zits since I was a dirty, greasy 13 year old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the length</li>
            <li> My usual orders from Amazon are for books and they seem to take forever 7-21 days.  </li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my lashes after consistently using it for four months. :(</li>
            <li> I continued using the product hoping the growing process would pick back up, but unfortunately it hasnt.</li>
            <li> and I purchased this in December 2010, so I am not pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s that that adds the illusion of volume or</li>
            <li> I tried the serum and found that the wand was too small.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product at another place in the past</li>
            <li> My eyelashes had gotten thinner over time,  after just a few weeks my eyelashes were getting fuller and longer!</li>
            <li> At first, I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was SO hopeful, but skeptical at the same time, but now I have the longest lashes of anyone I know!</li>
            <li> but I was not satisfied with their results.</li>
            <li> I also bought my usual mascara  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after 3 weeks of use, I don&#x27;t see any noticeable difference except for the swollen, red and irritated eyelids and bloodshot eyes.</li>
            <li> In the past I used Renewlash and Lattise.</li>
            <li> They werent any longer but the bald spots at the corners of my eyes had small hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether to buy another or not.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 6 weeks &amp; have noticed thicker eyelashes</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not sure if this helped either</li>
            <li> Time to throw it away and go back to the expensive Latisse -- which worked when I tried it two years ago.</li>
            <li> Not sure why,</li>
            <li> What I did see-- and what finally made me stop using it-- was an uncomfortable dryness in and around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have used Latise in the past....</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I had steroid lashes!  </li>
            <li> in all, this product does what it says, but be wary of anything you put too close to your eyes, especially if it is not medically prescribed.</li>
            <li> The discomfort was unbelievable, too.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t make it look like you have fake lashes on unless your lashes are naturally giant.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if I&#x27;ll spend the money again for this result.</li>
            <li> I began using this product this past August.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Reviatlash changed their formula and it no longer had the same</li>
            <li> but then again, I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> I am not really sure what to do about this.</li>
            <li> Whenever i use it for a while i get tons of compliments on my lashes, I even had several people ask me if were fake.</li>
            <li> ; I learned from Beautypedia.com that this contains some of the same ingredients as Lashtique, the expensive prescription product.</li>
            <li> Ladies, it takes a few weeks, but it works!  </li>
            <li> , they feel thicker and I have small stubble that will grow into longer hair</li>
            <li> People think I am still wearing the fake glue on individual lashes</li>
            <li> Used in past bimaprost</li>
            <li> sadly I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use this product again, even though it did work initially</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize just how well it works until I got lazy and stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Grand Lash and it was terrible for it made me look bloodshot all day where as this has thickened and lengthens without side effects.</li>
            <li> No more extensions.</li>
            <li> Upon wakening, a variety of small insects had been captured in my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if i will buy again.</li>
            <li> And unfortunately there are patches where the hair just will not grow back, so the serum can&#x27;t work miracles if you&#x27;ve destroyed the follicles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I had eyelash extensions for the past couple of months.</li>
            <li> I have used Revitalash Conditioner in the past</li>
            <li> Plus, the smoke coats her lashes or may be burning them... not sure.</li>
            <li> And I even see that the place I put on this product is red and my eye felt uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product in the past and it takes about 2 weeks to see results but the product lasts 3-5 months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this pretty faithfully for about 3 months now and see almost N-O change. :(</li>
            <li> It took a few months to see the results but it works!  </li>
            <li> I have actually resorted to cutting them off because they were pointing down so dramatically.</li>
            <li> I apply right on my lash line as close to the base of my lashes as I can get.</li>
            <li> *always* been thin and sparse, due to genetics not over-plucking or waxing.</li>
            <li> was a little hesitant after reading some negative reviews, but I guess whenever there are thousands of people using a project, statistically, there will always be some negative ones.</li>
            <li> The side effects of Latisse are not worth the product (permanent darkening of the iris, darkening at the base of the lashes, permanent eye color change, I mean really?).</li>
            <li> Seems to be working - subtle, but not surprising as my eyelashes are really thin and short.</li>
            <li> My lashes grew so long by Christmas, my bestfriend even asked me if I was wearing fake lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those gals who is obsessed with long eyelashes.</li>
            <li> There were a few crazy hairs that just shot strait out, or grew flat against my skin (those I just pulled out and didnt miss).</li>
            <li> Very upset and disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disapointed with it. :(</li>
            <li> But it seems not suitable for me.</li>
            <li> So long and goodbye to fake lashes.</li>
            <li> Expensive little tube with little product and little results!</li>
            <li> but unfortunately no real significant changes were made in the length department.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned cash!</li>
            <li> Since I have very sensitive skin, was concerned about a bad reaction, but had none.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t crazy scary long, but definitely longer than they were.</li>
            <li> Use a fine eye liner brush along the base of your lashes!</li>
            <li> I can hardly wait for the results after I&#x27;ve been using it a while longer.</li>
            <li> Since my eyelashes are blond &amp; hard to see I waited for a month before putting on mascara.</li>
            <li> Well with my lashes being so curly its hard not to touch the ends of my lashes that touch the skin.</li>
            <li> There was like hardly anything on the brush when you pull it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to see them</li>
            <li> My lashes are longer now, and they hardly ever fall out.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to tell anything with them).</li>
            <li> (When I was using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s lash serum, I hardly had any lashes falling out--like MAYBE 1 or 2 in two weeks).</li>
            <li> and I know I am hard on my eyelashes</li>
            <li> (Walmart, hard candy brand)</li>
            <li> you certainly get what you pay for with this crap</li>
            <li> even tho it is, too little to be noticed!!</li>
            <li> The brush is a little thin, but I got use to it.</li>
            <li> My lashes have gotten noticeably longer and lusher - when I curl them and add a little mascara, they look almost like false lashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious and a little afraid of what will happen to my lashes if I stop using the serum.</li>
            <li> It caused a terrible itch all around my eyes top and bottom, swollen and red like a bad sun burn.  </li>
            <li> I did have to use this every day for at least 5-6 weeks before I saw a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t drink milk dated with that late of an expiration</li>
            <li> , I have had zero pain or negative reactions from using this.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried at least 4 others.</li>
            <li> Give it at least four weeks, and follow the label instructions to the letter.  </li>
            <li> I was desperate to make my eyelashes grow back and within two weeks of using this product my eyelashes were longer and thicker !.</li>
            <li> I did notice a slight difference--not dramatic</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is a common issue or not.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is a common reaction, but it&#x27;s been 4 days since I used it</li>
            <li> but I stopped using it after a couple of weeks because of the side effect which from what ive read not everyone has had or at least not sharing.</li>
            <li> Nothing crazy, but yes definite.</li>
            <li> I bought this product one month ago for the reason that I just want to make my eyebrow and eyelashes thick.</li>
            <li> This product works, but slowly.</li>
            <li> Kathie Lee Gifford showed how thick her lashes were because of Rapidlash.</li>
            <li> I started to use this from Nov. and now everyone in my family agrees that my eyelashes look thick and longer than before.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows were already thick by some standards</li>
            <li> but I wanted thick youth eyebrows again and got those too.</li>
            <li> jury is still out but some change, slow.</li>
            <li> The process is slow but the product does what is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> After using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s lash serum, my lashes were thick, but with no additional length.</li>
            <li> Slowly, but eventually and with noticeable results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slow process</li>
            <li> I was so discouraged since I hate using so much mascara.</li>
            <li> Works as well as Brow Relonge, if not better, and less expensive.</li>
            <li> definitely looked FAKE!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> In fact you will not need to buy the expensive mascara that you needed before due to</li>
            <li> And what I mean by that is, don&#x27;t apply any to your eye LID.</li>
            <li> One eye has longer lashes than the other, so it&#x27;s not perfect, but I&#x27;m not complaining.  </li>
            <li> This one works just as well, if not better!  </li>
            <li> I was EXTREMELY skeptical about this product because I had used other products to make my eyelashes grow.</li>
            <li> I lost some of my eyebrows years ago due to stage makeup allergy and aging (sad).</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I tried this product because I have tried other over-the-counter products and it did nothing for my lashes.  </li>
            <li> AND I don&#x27;t need to worry about my green eyes turning brown as a side effect!!  </li>
            <li> No more skimpy eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical, but I do see improvement in the fullness of the eye lashes and I am using it every other day now (after 3-4 weeks of every day).  </li>
            <li> And the brush head is too small, does not apply to brow!</li>
            <li> Now they&#x27;re black, thick, and they curl up!!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I desperately needed to regrow my lashes after the summer (they fell out due to my allergies :/ ).</li>
            <li> I can say I experience this very randomly with the product immediately after application, but it goes away almost instantly.</li>
            <li> but I find it a bit irritating to my lashes but no more than Latisse.  </li>
            <li> No more false lashes for me.</li>
            <li> I decided to go down and get either \\&quot;extensions\\&quot; or fake eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t making the connection yet that I was using the Rapidlash just before bed and waking up shaky.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, I looked like I was up all night</li>
            <li> You will start to see subtle results in about 4 weeks, but it&#x27;s after having used it for about 2 months did I start to get compliments by others.</li>
            <li> but now they are ridiculous.</li>
            <li> seriously.</li>
            <li> I am sticking with rapidlash because it shows results and is less expensive.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I thought I would try it.  </li>
            <li> I seriously can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> I use to hate using mascara because, when it was time to remove it, several of the few lashes I had came out.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes don&#x27;t seem any thicker or longer without mascara, but there does seem to be a subtle difference WITH mascara.</li>
            <li> I will continue using it and would recommend anyone who is unhappy with their thin or short eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Works as well as latisse but less expensive and doesn&#x27;t cause eye irritation</li>
            <li> Change for the sake of change is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> and when my mom saw me after a long time she asked me if i was wearing fake lashes!</li>
            <li> My lashes are so long people think they&#x27;re fake!</li>
            <li> My lashes are crazy long and thick!</li>
            <li> Even after reading the reviews on this product before I bought it I was still a little skeptical, but now I am convinced.  </li>
            <li> With a little mascara, it looks as if I&#x27;m wearing fake eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> It is a little expensive compared to my expectation.</li>
            <li> My lashes were so thin that even with mascara they were hard to see.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good with routines</li>
            <li> Not Good.  </li>
            <li> Its not in the least bit irritating.</li>
            <li> So a few months ago I went and got some fake eyelashes on and when they started to come off</li>
            <li> I was so shocked to buy a product that actually worked as it advertised!</li>
            <li> This product not good for me.</li>
            <li> I did use Lilash for a long time, but they are very expensive, and I worried about the knock offs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Amazon price was approximately 45% less expensive than what I saw at the store.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that after 11 weeks of consistent use, I haven&#x27;t seen any changes in my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> four weeks, no lash growth, still thin lashes, and SERIOUSLY sparse lashes from all the breakage and falling out.</li>
            <li> I wonder tho if it will have some bad &amp;#34;side effects&amp;#34; in a long run.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed with this product the second time around.  </li>
            <li> and they were pretty nasty looking.  </li>
            <li> The first 4 days my eyes looked horrible!</li>
            <li> I read reviews online to see what other people were saying because I was still skeptical and a review said that their product was sent to them expired!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes were always weak and breaking.</li>
            <li> and my lashes looked so long that I was shocked.</li>
            <li> Duh!  </li>
            <li> The only thing I was disappointed with</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I hate it just because it wasn&#x27;t irritating like a few other lash products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> eyelashes were very thin due to me applying fake lashes.</li>
            <li> With age comes less lashes and the sparse areas make me crazy.</li>
            <li> am very disappointed as the reviews I had read about the product seemed promising.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical since this produce is so much less expensive than the doctor&#x27;s office brand.  </li>
            <li> I got my package very late.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable product!!  </li>
            <li> You should see results in a week, assuming you don&#x27;t get lazy and not follow instructions, wash your makeup off every night!!</li>
            <li> I was a little distraught and</li>
            <li> but honestly, I&#x27;m a little afraid.</li>
            <li> For what I was looking for, this product was easier  to get (no prescription) and much less expensive!</li>
            <li> It was so bad that I thought I had pink eye and went to the doctor.  </li>
            <li> Alas, all I received were EYEBROW ZITS.</li>
            <li> being in my 60&#x27;s the eyelashes and brows start to thin.</li>
            <li> and my eyes feel so tired after that.</li>
            <li> (it was stinging and irritating me)</li>
            <li> The website states that it takes approximately 3-4 weeks to see results.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product and have been using it each night for about a month, and I do not notice an improvement in the appearance of my brows, which over the years have become thin as a result of waxing and plucking them.</li>
            <li> Always apply thin coats otherwise it can irritate your eyes.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are still thin.</li>
            <li> Not a happy person with this one.</li>
            <li> Renew lash was irritating.  </li>
            <li> My lashes on one eye had broken off in just one spot</li>
            <li> Just apply to the base of your LASHES ONLY.</li>
            <li> I hate that gross caked on mascara look</li>
            <li> /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I started using RapidLash approximately 3 months ago.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re still thin</li>
            <li> but, alas, nothing after 3 months of continual use.</li>
            <li> eyebrows had gotten fairly thin from years of over-plucking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like that in my life.</li>
            <li> I used it for two weeks even though I could see it irritating my eyes.....</li>
            <li> I used this product every night before bedtime for approximately 6 weeks before I started seeing results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used another product and was not happy with it at all.</li>
            <li> How frustrating.</li>
            <li> I would color them in but still was not happy.</li>
            <li> I find the applicator brush too thin and wimpy.</li>
            <li> Still thin, but easier to plump up w mascara</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird to read negative comments.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m tired of throwing away money on the purchase of false lashes.</li>
            <li> The itching got worse over time</li>
            <li> Not happy -</li>
            <li> but i got tired of spending $130 for it.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Rapidlash now for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Rapidlash is even worse.</li>
            <li> that faded!&lt;br /&gt;Forget all those fiber mascara, lash extensions, false lashes etc etc and all the up</li>
            <li> For a moment there, I thought maybe my wishful thinking had me seeing longer lashes but when my mom asked if I was wearing false eyelashes</li>
            <li> I needed to enhance my lashes but didn&#x27;t want to invest in false lashes &amp; all the maintenance that it involves.</li>
            <li> My lashes looked as though I was wearing false ones.</li>
            <li> and sometimes I feel like I have false eyelashes on.  </li>
            <li> My daughter thought I was wearing false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> If I use mascara and a curler they look like false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what false lashes are for.</li>
            <li> My mom asked me why I had false eyelashes on???</li>
            <li> I considered buying false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Then I look like I am wearing false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> My mom who never pays attention asked me if I had false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> People that hadn&#x27;t seen me in a while thought I had false lashes on.</li>
            <li> My daughter even asked if I was wearing false lashes.  </li>
            <li> People think I have false eyelashes on.</li>
            <li> I thought I had a bad reaction due to it seeping into my eyes.</li>
            <li> I will post a youtube demo of this product if they get any longer and be a serious rapidlash fan!</li>
            <li> Seriously!     </li>
            <li> she seriously thought I had been wearing fake lashes.</li>
            <li> Even after months it wasn&#x27;t that dramatic</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a dramatic difference in the amount of lashes I have, but they were not sparse to begin with.</li>
            <li> Nothing dramatic, but I could get away with not wearing mascara now if I use and eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a dramatic difference</li>
            <li> Rapidlash results are not as dramatic as Revitalash, but it does work, with time.</li>
            <li> I posted some before and after pictures on Rapidlashes Facebook site (don&#x27;t know how to do it here), even though the results are not as dramatic as others have had with their before and afters, but you can see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I saw a dramatic difference immediately.</li>
            <li> Not the dramatic results advertised.</li>
            <li> I applied rapid lash every single night as directed to the base of my lashes and to my brows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products since and been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very difficult to apply with the tiny brush and also almost impossible to load onto the brush.</li>
            <li> They are like little cysts but not quite as bad.</li>
            <li> bad thing I noticed was that my eyes get a little itchy at times.i have experience this</li>
            <li> After being ill in 2008, and on an IV antibiotic, my lashes and brows were so thin an sparse.</li>
            <li> My brows grow really slow without this serum and they grow in crazy directions.</li>
            <li> I got so tired of fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> However I have seen slow growth !!</li>
            <li> Waste of my money :(</li>
            <li> Also, I hate the way mascara weighs down my lashes.  </li>
            <li> There are no more gaps between my lashes their darker, fuller, and longer!!!</li>
            <li> sorry.</li>
            <li> but I am sad to say it did nothing for me :</li>
            <li> When I wear two coats of mascara, people have asked if they&#x27;re fake.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews about this product before I tried it, because I thought it was expensive and didn&#x27;t want to make a costly mistake.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this on my eyelashes, but for someone like me with skin that breaks out if you just look at it wrong, I&#x27;d be hesitant on the eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was wrong.  </li>
            <li> She said with the perscription version, the price is so expensive in order to cover advertising and marketing costs.  </li>
            <li> Well, I was talked out of getting the expensive extensions because I wear contact lenses and</li>
            <li> So I ended up getting fake eyelashes</li>
            <li> even though instructions say this is useless).</li>
            <li> The serum burned my skin and I was unable to use it.</li>
            <li> My mother was in awe and claims it looks like I have fake lashes-so I bought her some for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t even need to wear fake lashes.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend giving it a try before getting soaked for the ultra expensive products.  </li>
            <li> I have been OBSESSED with lashes for, like, ever.  </li>
            <li> and when I put on a thin coat of mascara two days ago... KABOOM!</li>
            <li> but as it was expensive I decides to give  Rapid Lash a try but was completelly disapointed and never ever will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> You put it on and lay on the side of your face and weird</li>
            <li> but i want that fake lash look even w/o fake eyelashes, so</li>
            <li> This product works, but it takes about a month to see results and you have to use it every day without fail.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Latisse, which as we all know, is extremely expensive.  </li>
            <li> Until then, I am uncomfortable purchasing this product again or using the remaining portion of the bottle to see if the product works as claimed.  </li>
            <li> Sorry - no luck here.</li>
            <li> Also, this has worked wonders on my weird hair deprived</li>
            <li> I had revitalash before and is way too expensive</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s way too expensive for me.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I don&#x27;t like the idea of tying fake lashes to my existing ones.</li>
            <li> I never used fake lashes but used tons of Mascara</li>
            <li> If anyone is unsure or skeptical of using this.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t see any results with this product.  </li>
            <li> all that redness made me look ill / deranged.</li>
            <li> It was expensive.</li>
            <li> but it was too tedious to do every morning and night</li>
            <li> This unfortunately didn&#x27;t work for me like I hoped it would.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product is not returnable.  </li>
            <li> this is fake</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have not noticed one bit of difference after using this product for over a month.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical but decided to try it anyway.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are puny and sad again.</li>
            <li> I pulled out a lot of my lashes wearing fake ones.</li>
            <li> I had applied it wrong</li>
            <li> My expectations were wrong, not the product.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I have been using this for about a month now and have noticed a difference in the length of my lashes.  </li>
            <li> I am one of the unfortunate ones.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t need to put fake eye lash anymore</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this one since I haven&#x27;t tried it</li>
            <li> I tried an expensive brand from upscale store that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Latisse worked but was too expensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it and unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all!</li>
            <li> but sorry to say it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product, but decided to give it a try anyway because of the price.  </li>
            <li> ask if I was using fake lashes.</li>
            <li> I have money to throw around casually like it grows on trees or something, then I might buy Rapidlash again and give it another go.</li>
            <li> I was asked by some cosmetologists if I had false eyelashes!  </li>
            <li> I had a woman coworker come up to me one day and ask me if I was wearing false eyelashes!  </li>
            <li> I have very thin hair, nails and eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> use to have very thin sparse eyelashes after three months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not experienced any unpleasant side effects, and I use it every night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like when I was in my twenties, but at least I don&#x27;t have to resort to annoying fake lashes.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this gave me no results whatsoever, and it made my eyelids itch like crazy.</li>
            <li> Both in that annoying small hole and on the ends!  </li>
            <li> Other brands are just awful.</li>
            <li> Had to pull them of due to eyes tearing up and itching terribly.</li>
            <li> As you can see now why i continued using this product even though it gaves me horrible dark circles, but i guess its a sacrifice</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF SUCKS!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Rinse with cold water</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking this could be dangerous.</li>
            <li> For some crazy reason, I had lost a portion of my eyelashes.   </li>
            <li> I would like to use it for my eyelashes, too, but am afraid that it may darken my &amp;#34;baby blues&amp;#34;, so I will not go there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used Latisse because of the expense and I&#x27;m afraid my eye color will change.  </li>
            <li> but I was getting desperate.</li>
            <li> But it must be cold pressed castor oil.</li>
            <li> Call me crazy</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are crazy..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe the serum is dangerous, but it&#x27;s not for everyone, so please pay attention to it&#x27;s effect on you.</li>
            <li> I do not like the reviews and dangerous side effects I have read about this product and am afraid to continue use.  </li>
            <li> I have to stop using it, cause I&#x27;m afraid it will irritate my eye.</li>
            <li> It burns like crazy.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes grow like crazy, but I have to use it every night.  </li>
            <li> obsessed!</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical about whether this product would work on not, but I&#x27;m a believer now!  </li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> Watch out for fake vendors!</li>
            <li> Ill never buy it again!</li>
            <li> Horrible Product - past expiration - and burned my eyes - need to take off Amazon.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with giving this product a try!</li>
            <li> however it is very expensive</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was very skeptical but went ahead and ordered.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical but it works and I am so ecstatic.</li>
            <li> I decided to give it Rapidlash another chance because the price was lower and the expensive stuff was worthless (I never used the RX).</li>
            <li> I saw this product advertised, I was very skeptical.  </li>
            <li> I realize that biologically that seems almost impossible</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I reacted to it in a very unpleasant way.</li>
            <li> Apart from  the importance of ethics, I&#x27;d be worried about bad karma.</li>
            <li> They were so itchy and looked bad.</li>
            <li> I wear contacts so that may be why I have some sensitivity to the product but not so bad to stop using it.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t clump nearly as bad as they did before.</li>
            <li> too bad cause</li>
            <li> Too bad there&#x27;s no recourse.</li>
            <li> Too bad this product doesn&#x27;t work on me, I&#x27;m looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> It got so bad</li>
            <li> Not too bad.</li>
            <li> All the time, I&#x27;m still frustrated because I can&#x27;t find any conclusive decisions on whether it works or not, or how it works, etc.</li>
            <li> Unlike Latisse, this does not leave that ugly brown line on your eye lid where you apply it-</li>
            <li> and they are painful to remove.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 5 weeks, I still use rapid lash every night and NEVER skip, I bought an expensive eyelash curler, I curled yesterday, my eyelashes look fake!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be disappointed though, it did</li>
            <li> I dont know what happen, but I am highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m jealous :(.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed but will continue to be on the lookout for something that holds up.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;DO NOT TAKE THE RISK :(</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this product, I used it as described but it didn&#x27;t follow through on its claims.</li>
            <li> Burns like crazy!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was very afraid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very cynical when it comes to things like this</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy this product again, very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing .</li>
            <li> Oh sad!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had lash extensions before but the maintenance was just too annoying for me.</li>
            <li> I have used this at the base of my eyelashes, as directed, for 6 weeks now.  </li>
            <li> For RadipLash, you apply it as you would eyeliner on the base of your lashes.</li>
            <li> In the morning, I occassionally notice that some of the product dries at the base of my lashes.</li>
            <li> Wait a minute, I do hate it, it doesn&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li> I always apply the serum to the skin at the base of the eyelashes, sometimes between the lashes too.</li>
            <li> I would say it was a bit annoying, but it wasn&#x27;t unbearable.</li>
            <li> I made the horrible decision to apply fake eyelashes and this serum saved me from emberrassement !.</li>
            <li> and I was getting very frustrated.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> am very disappointed after a month of using this.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> and they were awful.  </li>
            <li> Looked horrible with mascara.</li>
            <li> I have awful allergies anyway</li>
            <li> The product I bought instead was awful.</li>
            <li> After a week of nightly applications, I started breaking out terribly from this product.  </li>
            <li> Whatever it was, it looked awful.</li>
            <li> Made my eyes itch terribly .</li>
            <li> But if you use the product everynite you WILL not be disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> Worst product ever!!</li>
            <li> I then added it to the base of my eyelashes and after about 4 weeks my lashes were longer!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as quickly but it does work eventually</li>
            <li> Quick delivery!  A noticeable difference after several weeks of use.  Especially on a sparse eyebrow area.  Very happy with product overall and have reordered again.</li>
            <li> love this product! works better than one i tried that was more than twice the price. it&#x27;s a must have in my book. my lashes not only grew longer but darker as well. w/o mascara it used to look like i had no lashes they were so blonde. not so now.</li>
            <li> I Love this product - of course was skeptical as many beauty products have failed but this actually does work. I used to have individual perma lashes on and off for several years and it has left my natural lashes bald in many spots and very very brittle and thin. I basically had no lashes and decided to suck it up take of my fake individual lashes and give this a try. it has grown them and made them so much stronger than I had hoped for - you do have to use it every night and be patient because the results will come. I hope this helps for anybody looking to improve their own!</li>
            <li> Noticed results in 3-4 days!!!! My eyebrows became a bit darker and grew a lot as did my eye lashes. When you get the product in your eye it causes slight discomfort but nothing major. Make sure to follow direction and apply before bed time!</li>
            <li> Works well. It irritates the eyes for a few days</li>
            <li> It works it works it works!!</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair, nails and eyelashes.  I first bought this on a whim, just to try it out.  Well, it REALLY does work.  Takes a few weeks or so....I apply it to the &amp;#34;liner&amp;#34; area on the top of my lashes, and lately I have been putting it &amp;#34;under&amp;#34; my lower lashes, and wow....now my lower lashes are longer than I have ever had in my life.  I have really seen a definite difference.  When I forget, or stop using, my lashes end up back to where I was, and then I am very sorry that I forgot, because it will take a few weeks to get them back.  Best if used before bed, then it has all night to sit there on your skin, next to the root of the lashes, with no make-up or anything to get in the way.  If I forget to apply at night, I put it on in the morning, as it is clear.  Just be careful not to put any eyeshadow over it, or the shadow will just absorb it, and not work.  I love this serum, and will continue to buy!!</li>
            <li> when i got it, it was  already expired!! Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> did not work for me...sorry.</li>
            <li> I notice if I stop using this my lashes fall out so much easier. Used to if I tugged on my lashes cause they were bugging me they&#x27;d come right out. Not sure it makes lashes longer because mine are already long but definitely makes them stronger and keeps them full.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was very excited reading the reviews...but I am sad to say it did nothing for me :(&lt;br /&gt;I have the same short eyelashes I started with...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it make difference to my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!! It really does make your lashes, thicker, longer and fuller!</li>
            <li> I have been using Rapidlash for my eyebrows for a little over 2 months. I have eczema on my eyebrows (mostly on the left side) so the hair wasn&#x27;t wanting to grow back no matter what I tried. I tried ALL of the home remedies/natural ways to grow them back to no avail and I was getting very frustrated. It took a little over a month to notice results, but I am very pleased with how my eyebrows look now. Before, I barely had any hair on my left brow and was annoyed at having to pencil in my brows which usually never looked quite right :/ I&#x27;ve been using the product as directed and sometimes 3 times a day instead of 2. If you&#x27;re at your wits&#x27; end, you should definitely try Rapidlash. It&#x27;s affordable and way cheaper than other products and it actually works :)</li>
            <li> Worked in the past for me. Just takes it over a month to see any difference</li>
            <li> I had some minor redness and itchiness the first few days after starting this product, but it disappeared quickly.  I also wear contact lenses, and have had no problems.  At first I couldn&#x27;t see any difference, but it has now been almost 12 weeks and I am amazed at the difference.  My lashes have gotten much longer.  They actually brush my glasses, when I wear them, if I haven&#x27;t curled my lashes well enough with an eyelash curler.  My lashes only seem a little darker, so at first the difference wasn&#x27;t noticeable until I started wearing mascara a little more regularly. I am very happy with the results, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay the exhorbitant price to try Latisse!</li>
            <li> I lost my eyebrows as a teenager to my best friend, who is now a PhD on molecular design: we had an accident at the lab, and the chemicals burned my forehead, leaving me without eyebrows for most of my teen years. The hair eventually came back: one eyebrow here, one eyebrow there... not where they were supposed to be. As an adult I managed to grow a few more hairs, but for most of the last 10 years I had to rely on eyebrow pencils and stencils...  Until now.  You can&#x27;t imagine my excitement when the hair started to come out after all these years, only after 2 weeks of using RapidLash. And my eyelashes - which were also gone initially but seemed to be destined to be always short- are growing too. I have been using the product for 6 weeks now: I still have to use my eyebrow pencil, but I&#x27;ve noticed I have to use it less and less everyday. Sections that were totally hairless are now starting to fill up. And did I mention my eyebrows and eyelashes also seem to be darker? A welcome plus.  Get RapidLash. Get it NOW! I never write reviews, but when it comes to my eyebrows...</li>
            <li> I tried Rapidlash after wearing eyelash extensions for a couple of months.  My eylashes are light, short, and sparse.  After I had my extensions taken off I was left with gaps and very brittle eyelashes.  I turned to Rapidlash over Latisse because of the cost difference.  Since my eyelashes were in such poor shape it was difficult to determine at first if my eyelashes were simply growing back on their own or if Rapidlash was working. I&#x27;ve been using this since mid-August and I can honestly say, it is the Rapidlash.  My natural lashes have never looked so beautiful!  I put it on faithfully every morning and I am still working on the original tube from August.  My lashes are LONG!  Not super thick but long and they look darker.  No side effects for me and I have been telling everyone I know about this fabulous product.  I really noticed a difference after using this product for 6 weeks.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I started using Rapidlash 4 weeks ago and i love the results.  I had tried using false eyelashes twice and noticed that when they were removed they removed most of my lashes. I stopped and started using this product. My lashes look great. A little mascara and they are almost touching my brows just after 4 weeks.  I AM A BELIEVER!!!!!</li>
            <li> i saw some growth in eyebrows more than eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Rapid Lash is an amazing product !  I am a 60 yr. old woman who has had short, thin lashes for most of my life.  After using this product for only 3 weeks I began to notice a substantial difference.  It has now been 6 weeks and my lashes are unbelieveably long, full and darker.  My daughter has asked me to purchase Rapid Lash as a Christmas gift for her because the difference in my lashes is so profound.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product one month ago for the reason that I just want to make my eyebrow and eyelashes thick. My eyelashes is already long and looks great when I&#x27;m wearing mascara but wearing a mascara everyday makes your eyelash fall off specially when it&#x27;s waterproof and you are trying to remove it when washing your face.  After using this product for a couple of weeks my lashes looks so much better now with or without mascara. I&#x27;ve read some reviews that it makes your eyelid and under eye dark, so far I don&#x27;t see that on mine. Bottom line this product works for me !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Rapidlash for some months now and noticed a vast improvement in the condition of my lashes.  They are thicker and fuller now and visibly longer.  My lashes were very sparse and so I am very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> I started using this product on the 2nd of December. It says it takes 4 to 6 weeks for results but I swear my lashes look longer already.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it says it does. I have been using it for 4 weeks &amp; 2 days. My lashes are so much longer &amp; now appear to be getting thicker. My eyebrows are a growing at a slower rate, but I know that I have to be patient. Since the ends of my eyebrows diappeared over time, it will take time to get them back. Long story short, I plan to order more of this product. It truly works &amp; the price is incredible at Amazon. Our local drugstore carries it for more than double the price &amp; they can&#x27;t keep it in. So glad I checked here first!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different lash growth products but this one has the best results by far.  I was without it for 2 weeks and during that time my eyelashes started falling out. As soon as I got more I started applying it again and my lashes started growing back within 2 weeks.  I will never let myself run out again!</li>
            <li> I am at that age when the lashes and brows come in thinner and shorter with each passing year.  Eyes with no eyelashes are like a picture without a frame--boring.  I can&#x27;t afford Latisse, and I worry about all the listed possible side effects, on top of the fact that you have to pay for a doctor visit to get it.  I decided to try RapidLash a little over a year ago.  It is less than 1/3 the price of Latisse, and there are no listed serious side effects as there are with the prescription product.  Within 2 weeks, I noticed my lashes were not breaking or falling out anymore, and they did appear to be getting longer. Within 2 months, they were twice as long as they had been since I was in my 20&#x27;s.  In short, I am and will continue to be an ongoing user of this product.  I also decided to try it on the outer 1/3 to 1/2 of my brows, as they were thinning just like my lashes had been. Now they are full and beautiful again.  I don&#x27;t use it every day now, since my lashes and brows are where I want them to be.  I use it 3 to 4 nights a week to maintain my lashes and brows where they are.  This is a terrific product that really works!!</li>
            <li> Bought it, used it daily for 31 days, the difference noted was more lashing fell out while using it than before use - stopped it.  I did see a review somewhere on this product that it used to contain the same chemical that Latisse contains.  After the drug company patented Latisse everyone else had to stop using that ingredient including Rapidlash.  Which would explain why so many rave about its effectiveness and others see no results.  Not sure if it&#x27;s true.  All I know is it didn&#x27;t work for me.  Should have heeded the 60 other reviewers who gave it one star.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I&#x27;m getting married in the fall and I wanted a little extra fullness in my lashes for wedding photos (without having to wear fake lashes). I have pretty full lashes already, but after only 3 weeks of using this product I can already tell that my lashes are thicker and longer. I can&#x27;t wait until it&#x27;s been 6 weeks to see the full effect... I will update my review then : )</li>
            <li> I bought this ONLY because product states can be used for eyebrows too. I barely have any and have been, to the chagrin of my spouse, considering eyebrow tatoo-ing.  Thought I&#x27;d give this a shot first.  It may be that a month and a half of usage may not be enough time, hopefully I&#x27;m not prematurely &#x27;judging&#x27; but..... it&#x27;s not working on the brows. However, my eyelashes are spectacular!</li>
            <li> it really works!! i notice the difference after i used for a month. I am skeptical at the beginning, becuz there are so many eyelash enhancement products in the market. I am not the person who like to leave the review for product. I am lazy ^^\\&quot; But i was amazed by this product. And this is my second month, I still see it is growing a little by little. I used both upper and lower lashes, and they both works! Highly recommend! And the price is acceptable too. You just need to be patient to use it every night. I used Eye-lite Double Lash Eyelash(which is also popular) before rapidlash, but eye-lite didn&#x27;t have the result as rapidlash.</li>
            <li> I have been using Rapidlash for about four weeks now.  I know it is supposed to take six weeks to three months to really see a difference, but my lashes are already longer and thicker.  I used to couldn&#x27;t get enough mascara on my eyelashes, especially because they are blonde. But now I can find eyelashes to put mascara on, and it only takes one coat.  I am going to order more soon, because I don&#x27;t want to be out of it. I can hardly wait for the results after I&#x27;ve been using it a while longer.</li>
            <li> At first I was very skeptical but after just 3 weeks of use I started to notice a difference Definitely worth the money. I will continue to use and recommend this product to my friends -- absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had short thin lashes (as do my mother and sister). I&#x27;ve been using Rapid Lash (less than religiously, mind you) for about a month now can see a definite lash enhancement. They aren&#x27;t any thicker per se, but they are definitely longer. They&#x27;re really noticeable when wet and they touch the lenses of my glasses now. When I wear two coats of mascara, people have asked if they&#x27;re fake. I am SO pleased with this product. I don&#x27;t know what happens if you stop using it, but with results like these, why would you? No irritation, stickiness, smell, or fuss. Just longer lashes. Go get &#x27;em, ladies...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month and it seems to work. I wanted it more for my eyebrows than eyelashes, but using it on both. Can see some increase in eyebrow hair, but not sure about effect on lashes. Worth a try, though.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It works a little slower than I would have liked... took a month to see results, but once my lashes got going, they really took off. It has even made my bottom lashes grow as well. I don&#x27;t even use it every night, and I&#x27;m still getting results.</li>
            <li> I just purchased my second tube of Rapid lash. It works, I noticed results right away. My lashes are longer and thicker. My bottom lashes which were barely visible are growing too. Im a believer and I will keep using this product. My first tube lasted for over 2 months. I have stopped using mascara because I dont need it!  Totally worth the price especially when Amazon offers it for under $26. with free shipping. Latisse costs over $120. and requires a prescription. Why spend the money on Latisse when this works great and does not require a prescription? This is a good product and it works!</li>
            <li> I used Rapid Lash for about 3 weeks, maybe skipping a day or 2 and I have already noticed my lashes are longer. I applied it to both the top and bottom lashes. This product definitely works, although it did make my lashes longer, it did not make them thicker. I am asian so I have sparse lashes that are super straight and grow down. After using Rapid lash my lashes have slightly curled. I still have to use a eye lash curler, but after curling them and using mascara they are noticeably different. It&#x27;s been 3 months now and I still have a little bit of solution left in my tube so the product goes a pretty long way if you are just using it on your lashes. Overall, I love it and would highly recommend it if you want to buy something over the counter.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews about this product before I tried it, because I thought it was expensive and didn&#x27;t want to make a costly mistake.  I was even skeptical about the reviews because there were so many positive ones.  I figured the company could have paid people to write them.  But I decided to give this a try since my lashes were becoming sparser and shorter.  I did have to use this every day for at least 5-6 weeks before I saw a noticeable difference.  My lashes completely filled in in the sparse areas and actually grew longer, especially at the corners of my eyes.  I could even tell a difference in photos of me.  After faithfully using it every night for 6 weeks, I backed off and now use it several times a week to maintain what I have.  The product is a little irritating to my eyes, but not bad.  I have been using the same tube for almost 5 months and still have more to go.  I highly recommend this and will use it forever.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any results</li>
            <li> OK, I used this on my eyebrows because I thought &amp;#34;sperm&amp;#34; eyebrows were all the rage in high school, overtweezed, and am left with the aftermath now as an adult. I had great hope for this. Alas, all I received were EYEBROW ZITS. I haven&#x27;t had eyebrow zits since I was a dirty, greasy 13 year old. It&#x27;s gross at this age. I will continue to use this on my eyelashes, but for someone like me with skin that breaks out if you just look at it wrong, I&#x27;d be hesitant on the eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been jealous of people with long eyelashes!! Mine are non-existence!! I saw this thing called rapid lash... And I LOVE it!!!&lt;br /&gt;1st pic is beginning&lt;br /&gt;2nd pic is 2 weeks later&lt;br /&gt;4th pic is 4 weeks later... Keep in mind (the 3rd pic I&#x27;m wearing mascara), but there&#x27;s a huge difference!!!</li>
            <li> I have used Rapidlash in the past and it worked great. I was excited to order more, however it did not work like it did the first time I bought it. I finally realized the Rapidlash Amazon sent me was expired in 2012 ughhhh!</li>
            <li> Used for 4 weeks and found no difference on the length of my lashes or eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! Nothing dramatic, but it definitely helps.</li>
            <li> This really works!! I was paying for eyelash extensions for over two years (every three weeks &#x3D; 80 bucks a session!) and then my eyelashes started falling out. Oh sad!! But after using this for a month, my eyelashes have fully grown back in and they are so long and lush. WAY better than extensions and way cheaper! My eyelashes just rock. The extensions looked so fake too, and now my lashes just look real, healthy and full and long!  When I read they hit my glasses! ha ha Wow, thank you for making a product that really works and is so affordable!</li>
            <li> Could only use for two nights because of severe eye irritation. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if it works yet</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, this actually works!</li>
            <li> It takes some time but this product truly works!  But again, you will not see a difference for about a month, but if you keep using it on a regular daily basis it honestly works.  I have been amazed at how long my lashes have become....(I used to order this through another beauty website and paid much more for it - I&#x27;m SO GLAD Amazon carries it)...I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now and my lashes almost literally hit my eyeglasses when I put them on.</li>
            <li> Works well!! I got also purchased for my mother who had lost her eyebrows and lashes (due to menopause) and she actually has lashes now!!!</li>
            <li> gift for wife. don&#x27;t know if it works.</li>
            <li> It works great, especially when I remember to use it several nights in a row.  My eyelashes and eyebrows are fuller.</li>
            <li> This product does work.  After 4-5 weeks I saw a big improvement in my lashes.  However, it took me that long to figure out that the Rapidlash was causing some big problems.  Looking back I realized that right from the beginning when I would get up in the morning I would feel shaky all over my body.  This had never happened before but I thought it was just a one time thing, but it continued everyday. I wasn&#x27;t making the connection yet that I was using the Rapidlash just before bed and waking up shaky.  It progressed to the point that my thigh muscles felt like jello and I would have to support myself on furniture when walking.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was wrong.  I was very afraid. Finally, it all came together for me.  I stopped using the Rapidlash and the next morning marked improvement.  I, of course have stopped using it and things have returned to normal.  Mine may be an isolated case, but I wanted to report this in case someone starts to feel as I did they would have a heads up that it may be the Rapidlash.</li>
            <li> Wow this really works!! I really didn&#x27;t expect much when I ordered this product but thought I would give it a try. My lashes are already somewhat long but I wanted them to be fuller and longer. I started to notice a difference after about a month but after consistent use for several months the result are amazing! I have had several people ask me if I had eyelash extensions put on. My lashes are fuller and longer. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.  Another product that promises big but is a waste of money.  I&#x27;ve reached the point with the cosmetic, health and weight loss industries that I&#x27;m fed up with all the false claims and phoney testimonials and now only buy things that have been recommended by people I trust and who have proven results.  So many industries these days have forgotten what &amp;#34;truth in advertising&amp;#34; means in pursuit of the almighty buck.  It&#x27;s disappointing.  Apart from  the importance of ethics, I&#x27;d be worried about bad karma.</li>
            <li> Erm.....this doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Works fast and eyelashes really do grow in quickly.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now, my lashes have gotten a little longer.....maybe 1-2 millimeters max....not so sure about the volume, but definitely length improvement. the only reason i didnt give this product 5 stars is because i wake up every morning with either some white substances on my lashes or a lot of eye boogers.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for use on my eyebrows, not eyelashes. After 6 weeks, I would have to say that I think I saw a slight improvement in the eyebrow that needed it the least. However, the eyebrow that really needed it, has not improved. I say just keep penciling them in......</li>
            <li> It works , not nearly as fast as similar products I&#x27;ve used but it&#x27;s also half the price!</li>
            <li> Used it for 8 weeks - did nothing.</li>
            <li> First of all, I received it in great condition.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and my lashes are darker and thicker. I&#x27;m not sure about the length but I&#x27;m going to start keeping track now on. Still, it is a great product</li>
            <li> I have used this product for almost 6 weeks. It hasn&#x27;t seemed to do much for me.My brows &amp; lashes seem longer but not thicker. I bought it for my eyebrows mostly but tried it on my lashes as well. Since my eyelashes are blond &amp; hard to see I waited for a month before putting on mascara. My lashes seemed longer and a little thicker but not fuller. My brows still have some bald spots but the hair seems longer &amp; a little thicker so they aren&#x27;t so noticeable.</li>
            <li> I had eyelash extensions, and since i had a few left I pulled them out myself which left me with really short eyelashes. So I bought this item, have been using it for 5 weeks and my eyelashes grew out. However, i was expecting them to grow really long like other customers had claimed, but they didn&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t be disappointed though, it did it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> According to ingredients listed., this product contains isopropyl cloprostenate, the main ingredient that makes lashes darker, fuller &amp; more youthful. What I received was a revamped version of rapidlash containing none of the ingredients that lead to lash growth.</li>
            <li> My first review I did not see much improvement ... which was about 1 month of use.  However 2 months of use and now I have seen very little eyelash growth but my eyebrows HAVE been growing and filling in. I have to pluck where I had not had to in years. I will be reordering as I think with another bottle or two I will not have to use an eyebrow pencil at all. Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> Ok unbelievably this product works. I had surgery and they messed up my eyebrow with tape. So I got a waxing done by taking a chunk of my eyebrow uuuggh but kinda funny. I was a little distraught and my eyelashes on that side were messed up too. Ok already my brow is coming back and lashes. I am thrilled. I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect but I read all the product reviews on the many lash serums Amazon has to offer. This had almost a 5 star rating so I went with it. One happy customer did the research for customers looking and talked about the peptides in this product and only 2 others. This was in my price range and I am so happy I got it. I know not all products work for everyone but this works for me. I wish I had taken before and after pictures. By the way this has started growth within 3 weeks. I hope this helps your search. Great product that really works!!! Thank you Rapidlash for putting a product out there that does what it says it will. Happy happy customer</li>
            <li> This is the best product EVER for growing your eyebrows!!  After years of trying tons of products with minimal or no results I am happy to say I found this product. I had dramatic results after only 2 weeks of using the product. And now on my second bottle I almost have my dream eyebrows!!  I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I was dubious, but willing to give it a try.  My lashes are short and tend to fall out in ways that leave tiny bald patches on my eyelids.  After using this for a month I was really pleasantly surprised to see that not only were my lashes longer, but had filled in nicely in the little bare patches.  Did not notice any itching/burning reaction or other allergic issues, and I usually have pretty sensitive skin.  Hope this keeps up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many eyelash enhancers.  This is the best by far.  Lashes appeared thicker and fuller within 10 days.  No irritation to eyes.</li>
            <li> I started using this product on Dec 5, 2010.  I am 67 yrs old and I had almost no lashes.  I SURE DO NOW! I used it almost every day and haven&#x27;t run out yet.  What a deal!</li>
            <li> simply did not work. no change at all, even when using it properly.</li>
            <li> I put this on the area where the lashes meet my lids.  I&#x27;ve read the instructions many times and I still can&#x27;t understand where to apply it.  I don&#x27;t use everyday and I probably average 5 to 6 times per week.  I&#x27;m on my third week.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my lashes are longer but not thicker.  Maybe I don&#x27;t use it everyday or maybe I should give it more time.  But I&#x27;m quite happy with this longer lashes.  Next up, thicker lashes. So I will buy aother tube again for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using RapidLash for about three weeks and already notice longer lashes.  I wasn&#x27;t really expecting to see a change this soon but because my lashes were so short I really can see an improvement.  There have been no side effects, such as itching or darkening of the skin that was mentioned as possible, just longer lashes.  For me, this is a dream product!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over 2 weeks and see significant growth in my lashes...I have not missed a night of application...it is easy to apply and I have never gotten any in my eye..will continue to use since my eyelashes for some reason just became short and stubbly.</li>
            <li> I tried this on the recommendation of a friend who clearly had success with it. After a couple of months I was ready to give up, when about the 3rd month some of my lashes started getting noticeably longer. I&#x27;m on my second tube, and after a little over 4 months, all my lashes are really long. They aren&#x27;t really thicker, but I&#x27;ll take what I can get. Maybe that will happen yet.  They are darker, too which is a huge plus for me. I have no real cons to report; keep it on the base of your top lashes without getting it into your eyes before it dries, otherwise it can sting a little. It dries fast tho. And Amazon&#x27;s price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Rapidlash works within the 3 week period indicated on the instructions.  I thought it was fun to have longer lashes!</li>
            <li> Works great on eyelashes, they are longer than I can believe. So far, hasn&#x27;t really done anything for my eyebrows though, and that is the reason I bought it in the first place. Can&#x27;t beat how great it works on the lashes though!</li>
            <li> Received product very quick. My usual orders from Amazon are for books and they seem to take forever 7-21 days.  The lash product was received in the same week as my order. 3-4 days.  I am already seeing results with this product after 2 1/2 weeks. I have recommended this product to friends.</li>
            <li> not as good as latisse but def worth the money. i saw results after a month. my lashes are longer and thicker! i love it!</li>
            <li> Works well.....being in my 60&#x27;s the eyelashes and brows start to thin. I started using this product a year ago. I don&#x27;t think it took more than two weeks to see the difference. My lashes got longer, darker and even have a curl to them....great product!</li>
            <li> have been using for 2 weeks still have not seen much hair grow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over 5 weeks that I have been using Rapidlash, as directed and at this time I see no visible difference in my short, blond eyelashes.  I was hoping that I will end up with lush, long and darker lashes as my friend did, however, she did use a much more expensive product.  I will continue to use Rapidlash and hope that my lashes will sprout shortly. From the various reviews I see that it works differently for different people, so it just a matter of investing in Rapidlash and see what happens.</li>
            <li> OMG...... It really works ! I was having my lashes done every week for years, now. Spending hundred s of dollars a month. It&#x27;s been just about a month since I started using Rapidlash. My lashes have never looked better ! I love Rapidlash ! Thank you to the lady in the tanning salon who told me about this product. I have had to have my lashes trimmed down, because they were growing up to my eye brows. I love it, they are thick and full. No more false lashes for me. I now have my own beautiful thick, long lashes. I am going to buy a few Rapidlashes  this time to have on hand. Thats how much I love this product, it really work, and Ive tryed everything on the market. \\&quot;This is the way to go\\&quot;. With-in 2 week you will see a difference ! I promise, check it out ladies. You will love it. too !  Oh .....and when you do use mascara OMG.... it what I allways wanted my lashes to look like,and the days when I dont were mascara I still have big beautilul lashes. This is a must have !   Treat yourself, ladies !</li>
            <li> Even after reading the reviews on this product before I bought it I was still a little skeptical, but now I am convinced.  I&#x27;ve been using Rapidlash now for just about a month and I can already see growth.  I think if I just keep up with applying it every night I will attain the results I was hoping for.  As far as the results I have gotten from this product in a rather short time frame, I really think its worth a try.</li>
            <li> As someone who wears contacts, I have to suggest if you do as well, you’ll want to try this. Other brands make me blink like I have ocd. Other brands end up flecking my lenses with bat guano. Other brands smear my face like a raccoon. Other brands are just awful.</li>
            <li> I carefully read the reviews before purchasing this product because it seemed to work pretty well.  But I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my lashes after consistently using it for four months. :(</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t even been three weeks yet and both my husband and I can see results. I have been using it everyday, and the only side effects are slight dryness and mild very mild itching- only twice, feels like when your eyelash is getting ready to fall out itch. Nothing wierd or untolerable. I even got it in my eye and nothing happened. No burning, ect. I can&#x27;t wait untill 4-6 weeks if my eyelashes are this long already who knows how long they will get. I will post a youtube demo of this product if they get any longer and be a serious rapidlash fan!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, buying this after a friend recommended it (she bought it at CVS for about $50).  After a few weeks, I have to say, it really works.  My eyelashes are longer and don&#x27;t look skimpy anymore.  I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re darker, but they are absolutely thicker!  You just have to be patient, as it takes some time to work, but I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I had been using Li Lash for a few months with spectacular results, longer, thicker, curlier.  I decided to try Rapidlash because it was about half the cost.  Using Rapidlash at the same frequency I had been using Li Lash, I lost ALL of the growth and results I had seen in previous months.  Such a bummer.</li>
            <li> No results yet and my eyes feel so tired after that. Don&#x27;t know what is wrong with this product, cause I&#x27;ve used it before and the result was amazing.</li>
            <li> amazing results! id recommend it, but it&#x27;s my little secret ;) i do get slightly red eyelids, but i dont care! this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> this is my 4th tube of rapidlash, my second from amazon (they have the best prices) i absolutley love this product, i get comments all the time from people asking me if my lashes are real. they are longer and thicker and darker thank you rapidlash and amazon, i will continue to buy this product from amazon.</li>
            <li> Very good shopping experience&lt;br /&gt;Though I still haven&#x27;t seen results, suppose in 3 months...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never know whether this product works or not.  I had to discontinue using it due to itching, eye irritation, and the dark under eye circles mentioned by another reviewer. Purchase with care.</li>
            <li> I am a 55, and the lack of hormones has effected my eyelashes so I thought I would give this a try.  What a difference it has made, my lashes can actually touch my glasses.  Having long lashes does make you look younger and more attractive.  Do not hesitate to order this product.  Amazon has the best price around.</li>
            <li> Many of my eyelashes and eyebrows fell out last year after I had a terrible bronchial infection that dragged on and on and I had to take a very strong antibiotic. I started using Rapidlash on both my eyelashes and on my brows and after 6 weeks my lashes have completely grown back in and are longer than before. My brows have filled in too. The product does cause my brows to itch a little, but nothing nagging and I can put up with the occasional itch in order to have brows and lashes again!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Rapid Lash for almost a year and I can&#x27;t believe how well it works.   I have never had lashes this full and long and my eyebrows which previously were skimpy at best, have filled in nicely.   I will make sure that I never run out of Rapid Lash.</li>
            <li> In order for this to work, you need to be consistent and day to day with application...pricey...</li>
            <li> Just have a little patience, this stuff really does work. In two weeks I started to see positive effects. It&#x27;s important to follw the direction as noted on the package. I&#x27;m about 3 weeks in and my lashes look fuller and longer. The only draw back is, you have to continue using this product to maintain long lashes. I give this product two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I had heard very good things about Rapidlash but having used it for over a month now, I have to say I am disappointed as I have not noticed any visible results yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little more than a month and have noticed results. My lashes are fuller and longer!!!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at the idea of a lash growing serum, but after all the advertisement and friend&#x27;s comments, I decided to give it a try, especially Rapidlash is quite cheap compared to latisse or some others. After a few weeks, the length of my lashes were significantly longer! My eyelash used to be quite short to even curl it. I would use coats and coats of mascara. Now, i can just use one or two coats of masacra. So Ladies, if your looking for a cheap and efficient eyelash grower, I suggest rapidlash HANDS DOWN</li>
            <li> It works!...longer thicker lashes in 2weeks....</li>
            <li> This product works, but slowly. I would rather buy latisse and get it over with. However I have seen slow growth !!</li>
            <li> Not a real big difference, but my lashes do appear to be slighter longer.</li>
            <li> I actually was considering the perscription version of this and asked my eye doctor about it at my annual eye exam.  She said she didn&#x27;t think I need it because I have beautiful lashes already.  I told her I was using Rapid Lash for the past few weeks.  She said to keep using it because the active ingredients in both are the same.  She said with the perscription version, the price is so expensive in order to cover advertising and marketing costs.  Considering that two celebrities are spokewomen for the perscription, this makes sense.  My doctor is also not the only one to have said that the active ingredients in the two are similar.    You have to patient with this and use it consistently.  I only apply it at night per the instructions.  I have noticed that my lashes have gotten longer.  I also have a bald spot in one section and this has helped with regrowth.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any adverse side effects and recommend this.    One more note, there is more than a two month supply in each tube.  As with mascara, I think you can safely use this product for up to three months.</li>
            <li> I started using rapidlash in January 2011.  At 59, my lashes were really short and I had a lot of empty spaces.  I used to cake on the mascara just to make them show up and would have lashes fall out.  I used the product every night on both my top and bottom lashes.  After 4 weeks, I was amazed.  I could definitely see the difference on my top lashes.  Now at 12 weeks, my top lashes are more than 1/4\\&quot; long - some almost 1/2\\&quot;.  Although I wouldn&#x27;t say they are thick, most of the spaces have filled in, I have almost twice as many as before and can see more new ones at the base.  My bottom lashes are much longer and definitely thicker.  I also don&#x27;t notice anymore eyelash loss.  I thought at first that I was experiencing the brown discoloration on my skin that has been discussed here, but I don&#x27;t have any now so might just have been watching too hard for it.  I did not experience any change in the color of my eyes - they are still as blue as before.  I did experience a mild tingling sensation at first and occassional itching, but nothing that lasted longer than a minute.  I ordered a new tube - the first one lasted 2 1/2 months.  I love this product.  It has definitely worked for me.</li>
            <li> When I first started using Rapid Lash (10/10) I was so excited by the outcome. My lashes grew so long by Christmas, my bestfriend even asked me if I was wearing fake lashes. In January I started noticing that my eyelashes had stopped growing, the growing process had come to a halt. I continued using the product hoping the growing process would pick back up, but unfortunately it hasnt. Not only have my eyelashes stopped growing, they have lost all their bazzaz (thickness/fullness). I dont know what happen, but I am highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product does work.  I used it on my lashes about 8 weeks before it became noticeable.  The only side effect I had is red, burning eyes so I use it every other night.</li>
            <li> So I bought this product hoping to get my eyelashes growing as I have naturally short lashes and I don&#x27;t have a lot of volume either. So let me tell. If you don&#x27;t have it it is not gonna grow from nowhere!  I didn&#x27;t have any irritation or darkening of the skin or anything. It has been 4 weeks and nothing had changed.Looks like I am religiously putting this thing on me and absolutely NOTHING happens.I think it will help you grow your lashes back if they had been damaged but not if you didn&#x27;t have any lashes and magically they gonna appear. So yeah! Not working!</li>
            <li> I started using Rapid Lash in August 2010 and I have seen a great difference in my lashes.  My lashes are longer and stronger. I used to lose lashes all the time, but Rapid Lash has strengthened  them.  I love Rapid Lash because it works!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month and really did not see any different. It might be a little bit thicker but nothing really change in length. I took picture when i first use it and a month later and I don&#x27;t see the different</li>
            <li> I have used this serum a total of 4 times-- 3 nights, and 1 morning, on both my top and bottom lash line.    The first night I used this on my lashes, I woke up with bloodshot red eyes and the surrounding eye areas were red and puffy. My boyfriend said I looked like a racoon that got into a fight, haha! Seriously, I looked like I was up all night doing god knows what. I thought I had a bad reaction due to it seeping into my eyes. I stuck it out for the second night, and swept it on my lash line carefully. I woke up with the same side effects, although my eyes weren&#x27;t as puffy. I figured it just gets better, so I tried it out in the following morning. It didn&#x27;t really work out for me because it made my eyes dry and itchy, which I had to deal with for the whole day.    After just 3 days, both me and my boyfriend saw a difference. My eyelashes definitely look darker and longer already. I still wanted to take a break since I don&#x27;t see the point of having long beautiful lashes, if I have to deal with a bigger problem of dark red circles around my eyes.    My eyes looked a lot better when I skipped a day, and since I figure the side effects aren&#x27;t permanent, I went ahead and tried it for the fourth time last night.     This morning I woke up with no side effects, whatsoever. No dryness, itchiness, redness, and no bloodshot eyes. I think you just have to be extremely careful that this product does not seep into your eyes.    Make sure the serum dries completely before you go to sleep.    Overall, a promising product, but there ARE side effects. It just depends on what you&#x27;re willing to put up with. I will most likely keep using this product, however, if I see that there are worse side effects, I will discontinue use, and inform everyone through review.</li>
            <li> I definitely noticed a difference in my lashes after the first few weeks. Not only do they appear longer, but darker as well. Mascara goes on and comes off more smoothly, resulting in fewer lashes coming off. I will definitely continue to use this product to moisturize and care for my lashes.</li>
            <li> seems to work but little irritation with it seems to cause little minor beak out</li>
            <li> Its been a month and I do see improvement in my top lashes. I only applied the serum to the top lashes first to make sure I wouldn&#x27;t break out in some sort of allergy. I haven&#x27;t. My lashes were very sparse and short, now they have filled in some and I&#x27;m quite pleased. I just started to apply it to my bottom lashes as well. I&#x27;m going to give it at least 16 weeks to determine the full effect and hopefully, cross fingers, I won&#x27;t have to keep using false eyelashes. Will update.</li>
            <li> I been using this product for about a month, and I am still waiting to see the results. My eyelashes look the same. When I first began to use it, the next morning I had problems with my eyes (it was stinging and irritating me) but now it went away. But I see No difference. I heard that Castor oil works the best (didn&#x27;t try it yet).</li>
            <li> i was using LiLash (which is amazing) but it&#x27;s not longer for sale in the US, so i bought this as a replacement. even after i stopped using lilash for about 8 months, my lashes stayed long and strong. until rapidlash...     THIS STUFF SUCKS!!! it made my eyelashes fall out! do not use, do not buy. burn it with fire.</li>
            <li> Works as well as Brow Relonge, if not better, and less expensive.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that after 11 weeks of consistent use, I haven&#x27;t seen any changes in my eyelashes. Today I happened to look at the manufacturing date of 11/13. I received my product early 10/14, which means it&#x27;s expired after 11/14 !!! So these past 3 weeks I have wasted my time. Shame on Amazon to sell me a product so close to expiration, knowing it has a 1 yr. Shelf life from stamped mfg date on tube.&lt;br /&gt;C.R., Fl</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every night for almost 5 weeks now and there has been no change in my lashes at all!!! I feel it&#x27;s a waste of money and now I will go get my Rx from the doc and buy some Latisse which I should have done in the first place.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 months now. I was  skeptical at first on whether it would work well or maybe irritate my eyes, but I hve found that netiher of the issues were a broblem. My brown lashes are the longest and fullest, but still the same color. The color has not lightened, and mascara makes them look great. Guys are noticing!   Thank you!</li>
            <li> My lashes and brows started growing within four weeks. I am completely satisfied with this product and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this product instead of neulash because of the positive reviews.  I am dissapointed with the results.  I immediately noticed that my lashes looked healthier but after 4 weeks of use, there is absolutely no difference in the length or fullness of my lashes. Maybe the product will kick-in in a few weeks but so far..no results.    I do want to compliment the company that sent the product.  Shipping was quick and the stuff was brand new.</li>
            <li> Although I received this item in a timely manner, the tube I received contains little or no product.  This is not this first time I received an empty tube of this product (the first was directly from the mfgr!).  They need to improve their quality control. I can&#x27;t say weather or not this works, because I have never received a viable product. Amazon is sending a replacement.  We shall see what that brings.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item on November 13, 2010.  I&#x27;ve been using it consistently on my lashes and brows since I received it around November 17.  To date, there are absolutely no visual results whatsoever.  My lashes are the same as well as my brows.  The website states that it takes approximately 3-4 weeks to see results.  While this time has transpired since I began using this product, I&#x27;m going to continue using it for another 3-4 weeks to give the product ample time to work.  If I do not see results within this time, I&#x27;ll discontinue use of this product.  I remain hopeful that it will start working soon.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product once a night for 6 weeks now.  No visible results so far.  I am very disappointed especially having read a lot of positive reviews.  Hopefully i would be able to report differently after a few more weeks.    UPDATED - i just noticed the expiration date of the product - it&#x27;s MAY 2010 while i ordered it early NOV 2010!!  that is probably the reason why i still have not seen results after more than 8 weeks of application!   Would you know how I can get a refund or replacement?!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I have used others, including mascaras, but this is by FAR the best, and is amazing. It takes about 4-6 weeks for results, obviously NEW eyelashes have to grow in. The new ones that have been nourished with Rapid Lash, are stronger and mine were almost twice as long, and CURLY.  I threw my eyelash curler away.  That seemed to happen overnight after about 6 weeks.  I will NEVER be without this product.   Buy it, wait for it, and LOVE it too. Amazing is the only word I can find to describe, can&#x27;t imagine how this can work, but it does.  You will be amazed too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a month now and think that my lashes are somewhat longer.  definitely not thicker yet.  this product was recommended to me that has had great results, so i&#x27;m hopeful that in time it will work well.</li>
            <li> I have had very little eyelashes for several years.  I decided to go down and get either \\&quot;extensions\\&quot; or fake eyelashes.  Well, I was talked out of getting the expensive extensions because I wear contact lenses and the operator said they would not last as long because I would pull on my eyelids to put in my lenses.  So I ended up getting fake eyelashes and they were awful.  I looked like a butterfly had landed on my eyes...definitely looked FAKE!  I had them removed and lost even more eyelashes in the process!  UGH    At any rate, I ended up buy Rapid Lash.  I saw no change whatsoever until about the 4th week and I thought hmmmmmmm, maybe this does work.  I was thinking it was just another gimmick and I was out my $$.  Well by the 6th week I had to quit using it because my eyelashes were so long that I could not wear my glasses because they hit the lens!  Seriously!     My daughter was so impressed that I decided I would buy her some Rapid Lash for Christmas. I&#x27;m telling you....if you are ever thinking about getting extensions (which only last for a short time)....try a tube of this.  It takes less than 30 seconds to apply and it&#x27;s almost like water.  It&#x27;s painless, odorless, and boy does it work.   Give it about a month before you give up on it...you will be soooooo surprised.  Rapid Lash certainly worked for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 7 weeks and I think I almost ran out of the first tube...still no result. I have very thick long eyebrow hairs but short lashes. I would like to believe my lashes are darker after 7 weeks of usage or it might have been my wishful thinking. Bottom line: no visible difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE** 1/09/2011&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s been more than 8 weeks, I can finally see visible result...It&#x27;s definitely lengthening my lashes, the result is more pronounced with mascara application. But I&#x27;m very happy with the improvement so far, still holding my breath tho, because I want to see how long the lashes will grow to. I think I will order another tube to continue the growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give 3 stars based on the slow result, and also on one note, it does, for some reason, made the under-eye skin area very dark...I also saw similar complaints in other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE*** 2/08/2011&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now been 3 months and the result is amazing. I now i have long thick lashes with layers, kind of hard to remember what it was like before! :) Be patient and make sure you get a bottle that is not expired. It makes a big difference.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and have been using it each night for about a month, and I do not notice an improvement in the appearance of my brows, which over the years have become thin as a result of waxing and plucking them. I also noticed that my product is old. The expiration date says May 2010 and I purchased this in December 2010, so I am not pleased. Also, when I reordered someone had rubbed off the expiration date, so be on the look out for old product, and remember that an expiration date should be on the bottom of this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for around 3 years now,and it seems that I no longer am gaining the benefits I initially had.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I don&#x27;t know if the formula changed,or my lashes became \\&quot;Rapid Lash resistant\\&quot;!(is there such a thing??)&lt;br /&gt;It has never done a good job on my thin,sparse brows,but that&#x27;s NOT why I purchased it in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;My most recent delivery of the formula seemed much thinner than previous shipments&lt;br /&gt;(3years,remember),and I feel like the product is no longer working for me.&lt;br /&gt;Rapid Lash Burn Out? I dunno....I&#x27;m hoping to find something that works well for AGAIN!</li>
            <li> this is the second bottle i have ordered. i have noticed longer lashes after a few weeks of using the first bottle. i don&#x27;t think it added volume, but definitely length to my lashes. i have been applying religiously every night to maintain the longer length.</li>
            <li> I have not read any other reviews on this product since I purchased it so I am not biased one way or another. I only used it on my top eyelash line in order to conserve it. One bottle lasted me about 2 months putting the product generously on every night. After about 5 weeks I saw extremely noticeable results as did everyone else. During those 5 weeks I started to get itchy right where I would apply it and there would be a thin red line where I applied it as well. I was not too concerned as I read the side effects beforehand until I started getting red bumps almost like a sty on my eyelid, my eyes were bloodshot all the time as well liek they were irritated and I thought this would go away (never did). They were so itchy and looked bad. I stopped using the product immediately and all side effects went away after about a month.    All in all my eyeslashes have been short and brittle forever, this product made them long and beautiful, but I am not sure what is best, long, beautiful lashes with red bumps and bloodshot eyes or short lashes....?? It&#x27;s been over a year since I used rapidlash and now I am going to try lashipix as it is scientifically backed up and no one has reported any side effects.....we shall see!</li>
            <li> Product works just as promised...I was using a much more expensive prescription product and got tired of paying $100/+ every time I ran out.  I think this works almost as well.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t done anything for me.  I got a infection in my right lid.</li>
            <li> Rapid Lash its a great product that give us excellent and quickly results. My lashes are growing so fast, and long, and it is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying this is my first review on any product ever. Let me follow that by saying that yes, you might think I&#x27;m a &#x27;plant&#x27; or something because of that, but the fact is that it is because I just never am motivated enough by a product to write a review.  I mean, I have the thing already, right? That is, until now. Anyway, my motivation for this comes from the fact that I was frustrated by the lack of information on exactly *why* this product works - add to that the mixture of experiences seen by reviewers - amplified by the fact that this thing is $50. $50! Unless you&#x27;re making serious bank, that&#x27;s a significant investment into something you don&#x27;t know very much about.     Some background on myself: I have asian-like eyelashes (I&#x27;m part asian). If you don&#x27;t know anything about them, they tend to be short, straight, and sparse. Asians have a lot going for them, but eyelashes is not one of those things.    I started using it about 3 weeks ago pretty religiously for me, which means once a day (sometimes 2x a day even though instructions say this is useless). At first, I put it on once at night and once during the day, only on the upper lash line. After a few days, I concluded that it does irritate my eyes and it&#x27;s not allergy season (in January, ha), and began sticking to only putting it on at night.     All the time, I&#x27;m still frustrated because I can&#x27;t find any conclusive decisions on whether it works or not, or how it works, etc. etc. As of now, I still don&#x27;t have a really clear idea of why it works, how well it works, but ...      drum roll      I was looking in the mirror a few minutes ago and I undoubtedly have way more lashes on both my upper and lower lash lines. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s that that adds the illusion of volume or what but everything looks better. Longer, more populated lash areas. It&#x27;s wonderful. Maybe I&#x27;ll expand more on this later. I wanted this to be quick and maaan, okay, I&#x27;m going. I hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product works or not, I was only able to use it for 3 days.  I&#x27;d put it on before going to bed and I&#x27;d wake up with itchy red eyelids.  Probably not the best for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I had heard great things about this product and was eager to try it. Unfortunately I reacted to it in a very unpleasant way. On the third day of usage I developed red oozing eyes so I stopped it and the eyes cleared up quickly. I might just be super sensitive so I would not discourage anyone from trying it.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with product  and it was delivered on time.</li>
            <li> this product is absolutely amazing,&lt;br /&gt;I have never have beautiful lashes, they are naturally straight down. However If I apply a nice mascara my lashes will look good. Early this year I started noticing that I started to loose many lashes and the ones I had left were half the size . Also my favorite mascara started looking all ugly. I know I started to loose lashes because how much I use mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give this product a try and see how it went. The first night my eye was really itchy but I left it all night long. I&#x27;m not good with routines so I was using it every other night and I also start applying mascara every other day and I will just curl my lashes so I didn&#x27;t look sleepy lol.&lt;br /&gt;Well last week I noticed that my lashes were looking great with mascara, when I removed the mascara I saw that the ones I lost were back and the ones that were half the size were really long!&lt;br /&gt;The application is really easy, no makeup on, and you apply that clear liquid all over your lash line (like if you were lining your eyes). It is kind of uncomfortable at the beginning and my eyes were a little irritated the first week.&lt;br /&gt;Now my eyes are used to it and I love this product.  I will use it from now on!&lt;br /&gt;I also saw this product in bed bath and beyond for $42.</li>
            <li> I used this product, typically nightly, for two months.  My eyelashes did seem longer, which was a nice.  However a few days ago, I woke up and my eye was horribly red. It was so bad that I thought I had pink eye and went to the doctor.  However, my eye wasn&#x27;t itchy and I wasn&#x27;t having discharge. A day later, my other eye started looking red too, although not as bad.  After doing some more research online about rapidlash, it became clear to me that this product likely caused this. I stopped using it and the red is gradually fading. The health of my eyes is really something I don&#x27;t want to mess with and I should have known better than to apply some product to my eyes.. lesson learned!</li>
            <li> Was so excited about using this product with all the great reviews until I saw a recent post regarding product being expired. All 3 of my purchases were expired in 2010 and just purchased! I wouldn&#x27;t drink milk dated with that late of an expiration so why would I put something on my eyes that expired 6+ months ago?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had lash extensions before but the maintenance was just too annoying for me. My original lashes are okay but nothing spectacular so I wanted something to make my eyes pop more. I&#x27;ve been using Rapidlash for about 3 weeks now. I can definitely see new hair growth especially on my lower lashes. For some reason, my right eye&#x27;s lashes is growing faster than my left eye, but it&#x27;s not an extremely noticeable difference. My lashes tend to curl as a whole but there are a few rebel lashes that are straight. At first the skin around my eyes were darkened but it went away after a few more days of application. My skin sometimes itches a tiny bit but goes away within a minute. I am pretty satisfied so far with the growth but my lashes haven&#x27;t grown like weeds like some other people had the fortune of noticing. I&#x27;m jealous :(. Hopefully after a few more weeks, I&#x27;ll get that false lash effect!</li>
            <li> So when I heard about Lash growing serums, I was sceptical.  I already tried out the Maybelline Jade lash growth serum (from that fancy Eva Longoria commercial) and was excited to get my lashes fuller and darker - with the Maybelline Jade product, NOTHING happened...    When I looked around Amazon, I found couple of different Lash growing serums.. reading the Latisse reviews, I was scared that I would get a product which would darken my natural eye colour, so I was hesitant to buy RapidLash.  After reading many reviews, I had a feeling that barely no one claimed to have these kind of side effects. With the big price lowering I decided to give it a try.    So what did my lashes look like, before I started using RapidLash? They have not exactly been very short, nor were they very long... not too blond, but not very dark either. My problem was, that because I use a lash curler every day (my lashes are straight, they don&#x27;t have a natural curl AT ALL), I loose a lot of lashes.. there have been spots where I would constantly loose lashes, which really gave me VISIBLE holes in my lashes when I put mascara on. I am only 20 years old, by the way.  As told by RapidLash, I kept applying the product to my upper lashline every day before I went to sleep. I did not do it on my lower lashline, nor on my brows, so I do not know if the product gives you undereye circles or if it helps growing your brows (which I am sure it helps, if I would need it!!). It is true, that when you wake up in the morning, your eyes have more of that \\&quot;dirt\\&quot;-stuff (little morning crumbs) that seals them over night, but when you wash your face with water, it all goes away. My eyes did not swollen or anything.    After using it every day for a month, I started to see the difference!! When I curled my lashes, I could definately see, that they were growing LONGER and that the gaps in my lashline did disappear!!! Now, when I put mascara on, my lashes are just gorgeously long. It does not look faked or anything, it&#x27;s just really nice. I still apply the serum every night, just to see, if it can get even better.  I have read a couple of times, that after more time, your lashes get a natural curl and tend to get darker than without using the product.. I hope that will happen in the next month, but only for getting LONGER and MORE lashes, I would definately recommend buying this product!    I only give RapidLash 4 out of 5 stars, because I think that 4 weeks are a long time to see result, but of course, you DO see them after a month. And it also misses out on the additional star, because my lashes did not get darker.. but of course, it is a GROWING, not a DARKENING serum, but that&#x27;s just what I think for now, after having used this product for one and a half month.. and YES, I will buy another bottle right now, just to keep my lashes the way they are now!</li>
            <li> First of all, I started with ok lashes as far as length and thickness. They looked fine with mascara, however were quite limp. I had always found that they responded well to using a curler if I used waterproof mascara after. Otherwise they would almost immediately lose the curl and return to their original limp state. That being said, I still wanted thicker and longer lashes. Prior to using this product I had used a similarly priced one for eight weeks with no results (until the tube was empty). I tried this one based on reviews and after eight weeks could see a noticeable difference in both length and thickness. Now, after 4 months (and almost at the end of the tube) my lashes are even thicker and longer than at the 8 week mark and now hold curl with washable mascara. I do use the product probably 6 out of 7 nights and honestly did not see results until 8 weeks. I&#x27;ve got a new tube on reserve and plan to continue using this. I&#x27;m beyond happy with my lashes now! The photo below is after 4 months without curling or mascara.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product elsewhere and have been pleased with the results.  The same product purchasd from Amazon does not seem to have as much product in the container as when I purchased it from a beautician.  I question if the product was old or evaporated.</li>
            <li> Lashes were becoming sparce as were my eyebrows. Kathie Lee Gifford showed how thick her lashes were because of Rapidlash.She said she wasn&#x27;t going to pay the price of the presc. formula and loved Rapidlash. Bought it and within a month, my lashes and brows are thicker, especially my lashes. My daughters noticed so it must be working. I&#x27;ll begin my second tube tonight and have ordered two more tubes. I want to always have one to use and one in the drawer..!! [...]</li>
            <li> It helped me grow thicker, longer eyelashes. A 27 year old was jealous of my lashes, (I&#x27;m 54) so it is helping. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> The second time I bought this product it seemed that the item was almost on empty.  I am extremely disappointed with this product the second time around.  The first time the product lasted me three months and I was happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Of the two products I was interested in, I selected this one because it had a lot of positive reviews and cost wise it was the most reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m guessing that everyones experience and the length of time before results appear will be different.  My results appeared faster than expected...after only two weeks of applying a thin layer to the base of my eyelashes, as directed, my lashes were noticeably longer and more defined!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this again?  No hesitation, absolutely!&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend?  YES!</li>
            <li> I guess it could work but I stopped using it on the third day. It gave me pink eye and when it got here the box was closed but it was all written on and very wrinkly if that makes sence. Also I bought it before realizing it doesn&#x27;t do permanent changes.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 4 weeks now...every night...and...nothing has changed. Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> Been using this product off and on for about 3 years! My eyelashes don&#x27;t stay long when I&#x27;m not using it however it&#x27;s great whenever you are low on lashes or missing any! Def recommend this if you want fuller longer lashes!</li>
            <li> I tried the serum and found that the wand was too small. The serum burned my skin and I was unable to use it.</li>
            <li> Great customer service, but I don&#x27;t like the product because it irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> Irritated my eyes. Made them feel pasty. Didn&#x27;t use long enough to see results.</li>
            <li> I can not see any difference after three weeks.  I will give it a chance and continue to use it until I use what I have paid for.</li>
            <li> I started using this product last February and have not been without it since. My eyelashes are longer, my eyebrows are no longer thinning.</li>
            <li> Its really great.. The first couple of days i did experience a little bit of irritation around my eyes but now I forget i even have it on. Im on week 4 and i can already see a difference my lashes are longer and a lil fuller</li>
            <li> I had almost no visible eye lashes.  I have been using Rapidlash for just over 3 weeks and have seen a really nice results !</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;m So happy I bought it! And will continue to! My lashes are longer and thicker and darker and it&#x27;s only been 5 weeks. I bought it because I guess I am somewhat alergic to a lot of mascaras. I had taken a chance and bought this type that adds fibers to your lashes and then you add their mascara over it. It looked cool. About a month later about a third of my eyelashes on my left eye had fallen out in the middle. I went back to my lancome mascara immediately. But even after a few months they were not growing back and the couple of lashes I would get would fall out.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely take before and after pictures. I am truely amazed. It&#x27;s just been over a month. Happy girl!</li>
            <li> After one use I have developed eyeball pain.  I found a comprehensive review online and will no longer use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just opened my third tube of RapidLash, in about 8 months.  I apply this product to the upper lash line each night, after washing my face ,and before applying any skincare products.  Then allow to dry.  I have seen a big improvement in the length and thickness, as well as color of my lashes.  They are darker as well as fuller and longer.  After being ill in 2008, and on an IV antibiotic, my lashes and brows were so thin an sparse. I haven&#x27;t used it on brows as I had them professionally tatooed as a Birthday gift.  Had 1/2 brows s it was a great treat. I am not saying this is a miracle for your lashes, but it is a huge improvement.  I&#x27;ve never used the perscription product, so can&#x27;t compare it. I learned of this from Kathy and Hoda on their portion of the Today Show.  Kathy uses it and has for some time.  She swears by it.  They did show a close up of her, without mascara on \\&quot;no makeup day\\&quot;.  It was pretty incredible.  I&#x27;ve not seen a before of her though, without makeup.  In any case, I am going to stick with it.  It&#x27;s worth doing at this price.  I paid almost about $50 for my first tube, on another website.  Glad I checked with Amazon before buying the second one.</li>
            <li> I have used this at the base of my eyelashes, as directed, for 6 weeks now.  I have watched carefully, often adding my lower lashes as well, because they are getting thinner as I age, just like the top lashes.  I&#x27;ve even doubled up on the coverage, in hopes that ot would help.  Nothing.  Nada.  Zip.  My eyelashes are exactly as they were before.  I was lucky, as I did not have an allergic reaction as some buyers explained.  But this product is a serous waist of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want the long, dark, full lashes of your youth, find a picture of yourself from way back then, and feel greatful that you even have eyelashes... Or eyes, for that matter.  And if that doesn&#x27;t help you, find some easy to adhere false eyelashes.  That is just my advice.</li>
            <li> It took a really long time to notice a difference. Even after months it wasn&#x27;t that dramatic so I never did reorder. I think I will try Lilash next time because I know people who had better results with that brand.</li>
            <li> This is my third tube of this, and it&#x27;s made such a big difference in my eyelashes. They have become thicker and longer.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Following the directions to a \\&quot;t\\&quot; but no sign of extra or longer lashes yet.  About a month into it at this point - maybe something will show up in the next couple of weeks.  Hope springs eternal.</li>
            <li> I have been fooled may times by products making wonderful claims, but this product does what it says! My lashes were so thin that even with mascara they were hard to see. I tried the new masccaras that are suppose to \\&quot;extend and magnify\\&quot; your lashes, but the mascara was so thick and heavy it actually pulled out my lashes! I have used Rapidlash for 2 months now and I can see longer and darker lashes than I have had in 20 years. I am 62 and gave up on having pretty eyes, but now, even without mascara, I have lashes again! I even used it on my eyebrows which had become thin out from years of arching, and they have filled back in nicely too. Now if I could find a face lifting product I could afford that works as well as Rapidlash!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002WTC38O International Research Labs Rapidlash Eyelash Enhancing Serum (3ml), 0.1-fluid ounces Bottle]]  This product really works! I am a lover of the eyelash curler, and use one almost daily, but the downfall is breakage and sparse areas. Rapidlash really helps improve the health of my eyelashes. I do my best to use it nightly, and have seen wonderful results! After only two weeks of usage, my lashes are longer and those sparse areas have begun filling in. I totally recommend it! I used it this summer also, and gave my eyelashes a \\&quot;rest\\&quot; from the eyelash curler, and couldn&#x27;t believe how long they grew!</li>
            <li> Have been using product for about three weeks.  My eyelashes seem   longer but not necessarily thicker. Will keep using to see if  there is further change.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, i tried it just for the sake of trying so far no significant change in my eyelash. Haven&#x27;t try on my eyebrow maybe I should.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s lashes tripled in number and length and fullness, in about two months. You can see them from across the room!</li>
            <li> One of the most amazing products I have ever encountered.  I cannot believe how much it has changed my lashes.  I didn&#x27;t notice a change for the first month or so---but then I started to notice and then BOOM!  My lashes were VERY noticeably longer.  My mother was in awe and claims it looks like I have fake lashes-so I bought her some for Christmas.  My best friend also noticed and bought some for herself.  I am getting married in a few months and I won&#x27;t even need to wear fake lashes.  I never had long lashes and I thought I never would.  I would recommend this product to everyone I know.  (Also, I have had this bottle since October and it still has not run out!!)</li>
            <li> I was using LiLash for over 2 years with great results however it is very expensive so I decided to use something cheaper.  Big mistake.  My eyes will not stop watering until I wash it off.  Never had that problem with LiLash.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> Have yet to see results.  Saw real results with Latisse though.</li>
            <li> Although I do not see an AMAZING amount of new eye lashes...I do see the difference. My eye lashes are also darker. I like the product and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the last couple of months. I really think it has been making my lashes longer and healthier. I have even gotten compliments! I think it is a great product for the money.</li>
            <li> I havent been using this serum daily as I should but I try not to skip too many days. I do see a difference in my lashes. They appear to be fuller since I&#x27;ve started the product about 2 weeks ago. For best results you are supposed to apply it on daily so I really need to get into the habit of daily use to really maximize my lashes. The product is legit so try it out!</li>
            <li> I use it all the time, I&#x27;m on my 4th tube, I love the results.  Everyone comments on how long my eyelashes are. It&#x27;s a great  product. You have to comment to using it every nite, just get  in the habit and you&#x27;ll love the results.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works - mostly for length. But, if you quit using it, your lashes go back to normal in a couple of weeks.  The price is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I have used rapidlash for 2 yrs and it definitely has worked for me!  Had no lashes previously, and now I do.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for a year and still has some to spare. This product really works, and goes a LONG way. I think anyone that buys this, will be as happy as she is. Ita has shown great improvement in her overall legnth and thickness in her lashes. And the results only took a few weeks....and it is cheaper than Latese, and the tube lasts longer. Enjoy![[ASIN:B002WTC38O International Research Labs Rapidlash Eyelash Enhancing Serum (3ml), 0.1-fluid ounces Bottle]]</li>
            <li> I bought this product to replace my love for the very costly Latisse. So after having used Latisse, it was interesting to see how this would match up.    This product does work, however, you need to give it time. You will start to see subtle results in about 4 weeks, but it&#x27;s after having used it for about 2 months did I start to get compliments by others. Just stick with it. If you have ever used Latisse, do not expect this product to work as fast.     When I first started using this, it did mildly sting my eyelids, but I would go away after a couple of minutes. The product does have a warning about that. After continued use, it went away completely. That was the only side effect I had. Unlike Latisse, this does not leave that ugly brown line on your eye lid where you apply it- so no eye lid pigmentation, which I love.      I would def recommend this product to others, but you must be patient and it will do the job!</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product at another place in the past and it really worked.  This time it has only been 30 days so it hasn&#x27;t had time to really be visible.  I am hoping in another 30 days I will notice a difference. It took 90 days to really notice a difference. Last time it worked so good my eyelashes hit my sunglasses.</li>
            <li> after one month I can see definite length improvement.  I&#x27;m still undetermined if they are fuller yet though.  seems like there is plenty of product to last for 2-3 months</li>
            <li> This product has performed well for me so far.  After 2 weeks I noticed a definite increase in softness and flexibility of my eyelashes.  After 4 weeks I regained  pointed tips to my lashes instead of blunt fuzzy ends and after 5 weeks the ends of my lashes have increased curliness.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the third week of religiously applying this product every night, and I am still waiting for some miracle to happen. I know it takes \\&quot;4-5 weeks\\&quot;, but being half way through that period, I&#x27;d imagine I should start seeing any changes, but there are none so far. No side effects, no itching, no discoloration, and no longer eyelashes either.     I have doubts so far, but I will continue applying, and if anything changes or happens \\&quot;overnight\\&quot; I will update my review. So far, two stars.</li>
            <li> I posted another review of rapid lash serum for a similar product but I wanted to add my two cents here.  I love this product and it does work. I applied it every night for 4 weeks and noticed no difference but I continued applying it for another two weeks and my lashes started growing in. My lower lashes are MUCH longer than they used to be and my top lashes are denser and thicker.  I no longer wear black mascara-the results are that good.  I can&#x27;t vouch for any other lash products, this is the only one I have used but I am very happy.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for the money and it WORKS! I found this product a few years ago on line. My eyelashes had gotten thinner over time,  after just a few weeks my eyelashes were getting fuller and longer! For some reason I decided to take before and after photos, the results blew me away! So pleased with the results I sent the company photos thanking them for the amazing product, and they asked to use my photos. I did have a little darkening color on my putter corner of my eye but that faded!&lt;br /&gt;Forget all those fiber mascara, lash extensions, false lashes etc etc and all the up keep that goes with that mess! You can have YOUR OWN LASHES, growing long and thick...for REAL. I rarely leave much feedback or reviews..unless it&#x27;s something that works!!! Prepare to be amazed!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, like a lot of other reviewers, and I don&#x27;t know why, but it worked great for me!  I don&#x27;t see any impressive ingredients, but my lashes grew back long, thicker and darker.  Would recommend giving it a try before getting soaked for the ultra expensive products.  Note; I used it every night, religiously.  I did not put on any eye cream at night while using this, nothing that would interfere with the product&#x27;s action.  I began to notice results in about 3 weeks.  Once I had the results I wanted, I only use it occasionally, like once or twice a month.  Also, learn to sleep on your back!  My eyelashes were very damaged from a lifetime of sleeping with my face smooshed into the pillow!</li>
            <li> I started using this product with a little skepticism, but hey I have $20.00 (okay, it was a little more, but still inexpensive)and the hope it could actually work.   I already have long eyelashes, so my goal was to increase the eyelash density to be more in keeping with what I had as a teenager.   It&#x27;s taken 6 weeks -longer than I hoped- but ITS WORKING!! What I am seeing is not a uniform growth pattern of longer than normal lashes, but rather, a few eyelashes at the outside corners of my eyes having exceptional growth. The effect is what I would have if I purchased and applied a few false eyelashes and applied only at the outside corners. The over-all growth of my lashes is there, but it is especially noticeable at the outside corners.     As for my wish of having more eyelashes, that seems to be improving as well. I have some very sparse spots on my lower lashes, and now I am seeing very fine, stubby new growth. I can&#x27;t wait for these sparse areas to fill in!   I&#x27;ve experienced minor irritation, only in the first week of use, and easily resolved with eye drops. Since then, I&#x27;ve had no issues, and I plan on continuing the use of this product. Hardest part is the required patience, but it is well rewarded. Go for it!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with how well this product worked. This is the first time ever that I have tried any eyelash serum and had previously been hooked on false lashes. those were such pain in the butt! I put on a thin layer every night before I go to bed and within maybe 3-5 days there was a pretty noticable difference on the condition of my eyelashes. I hadn&#x27;t seen my best friend since before I started using this product and when I saw her again she seriously thought I had been wearing fake lashes. The only thing is you have to be very diligent about using this every single night, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t seem like your lashes are as long the next morning. The mascara you use is important as well, but whenever I get mistaken for wearing false lashes, I&#x27;m usually wearing just Lash Blast. I had been struggling to find the right mascara that would really make the little corner lashes stand out, but after using this product I swear I&#x27;ve had brand new lashes grow and now they look a lot fuller. I have always had rather long lashes, but this makes them look even longer and fuller to where I don&#x27;t have to use so much mascara in the morning. It is DEFINITELY worth a try!</li>
            <li> My mother started using this and noticed a difference so she gave me some to try.  At first, I was disappointed.  After a month I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference.  But after the first month I began feeling a difference in the texture of my lashes.  Perhaps it is because I don&#x27;t wear make-up every day that it took me so long to realize that this stuff is amazing!  I cannot believe how long my lashes are.  I&#x27;ve never had to use a lash curler before because my lashes were not long enough but now I may have to invest in one because I&#x27;ve never had lashes like this before.  My daughter, who is blessed with thick and long lashes, may never need this in her lifetime.  Still, as we get older our lashes do thin out.  I&#x27;m going to make sure she knows this stuff is out there and then cross my fingers that it doesn&#x27;t go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t give up after a few weeks because it isn&#x27;t an instantaneous change and I am not typically a patient person.</li>
            <li> It works. My mum says my eyelash like a doll and I bought another one.</li>
            <li> after reading the hundreds of raving reviews about rapid lash i bought it.  Ive used it now for six weeks.  absolutely NOTHING happened, except some red burning eyes.  I was sure if i stuck with it, it would eventually work like everyone claimed.  someone from the company must be sitting and typing these reviews all day, because it really does NOTHING!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought so many cosmetics that make the claim &amp;#34;You&#x27;ll see a difference!&amp;#34;, and I really didn&#x27;t see any difference at all. Not this one! This one absolutely does what it claims - my lashes grew, and grew, to the extent that I could feel the ends of my lashes touch my eyelids, and could feel them touching the inside of my reading glasses.  I haven&#x27;t been using RapidLash for a couple of years, but used it consistently for about 3 years. A couple of things to be aware of:&lt;br /&gt;1. When I first started using the product, I felt a little stinging along my lash line. This went away after a while.&lt;br /&gt;2. I did also have a bit of redness along my lash line. Fixed with a bit of concealer, foundation or eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;3. After many months of steady use, I noticed that my lashes had become slightly sparser. I probably should have backed off use to every other day or every third day instead of daily.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is I was very happy with the results, despite minor issues. Of course, these can vary individual to individual, so your mileage may vary.  I&#x27;ve also noticed the price has dropped considerably since I was using it regularly, so if anyone is interested in trying it, the cost is low enough.</li>
            <li> It takes a few weeks but used every night before bed, it works. My lashes are pretty long naturally but now they are ridiculous. I love that.</li>
            <li> Does not work not worth your money ! 😡</li>
            <li> Being a lover of long lashes, I decided to try this less expensive alternative to Latisse.  I took several \\&quot;before\\&quot; photos and made a mental note of exactly where my lashes went to on my eyelash curler. The product is easy to use - very similar to liquid eyeliner, except it&#x27;s clear.  I&#x27;ve used it every night before bed and I have seen growth for sure!  My eyelashes aren&#x27;t necessarily any thicker or dramatically longer (I recall one review saying she couldn&#x27;t wear her glasses without her eyelashes pushing against the lenses - ha! I wish!)  but there has been improvement. I will continue using the serum until it runs out and at that point I&#x27;ll decide whether or not to continue, or it if&#x27;s not making that big of a difference I might just opt for one of those mascaras you that has the white primer first then the black mascara. Either way, it DOES work but I think the length varies per person.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything on the market.  It seems to help eyelashes not fall out as much, thus getting thicker, but after about two months I haven&#x27;t grown starlet eyelashes, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> created sever eye irritation after 1 use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of years now and it&#x27;s honestly changed my life! Best thing I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;m very cynical when it comes to things like this but once I tried it I&#x27;ve never looked back. You have to be religious with it and use it as much as it says it you won&#x27;t see the effects. Be persistent and you&#x27;ll achieve fully lashes and brows within the timeframe they set!</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t see much regrowth</li>
            <li> i am 25 and have been using this product for about 4 months now. my eyelashes are amazing. seriously. i get compliments every day!! i had a baby a few months ago and needed something to pop on my face...using this product made my eyes pop like never before. seriously, i cannot say enough about this product.!    update...been using it for 8 months now! obsessed! i get so many compliments on my lashes and it makes putting on mascara so fun!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it almost 3 weeks and have seen no difference. It also makes my eyes crusty lol</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I have been using it for over an year now and when my mom saw me after a long time she asked me if i was wearing fake lashes! they aren&#x27;t that long now but i didn&#x27;t have any before and mascara couldn&#x27;t help much because they were so short. Now, they are longer and thicker! I didn&#x27;t see any results at first but like everything else this product needs to be used with patience! it took me 6 months to see results and now its my must have! I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very happy with product.  Noticed lashes are more prominent and eyebrows a little thicker.  Since I have very sensitive skin, was concerned about a bad reaction, but had none.  Just wish company would design tube so that you have some idea of how much you have left so that I can order in advance.  Can&#x27;t afford to order more than one at a time.  Have to wait because last night I discovered it was empty.  Also have this problem with pump moisturizers.  Go to apply moisturizer and it&#x27;s empty.  Please a head&#x27;s up.</li>
            <li> At my age eyelashes start getting shorter and thinner and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to spend over $100 on the lash lengthening with the dermatologist.  Its difficult to tell just how much this has increased the length of my lashes, but it has.  They are also thicker. when I apply mascara I am amazed at how long they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish I could figure out when I would need to order.</li>
            <li> I have been OBSESSED with lashes for, like, ever.  I had been debating whether to buy this or not and I&#x27;m SO glad I did!  My lashes are crazy long and thick! I haven&#x27;t noticed any side effects and am over the freakin moon about how long the suckers are!  For a moment there, I thought maybe my wishful thinking had me seeing longer lashes but when my mom asked if I was wearing false eyelashes I knew it was truly working :)    Now every morning when I do my makeup, I leave mascara for the last step and it transforms my whole look! I am so in love with Rapidlash! I was SO hopeful, but skeptical at the same time, but now I have the longest lashes of anyone I know! SO stoked with the results!  If you&#x27;re a lash-lover like me, I&#x27;d give it a try!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  It really works and it will make people comment on your lashes.  You only have to use it once every other day or so.</li>
            <li> Rapid Lash is such a wonderful and innovative product. The reviews here helped me in purchasing this. At first, I didn&#x27;t believe it will work but after 1 or 2 weeks I saw the hair on my brows grow where I applied this serum. I still haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in my lashes that&#x27;s why I just gave it 4 stars. But I&#x27;m really happy that it helped me grow the hair in my brows back. After having it waxed I didn&#x27;t like how they made my brows look shorter. My brows grow really slow without this serum and they grow in crazy directions. So after I purchased this, I saw better improvements which Im very pleased with. I have recommended this product to some people I know who also have problems growing their brows. Thank you Rapid Lash and Thanks to Amazon too for the great item and the good price!</li>
            <li> I had originally tried the prescription Latisse and found this product to actually work better for me.  I paid a hundred for the RX and only a quarter of that for the Rapid Lash. I have never had any lashes to speak of but with this product I can actually curl them and have much longer thicker eyelashes.  I also use it to thicken my eyebrows which are thinner than I would like and have had great results with that.</li>
            <li> I spent alot of money on this product for one application. The wand didn&#x27;t even come out more than slightly SLIGHTLY wet- and it lasted ONE swipe over the area- meaning, to cover my eyelashes on 2 eyes I had to put the applicator in the bottle and really mush it around to find any wetness- about 20 times.    20 times. To coat 2 lashes.  garbage. This product is GARBAGE.</li>
            <li> I took pictures before I started using the product and then again at 4 weeks.  There is a noticeable difference!  My eyelashes are darker, thicker and longer.  I rated this product a 4 instead of a 5 because I developed these little red bumps/zit-looking things around my eye sockets right after I started using the product and they were pretty nasty looking.  I toughed it out though and put benzoyl peroxide on them every night.  They&#x27;re barely starting to go away now (4 weeks later).</li>
            <li> I started to use this from Nov. and now everyone in my family agrees that my eyelashes look thick and longer than before. I use for my upper eyelashes only so it can last about 3 months.</li>
            <li> I tried City Lash enhancing serum for quite a while, but did not seem to see the difference that rapidlash makes.  I am sticking with rapidlash because it shows results and is less expensive.</li>
            <li> International Research Labs Rapidlash Eyelash Enhancing Serum --- a good purchase... I used to love those people with long and thick eyelashes.. They look so lovely. I have always wanted to have thick and long eyelashes.           I have tried many other products but I was not satisfied with their results. I would feel irritated or feel that it was not even. Then one of my friends suggested me this Beautiful Eyelash enhancing serum and I just wanted to give it a try.. It was just amazing...          This small bottle lasted for a long time ... and I could see the results in a month.. My friends found the difference in my eyes...and they said that I looked pretty because of the thick and long eyelashes... WOW...           I used it typically at night and it hardly takes a few seconds for the application.. I  keep track of how my eyelashes grow and keep taking pictures from time to time .... With makeup on it has a great effect and each and every day is  a new start...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried long enough to know if this product works on eyelash growth. I had to stop because my eyelids were turning brown.  My husband volunteered to test it on his eyelashes and it turned his eyelid redish brown within a day.  It took a few days for the color to fade after I stopped using this thing.</li>
            <li> Raiplash works for me! My lashes are twice as long now. Amazon offers a great price(around 23 dollars) too, I used to pay double! cheers  :)</li>
            <li> After only one week I saw more length in my lashes.  It has been only 4 weeks now and still getting length but no thickness.  I wear contacts so that may be why I have some sensitivity to the product but not so bad to stop using it.  Shipping was amazing, regular free shipping got the product to me in a couple of days.  Worth a try, when you have really sparse lashes, anything is an improvement.</li>
            <li> I did not believed in this kind of product but because of the good reviews I give it a try. It realy work.</li>
            <li> Amazon has the best price for this product so I always purchase from them.  The product really works.  I&#x27;ve had people notice my eyelashes.  I&#x27;ve been using on my eye brows too but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have helped them.  The tube lasts a long time...maybe 3 months or so.  I just discard for health reasons as I would mascara.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS!!  So thrilled; I&#x27;ve been using this for just over TWO WEEKS and when I put on a thin coat of mascara two days ago... KABOOM! I could see the AMAZING difference, it looks just like when I wear my expensive false lashes made of natural hair!!!  The lashes I had as a girl and teenager are almost back, I can throw out my falsies and in a month, I can even throw out my mascara!!  I am now focusing on my lower lashes which were a little scarce.  This product conditions and strengthens the eyelashes beautifully.  They almost never fall out anymore.  Another reviewer said it was like Rogaine for eyelashes and eyebrows, it is so true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy only ONE TUBE to start with; it lasts a couple of months, more than enough time to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Clean your eyes and face before you go to bed DAILY with the appropriate products i.e. make-up remover for waterproof make-up, sensitive eyes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Rinse with cold water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Pat face and eyes dry , gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Shake bottle, apply thin coat on the edge of your eyelids where your lashes grow, starting from inner corner to outer corner, be careful not to get any in your eyes.  If ever you do, rinse out eyes throughly with appropriate eyewash or eyedrops and re-apply if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Apply thin coat carefully to lower eyelids right where your lashes grow, if desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Always close tube well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Skip on nights when your eyes are very tired or strained due to other activities or if your eyelids are irritated from new make-up or cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Do this for two to four weeks to see results.  Always apply thin coats otherwise it can irritate your eyes.  Be patient.  Even if you skip a few nights, it works!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Use once a week to condition and strengthen lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll get so many compliments for your eyelashes, you&#x27;ll get tired of hearing them, LOL!</li>
            <li> It works for me, for my mom(80 years old) and my sister-and law. I assume, that it should perform for everybody else. I used it once a day at night for month to get  results, and the every other day after to sustain it.</li>
            <li> I bought it almost two months ago ,I put it on my eyelashes every day and haven&#x27;t get any results.</li>
            <li> This does really work. Just use it as directed , every day for 5 weeks and I completely noticed a difference. I do think when you stop using it though, your lashes go back to their original length. Strange.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I have been using Rapidlash for 5 months.  Rapidlash has definitely increased  the length of my lashes.  (I curl my lashes daily and can see that my lases are longer in relation the my eye lash curler.  That is my \\&quot;ruler\\&quot;.)It took about two months to notice a change.  The effect is most noticeable with mascara. I have been using the same tube since September (5 months) and still have some product left.  I did make another purchase to be ready when the initial tube runs out, but so far it is still going!  I apply the product nightly to the base of my lashes making sure that some of the product actually touches right where the lash and the lid meet.  At first I think I was applying it too much on the lid, like you would eye liner, and now that it is right on the lash/lid line I feel I am getting better results.  I have had ZERO irritation or discoloration associated with this product.  I store mine upright, for what its worth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been known for my long fluttery lashes, nor have they ever been sparse. I just wanted some enhancement, and this definitely provided that. I didn&#x27;t have the dark lid effect some spoke of, and I put it on before bed on top of eye moisturizer right along the lash line, but I&#x27;m sure it smeared all over the place. No issue for me. Not sure how long it took to notice effects, but on a few occasions, I did actually use a scissor to trim some lashes that had gotten out of control. No joke. The suckers had gone above and beyond their call of duty and were sticking out like a sore thumb. Of course this isn&#x27;t the basis for my positive review, because the rest of my lashes were definitely longer and more dense. I made sure to apply the serum throughout both top and bottom lashes and had great effects for both. Highly recommended, especially combined with a dying product like Swiss O Par to darken...gives you virtually maintenance free, dark, lush lashes for days and even weeks. Perfect for vacations and the like.</li>
            <li> love it product made my eyelashes and brows thicker and longer. Be patient have to use it for a long time (like 7 months ) to get full effect.</li>
            <li> This was my first crack at lash/brow enhancers.  I had a gap in one eyebrow that just refused to fill in, so I used it for that as well as on my lashes.  After using 1 month each night, my gap is now filled in, and my lashes are noticeably longer.  So it works, and I found it easy to apply with no stinging etc.  I also used on my lower lashes and only see a small improvement there.</li>
            <li> This product overall was okay. It worked but the results were not dramatic. I guess it works for some but not all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a month now and it is working.  I can see a difference in length and color of my eyelashes and eye brows.  In fact, I have ordered another tube so that I will not run out before I reap the total benefits.</li>
            <li> Purchased this based on reviews.  Have to say that I&#x27;m pretty pleased with my results.  Have experienced noticeable improvement in length.  Fullness has improved somewhat but not significantly, however existing lashes are thicker and stronger.  Been using it for about 8 weeks - have missed a day here and there, but for the most part, have used it daily.  Like others have commented, it seems like the tube wasn&#x27;t quite full (ie, you have to really work with the brush to get the product out of the tube for proper application).  With that said, I was still able to manage approx. 2 months of almost daily use.  Have even noticed a very slight upward curl in lashes. I know others that are using Latisse and have seen their very impressive results.  Didn&#x27;t experience the kind of length you get with Latisse, but for a fraction of the price, I&#x27;m pleased with Rapid Lash and have ordered a second tube.      Note:  Used it on brow line as well but noticed no improvement there.  Will try another product for that area.  Now that I won&#x27;t be wasting any product on the brow area, I expect to get a solid 8 weeks, if not more, from my second tube.</li>
            <li> This product really works! This is the third time I&#x27;m ordering this and I love it! It is a lot cheaper than buying it in the store.</li>
            <li> This is a product for which I have paid full retail in the past. The price on this site was fantastic; so I ordered two! When I later had a question about dates on the product, the seller answered promptly and courteously. I am very happy with this product, the process and the seller.</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical about whether this product would work on not, but I&#x27;m a believer now!  I started using RapidLash several months ago, and I did see results.  Then I kind of got lazy and wasn&#x27;t consistent about using it.  I started again about a month ago, and I can definitely tell a difference!  My lashes are definitely longer and prettier.   I have only used the RapidLash on my eyebrows a few times, so I can&#x27;t comment on its results on eyebrows.  However, I plan to use it much more consistently on my eyebrows so that maybe they will actually show!  They&#x27;ve gotten thinner the older I&#x27;ve gotten, and I would like to look like I have brows without having to APPLY them each morning!</li>
            <li> a great product for a great price. it really works and i am really happy with the results. i would recommend this product to anyone who wants longer lashes.</li>
            <li> Due to an inflamatory eye condition, I have been on several eye medications and the combination caused my eyelashes to fall out. I was not willing to risk the side effects of meds such as Latisse, so I thought I would give RapidLash a try. Within a week I could see that the patches that were completely missing lashes had filled in, after a month I saw significant growth - my lashes are longer and somewhat darker and MUCH better than they were before I started using this product. I will continue to use and recommend Rapidlash!</li>
            <li> This product works, but it takes some time to see the effects. Noticed about a 30% increase in lash length, which becomes very noticeable when wearing mascara. Works well on brows too, but I noticed that my eyebrows get too long a fall out. I would not recommend using on eyebrows if they are a decent length.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product last year and was very pleased with the results. My lashes were thicker(and somewhat coarser), and some sparse areas actually filled in. As others have noted, it does require consistent application for at least four weeks, but the tube can last for months. My second tube (a drugstore purchase) didn&#x27;t work well - even the serum seemed different, so perhaps it was a bad batch, but my eyelashes lost the gains made earlier. I&#x27;m still a believer, though, so I purchased my third tube through Amazon last month (at a great price, too - I see it&#x27;s up 33% since then!) and have started the process again.        Despite the \\&quot;hiccup\\&quot; in my Rapidlash experience, I can easily recommend it - the results were impressive!</li>
            <li> Seriously, I thought I would try it.  I certainly wasn&#x27;t going to pay for Latisse. But don&#x27;t bother.  Waste of money and time. Actually I had more eyelashes fall out, than normal.  Maybe one or two long ones grew but could easily be pulled out.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> My lashes are on the long side to begin with and this made them even longer, but not thicker. For maximum results, you really need to use this every night.     My sister&#x27;s lashes are pretty short, but this made them longer and thicker.     Friends have definitely noticed a difference in our lashes.     One downside is that my eyes are definitely more red/bloodshot after I started using this product. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 6 months now and I&#x27;m going to continue using it.</li>
            <li> Love RapidLash! Used it previously with good results and now improving on those results with this latest purchase. I bought two (2) so I could give one to my friend to try since she was so amazed at my lashes - she had to tug them to see if they were really mine!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have been growing like weeds! I use it every night, only on the top lashes. It&#x27;s been almost 2 months and I feel like they are still getting longer by the day. I no longer need to use a curler - they curl by themselves now and they NEVER did that. They were short/medium length and now they are without a doubt long. And also darker and fuller. It makes such a difference. I&#x27;m hooked and for fear of losing these new lashes, which honestly feel like someone else&#x27;s lashes, I plan to continue to use the product nightly. It&#x27;s become part of my routine and is just too easy not to - takes only a few seconds and doesn&#x27;t burn at all. I started noticing the change after about a week and a half. My sister started it at the same time as me and has also had the exact same effects. It&#x27;s a must try.</li>
            <li> I needed to enhance my lashes but didn&#x27;t want to invest in false lashes &amp; all the maintenance that it involves. Rapid lash has been a great solution.</li>
            <li> This product actually worked for me.  My eye lases are longer and I am happy!  I don&#x27;t use it every night because I heard some ppl say their eyelashes fell out, so I was worried about the strength of the serum.  But 2 months later I do have lashes that are the longest they ever have been.  It looks wonderful when I put mascara on too.  I will definitely keep buying this when I run out.  Only trouble is that my lashes didn&#x27;t grow in all at once, I did have a few that grew a bit slower, just like hair.  It doesn&#x27;t look like say, false lashes, but it looks natural and pretty.</li>
            <li> This works just as well as all the RX brands, without the cost.  You have to be consistent in applying daily to see results, and lashes don&#x27;t stay without continued use, BUT it does work.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but this is worth writing about.  My eyelashes are &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; since using this for the past several months.  My eyelashes hit my drinking glass when I take a sip.  My only complaint is that they are a little spidery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used another brand for the past year and loved it.  I had hoped to get the same results with this.  I am disappointed.  My lashes are longer than without, but it has taken FOREVER!  and they are not as thick as they were with the other brand.  It&#x27;s ok, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> This is worth it. Before this one I tried allure md ( i think thats what its called), it 1asts double the price and last only half the time. The brush is a little thin, but I got use to it. You gave to use it everyday. To be honest I thought it was a racket, but to my amazement is works wonders. I would never pay 100 dollars like some others charge. I used my amazon gift cards I earned on swagbucks. I average 50 dollars in gift cards a month and that will be to keep up with my rapid lash purchases. Itsfree&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. My eyelashes have stopped falling out. I notice that they seem to be getting thicker, and maybe even a little longer. I have been using for about two weeks now. I like it and would recommend.Price on Amazon for this is great!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome - a couple of my friends used it and I asked how their lashes got so long -  they said this product so I gave it a try - now my friends are asking me how I got my long lashes!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the purchse, the eyelashes grew a little with no side effects, I have been using it over 2 years now.</li>
            <li> It is true that there is side affects. Using it for 3 days, I already could feel my eyelids becoming a bit more sensative and developing pinkish circles under my eyelids. This made me worried so I stopped the use of it, and only use it every 2 days. It does do its job and I am happy with how effective it is judging by the cost. But there are minor side affects if you pay attention.</li>
            <li> This product does work. It just takes a while before you see the results. I noticed it after using it for 5 weeks. My co-worker noticed them getting longer. I don&#x27;t agree that it makes your lashes thicker. My lashes are still thin. I do recommend it if you want longer lashes.</li>
            <li> I started using this Rapidlash in January and my lashes are so much longer and thicker than they were before.  I took pictures before I started using Rapidlash and I compared them with pictures I took today and I see such a huge difference! I am still on my first tube of this stuff, and for the price you pay, this is so worth it!  I didn&#x27;t experience any darking of my eyelids, but there was some tingling when I first started using it. It stopped after a few days, though.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe they send expired eye products....I suggest people check the bottom of their bottles..Mine expired 5 months ago. Other people have also commented on this...I&#x27;m thinking this could be dangerous. What do you think?</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. I was following the directions but my eyelids got very red and were inflamed next morning. I tried to do it for 3 days and finally gave up. I had dark circles under my eyes and my upper lids got swollen and red.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. Not a happy person with this one.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Had used nightly for months and saw no significant eyelash growth</li>
            <li> I used to have very short eyelashes and after having eyelash extensions for 2 months, they were really out of condition. I bought Rapid Lash as an alternative to destroying my eyelashes with fake lashes and have been pleased with the results so far. I have been using the product for about 6 weeks, and in the last week especially I have noticed a difference in the length of my eyelashes. In the first couple of weeks I noticed my lashes got back to their original condition before I had extensions, and since have gradually grown longer. Last week I had a few random lashes which were much longer than the others, however they all seem to have caught up and evened out better now.  I think the lashes on my right eye are still longer than on my left, but I am hoping this will even out too. I have not noticed a dramatic difference in the amount of lashes I have, but they were not sparse to begin with. They are possibly a little darker but I don&#x27;t believe they are any thicker.  I have not had any side effects with this product and have been generally pleased with the results and will buy another bottle as I am now coming to the end of mine after 6 weeks of use every night.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as instructed for about 2 months and have noticed very little improvement. I have not seen my lashes grow longer, thicker, or darker. I have only noticed they seem in a little better condition, less likely to lose as many.  I have also noticed shortly after applying the product my eye lids feel itchy. I am not overly impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> It took at least 8 weeks but when it worked it really worked. My lashes are so long, black and thick, they look false. I have always had nice long lashes but with age they were not as thick or as long. Now they are so long they bind when I am sleeping. I actually need no mascara. I tried the expensive $120 one from the doctors office and this works better (I think) at a price that is so much less. In fact you will not need to buy the expensive mascara that you needed before due to your lashes being so nice. I stopped buying Dior Show mascara because I just don;t need it any longer. Lasts a long time too. You will NOT regret buying this, just hang in there long enough to see the results! Amazing stuff!!!!</li>
            <li> This lash serum only takes a couple of weeks to see that it&#x27;s working. It didn&#x27;t make my lashes thick but did make them quite long.</li>
            <li> After using it for some time I noticed baby lashes which made me think my lashes were breaking off.  Not Good.  I&#x27;ve used other products with more success.</li>
            <li> love this product.  it totally works just as promised.  my lashes got so long i have to wear my glasses a little lower on my hose so they won&#x27;t hit the glasses lens. love it</li>
            <li> I bought 2 bottles of Rapid lash on september and i´ve been using since then and NOTHING!!!!! i´ve used Latisse before and THAT really works! but as it was expensive I decides to give  Rapid Lash a try but was completelly disapointed and never ever will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 70 and have always had rather thin, somewhat short eye lashes. I would go over and over them with mascara but not until I diligently used Rapid Lash every night for one sold month did  I begin to notice a BIG difference.  My lashes were actually thicker and longer but I didn&#x27;t notice any new lashes growing.  Where I really noticed the difference was in some recent head shot pictures taken of me.  My lashes looked as though I was wearing false ones. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and will continue to use it nightly.  By the way, I have had no itching or discomfort of any sort with this product and my eyes have always been sensitive.</li>
            <li> Awesome, my eye brows and lashes are growing.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I desperately needed to regrow my lashes after the summer (they fell out due to my allergies :/ ). It worked fabulously for me! I saw results almost overnight. For RadipLash, you apply it as you would eyeliner on the base of your lashes. Mine are now thicker and stronger; they look really pretty if I do say so myself. I highly reccomend this product. Definitely try this before going the perscription route for Latisse. Honestly, RapidLash is half the cost with absolutely NO side-effects. The side effects of Latisse are not worth the product (permanent darkening of the iris, darkening at the base of the lashes, permanent eye color change, I mean really?). I will continue to use this to keep my lashes strong. Also, don&#x27;t let the price put you off. You get what you pay for, and believe me, it is so worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS In the morning, I occassionally notice that some of the product dries at the base of my lashes. All I do is gingerly comb through them with an eyelash brush and it comes right out, no problem.</li>
            <li> I seen some results but not dramatic results however i&#x27;m still using it.</li>
            <li> 5 weeks ago I had a reaction to a mascara I never used, I cheaped out and bought a cheapo eyelash curler also, well because of my cheapness I lost clumps of eyelashes !have long thick lashes that wing out naturally. I went to eye doctor told me I didn&#x27;t have an infection but prob switching products did it. My eyes looked weird with clumps out, and they thinned a lot too , I bought rapid lash not expecting much, well in 2 weeks I noticed the clumps had lashes growing out already, I inspect every day in day light. It&#x27;s been 5 weeks, I still use rapid lash every night and NEVER skip, I bought an expensive eyelash curler, I curled yesterday, my eyelashes look fake!!! I didn&#x27;t even use mascara! I went to grocery store and this girl I talk to all the time asked me what kind of falsies I had on!! I told her about rapid lash, she sees me every Sunday,  so knows what they look like. I also bought my usual mascara  that&#x27;s 30 bucks but wasn&#x27;t taking any chances, today I curled and only put a little on the tips, my lashes looked crazy long, full and winged out! I seriously can&#x27;t believe it. I also use jojoba oil to condition them but not at the rim where you put on the rapid lash. I also put it on my brows and they look way more fuller and defined, they say 1 bottle lasts 2 months, it probably does, but in the beginning I was so freaking out I kept putting it on a few times a day, they say it won&#x27;t help, so don&#x27;t waste it. I woke up at 3am last night to use the bathroom and ordered a new bottle lol! I won&#x27;t do without this stuff! My friend used Latisse , I showed her my lashes a few weeks ago then she saw them the other day and couldn&#x27;t believe it, she&#x27;s buying rapid lash too, oh it also made them darker, I&#x27;m a sucker for beauty adds, really nothing works as advertised, but this is just truly amazing, and NO I&#x27;m in no way associated with anyone from the company or amazon, just a 45 year old who cheaped out and was taught a beauty lesson!</li>
            <li> I use Rapidlash regularly and have for several years,  and it really does lengthen eyelashes and adds some fullness as well,  nothing else I have used even comes close.  I will continue to order it.</li>
            <li> This was suggested to me by one of the consultants at Ulta. I decided to see if it was cheaper through Amazon, and it is, so I ordered it. OMG, does this stuff work!! I&#x27;ve got those lashes that stick straight out, are thin and certainly not long. After THREE days, I&#x27;m not kidding, THREE days, my lashes were longer, thicker, they had curl that they&#x27;ve only gotten from an eyelash curler before!! In fact, now after 1 1/2 months of regular use, I&#x27;ve quit using my eyelash curler!! My lashes were just a brown color before. Now they&#x27;re black, thick, and they curl up!! Heck, they look nice even without mascara! Suggest this?? Emphatically, YES!! What are you waiting for?? :-)</li>
            <li> I had lashes this long and think only at the age of 18! Results showed up in 2-3 weeks. Strongly recommended! Thanks</li>
            <li> Very effective serum. Lash and eyebrow growth was very noticeable after 2 months of use. The slight stinging sensation felt at the lash line, however, can be irritating to sensitive individuals.</li>
            <li> works!!  works!! works!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish they are a bit friendlier in price; they they seem to last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Still waiting to see growth after five weeks.  Nothing is happening.</li>
            <li> not worth the money, zero results</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I assumed I&#x27;d have to wait 6 weeks for results, but I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a patch in my left bottom corner where I have 3 SHORT lashes and that&#x27;s it. After only 3 weeks I saw them get longer!! I now have 5 (though they are still SO thin they&#x27;re almost invisible) and have gotten some random super long ones on other parts of my lashes. Reviews said it&#x27;d just make them longer, not fuller, but I feel like I do have more lashes, but I&#x27;ll have to check my before pix to make sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I forgot it at home over Thanksgiving and had many lashes fall out, so DON&#x27;T skip more than a day!! It says use it just at night, but my eyes water at night so I put it in just the corners in the morning as well (maybe why I saw results in my bald corner so soon?), I have had zero pain or negative reactions from using this. I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I finally spent the money to try Latisse after using Rapidlash successfully for 2 years. I thought it just might produce better results. WRONG! I finished my tiny Latisse bottle, seeing less positive effects and actually losing eyelashes. I promptly ordered 3 more Rapidlash (a deal and no need to order for 6 months) to get my lashes back in order. As an FYI, I&#x27;m 62 but still working in retail management and have to keep up with the younger gals, so appearance is important. With age comes less lashes and the sparse areas make me crazy. Rapidlash gave me fullness and length. It&#x27;s not like when I was in my twenties, but at least I don&#x27;t have to resort to annoying fake lashes. I haven&#x27;t found a better product yet.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product to see if it would help my aging and thinning eyelashes and eyebrows.  I have faithfully applied it every evening to no avail.  This did grow even one more hair!  Of course, I thought it was probably a hoax, but worth a try.  Now, the window of opportunity to return it closed.  Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned cash!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she says it works. nothing miraculous, just conditions and improves. She says its worth the money.</li>
            <li> Let me give you some background info: My eyelashes are medium length but they&#x27;re stick straight which makes it appear like I don&#x27;t have any at all! I&#x27;m one of those gals who is obsessed with long eyelashes. I was browsing the web to see ways of growing lashes long and strong! I tried Vaseline, oils etc) nothing worked. I eventually turned to the \\&quot;serums.\\&quot; I read reviews of different serums and was really surprised with the ones for Rapidlash. Happy results! I decided to order. I&#x27;ve been using Rapidlash consistently for four months now. The results are amazing! My eyelashes have grown so much that when I apply mascara they hit my eyebrows! My lashes have even curled with the new growth spurt. I&#x27;ve noticed my lashes take to mascara a lot better. They don&#x27;t clump nearly as bad as they did before. I don&#x27;t even have to take a lash comb through them! They&#x27;re awesome. I don&#x27;t notice as much lash fall out. I&#x27;ve used this long enough to know what kind of results I can get, I now just apply 3-4 nights a week for maintenance. I have received so many compliments. How I manage to get them so long, how I avoid clumps and fan them out. Rapidlash has improved the health of my eyelashes so much, that&#x27;s how I reply to these comments haha! My eyelashes are healthy so they cooperate much better! I recommend Rapidlash to anyone looking to improve the health of their lashes. You will see results if you are willing to be patient. I saw results as little as 3 weeks. I now have the eyelashes I&#x27;ve always wanted. Long, healthy and lush! Every morning I&#x27;m excited to put on my mascara and play them up! Give it a try! I just purchased my second tube two weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and have noticed my lashes seem darker and fuller...but not longer.  I&#x27;ve used several other brands with the same results, so I think I&#x27;m destined to be stuck with short lashes. I am still happy with the fullness though and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a senior citizen and this is the third time I&#x27;ve ordered Rapidlash from Amazon. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and it&#x27;s the only lash growing serum that works for me and I&#x27;ve tried at least 4 others. My lashes are longer and fuller thanks to Rapidlash. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using this item, I have seen no difference in my eyelashes,  I will finish the whole tube, just to se if it will actually work for me.</li>
            <li> It really works. My eyelashes look great, they look more healthy and grew a lot and  after a couple of months! I though have to say that if you stop using it they will look exactly the same as before, so you must use it permanently if you want to keep that wonderful look. The other thing I noticed is that my eyelids started looking darker and growing tiny hair but I don&#x27;t mind because it&#x27;s not noticeable.</li>
            <li> Tube not full.  Can barely get it out.  Seemed dried out.  Bought this product before &amp; tube had more product in it</li>
            <li> How can I return this??  Does not work....&lt;br /&gt;Need information on how to return this product&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;very&lt;br /&gt;much</li>
            <li> The Rapidlash product did not work for me and I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 weeks.  Please improve this product with the required ingredients so that it will increase the lashes.</li>
            <li> It works, but you really have to use it every single day for at least a month to see any kind of results on your lashes. I saw my brows growing fuller within 2 weeks tho. Watch out for fake vendors!</li>
            <li> It really works!  I have used it for eyelashes and eyebrows and have been very satisfied with the product and the price.</li>
            <li> I was pretty satisfied with my eyelashes before, but I wanted to see if I could make them more spectacular and reminiscent of false lashes with the help this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two months later with nightly use, my lashes are so long that they almost touch my eyebrows. I feel like a camel. A sexy camel.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did not work for me.  I used it on my eyebrows because I have long eyelashes but very sparse eyebrows.  Kathie Lee Gifford recommended it on the Today how so I thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nightly for about a year.  I had NO eyelashes and now they are long and beautiful!!  Love love love this product.</li>
            <li> Latisse?  Why?  Have been using this for about six months (when I remember) and you can&#x27;t beat the price and the results.  Latisse is $120 for a month .. this works just as well.  My lashes are longer, thicker and curl by themselves.  VERY happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased RapidLash and have been using it daily for the last 3 weeks.  The packaging was sealed well and the applicator (which is a lot like eyeliner) was very easy to use.  Unfortunately, after 3 weeks of use, I don&#x27;t see any noticeable difference except for the swollen, red and irritated eyelids and bloodshot eyes. I apply the product carefully, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m getting any into my eyes, but some seepage must be happening. Certain eyeliners do irritate my eyelids (not all - I can use mac gel and stila liquid liners), so it may be my somewhat sensitive skin reacting to the product. Without any results though, the daily discomfort just isn&#x27;t worth it for me - plus I&#x27;ve read that I may have to continue using this product to maintain lash improvement, if any.</li>
            <li> So far I guess it is helping a bit. Not so much as the last one I purchased. It was a better price but I think I will pay for the higher quality one next time.</li>
            <li> Have been using for about 3 weeks and my lashes are darker and growing longer. Cannot wait to see the results after longer use.</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference after using the prodduct for one week! My lashes are longer and look MUCH fuller!!</li>
            <li> Not quite as good as my last lash stuff, but still makes my lashes a bit darker and longer! And a better price than my last stuff was.</li>
            <li> I am not super impressed.  I have been using the product for three months .My lashes are stronger and healthier and maybe a little longer, nothing noticeable. In the past I used Renewlash and Lattise. Renewlash is no longer available on the market . When i used it for six weeks my lashes were so long that people really noticed.  I am definitely not getting the same results with Rapidlash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I like about Rapidlash. Its not in the least bit irritating. Renew lash was irritating.  Rapidlash is also easy to put on , You just have the little brush that goes back in the bottle, simple no fuss. Unlike latise which was such a pain to get on, with the the dropper and all the little brushes one for each eye. I just couldn&#x27;t do it every night.&lt;br /&gt;  so over all  Rapidlash is not a bad product but doesn&#x27;t do what it claims</li>
            <li> Thanks. I have noticed an improvement in eyelash growth. Will continue to use. Well worth the money I spent on this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. When I remember to apply it, I do it twice a day. My lashes are so long people think they&#x27;re fake!</li>
            <li> I am in the entertainment business. Lashes are important to me. I refuse to put on semi permanent lash extensions which end up destroying your lashes completely. Been there! I tried RapidLash because I thought it might be a good alternative to Latisse....not so!! I have been using it for 3 weeks faithfully and not one iota of difference. In fact, my lashes seem more brittle than before. I paid $29 on Amazon Prime for this product and now I see I can get CareProst bimataprost 0.0% solution generic Latisse for $36.00  - as opposed to $120 for brand name Latisse and given my experience with Latisse (amazing even after 3 weeks) I would only ever stick with Latisse or an exact generic formulation in the future. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> This product was a total waste of money. I tried it for 8 weeks and there was no difference what-so-ever.</li>
            <li> Very good product!  My lashes on one eye had broken off in just one spot and I needed something to help . Yes it takes about four weeks to work but that is normal for any hair/ lash product . Try it but be patient and use it daily as directed.</li>
            <li> Let me first say I &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 this stuff. It really does work. I&#x27;ve been using for around 1 1/2-2 months everynight like clockwork. Used to when I looked at myself in the mirror I could barely even tell I had eyelashes, well now, even without makeup you can see my eyelashes. They are long and fairly thick compared to what they were to begin with. Make sure you put this on only where you want eyelashes to grow. I had been putting it on from corner to corner on my eyes until I noticed a few eyelash hairs growing the very inside of my eye, kind of on my nose....in that corner. LOL--no biggie, I just plucked them out and now I make sure I only put it where I expect hair to grow. This is a great product. I haven&#x27;t had any side effects or any problems with it darkening my eye lids either. I love this product and will continue to buy it. If you are thinking about purchasing this, then GO FOR IT. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I do reccomend this product but I have been using it on my eye brows. I am in my 50&#x27;s so my brows have thinned. I don&#x27;t have the eye brows of my youth but what I do have now is much better than before. Each hair is thicker and longer and looks fuller. But there is a nice bonus. My eye lashes look fuller and longer without applying the serum to my lashes. Don&#x27;t expect miracles but do expect improvement. I will reorder Rapid Lash.</li>
            <li> This product is working well for me.  After using for a few weeks I did notice my lashes grew and thickened.</li>
            <li> Rapid lash does work.  I have been using it for about 6 months and my eyelashes are longer and my eyebrows look fuller and darker. My only complaint is that my eyelashes are still thin and not thick like I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> I have used this for one month. I did notice the difference within two weeks. My results are not longer or thicker lashes but I have noticed the increase in amount of lashes I have. I&#x27;m Chinese and I have short stubby and straight lashes. I curl my lashes everyday and noticed that my lashes have not been falling out. I used to have 2-3 lashes falling out whenever I used my eyelash curler, now maybe one lash falls out a week. So 100% sure its helping my lashes to stay put. I can see with continued use that my lashes will grow longer but this will not give immediately results. I will give a 3-6 month update later.</li>
            <li> Nothing has helped my sparse lashes and brows until I used this product. I am very pleased with the results. I have been using this nightly for 3 weeks and see a noticeable difference. I&#x27;m 54 and have very sparse straight lashes. This has thickened my lashes and after I curl them and add mascara I can actually see them now. I will definitely be a regular buyer. No discomfort or discoloration that other users have found. Try it - you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice now. It has made my lashes longer, and my borws fuller both times.  The first time I used this was in July 2010. The first 4 days my eyes looked horrible! They were extremly blood shot. They were extremely dry and hurt to keep open. I stuck with it thinking I would stop after a week if it stayed that way. 5th day they were slightly red, and the 6th they were back to normal. (Didnt happen the 2nd time)    I saw results with in 3 weeks. They werent any longer but the bald spots at the corners of my eyes had small hairs. After using it for a couple more wks I had eye lashes w/o any gaps and they were a lot longer.     I have curly eye lashes. They curl back and touch my skin w/ my eyes open wide. Half my lashes (top and bottom) did full circles after 6 weeks which wasnt that big of a deal just funny. There were a few crazy hairs that just shot strait out, or grew flat against my skin (those I just pulled out and didnt miss). I did have to trim them once because some were so much longer then the rest.     I stopped using it for 2 months because of a diet I did. My lashes seemed as if they all fell out after 4 weeks. I took pictures before starting rapidlash, well they were really just back to normal. It just seemed that way.    The second time no redness, the bald spots are gone again, and oddly enough they are still curled but are not doing circles this time.   I think the porduct is wonderful!     This is my problem. It says in the instructions not to get it any where but on the lash line. Ok no big deal. Well with my lashes being so curly its hard not to touch the ends of my lashes that touch the skin. The longer my eyelashes get the harder it gets to keep on the lash line and not every where else to. I now have darkening around my eyes (there pretty ugly). Its easily covered but annoying when you want to go swimming or are not in the mood to put makeup on. I started only using it on my bottom lashes ever 3 days. It has reduced the darkness (and they are staying the same). Being more careful, and taking a damp q-tip and wiping off any not on the lash line has helped a lot to. I think I might be able to get it to go completely away if I keep being careful. Hopefully in a month.   I dont think to many people have the problem of overly curly lashes but just in case some one does be careful.     I stopped putting it on at night also. You put it on and lay on the side of your face and weird it gets all over. It getting all over is what seems to make my circles. I put it on once im out of the shower. Do my hair and by then its dry. I havent seen the difference between using at night or day.    My brows are much better from it to. I dont have to color them in now.     The second round has been better by far. My lashes are not in circles, no crazy ones (so far), no redness, and im figuring out how to deal with the darkness.     Its worth the money and I feel better using it, even with the problems I have had with it, then going back to my short/weird lashes.     For those of you who want to know: In the winter im extremely white and a more reddish tone. In the summer you would never now I could get that light and look completely olive toned. I think if I had a tan now you might not see the cirlces at all?     PS: First tried it because the salon I worked in sold it. 4 or 5  girls that work there are using it and say they will never stop. They havent had the dark circle problem or the red irritated eyes for the first while. They love it. I guess its different for every one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3-4 months and I have noticed a huge difference. I had some spots where my eyelashes just didn&#x27;t want to grow, bald spots. Looked horrible with mascara. I started using this and WOW it made those bald spots disappear. My lashes are full and longer. I love it. One tube lasts longer than a month I got almost 4 months of use with mine. It&#x27;s reasonable priced and it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using RapidLash for about 3 weeks now and I can already tell a difference in my lashes and brows. I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Just started using Rapidlash.  I have noticed new eyelash growth in 2 weeks! For some crazy reason, I had lost a portion of my eyelashes.   I am happy to see the new growth, and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Rapidlash gets 5 stars, Amazon 1 star.      I&#x27;ve been using Rapidlash for a couple of years now and love it.  My lashes are much longer but not thicker.  I&#x27;ve been purchasing it from other sites but decided to give Amazon a shot because of the low price. The last tube I received from another retailer, I noticed immediately that my eyes were really dry and bloodshot and still are.  I read a review by \\&quot;Leo\\&quot; who said to look at the bottom of the tube for the expiration date, which I never did.  So I looked at my current tube, and it was expired.  That&#x27;s most likely why my eyes are so red and dry.  I took a chance and ordered two tubes from here and when I received them, immediately opened them up and of course, they were expired (5/10)!  So I returned them and asked for new ones that were not expired.  They resent them to me and what a shocker, they were expired as well (10/10)!  Customer service told me that they can&#x27;t promise that I won&#x27;t receive expired products again.  So they credited me back and told me to throw out the tubes because they can&#x27;t accept returns on personal care items. The moral of this story is you get what you pay for!  It&#x27;s unfortunate that you have to open the box to see the expired date but make sure you do it!  And don&#x27;t order this product from Amazon!</li>
            <li> My first tube of Rapidlash from a local housewares store was awesome.  My lashes grew long and curled, and my eyebrows filled in.  I loved it.    My second tube, ordered online, had a different shape to the tube.  It was cylindrical, but it had a slope to the cap that my first tube had not had.  I did not see the results nor maintain the results that I had gained from my first tube.    I&#x27;m not sure whether to buy another or not.  If I do, I&#x27;ll go back to the original source with the cylinder tube with straight, parallel lines.</li>
            <li> i bought this product a few weeks ago and have only used it for two weeks. obviously not any apparent difference since i havent used it for very long. my concern is that the product&#x27;s Manufacturer&#x27;s guaranteed date on the bottle of the actual bottle of serum says \\&quot;10/10\\&quot; (october 2010) i dont know if that means its expired or not but i will keep using it just to see if it works. just giving you all a heads up!</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product overall, my eyelashes are pretty long and thick for asians but i want that fake lash look even w/o fake eyelashes, so i thought i&#x27;d give rapid lash a try since all the other brands are WAY over priced! I have to say i noticed little hair growing out on a bald spot on my bottom lash in as little as 2 days, the end of my top lashes were growing longer in about 3-4 days, i didn&#x27;t expect such a rapid growth from this product so i was really happy with it. The down side is that it gives me blood shot eyes and a pretty obvious dark circle under my eyes, i&#x27;m pretty sure the cause of it is from rapid lash because ive never had dark circles ever. I think everyone have a different reaction with this product since ive read some of the other reviews and it seems like many ppl didn&#x27;t experience a side effect, but i wasn&#x27;t that lucky with it. However, i still decided to go on with it since i have seen immediate result from lash growth, it&#x27;s been almost a month since ive used it and i have to say this product really does what it says, my top lashes have grow at least 30% longer and my bottom lashes grow so much espeically at the end since that&#x27;s the part with the least/shortest lashes. When i put on mascara my top lashes can actually touch my eyebrow if i frown a little which SHOCKED me. I wouldn&#x27;t say my lashes got thicker but there was definitely more amount which made it look thicker, like i said in the beginning i saw little lashes growing out almost immediately after i start using this, the bald spot on both my under eyelashes have already been filled in, the new lashes are still not as long as the other ones but they are definitely there. Now that its been over a month since ive used this, the growth in length have slowed down a bit as i haven&#x27;t notice dramatic length improvement anymore, but theres still little new hairs popping out here and there which made my eyelashes look much more fuller overall. As you can see now why i continued using this product even though it gaves me horrible dark circles, but i guess its a sacrifice i&#x27;m willing to take, i mean for the price of this thing the result is so much more than what i have expected. Aside from using this product on my lashes i have also been applying it on my eyebrows, they didn&#x27;t grow as fast as my eyelashes did, but i can definitely say after a month of application they start to come in together toward the center more, and the shorter brows at the beginning are also becoming longer and thicker, so i would definitely recommend this product however i think this thing works exceptionally good for my lashes since i haven&#x27;t read any comments from ppl that stats lash growth in like 2 days, but do think this product is worth the money and you just have to stick with it for a while and really try to use it every night. If i&#x27;m going to have any complaints about this product it would be the dark circles but longer lashes comes with a price.</li>
            <li> My lashes look so much better that when I went to the eye doctor recently for a check-up she asked me if I&#x27;d been using Latisse.  The results did take about a month, but I was so amazed by the change that I was calling all of my friends and telling them that they needed to get some RapidLash for themselves.  The tube lasted a long time; I bought it in September and am just now (in March) getting ready to order some more.  I used it every night for about 3 months and then went to every second or third night.  I&#x27;ve been told that if you stop using it your lashes will become sparse again but I don&#x27;t plan to find out.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> my eye lashes didn&#x27;t seem to fall out as much and they seemed to thicken up a bit,but I didn&#x27;t see much addition to my length.I think mascara would have same effect.</li>
            <li> Rapid Lash serum was recommended by a friend who saw results with new lashes (she lost her own) so I gave it a try. Within 3 weeks, I saw longer lashes. By twelve weeks, my lashes are longer and super dense (no more bald patches).  My eyebrows were already thick by some standards but I wanted thick youth eyebrows again and got those too. It worked for me.</li>
            <li> Based on all the great reviews, I ordered this and was really hoping that it would work.  I used it nightly for eight weeks, just as instructed on the packaging.  I followed the instructions to a T, but it did nothing for my lashes.  I didn&#x27;t see any sort of growth or improvement in the condition of my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that Ardell&#x27;s Brow and Lash Accelerator works much better for me, at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like Rapidlash works for a lot of people, but it may be worth it to give the Ardell Accelerator a try before spending money on this.</li>
            <li> It works! Have to keep using it but it deffinitly works!</li>
            <li> After a week of using it, I&#x27;ve realized that my eyelashes have been getting longer. I am so amazed at this stuff. People should use.</li>
            <li> After a month or so, I started to see some results with longer lashes. It even filled in areas of my eyebrows that had been sparse and take years to grow back after a bad waxing job.</li>
            <li> Been using this 5 weeks now and it WORKS! !  I read some other reviews about dark staining around the eyes..but so far I haven&#x27;t experienced that.  .. would really recommend this to others!</li>
            <li> It takes a few weeks dnt give up...I used it on my eyebrows, I have new hair growth long an thick . Honestly I thought there was no hope, well I found it! LOVE♥ IT!&lt;br /&gt; Miss.Gracie</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of a friend, it has been 3 weeks and my lashes are noticeably longer, thinker and darker!  Debated trying Latisse, but this is much more reasonable and the applicator is a cinch to use. Love it!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and have noticed a significant amount of growth in both lashes and brows. Very easy to use. The price on Amazon was great compared out in the stores. I love  Rapidlash!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for lash lengthening. It costs less than and works better than most other lash lentheners!</li>
            <li> I started losing my eyelashes,  and eyebrows a few years ago due to hypothyroidism. I am now on biotin to help with my nail and hair growth and I decided to try Rapidlash. I could see results within a week. My eyebrows started coming back in and my eyelashes are filling in and look like they did when I was younger. It does make my eyelids darker where it gets on my lid but I can live with that. A little eye makeup and it blends right in. I just ordered my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I started using it after I saw a girlfriends sister&#x27;s lashes but was in disbelief because she does a lot of different things to herself...&lt;br /&gt;plastic work---3 x on her body and face that I know of...&lt;br /&gt;But her eyelashes had no mascara and they were thick and long...and she was selling it also.&lt;br /&gt;Pissed me off so I ordered but not at this price!!&lt;br /&gt;I used it and it does work if you are faithful and follow it to the T...&lt;br /&gt;My were growing so fast and long they were hitting my bangs at night and waking me up...seriously.&lt;br /&gt;so I started getting noticed wow! your eyelashes are beautifully long...are they natural?&lt;br /&gt;I have several girlfriends who had spent a fortune on the real hair false long eyelashes over and over...&lt;br /&gt;they noticed!!! also...so one girlfriend I gave her what I had left...half of it probably and weeks later asked if she had used it--no have not had time...I wanted to say give it back ...but instead I will just order a new one...and not every give her something free again...she wants it! she doesn&#x27;t want it...she is not a consist person on doing things...but she is jealous of my eyelashes and now my eyebrows are coming in also... love the product...recommend you do it early before bed so they are kinda dry because it can run on to side of eyes and hair can grow there also...LOL</li>
            <li> the delivery was VERY fast. It got here within 3 days i think!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it since I got it, and I can tell already that my eye lashes has gotten longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price! fast delivery! It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Works like a dream! Within a month my eyelashes looked significantly longer! I just repurchased it and waiting for the next tube is agonizing! To begin with my eyelashes were a good length but after using Rapidlash I can notice how long my eyelashes are even without mascara and with mascara people always ask if my eyelashes are real because they can&#x27;t believe how long my eyelashes are. Such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ussed this product for a couple of years and love it.. It really works. I use it every night. It lasts a long time..I&#x27;m 69 years young and have beautiful long lashes thanks to Rapidlash.</li>
            <li> I was amazed to have long eyelashes for the first time in my life!  They even hold mascara better and might be thicker!  My daughter started using it and gave up her extensions after seeing mine!  Give it a month or so and enjoy lashes!!!  Just orered my 2nd bottle!</li>
            <li> Due to chemotherapy I lost my brows and most of lashes. This product was recommended to me. I have been using it for three months now and happy and excited to say that I now have recognizable brows and lashes. Due to chemo, I know it took longer to show signs of working, but worth the wait! Fantastic product. Easy to apply each evening.</li>
            <li> I have been applying this for 4 weeks.  So far there is no changes to lashes.  Very disappointed. Also you can&#x27;t tell how much fluid is in the tube or on the brush.  It is a guessing game hoping you apply enough on your eye lids.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every night before bed time and I see some difference in my lashes. They seem a little darker and just a tad bit longer. I read reviews online to see what other people were saying because I was still skeptical and a review said that their product was sent to them expired! I checked my tube and I was also one of those unlucky ones that got an expired tube! I&#x27;m wondering if I should ever even order from Amazon again or just go buy the product from the actual website. Maybe I would get more dramatic results.</li>
            <li> My lashes were falling out and becoming very sparse. Since I&#x27;ve been using rapid lash, they have filled in and grown. My hair dresser noticed them and showed them to the lady at the salon who does eyelash extensions. They were both amazed. This is a great product and one that actually does what promises!</li>
            <li> I used it for over 8 weeks never missing a day. It also made my eyes burn at times. I am now using latisse.</li>
            <li> I came really close to forking out the $100 a month and getting those amazing eyelash extensions. I have really blonde, really short eyelashes. But then after talking to a lot of friends, it turns out that some people after months of wearing those thingys don&#x27;t have much left of their eyelashes once they are removed. I guess cheap glue can ruin your natural lashes. Well I wasn&#x27;t willing to risk it. So I purchased rapidlash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, there are a lot of people leaving reviews that this product was a waste of money and did nothing for them. And I myself, after 4 weeks of using it felt the same way. I was determined to figure out why no results? I  re-read the directions one more time and decided to give it one more month trial (there is enough for 3 months).So I am so happy to tell you that after the next 4 weeks of using it THE RIGHT WAY I was amazed at the difference. The directions say, \\&quot;apply it like eye-liner.\\&quot; Well I don&#x27;t know how you apply eye-liner, but I put it on my lid and it doesn&#x27;t touch my lashes at all. Hence: no results the first month. So here is what made a HUGE difference once I figured things out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Use a GENEROUS amount!! Some women say they get results with only using a very small amount, but like I said, when I did that I saw absolutely no results. Depending on the packaging, you may need to dip your wand several times to get a lot on the brush. The tube of rapidlash from this seller had a nice tube that is easy to apply. Then later I purchased the 2-pack that is also for sale here on amazon and I did not like the packaging. There was like hardly anything on the brush when you pull it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 2. Don&#x27;t apply it like eyeliner! And what I mean by that is, don&#x27;t apply any to your eye LID. I don&#x27;t know why they would say that in the directions? I wasted a whole month of this stuff because the dumb directions have an illustration that makes it appear that you should apply it to your lids. Just apply to the base of your LASHES ONLY. Don&#x27;t worry about the bottom lashes. As you blink and then go to sleep the product will naturally get onto the lower lashes on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Use it every single night&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you go....once I applied in generously, like really wet lashes, WOW! Within 1 week I saw what everyone was talking about. My lashes are even a bit darker. Nothing dramatic, but I could get away with not wearing mascara now if I use and eyelash curler.  I see the most dramatic difference when I am wearing mascara, but now I only use a tiny bit of mascara which is pretty exciting! I hate that gross caked on mascara look that I use to have. I mean,this stuff is amazing! I feel all girly. Totally worth the $30.</li>
            <li> This product really works. It takes about 5 to 6 weeks to see results, however after that, you can clearly see longer and fuller lashes with consistent use. I used every night so far and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> Did not grow anything! Do not buy! I used it for 60 days. Twice a day. It did not grow anything.</li>
            <li> Big improvement  in my eyelashes. Gave one to my sister love it. Would recommend it friends. Also cheaper than what use to pay</li>
            <li> It is a nice product, but I just feel that the product is not as &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; than I have expected.</li>
            <li> it definitely works for me. the only problem that i have with the product is that it is hard to tell if I applied the necessary amount on my eyelids. there is no feel when I apply it in contrast to other similar products that you can feel what was applied.</li>
            <li> it worked for me at least with the first bottle. When i bought the second one, i didn&#x27;t notice as much of a change.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me but the plus side it causes no irritation or minimal unlike latisse</li>
            <li> I bought this product in November.  I have long, straight and fair at the tips eyelashes.  It is now the beginning of February and there is absolutely NO doubt that the condition of my eyelashes has improved.  They seem thicker although I know hair follicles cannot be created, but they also seem much longer and healthier with less falling.  I am definitely going to continue with this product.  It is amazing.</li>
            <li> This should really get no stars but that&#x27;s not an option. I should have listened to the other 1-star reviewers who said they received this product and it had already expired months ago. Sure enough, I received my order of the RapidLash Eyelash Enhancing Serum and saw that it had expired in August! Six months ago!! Total waste of money. I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> Worked well and started noticing results about the 4th week.  I am happy with the product and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This is the 4th time i have purchased it and it does work on lashes not as well on the brows!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about three weeks and can definitely tell that my lashes are longer and fuller. Other people have also noticed and made comments. No side effects in my case.</li>
            <li> This product works, but it takes about a month to see results and you have to use it every day without fail.  Although I have tried other products that take less time to work, they are far more expensive.  For the price, this product is great!</li>
            <li> The use of a period of time, I feel the effect. My eyelashes long out, and begin to grow. Great!.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 6 weeks &amp; have noticed thicker eyelashes &amp; they are starting to get longer. I will reorder &amp; can&#x27;t wait to see the length that they get. I did not get any discoloration at all. It does sting slightly at times when you apply but very minimal. More tingling than anything.</li>
            <li> I must admit, I was very skeptical, but after reading all the positive reviews, I definitely thought it was worth a try. I used to have nice eyelashes, but after getting fake eyelashes put on at a salon, that all changed. When I went to take the fake eyelashes off, I wind up pulling all of my real eye lashes out. I thought that they would grow back after a while, but after 3 years, I realized that were never growing back. I&#x27;ve been using Rapidlash for about a month now and my eyelashes are so long! I can&#x27;t stop looking at them in the mirror! My co-working actually asked me what mascara I was using to make my lashes so long. I told her it was Rapidlash! This stuff really works! It is a bit pricey, but it is worth it! When I apply it at night, it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn my eyes. I can&#x27;t even tell that I have anything on! It&#x27;s just amazing! I can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about it!</li>
            <li> I can see my eyelashes when I blink now and sometimes I feel like I have false eyelashes on.  The results are taking some getting used to for me, but there are results most definitely!  And honestly, I only use it a few times a week!</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews - and just KNEW I had to try it!&lt;br /&gt;This IS wonderful - After two weeks I noticed a difference - my lashes ARE longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I run out of this bottle, I certainly plan on buying more (I may even get a couple as a Christmas present for family!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the price - can&#x27;t beat it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly and neatly packaged!</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing for me. I can&#x27;t say I hate it just because it wasn&#x27;t irritating like a few other lash products I&#x27;ve tried. Both Latisse and the original Revitalash turned my eyelids red but gave me amazing full lashes. Wait a minute, I do hate it, it doesn&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li> it does work.. but so does vaseline.. which I read about after I bought this LOL.  Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product really does work, but with consequences. I noticed I started getting little bumps around my eye lid after a month of use and they are painful to remove. They are like little cysts but not quite as bad.</li>
            <li> i HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR OVER A YEAR NOW, AND I CAN NOTICE IF I FORGET FOR SEVERAL DAYS IN A ROW.  MORE LASHES FALL OUT, BUT IF I USE THE PRODUCT REGULARLY (I USE IT EVERY OTHER NIGHT), IT REALLY HELPS.  aLSO I NOTICE MY LASHES ARE LONGER THAN THEY USE TO BE.  I AM 73 YEARS OLD, SO ONE DOES NOT EXPECT ONE&#x27;S LASHES TO GROW LONGER.  THANKS FOR A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> update: February 22, 2014&lt;br /&gt;I have found that the product just didn&#x27;t work as well after the first tube.  I also noticed some irritation of my eyelids.  They sometimes were red, and lately I noticed what seemed like tiny blisters. This made me skip the treatment some nights, and then the growth effect wore right off.  I&#x27;m halfway through my third tube, and my eyelashes are short again, and rather straight.  This makes them almost invisible.  Because of the diminished returns and the side effects, I have stopped using Rapidlash.  I am in search once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I started using RapidLash approximately 3 months ago.  I only used it on the upper eyelashes and eyebrow of my right eye.  The left eye was the untreated control. After about a month, it seemed to me that it was working, but it was not obvious.  However, the effect was encouraging enough to continue.  I used it every night without skipping.  After two months, the difference was clearer.  So far it has made the eyelashes on the treated eye look darker, and a bit thicker and longer.  I can&#x27;t say for sure that it is having an effect on the eyebrow, but I will continue the treatment.  Please see the picture I uploaded of my eyes.  The effect is not spectacular so far, but I&#x27;m in my early fifties, so to me it&#x27;s nothing short of a miracle. Please note that the photographs do not show the difference as clearly as I can see it myself. My husband, who took the pictures, says that it&#x27;s time to start treating the left eye. He can clearly see the difference.  I selected the right eye initially because on that side the eyelashes were slightly more sparse than those on the left.  After almost 3 months of treatment, it is now the other way around.&lt;br /&gt;I have not observed any change in the color of either the eye, or the eyelid.  I always apply the serum to the skin at the base of the eyelashes, sometimes between the lashes too. My old tube is almost used up now.  I store it upside down, so thebrush will be dragged through the serum when I use the tube.&lt;br /&gt;Another user mentioned that the active ingredient of this formulation is a chemical called isopropyl cloprostenate.  That chemical is on the list of ingredients for the tube I bought in August, but not on the one I bought in October.  There are a few other differences. I uploaded a picture of the side of both boxes with the list of ingredients.  There is a different chemical known as miristoyl pentapeptide 17 in the second tube.  Does anybody have a positive (or any) experience to report about the new formula? Did it work for you?  Some people commented that some tubes worked and others didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Soon I&#x27;ll be starting to treat the left side too. I  hope the new formulation is as effective as the one I got initially. I hope it works for you too.  I guess the effectiveness depends on age, and on how long before treatment hair growth started slowing down. My eyebrows have been very sparse for at  least 6 years, and my eyelashes have been getting shorter and thinner for several years.</li>
            <li> I have gotten eyelash extensions and used all different kinds of products and I only saw a difference with Revitalash. I never should have tried anything different.  I used this as directed and see NO difference ..if anything the seem to be a little sparse.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product (this is a replenishment for me) hoping it would fill in my natural eyebrows. After using it for sometime between 4 to 6 weeks, it works! I would like to use it for my eyelashes, too, but am afraid that it may darken my &amp;#34;baby blues&amp;#34;, so I will not go there. But I can absolutely vouch for the eyebrows!</li>
            <li> Helped improve lashes somewhat but it took several months.  If your a mature woman with fine thinning hair, don&#x27;t expect to get long lush dramatic eyelashes quickly.  But I must say it definitely improved mine with more growth after 4 months, but just not as dark, full and long as I hoped. Eyebrows improved very little, the ends still won&#x27;t grow out.  Just the same, I would recommend this product and I do think its better that Smart Lash because you only need to apply it once per day instead of twice with Smart lash and you get the same results. This saves money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Wow, by mid to late November I noticed just how much my eyelashes have actually improved by volume and length. Now when I curl my eyelashes and put on mascara my eyelashes look like they did when I was in my teens! My eyebrows have also improved. It took several months but with patience and persistence it paid off big time. I&#x27;m completely sold on this product now.</li>
            <li> My friend suggested for me to use this. It works as well as Latisse and the price is unbeatable. I can see a huge diffrence in my eye lashes:)</li>
            <li> I rarely ever write reviews, good or bad, but I&#x27;ve made an exception.  This product is amazing.  I am approaching 45 and my eyebrows are getting thinner.  I&#x27;m very self-conscious because of this.  I&#x27;ve tried Latisse, which as we all know, is extremely expensive.  Even after using Latisse and throwing away my money, nothing made my eyelashes or eyebrows grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I basically tried this product to see if my eyebrows would grow, not necessarily my eyelashes. My doctor even recommended I use Latisse on my eyebrows.  I did, and nothing.  I was very disappointed.  Then, I saw a deal on another website for Rapid Lash on sale.  Having nothing to lose, I bought it.  The very same day I received it, I started using it.  After a few weeks of using this product, I started noticing both my eyelashes and eyebrows growing.  Knowing how fast and effective this product is, I then bought a pack of 2 from Amazon.  It is less than 1/2 the price of what Latisse costs and package contains 2.  I am extremely happy with the way my eyebrows have grown, but am also very happy with my eyelashes as well.  With a little mascara, it looks as if I&#x27;m wearing fake eyelashes.  They are very long.  I will keep using this product forever!</li>
            <li> I used this product after trying the &amp;#34;more expensive&amp;#34; brand that is available.  I don&#x27;t know if it was a fluke in my case, but this product caused my eyelids to become red/irritated where the product was applied to the lash line.  Both the upper and lower lid lines were red and itchy. While the product appeared clear as it came out of the tube, I noticed a reddish discoloration on a portion of the white plastic barrel directly above the brush.  Of course, I didn&#x27;t take note of this discoloration until I awoke to sense that my eyes itched and my lid lines appeared red and inflamed.&lt;br /&gt;While I didn&#x27;t continue to use the product to see if it works as stated, I wanted to mark the product that I &amp;#34;didn&#x27;t like it&amp;#34; because of the discoloration noticed on the barrel.  I applied the product as directed on the included package insert and, having used a similar product in the past without irritation or unwanted side effects, can not chalk the irritation up to &amp;#34;user error.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If someone can lend some insight into whether the reddish discoloration is commonly seen on the barrel, that might put my mind at ease a bit more about repurchasing and giving the product another chance.  Until then, I am uncomfortable purchasing this product again or using the remaining portion of the bottle to see if the product works as claimed.  It is a shame, since this product was a less expensive option and had received positive reviews from others.</li>
            <li> My friend noticed my lashes are longer and thicker. I&#x27;ve continued use for over a year. I never let myself run out!</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, this stuff works.  I have very sensitive eyes, and have never had a problem with it hurting my eyes in any way.  And, it does help your lashes fill in and grow.  Try it.</li>
            <li> jury is still out but some change, slow. Waiting to see.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered on time, easy to open. I may try a second tube. ??</li>
            <li> It turned my eye lids orangeish color that lasted for six months - I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it at all to anyone</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I am imagining this, but after four weeks my lashes look longer.  They seem longer but not thicker yet.  I don&#x27;t even take off my eye makeup first.  I did that at first and got a rash from all the makeup remover chemicals.  I have very sensitive skin  but this product is not bothering me at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now and I&#x27;m ecstatic to say I&#x27;m seeing results. My lashes are short AND thin so long lashes are one of my obsessions. I&#x27;ve used this product on my upper and lower lashes once a day, right before bed. (I&#x27;m not sure if this helped either but I started using regular mascara on my upper lashes during the day because I read that helps protect your lashes from the harsh weather.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most noticeable growth was on my lower, left eyelashes. I literally had about 5 lashes there when I first started. Now, they&#x27;re growing and even slightly longer! They&#x27;re still thin so it&#x27;s hard to see them but I&#x27;m happy to see results. I can also see results on my upper lashes! It&#x27;s only a little bit but I can tell there&#x27;s growth. I will keep using this and hoping for bigger results!</li>
            <li> Started using this about a month ago. So far I think I am seeing a little change in my eyebrows and still hopeful for more positive results.</li>
            <li> too soon to see how enhancing it will be. It is clear and as yet I see no change.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about my eyelash enhance serum but I noticed that it was expired that I received an expired item I didn&#x27;t realize until a week later but I had wondered if it was normal for my eyes to burn using it and well I stopped using it already because I don&#x27;t want to risk loosing my eyelashes instead of gaining new ones</li>
            <li> This is a Latisse knockoff, and affordable to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this in January, on my lash line only.  I am on my second tube and started using it on my eyebrows just a couple weeks ago.  I can&#x27;t say what it will do for my eyebrows, because it does take time to get results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make a long story short, my lashes are slightly longer and thicker.  I do not make any claims that it helps grow lashes, but I have noticed my eyelashes are not falling out as quickly as they were before I started using it.  I was losing four or five lashes from each eyelid every day when I washed my face in the evening.  Now I&#x27;m losing one or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that correct application, right at the roots, helps keep the hair follicles in good condition.  I have no scientific proof, and I can&#x27;t guarantee you will have the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though this is only .1 ounce, there is more than enough product for you to determine whether it works for you.  Give it at least four weeks, and follow the label instructions to the letter.  Feel free to drop a comment and let me know if you like it.</li>
            <li> Okay so this product definitely works BUT once you stop using it get, get ready to say bye bye to those lashes that you love and going back to normal. As a product it does what it should, but doesn&#x27;t last. Disappointed but will continue to be on the lookout for something that holds up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rapidlash with good success for a couple of years now.  I get a better price checking on Amazon that I do at local stores.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product and I used it religiously (most mornings AND nights!) but, alas, nothing after 3 months of continual use. Time to throw it away and go back to the expensive Latisse -- which worked when I tried it two years ago.</li>
            <li> I havent been keeping track of how long i been using this but i definitely see a difference in my lash length so i just use it everyday, usually twice a day even though it says your not supposed to lol the only downfall is it leaves my eyelids a bit puffy, even when i was using it as directed. Overall, im pretty happy with this product! I have tried grandlash and smartlash so far and i like this one the best.</li>
            <li> I have used LiLash previously w/ outstanding results.  I saw the good reviews for this and decided to give it a try as it was MUCH less expensive.  I have been using it daily for a couple months and I see nothing.  Sorry - no luck here.</li>
            <li> Watch out!  If you get even a tiny bit in your eye wash it out quickly or you&#x27;ll be wearing a pirate patch for a while, I am.  I&#x27;m just  hoping and praying this won&#x27;t last for long.  On the bright side, my right eye seems fine.</li>
            <li> I tried this product straight from City Cosmetics and after awhile I found my lashes thickening up and noticed the length increasing.  i get a lot of compliments.  I decided to purchase from Amazon and continue to use it.  I am also using it on  my very sparse brows and notice hair growing in.  I am sold on this.  In also purchased Ardell Brow which is a great conditioning product for both lashes and brow.</li>
            <li> I use it every night before the bed. It works for me but also it makes my eyelashes fall out. So now i stop using it. Because i think i used enough for the eyelashes already.</li>
            <li> This product worked amazingly. Longer, thicker and darker lashes. However, the entire time I had eye irritation. About two months in, my eyes started itching really badly and even became super swollen. After the swelling went down, I tested it out again and my eyes swelled up again. I have awful allergies anyway so I would say this product is not for those of us that have sensitive eyes or allergies. But it DOES work:-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple years now.l  I&#x27;m very very happy with it. Ive seen a noticable difference in my lashes</li>
            <li> I was very sceptical, but after using this product faithfully every day, I noticed a difference after 2-3 weeks.  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I apply once each evening and if I&#x27;m having a makeup free weekend day I&#x27;ll apply it in the morning as well. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and am very happy with the results. My eyelashes used to be sparse and light and now they&#x27;re fuller and longer. When I curl my lashes I&#x27;ve been asked if I&#x27;m wearing extensions and I love being able to say no!</li>
            <li> So been using this for three days now on my lashes and eye brows and I can see growth on my eye brows already, I did take before pictures so by week 4 I will measure the difference but looks promising so far.....would recommend for those look to get fuller eye brows and lashes. It&#x27; doesn&#x27;t itch if when it comes in contact with eyes which is a good thing because am super sensitive. Love it.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. I needed to fill in a missing patch of eyebrow hair,  due to over plucking.  After using the whole tube,  I still have no hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this to grow out my lashes and my eyebrows (eyebrows especially).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyebrows had gotten fairly thin from years of over-plucking. After about a month of use (i.e. since I received it), my brows had already gotten noticeably thicker. I finally just got my brows professionally reshaped and have had many compliments on how full they look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes have been growing out a lot more slowly, but the growth is still noticeable. Given the fantastic results with my brows, I was hoping for a more &amp;#34;falsie&amp;#34; eyelash look, but I&#x27;m still happy with what I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
            <li> Results take time,,but be patient before you give up. The first month to almost 2 months I couldn&#x27;t see a difference. I was very disappointed as all the reviews said I would see amazing results fast. I didn&#x27;t. However I continued to us rapid lash , reluctantly as I had nearly given up on it working for me. I even skipped nights thinking it doesn&#x27;t really matter any way. (Lol)  But somewhere around the 2 month or so mark, I began to notice my marykay mascara (in which previously was \\&quot;just ok\\&quot; ) was looking better and better with each application. Before I was unhappy with nearly every mascara I had tried, I am seeing now, that the lashes were the problem!! Almost any mascara will do it&#x27;s job when the lashes are healthy and full!!! I am getting lots of compliments and everyone wants to know why my lashes look so good!</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product. I began to use it and didn&#x27;t see much results but wanted to keep trying. Then, by chance I saw the bottom of the tube and it had and expiration date of 12/13, which was almost six months from when I purchased it. I emailed the seller and amazon refunded my money right away. I am grateful for that. I won&#x27;t buy this product again, very disappointing.</li>
            <li> During chemotherapy I lost all my hair, eyebrows and eyelashes.  I purchased this product for use on my eyebrows because my eyes are very sensitive and I was worried about getting product in them.  Upon completion of chemo and after 3-4 weeks of use I had the thickest eyebrows of my entire life and still had no eyelashes and the hair on my head was only about a mm in length.  That made me think the Rapidlash really worked.</li>
            <li> Although Rapidlash does work to extend eyelash growth, one or more of its ingredients can also darken the skin where it is applied. The skin returns to its normal color when application is halted (along with the eyelashes). It can also cause darkening of the iris, which cannot be reversed.</li>
            <li> Be patient. After years of over doing it on the plucking of the brows, I was left with sparse eyebrows. use this on them and they will start to grow again!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well.  I have to admit I had my doubts but I have used it for about 6 wks. and I finally have eye lashes you can see, with or without mascara.  They look awesome with mascara.  I will be purchasing more of this.  Easy to use, once a day before bed.  If you can put eyeliner on then you can do this, it&#x27;s that easy.</li>
            <li> I lost of my eyebrows due to my thyroid. With Rapidlash I noticed I am getting my eyebrows back after applying to my eyebrow area. My lashes appear longer thicker and darker at the roots after 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> This product really works!  It initially takes about four weeks for the full benefits, and my lashes are definitely longer and thicker.  By continued use, I now have prettier lashes!</li>
            <li> I have only had this rapid eyelash enhancing serum a few week. But Using it nightly is so simple.  I feel like it makes my lashes healthier.  It is like putting conditioner on your hair, but this is for your lashes.  Eyelashes seem plumper.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT, IT IS HELPING MY EYELASHES GETTING LONGER, BUT WISH THERE WAS A PRODUCT THAT WOULD MAKE IT GROW FASTER THOUG.</li>
            <li> After 2 months, my lashes are just the tiniest bit longer (maybe 1/16 an inch, if that).  They are not any fuller or thicker.  I&#x27;m not too impressed with it and I paid $50 at Ulta for it, so I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> still trying it will see if it works for me need another month to decide.&lt;br /&gt;seems ok need to try it longer</li>
            <li> After three weeks I have noticed minimal change. Hopefully in the weeks to come they will grow longer keeping my fingers crossed,but  too impressed yet.</li>
            <li> It really works. After one week of applying the product, I noticed both my eyebrows and eyelashes grows. I&#x27;m really happy to find something that can save my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It doesnt make miracles but it works and I was so happy to not have to wear so  much make up. I have also been careful what I wash my face with. I have a feeling whatever I was using was drying out the eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyelashes felt more coarse but were longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> This product works for me. It has been over 45 days. The life of a lash is approx. 45 days. I was applying above the lash along the hair line. My lashes are about an 1/8 inch and 4 row wide, so I was spreading the product with my finger to make sure of coverage. Beware of getting the product places you don&#x27;t want hair to darken or grow longer. I had extra hair growing longer, darker and noticeable on my eyelid. Had to change my way of applying. I like this product. I apply at night because after applying it, it dries and coats with a white film, very noticeable, I don&#x27;t wear mascara as needed that often. Mascara can be applied after applying the Rapidlash Eyelash Enhancing Serum.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 4 weeks. I put it on before bed. I originally bought these to see if I could grow my eye brows back in,&lt;br /&gt;so far I haven&#x27;t noticed anything, I started putting it on my upper lashes as well. I can&#x27;t say I notice a big difference with no makeup on, but when I put mascara on, wow! I really can see a difference in the length. Says you won&#x27;t see full effects for 16 weeks,  I have to say so far I am impressed</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference within a week.... Used it 2x, sometimes makes my eye a little bit red but other than that i believe its working!</li>
            <li> Wow!!!!!!  What a wonderful product.  Will continue buying and will also gift to family and friends.  I actually am getting back my eyelashes I had in my 20&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m 54 and my lashes were short and brittle.  I know the product says results in 4 weeks, however, I&#x27;m impressed with the results after 2 weeks.  I didn&#x27;t think to do a before picture.  I read the reviews and was very skeptical but went ahead and ordered.  I&#x27;m very happy I did.  Can&#x27;t wait to see how much longer they will become!  I&#x27;m a true blonde and my eyelashes and eyebrows are almost invisible so that&#x27;s why I wore mascara.  You do have to use it several times a week in order to maintain your lashes.  That&#x27;s not a hassle for me as I have added it to my nightly routine and it only adds a few seconds.  The end result is well worth those few seconds.  No regrets here.</li>
            <li> I have been using rapid lash for about a month now. My lashes did not explode, but I can tell they are&lt;br /&gt;Thicker and longer. It did not bother my sensitive eyes and I apply it every night. I think in a couple of&lt;br /&gt;Months I will really see a difference. I would recommend this product as long as you don&#x27;t expect a miracle&lt;br /&gt;Overnight.</li>
            <li> It really works!! You have to use it every night to see the best results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 5 months and the result it&#x27;s not what I&#x27;ve expected , I say this product it&#x27;s waste money and time .</li>
            <li> My lashes looked  like my daughters who had them put on every 2 weeks for $60.00 bucks.  She now uses rapid lash and my girl friend who lost all her lashes from cancer treatment now has lashes and feels like a new person.  It works, there is nothing more to say.  Mine getting so long, I have to take a break for a while.  It is the best.</li>
            <li> Less than a month my eyelashes were long great product. Love it!</li>
            <li> The only affordable product I&#x27;ve found that actually comes through for lash &amp; brow growth in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased this, I have seen a difference in the length of my lashes , just wonder if it can be used on the lower lashes, I would purchase this product again .</li>
            <li> OMG!!!  This product is amazing. I don&#x27;t write reviews normally, but I had to set aside time to write this one. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I am telling all my friends to buy it.</li>
            <li> I love to use eye lash enhancers.  I bought this product because I have read a lot of good things about it.  This product does work good.  I have used Lash MD products and like those a lot better. The results with  Rapidlash are very subtle, Lash MD results are more dramatic. Rapidlash does not make your eyes burn or turn them red unlike the other eyelash enhancing products. I would not buy this product again.  I am going to go back to Lash MD.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, seems to work.  I have used it before as I have a medical issue that causes me to loose my eye brows and this works, it takes a few weeks but it worked for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over 2 weeks applying it twice a day (morning before make up and at night before bed). I thought my eyelids were getting dark and discolored but it turned out to be left-over mascara. So be sure to apply this when all make-up is removed on a freshly washed face. Also, this has worked wonders on my weird hair deprived eyebrow lol. It&#x27;s pretty awesome!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  Tried the new eyelash extensions.  Had to pull them of due to eyes tearing up and itching terribly. Unfortunately my natural lashes went with them.  This product brought them back fast!  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This works! Have been using this product for 3 months and am amazed by the results. In my 40&#x27;s an had thinning lashes an no lashes on parts of my eyelids from hormonal changes. Considered Latisse for a long time but was too scared to use it, because of all of the disclaimers. RapidLash works better than I could have ever hoped for. I noticed a difference within two weeks and today, after 3 months of use before bed each night, my lashes are full, long and beautiful. I looked like I didn&#x27;t have lashes without make up on before, and now you can see them beautifully. I also only need one or two swipes of mascara now and my lashes almost look like falsies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noticed a couple of reviews about the product burning a little. I can say I experience this very randomly with the product immediately after application, but it goes away almost instantly. It is absolutely worth trying. Just stick with it. Amazing.</li>
            <li> So a few months ago I went and got some fake eyelashes on and when they started to come off so did my real eyelashes. I was so upset because I&#x27;ve always had great eyelashes but we always want more. After doing a lot of research I found Rapidlash and it works miracles. Not only are my eyelashes back but they look amazing. Don&#x27;t over think it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this now for a few months and have noticed a significant difference in the number of eyelashes that I have and also their length.  The visible difference in the length of the eyelashes has been the most noticeable part. It took about 3 weeks to notice they were growing well, and then they lengthened further over subsequent weeks. It takes just a few seconds to apply, so simple. I am very happy with this product and just ordered another one.</li>
            <li> I had revitalash before and is way too expensive and now you cant find that anymore, my eyelashes where hughe w that product but you had to be consistent for 2 months straight, I try rapidlash and at first it looks like the bottle was empty but not much comes out of it, soo far soo good, my eyelashes look good, but not incredible lush lashes nor super long, but definetly improvement for how they are normally. and cheaper product too, I do recomend this product!!</li>
            <li> I use this product daily and haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference yet.  Will continue for next 30 days and rate again</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical since this produce is so much less expensive than the doctor&#x27;s office brand.  After 3 months of constant use I can actually say it works, it works, it works!  My lashes are really thicker but they are probably 3 times as long as they have ever been.  I use to hate using mascara because, when it was time to remove it, several of the few lashes I had came out.  Now, I love showing my lashes off.  I just purchased high end mascara justifying the purchase with all that I saved using Rapidlash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember to use it every night and be patient.  Oh and the directions said not to use on bottom lashes.  Recently I began using on my brows as well hoping the &amp;#34;tails&amp;#34; will grow in.  Still waiting for that to happen but I do think the brows that were there are getting longer.  I had to get my hairdresser to color them because I was beginning to actually SEE the color of my brows.</li>
            <li> I used up a bottle of Latisse and noticed obvious good results.  This stuff is not even close.  Since I&#x27;ve been using it, I&#x27;ve noticed my eyelashes and eyebrows shrinking and getting thinner.  Not sure why, but I&#x27;m going back to Latisse even though it&#x27;s more expensive.</li>
            <li> My lashes were becoming so thin with age, so I decided to give this product a try.  It really works!  I don&#x27;t think my lashes have ever been this long, ever.  The cost is reasonable, especially compared to prescription alternatives.  I don&#x27;t get any irritation from this product.  One eye has longer lashes than the other, so it&#x27;s not perfect, but I&#x27;m not complaining.  I&#x27;m totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in just a few weeks.  My lashes were longer but not necessarily fuller -still an improvement.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to work for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> They made my eyes bloodshot after the second day of using them.  After a week, I had to give up because people were super concerned about me because of how red my eyes were!  Plus, they burned after applying....no good.</li>
            <li> I know this product needs time to work. What I am noticing now is the lashes are not breaking as easily, will continue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it and the serum you can buy in drug stores these days..no difference. It did work at first then it just stopped. Never worked again.</li>
            <li> Update- I tossed this item after not noticing any results after 6 weeks. About a week later I noticed I DID actually have a little extra growth. I dug it back out of my junk drawer and have continued to use. It&#x27;s definitely not drastic but it is a little noticeable. Enough so that I will continue to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original post- Unfortunately, this product did not work for me. I have very short sparse eyelashes. I used this product everyday for 6 weeks and received 0 results. This was my first eyelash system to use and will probably try something else.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product off an on for several years. I can tell you that is makes my lashes noticeably longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> I applied this product nightly and within 6 weeks noticed a nice lengthening and darkening to my upper lashes! I used the same tube for 3 months.  I LOVED IT!  I purchased this in lieu of latisse-type medications, due to the price of those Rx&#x27;s and also the side effects. I&#x27;ve stopped using it during my pregnancy, and I hate that I now have my tiny thin short lashes back. Can&#x27;t wait to pop this kiddo out and get back to using the Rapidlash!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for two months everyday but nothing happened. My eyelashes were longer with an another procuct (which isn&#x27;t produced anymore) when I started to use Rapidlash. Then now my eyelashes are all short as my original length. So dissapointed. I have to start look for an another one...</li>
            <li> It works great.  I saw results in less then 30 days.  Love it! I will purchase it again. no side effects</li>
            <li> This stuff works!  I have used many others in the past that are much more exspensive. This one works just as well, if not better!  I swear, not only are my eyelashes longer but they seem thicker too!  Don&#x27;t hesitate!  Get it!  You&#x27;ll be happy you did!  :)</li>
            <li> This product works pretty well and is a lot less expensive than it&#x27;s competitors.  I&#x27;ve not used Latisse because of the expense and I&#x27;m afraid my eye color will change.  Rapidlash has helped make my existing lashes longer, but I have not noticed them getting any fuller, so I don&#x27;t think it aids in the growth of new lashes.  My eyelids do itch after I&#x27;ve applied it, but there is no redness, flaking or swelling and I&#x27;ve gotten it in my eyes without any harm as well.</li>
            <li> Not just amazing, but AMAZING! I have really good lashes anyway, but now they are crazy long....almost too long and so many new lashes. Can not say enough good things. I use it nightly on clean lashes and I never forget. I do not use it in the morning. Must stick with the routine, as with anything, results come from committing to the product.</li>
            <li> I got this within 2 days and right away I put it on. I have been using this for about a week, once in the morning and once at night. No mascara, just this and I have noticed a difference. I have notice after my 2nd baby that my eyelashes weren&#x27;t what they used to be. So after seeing what other people were saying on here, I thought I should try it out. I&#x27;m very happy and I can&#x27;t wait to see what they will look like after a month.</li>
            <li> super great. High recommend it, just be patient and keep using for 2 weeks and you will see the difference!</li>
            <li> I used Lash Genesis and that was definitely better, however about $20 more, so you get what you pay for. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes, which is great, but shows the serum is on the weaker side.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used prescription eyelash growers with excellent results, but I started using Rapidlash because it was less expensive. I used it for over 2 months, applying it every single night (I even watched youtube videos before I began applying it to make sure I knew how to do it properly) and saw absolutely no improvement in my eyelash length, color, or thickness. What I did see-- and what finally made me stop using it-- was an uncomfortable dryness in and around my eyes. I talked to some friends about it and apparently this isn&#x27;t that uncommon with this product. I&#x27;ll be moving on to something else...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month and I started to notice my lashes filling in after about 2 weeks.  I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a dramatic difference but it is definitely an improvement on my old blah lashes.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this every night as I should, it&#x27;s more like every couple of nights. But with that being said I have definitely noticed a change in my eyelashes. They don&#x27;t seem much thicker, but they are for sure longer and darker! I would recommend only using it at night because sometimes when you wake up its tried on your eyelashes and looks a little like glue. You probably wouldn&#x27;t want to be walking around with that at all day.</li>
            <li> I bought this many years ago while it costed me about $50 each. I applied it every night before bed, just the top eye lid. Took me about 2 months to see several strands got little longer than the rest. But good side is, my lashes were stronger than before. After I used this serum, I noticed that my lashes didnt drop off as much, which always irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> This made my lashes longer and prettier after about 3 weeks of nightly use.  Once I stopped using it, my lashes returned to normal.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> I quickly reviewed before bc I received it super fast and try to give everyone 5 stars..After actually using it and going through 2 bottles, I was left with less lashes and the ones I had were broken off. I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like that in my life. At first I thought the broken ones were new growth, but after using it for over 4 months, I came to realize how damaged they were. Now about 6 months has passed since I quit using Rapidlash and I have been using a coating conditioner b4 applying my mascara, my lashes are great. So at least no permanent damage :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Rapidlash for several years. Pros: Long lashes for sure.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: sometimes lashes grow crooked, but still look thick with mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the product and the price.</li>
            <li> This is my second time using this product. It works! You probably won&#x27;t start seeing a major difference for at least 2 months. Lastisse will give you results quicker,but your lashes will be so unruly. The growth with Rapid Lash is gradual and the lashes are uniformed. When I used Latisse I actually had to tweeze SEVERAL lashes out,because of the unruly growth that occured. I did not have to do that with Rapid Lash. Be consistent with your daily applications and you will be batting those LONG eyelashes. Of course your lashes will return to their normal length if you don&#x27;t apply the product like three times a week to keep your length.</li>
            <li> Okay... so I found myself wanting to get fake individual eyelashes jumping on the band wagon of others which was a big mistake, especially since I already had long, full and beautiful eyelashes. Needless to say, the eyelashes pulled out my own during the removal process and left me barely with any eyelashes. So, I was desperate for a quick, fast and efficient solution to grow back my own lashes. I read the reviews as some said it worked and others did not, but I figured I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began by applying the eyelash serum every night before bed, and in the morning after I washed my face before applying any make up. I did not have any reaction to the serum at all. And within 1 month, I began to start having normal looking eyelashes by month 2 they were extremely long. They, are now full and longer than the length that they were originally!!! Although, I do not use the product as much now maybe a couple times a week. But I must say the results were very impressive and I will continue to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have said it did not work for them. But do not expect miracles, be realistic you should definitely see somewhat of a difference in your eyelashes from the before and after. The results will vary based upon the normal growth of your eyelashes and how you use the treatment. But it is worth the try especially for the price!!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, particularly for the price.  I had run out of serum and couldn&#x27;t find any for a semi-reasonable price.  The product I bought instead was awful. A waste of money.  This product is excellent.</li>
            <li> I bought this eyelash enhancing serum with a large bit of skepticism that it was a bunch of malarky and snake oil salesman hooey. But....I was amazed to discover that after about using this for 4 weeks on my eyelashes and eyebrows, it really works!! I am a believer now!  And I actually bought some more for a gift for a friend who complains about her short eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say I use this 75% of the time. I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 months and I&#x27;m using it in an area where I haven&#x27;t seen hair growth in maybe a decade. Perhaps I am beyond help, but even with my inconsistent application, I would expect ONE extra hair.</li>
            <li> Have been using ths since almost when it came out. I even threw my eyelash curler away! Great stuff that really works! Sometimes my eyelashes hit my glasses they are so long!</li>
            <li> Works of men too. after 2 months I started to notice a difference. I took before and after pics but no place to post them here. I use twice a day although it says once at night. I&#x27;m hooked. You will be too. Be patient and give it 8 weeks before you see a result.</li>
            <li> I did notice my lashes are a little longer and thicker after 3 weeks of using it.  It is cheaper than Latisse but less concentrated.</li>
            <li> I have used Latise in the past....quit using it due to the cost of product plus the Dr. Fee to get the prescription! I started using rapid lash, and had someone comment that I had beautiful lases! I saw results in only 2 weeks....I&#x27;m sold! I did use it during the day, when I did not wear make-up, (for the first 2 weeks), and I think maybe this gave me a jump start on results! I&#x27;m sold on this product, and do not take the time to review products, or give them 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> It really works.  My eyelashes are very long.  I would give it 5 stars  I love it  The price is right!</li>
            <li> I made the horrible decision to apply fake eyelashes and this serum saved me from emberrassement !. Once my fake eyelashes fell so did my real ones. I was desperate to make my eyelashes grow back and within two weeks of using this product my eyelashes were longer and thicker !.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do much, may have made my eyelashes a little longer, but not worth the uncomforted itching all the time.</li>
            <li> I have used this product now for years. It is everything that I expected and more. You must continue to use the product for continued results. I would highly recommend Rapidlash and have to many of my friends after they noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> Tried for two months and saw little to no change, except that my lashes seems to grow in all different directions.  When I stopped using this product my lashes started their natural curve again.  What a true waste of money.  I really wanted it to work too, because my lashes are short and don&#x27;t grow fast at all.  :(</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t have high expectations for growing my eyelashes back with this product but I was getting desperate. As I have gotten older my lashes were so thin and scraggly that I was considering having to wear false ones. Yikes! Almost immediately I noticed my lashes getting longer (really longer!) but that has sort of settled down and now my lashes are thick and lovely and back to where they used to be. I use it every night and I have ordered my second tube. This has been an absolute revelation and I am still shocked that it works so well.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this product. I love it. It has brought my lashes back to how they were at one time. Long and full again. I was hoping this product would also darken them. My lashes have always been very blond in color and now as I have gotten older they have turned white but with a little mascara and having used this product they look thick long and beautiful. Thank you.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IRRITATED MY EYES. i HAD TO STOP USING IT.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work,, i will actually spend the money and get something that works.</li>
            <li> I have found that this works for me. It doesn&#x27;t create stellar results of ridiculously long or luxuriously thick lashes, but fills in spaces where I had no growth at all. As long as I use it, my lashes stay on my lids and are fuller and a bit longer than without.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it works as well as the first one I bought.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to share my experience with everyone that I even posted my photo that I took today. I uploaded it as a customer&#x27;s photo right next to the photo of the product. Do you see photos taken in 2008 and 2010? That&#x27;s me. On both of them I have some makeup and mascara BUT as you see the 2nd one is da bomb. No fake eyelashes ever. No super-duper mascara can give such an effect. In fact, I don&#x27;t even have to use some advanced mascaras anymore. My eyelashes look great even without it. It makes me feel much more beautiful and confident now.    I want to thank all the people who left their reviews here as that&#x27;s how I found out about this serum and started using it. I bought RapidLash on Walgreens website for about $46 though. I thought Walgreens was more credible. I think Amazon is no worse. I&#x27;ll buy it here next time instead. Write me if you want to find out details about my wonderful experience (I didn&#x27;t have major side effects and look at the results!).     Extremely satisfied! :-) Very recommended!    In case you want to zoom in the photo, here it is [...]</li>
            <li> Ordered Rapidlash before and have been very satisfied with it.  Not as good as Latise, but it doesn&#x27;t cost a $100 either.</li>
            <li> For a while I used this product on one eye only. After 2 weeks I began to notice some changes. First, my &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; lashes began to look a little thicker. After 3 weeks they seemed a little longer. At the end of 4 weeks they were definitely longer, and as an extra bonus they now also curl up on their own, no eyelash curler needed! I have been using the same bottle for about six weeks and haven&#x27;t run out yet, so I don&#x27;t know how long the tube will last. I have reordered some for my daughter and for myself. Don&#x27;t want to run out of something that actually does what it says it does!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product less than a month and I kid you not, my lashes has grown so much. I just hope if I stop using it, I wont loose my lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to say this product didn&#x27;t work--it did. However, I was told there would be a great or dramatic difference, which there definitely IS NOT. My eyelashes grew some, and they looked pretty healthy. But it&#x27;s not worth 30 bucks. However, for 30 dollars it&#x27;s okay. If you want a real good product that&#x27;s gonna give you a difference in length or fullness is gonna be Latisse, which is PRETTY PRICY but worth it and is what I gave this product up for. It&#x27;s a hassle to apply this evvvery night and to not reap any big benefit. I wouldn&#x27;t really purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I am a very skeptical person, and this is the most amazing product I have ever bought! To start I applied to my lashes everyday and also put some on the sparse spots on my eyebrows. Within a few weeks the spots on my brows were COMPLETELY filled in and not long after that my eyebrows grew in thicker, darker, and longer. And they are perfectly curled upwards without doing anything. As a blonde I look naked without mascara on, but now I feel comfortable leaving the house without it (although I still put it on for work and outings of course). I cannot recommend this product any more than I do. I have turned on many friends who have had the same results! Can&#x27;t believe this stuff is not in EVERY women&#x27;s bathroom! It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product once at bedtime and when I wake up. I&#x27;m really enjoying the results. My lashes are definitely longer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of months now and I have seen an improvement in my lashes. I had extensions on and when my extensions fell off so did my own lashes!! I was furious and irritated. I started using this and it took a while for them to start growing. The package did say that too so I wasn&#x27;t worried. They are much longer now as fuller.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, friends are asking me if I had eyelash extensions. My lashes are growing thicker, darker &amp; curliest! Get it!!</li>
            <li> Within the first couple of weeks I could tell the difference in my lashes. They were fuller and longer. No irritation at all and frankly, I expected some because I have so many allergies to the preservatives in products. I tried it on my thinning eyebrows too and the hair seemed to fill in. So very happy with RapidLash. Even bought some for my sister who had been through chemo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second one. I started using it on my eyebrows which were half grown and i always had to shade in. Now they are fully grown still somewhat thin but still so much better. I was getting ready to get eyelash extensions prior to purchasing, now I just use this and my MAC Blacksplash and I have long beautiful lashes. If I don&#x27;t use it for a few days though some lashes do fall out. I love it though.</li>
            <li> I religiously applied this product each night for six weeks.  And lo and behold I now have pretty long lashes.  My daughter thought I was wearing false eyelashes.  It does itch when I first apply it but it goes away quickly. Love it!</li>
            <li> I noticed results right after the first week.  Have only been using it for three weeks now and have longer and fuller lashes!</li>
            <li> My lashes are visible again! At 50, that&#x27;s a miracle!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical...but this stuff definitely works! my lashes got longer and started to curl. I also use it on the bottom lashes as well.</li>
            <li> the best there is as far as im concerned. does what it says and only product to grow my completly bald lashes to the point that people think i wear falsies! only good for length though, not thickness,  and sometimes they grow in a lil wonky, but still extremely pleased. the price, however, limits how often i can buy it...if it were cheaper id buy it on pallets!  lol</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see very much result at all. So I go back to use my previous serum.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to invest this much in a product I wasn&#x27;t really sure of.  The reviews seem to be mostly good with a few negatives.  I gave it a try and, I have to say, after 5 weeks of nightly use I DO see a difference.  I took photos before for comparison and lashes are noticeably thicker and seem darker.  I&#x27;ve not had any issues with darkening of skin, burning sensation, etc.  Key is to apply the solution to the base of your lashes on the TOP lid only - where the lashes meet your skin - from outside of eye to inner corner.  I&#x27;m definitely seeing a difference when I apply mascara.  Lashes are starting to look like I have extensions.</li>
            <li> I did not see any significant difference to my lashes with this product.my friend uses the other serum that costs entirely too much but boy she has extremely long lashes now!</li>
            <li> The eyelash grows not as long as I imagine. It is a little expensive compared to my expectation. just this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month, twice a day on most days (esp the first 2 wks).. No signs of any effect on lashes or brows. Also worth noting that I got it in my eye a couple of times and didn&#x27;t have any burning. Also, I have blue eyes and they have not darkened at all, nor has my eyelids, nor my lashes or brows. The only effect (if I&#x27;m not imagining a placebo effect) is my lashes seem a little stronger, I don&#x27;t notice them coming out as much as I used to.  Other than this, a waste of money and big disappointment.</li>
            <li> This Does NOT work for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed after a month of using this. I have applied it every night before going to sleep,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really like it!! I put this then my eyelash has grow up for 2weeks!! It&#x27;s a strong, long!! I introduced my friends!! She like it too!!</li>
            <li> Using it for a few years. Definitively improve appearance of my lashes. Think, for the price ( even now it more expensive ) , it is very good</li>
            <li> This really works! Im an Asian American and we don&#x27;t have long full lashes. But after using this product, my lashes have gotten longer and thicker. After you achieve your desired length, you only need to use it 2 or 3 times a week. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I read almost all the reviews before making a decision to purchase it and I don&#x27;t regret buying it. I started noticing significant growth after a couple of weeks of constant use.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product when it first came out, I couldn&#x27;t beleive how long my lashes were.  It worked so well...when I finished that, I bought another one...My lashes thinned out a bit..seems that they may not be putting in the product that they were before making it less effective.  Why, when a company has a great product, do they always cheap out later and lesses the effective product...too bad cause it worked great before!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t review the results yet since I just received my first tube, however I wanted to offer some clarification for those concerned about receiving an expired product.  I found this posted by a company representative... &amp;#34;Every RapidLash is stamped with a manufacture date MFG, month and year on the bottom of every tube. An unopened RapdidLash has and expiration date three years from the MFG date. For example, if the bottom of the tube is stamped with 01/13, the product expiration date is 01/16.&amp;#34;  Hope this helps!  I&#x27;ll update later once I can review the product itself.</li>
            <li> This product really works for me.  The prescription serum is too high priced to use for cosmetic reasons but after 2 years of use I can tell you this is just about as good for far less.  I did stop for a couple months a noticed an immediate difference.  At 60 with thinning hair all over, its just the boost I needed.</li>
            <li> I have tried the most expensive and the least expensive.  Rapidlash is hands down the best!  I see results within one week.  Great product and affordable!</li>
            <li> When I first heard of Rapid Lash, I was a little skeptical that it would actually work, especially since other products such as Latisse required a doctor&#x27;s prescription and were much more expensive.  But after reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try.  I started using it at the end of May, and didn&#x27;t really notice any change for about 4 weeks.  Then all of a sudden - wow!  My lashes have gotten noticeably longer and lusher - when I curl them and add a little mascara, they look almost like false lashes.  I also used it on one of my eyebrows which has been very sparse for decades (over-plucked in high school) - and sure enough, the bare spots where nothing has grown for years are filling in.  I was not &amp;#34;religious&amp;#34; about using it every night - I missed quite a few days here and there. I will continue to use this product (buying when it&#x27;s on sale, of course.)</li>
            <li> This seems to really help with growing my eyelashes! I would definitely buy this product again! The only thing I don&#x27;y like is when it gets gown in to my eyes after it has been on for a short while.</li>
            <li> My whole life I&#x27;ve had short lashes.  I used all different kinds of mascaras, cheap to mega expensive.  I guess it&#x27;s my oily skin, because by midday the mascara would be smeared all over my upper lids and under my eyes.  Also, I hate the way mascara weighs down my lashes.  A friend of mine does Lavish Lash at her salon and it&#x27;s way too expensive for me.  Plus, I don&#x27;t like the idea of tying fake lashes to my existing ones. With my luck, my natural lashes would get pulled out.  So I got on Amazon and looked up one of the best-selling eyelash serums with great reviews.  If it didn&#x27;t work, it would be only a small investment and I&#x27;d move on.  I have to say Rapidlash will be part of my daily routine for as long as it&#x27;s in the market.  Totally transformed my eyelashes!  After a few weeks, I had steroid lashes!  I love this product.</li>
            <li> I was EXTREMELY skeptical about this product because I had used other products to make my eyelashes grow. Vitamin E and Vaseline worked ok, both kept my eyelashes moisturized and a gave me a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; both to my skin and lashes. But RAPIDLASH was INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!! After literally 2-3 1/2 maybe less I noticed my eyelashes at the end of my eyes were Long and curl-up then the middle then I kept putting more, twice a day, and I have really long and full lashes!!! I just couldn&#x27;t believe it!!!!!!!!! I never used fake lashes but used tons of Mascara but I no longer have to apply tons of mascara. Just one time and I look up and my lashes literally reach up to my eyebrows!!!!! Isn&#x27;t that amazing!!!!!!!! I am so happy!!! I will continue to use this product for as long as its in the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only bad thing I noticed was that my eyes get a little itchy at times.i have experience this about 5 times but its not an extreme itchy sensation just wanting to rob my eyes a little. Other than that, I would recommend it to all those girls who want to feel more pretty and love a new style with natural longer eyelashes! Give it a try and I really hope it works for you like it worked for me ;) Namaste</li>
            <li> I wish I would have listened to other reviews. I stayed using latisse a couple years ago, then switched to RevitaLash, which i loved. When I couldn&#x27;t find it on Amazon, i tried a new product, can&#x27;t remember name, but came in gold colored tube. Great stuff, worked just like others. Rapidlash was little cheaper, so thought I&#x27;d use it. Well, couple months later, my lashes have gone back to their normal length and thickness. Bummed!</li>
            <li> Works great - make sure you use it every night and you will notice your lashes are longer within one week.  You have to keep using it.  I use it on upper and lower lashes and also my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I can legit see a difference. It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of time and money.  Used it everyday for a month and saw no difference.  I&#x27;m amazed by all of the good reviews here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all and this one is the best</li>
            <li> I ordered this hoping to get my lashes to grow stronger and fuller.  I barely started using so I am hoping for great results.</li>
            <li> I also had the experience where it made my eyelashes sensitive and they fell out a little bit at first, but I continued and this product seems to have made my eyelashes stronger and less likely to fall out. They are also LONG, and I love my eyelashes like this. I just bought a second bottle.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product but saw amazing results after 1-2 months of nightly use. People were complimenting me on my long, beautiful lashes. It did not improve thickness though. However, after i stopped using it my lashes began to fall out! I am down to short stubs and am so upset.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t review items very often, but I felt compelled to do so this time. Initially, I liked this product very much. Within two weeks, I began noticing my lashes were getting longer. By two months, I was blown away. I had never had lashes this long in my life. I was so pleased that I ordered a bottle for my mom for Christmas. Then the trouble began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a week later, I got a small white bump on the upper lash line of my left eyelid. I didn&#x27;t think much of it, but a couple of days later a very painful stye developed on my right eyelid. At that point, I realized it might be the eyelash serum, and I immediately stopped using it. I called my mom and found out she had the same issue within the first week or so of use. I definitely feel this product is related to the problems we had. After I stopped using it, the stye went away, but to this day I still have the white bump and will be seeing a doctor for it next week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this product does what it says, but be wary of anything you put too close to your eyes, especially if it is not medically prescribed. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I have been using another brand and decided to try this.  To my delight it made my lashes look longer and healthier.  I have fine , thin, lashes, all my life, and this enhancing serum truly made a difference.  I am a senior citizen if that helps anyone over 60 to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I used to use Jan Marini, then it stopped working. This works so much better, and is much less expensive. I was afraid it might irritate my eyes, because I have very sensitive eyes, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems. My lashes are much longer and fuller, including the bottoms lashes. My top lashes actually curl up and touch the lids!&lt;br /&gt;I wrote to the company to ask a question about ingredients, and got a very quick, friendly response.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I saw my eyelash improvements, I&#x27;m definetly ordering this product again</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t compare with Latisse.</li>
            <li> Love it. Worked great for me after having fake eyelashes for over 2 years and noticed how it really ripped out some of my own.&lt;br /&gt;After only a week I have seen results and now after a month, I have wonderful long lashes. I am not sure if I can achieve thickness with the serum, but I will continue to take it a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> My scarce eyebrows got fuller in 3days, my eyelashes took about a month until I noticed results...great product!!! I highly recommend it...</li>
            <li> It really works,.. Be patient nd consistent with the application nd you will start to see the result</li>
            <li> This works - my lashes are huge!  Keep the product out of your eye, otherwise you&#x27;ll have stinging.  Works quickly!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference. No new growth, thickness, or extending length of current lashes. I will go back to using Amplifeye, although more expensive, it works good for me.</li>
            <li> Made my eyebrow grow back to where they were. The process is slow but the product does what is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Have tried others. This one really works. I  just have to be careful not to use too much or get in eye as it will irritate my eye the following day.&lt;br /&gt;Really improves length and thickness of eyelashes. Do not even have to use an eyelash curler anymore</li>
            <li> I used this item a few years ago, it did not bother my eyes then made my lashes thicker. Now they itch and burn and no results. Maybe they changed the product. I wont buy again.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me as my skin seems to be too sensitive. I had pulled out lashes in the middle of my eye and I was hoping that I could hurry the process of regrowth. I used it for two weeks even though I could see it irritating my eyes..... finally, my eyes swelled so much, I could not ignore it and had to stop using it. It has been two weeks since my last application and my eyes are still showing swelling, dryness and itching.... though they have improved much. Having experienced all of this.... very thin lashes have grown in. Was it the serum or natural.... who knows. Note.... I gave the serum to my sister and she is using it with no skin problems.... though she has not used it long enough to tell if it has helped her lashes to grow.</li>
            <li> I used this product every night before bedtime for approximately 6 weeks before I started seeing results. You really have to be patient with it. My lashes are longer now, and they hardly ever fall out. I think this product mainly keeps your lashes nourished and in better shape so you don&#x27;t lose so many. I now lose maybe 2-3 lashes a week, if that. As a result, I have more lashes and they look fuller. I don&#x27;t think this product actually makes my lashes thicker. The product lasted me a good 6 months when applied every night, so you get a lot for your money. I read in some reviews that it only lasted a few weeks, but I don&#x27;t think you have to put on too much for it to work. I only used it on my lashes though, not my brows.&lt;br /&gt;On a side note: the product has the production date stamped on it, not the expiration date. So people that believe they received an expired product actually didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Saw some improvement, but did not get results I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products since and been disappointed.  This product actually made a visible difference in my lashes and my eyebrows!</li>
            <li> So far so good I see a marked improvement. I am elated and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I lost some of my eyebrows years ago due to stage makeup allergy and aging (sad). I&#x27;ve used another product and was not happy with it at all. I gave up on the idea that they could possibly grow back. Years later and after some research I came across rapid lash. After using the product since July I&#x27;ve seen a significant change in hair growth. Unbelievable! It really does work!  It will take up to 8 weeks to really see results and I intend to use the product longer until I get the results I want. If anyone is unsure or skeptical of using this. Give it a try and have patience. It really did the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and it absolutely works! You have to be diligent in applying it and you must be careful to only apply it to the lash line. I had some eye irritation but nothing major, no discoloration as some have reported. BUT  and this is very important...YOUR NEW LASHES WILL FALL OUT IF YOU DISCONTINUE TO USE THE PRODUCT. No, you will not keep the wonderful, long, beautiful eyelashes once you stop using the product. That said, I enjoyed them while I had them. Also, I gave my eyelashes a two year break where I used no products on them at all, besides occasional mascara. Now I am ready to buy this product again and grow some lashes. I think it is important to give the body a break from chemically-based products (I stopped using underarm deodorant for 2 years and instead used the all-natural crystal stick and the toxins which had built up over the years completely disappeared along with the rashes and staining of my white clothing). But, it&#x27;s up to each individual to decide for themselves. This product does indeed work but without permanent results as I stated above. \\&quot;you can&#x27;t put in what God left out\\&quot; Peace to all.</li>
            <li> I had allergic rection to it. My lids would swell every time i use it.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Lashes longer and thicker in 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I tried it for 3 weeks and I found my eyelashes and more prone to breakage</li>
            <li> Works Great!  I have seen a difference in the quantity of my eyelashes!! And it&#x27;s a Great buy!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month and a half now and am very pleased with the results.  I&#x27;m Asian and have short eyelashes but this product has really made my eyelashes grow!  I used the product on my top and bottom lashes and definitely see a difference.  I will continue to use this product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Amazing results! It took a little time but then, bam! If I use mascara and a curler they look like false eyelashes. My eyelashes had started to fall out on one eye with bald spots and the other would break after wetting to a certain length. So worth it.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. I had bald spots in the center third of my eyelashes. After applying faithfully each night for a month, the areas have almost all grown back in.</li>
            <li> My friend introduced me to this Serum as a x-mas gift.  It really works for me! I used it religiously for a month and it lengthened my lashes, so when I apply mascara, it really shows. Now i can skip a day or two without applying the serum.</li>
            <li> I shopped around for eyelash enhancing products and realized that the ones that seem to be the most reccomended were also the most expensive. But I found Rapidlash at a website other than amazon and decided to try it. I paid about $50 after shipping and I am thoroughly pleased by the product. I have been using the same tube for 5 months now and I am pretty good with applying it everynight. I am amazed to see that it is so cheap on amazon because this product really works, honestly I would have continued paying $50 to get it! My sister who has always had longer lashes than me comments everytime I wear make up which is not very often. She swears my eyeleashes are longer than hers now. I was scared of putting anything on my eye because there is always the possibility of side effects but so far there are really none. My eyelids have darkened a very little but I don&#x27;t even wear make up everyday and I don&#x27;t think it is very noticeable. All in all I think Rapidlash is a great product for the money. LIke I said I am on my first tube and it has been 5 months, so spending about $20 for a product that will last that long is really close to nothing!</li>
            <li> This is a non-prescription product that WORKS!  Within 2 weeks I noticed that my lashes were growing--getting thicker and darker. It works on eyebrows, too. I use it every several days to maintain the length and darkness of my lashes and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> RapidLash is great! I chose it because of the price and that it does not have the side effects of other lash enhancers. Wow. When I put on mascara my eyelashes are gorgeous. Give it 4 to 6 weeks though. Very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> As the picture&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product&lt;br /&gt;Very fast shipping</li>
            <li> I guess it can&#x27;t hurt to condition your lashes, but I have seen no results.   Save your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rapidlash for amost 3 weeks now and love it!  A girlfriend has used Latisse and her lashes are amazing but I can&#x27;t afford that, so I looked into this one and thought it sounded great!  So in almost 3 weeks, I do see a difference and I haven&#x27;t had any of these side effects that some people talk about BUT I&#x27;m really scared of all these stories of lashes falling out 3, 6, 9 months down the road.  I really would rather live with short, blonde lashes than none at all, should I stop using?  Anyone used for a year or more that could weigh in?</li>
            <li> I have used lilash and had amazing results, I was hoping to find a cheaper alternative with Rapidlash. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t see any results with this product.  I guess in this case, you get what you pay for.  Shipping was super fast though...</li>
            <li> Rapidlash is making my lashes fuller and longer. I have been using it about 1 month now and plan to repurchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months now. I noticed results as early as week 2. I applied it every night on my top lashes, bottom lashes, and brows. During week 2 I noticed my top lashes were really long. Take note, this product does not multiply your lashes nor does it claim to do so. Read the entire information sheet for full detail (located inside box). This serum is to help boost your lashes with vitamins and strengthen your lashes. My lashes grew longer than usual but I did not get any more lashes than what I already have. My bottom lashes grew somewhat but nothing drastic. I would have to say the best result I had was with my brows. Due to 10+ years of over plucking my brows have frayed and grown in different directions. This serum helped strengthen and brought my brows back to life. I did not gain Brooke Shields brows, just better healthier brows. Anything is better than what I had before. My lashes have since fallen out so it will probably take 2-4 weeks to notice results again. For a product that is inexpensive I would recommend this to others. Be realistic, if you are seeking to obtain dramatic looking false lashes this product will not give you that kind of result. That&#x27;s what false lashes are for. I give this product 4 stars because I was pleasantly surprised this stuff works. To receive 5 stars in my book a product would have to be out of this world amazing. Which does not happen very often.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered Rapidlash. I use it on my upper eyelashes only. I bought it to replace Revitalash, which was no longer available. Rapidlash results are not as dramatic as Revitalash, but it does work, with time. I&#x27;ve not experienced any unpleasant side effects, and I use it every night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rapidlash for almost 15 weeks now.  Although it did finally work for me, it did not do it in the amount of time Rapidlash claimed it would on their box.  Most people saw results within 3-6 weeks.  I barely started to see some length after almost 8 weeks.  But they really did curl my lashes nicely.  If I use an eyelash curler now, they are almost too curly.  They in no way are so long that they look fake, even with mascara, and no one I know has noticed a difference without me pointing it out, and then maybe I get an, \\&quot;Oh yeeeeaaah!\\&quot; after they really have to look at my lashes...lol.  But when I do apply a primer and two coats of mascara, I can definitely see a difference in length, and only then a couple people I know have recently said, \\&quot;You&#x27;re eyelashes look longer today\\&quot;, but I&#x27;m not certain if it&#x27;s because they really think this or because I&#x27;m asking them every other day if they are.  :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish it had made them fuller/lusher, too, as others have claimed it&#x27;s done for them, but it hasn&#x27;t.  Maybe with more time.  I posted some before and after pictures on Rapidlashes Facebook site (don&#x27;t know how to do it here), even though the results are not as dramatic as others have had with their before and afters, but you can see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m very glad I purchased this product, even though it took twice as long to work for me.  I will continue to use it indefinitely as long as the results stay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for over a month now and i see a HUGE differance!It has made my lashes almost twice as long and about 1/3 thicker but not any darker (natural blonde my lashes are white). Now for the beware part DO NOT buy from directsupercenter!!! I got my package very late. Box came totally crushed I had wanted to give the first one I bought to a friend as a gift but being late and crushed I could not. Also i looked and the rapidlash it self had been opened and tampered with after being listed as new!</li>
            <li> Used Lilash with wonderful results from Oct-Dec 2010. Ran out and ordered Rapidlash at phenomenally low price.  Used for 1 month and have been wondering why Rapidlash was not working -- now I know! I read other 1-star reviews and found others reporting expired dates (@ bottom of tube). Received product Jan 2011, expiration date is Jul 2010. Glad I finally know (so I can go back to Lilash), and glad I only wasted $20. How frustrating. Too bad there&#x27;s no recourse.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick lashes naturally but have been experiencing some breakage from curling, so I stopped wearing all eye make up and ordered this, after a week i noticed gaps in my lashline. I read that this may happen initially so I continued usage, thinking maybe I was shedding lashes naturally, but by the end of the 2nd week I didn&#x27;t have many lashes left to spare!!! I have no allergies or condition that would cause this to happen. Very upset and disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was using Latisse but that is extremely costly.  I saw Kathy Lee Gifford advocate for Rapid Lash about 1 1/2 years ago and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  Great product but I find it a bit irritating to my lashes but no more than Latisse.  I use mainly on my eye brows and they&#x27;re much fuller than they used to be and Rapid Lash does not irritate my brow ;-)</li>
            <li> Not much to say. It does work, so; therefore I reordered 2 more. It took about 3 weeks for me to notice a change in the lenth of lashes and my brows filled in where I applied product. As you see I think it&#x27;s worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> I would love this product so much more if it didn&#x27;t make me completely miserable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product for two weeks and I noticed a very fast difference in my eyelashes. They were long, strong, and looked incredible. However, my eyes were always red and itchy. The skin around my eyes (eyelids &amp; under eyes) was even red and sensitive. I am a fair skinned, blonde gal and all that redness made me look ill / deranged. The discomfort was unbelievable, too. I kept hoping it would let up but it never did. After two weeks, I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may try it again using it very sparingly and every other night or two but honestly, I&#x27;m a little afraid. This stuff is intense even when you apply with a light hand. I&#x27;ve used Latisse and had the same effect. I think with my contacts and generally sensitive eyes, it may just not be the right product /method for me.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m optimistic.  I put it on faithfully every night on my upper lashes and any excess on the wand on my eyebrows.  No double dipping because I want it to last!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started on Feb. 15th so it&#x27;s only been 4 weeks.  I will give it 4 more then I will revisit the sitcheeashun!</li>
            <li> It has only been a week and I could already see the results. I will follow up in three to five weeks and let everyone know if my eyelashes grow longer as  suggested by the instructions. The shipment was also really fast.</li>
            <li> O.K., so I was pretty skeptical and did not see any results for the first 7 weeks.  I was actually going to stop using it until I noticed one really long eyelash on my lower lid.  It was so long that I thought that it was no longer attached to my lid and was simply caught in my other lashes, but I was wrong.  That one lash motivated me to continue using the product.  Now, my lashes are longer and thicker.  I have stopped curling my lashes before putting mascara on because they are long enough and curl on their own.  The bare spot with missing lashed has filled in and grown out.  I will definitely continue using this product and see just how fabulous my lashes can be.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks now. I have seen a big difference in my lash length and thickness. I got so tired of fake eyelashes. I had no swelling, darkening of the eye lids, or irritation from this product. I am just excited to see how my eyelashes will look after a month! For the first couple of days, I had some itching. But, here in New Jersey, it is allergy season. So, I really don&#x27;t know if it was the product. Not bad for the price.     Michelle   New Jersey</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t give up on this product! It took a whole month of using this every night before I started seeing results. But now, my eyelashes are longer and thicker. They are just right, not weird and spidery like what some other products out there will do. I bought this in August and I have used it religiously every night for 4 months and there is still more in the container. 3 ml lasts a long time. I have never had any irritation with it and have seriously sensitive eyes. Love it!</li>
            <li> I tried another cheaper lash growth mavala which seemed to barely make lashes look alittle stronger, but this one makes a bigger difference.  It won&#x27;t make it look like you have fake lashes on unless your lashes are naturally giant.  Mine are about average naturally, but this has made the thicker and longer.  I keep using to this to keep up results.  I think maybe using this in combination with the mavala one may work good.  I heard lilash one is the best, but it&#x27;s pricey.  My eyes don&#x27;t get darker and I didn&#x27;t have any side effects. I also made sure it doesn&#x27;t have prostaglandin or parabens which cause most side effect problems</li>
            <li> All I can say is that it really works.  It&#x27;s been 3 months, I was patient and it paid off.  Will continue to use it.  I actually had ordered 2 when I placed my original order (because of the positive feedback). So I just finished my first one ( making sure I get every drop) and then I will be starting on my next one.  I will continue to use this product and order more to have around for maintenance!  Thank</li>
            <li> Somewhat skeptical, but I have been plagued in my 50&#x27;s by lashes getting sparser and eyebrows becoming patchy. Within a week I saw my eyebrows starting to fill in beautifully. My eyelashes are not as dramatic, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks now. Since I was mostly concerned with my eyebrows, I am quite thrilled with the results. No problems with stinging or burning around my eyes or darkening of the skin. Since I HATE the drawn-on eyebrow look, I will quite happily continue to use Rapidlash.</li>
            <li> Like I stated in my title, it took about a month for me to start noticing results, I have straight short lashes. Now I have straight long lashes lol. They didn&#x27;t get much curl but they are longer. I bought the product for a second time and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product. I had sparse short eye lashes and I saw longer lashes in about 3weeks. The price is great compared to prescription Latisse which worked but was around $100 every month. Rapid lash works just as good I&#x27;d say. The only cons I can think of is my eyes feel dry in the morning when I wake up. Also, I noticed longer lashes but am still waiting for them to get thicker. I have been using it for about 3 months now.</li>
            <li> Works! Just don&#x27;t have time to apply everyday. I like for brows.</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of money for me.  It did absolutely nothing even though I used it as directed.  It was expensive.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering this again....everyone keeps commenting on my long lashes! Took about 6 weeks but they&#x27;re noticeably longer for sure!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those lucky ones! It works great for me! Wish it was a tad cheaper!!!</li>
            <li> It works!! My eyelashes r growing !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 2 months, but I&#x27;m already starting to see results! I was wary to try the product because of the potential side effects but I have experienced none of the negative side effects (brown discoloration of the eyelid and iris of the eye, pain, and falling out of eyelashes). My lashes are not particularly longer (that I can tell) but they are thicker and fuller and look wonderful with brown/black mascara (I have blonde lashes so it&#x27;s hard to tell anything with them). This product is worthwhile and you save a ton of money by purchasing on Amazon versus at a boutique. If you aren&#x27;t prone to side effects, this product will probably work great for you!</li>
            <li> love it.  The price is so much better through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Ive only been using for about 4 weeks.. I see no change in my lashes..at all..Im going to keep using for another month and see if it begins to work.</li>
            <li> Seen an improvement in just 2 weeks!  Fuller, longer lashes. love it!</li>
            <li> I first tried RapidLash last winter. In just two weeks I noticed my eyelashes were longer, and new lashes were growing out as well. It also improved the appearance of my eyebrows. But the actual thickness of the hairs didn&#x27;t improve as much as I&#x27;d hoped it would, and this stuff is still a bit pricey. But it does work pretty well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t waste your money. Latisse is much, much better.</li>
            <li> This really works! I can see my lashes growing daily!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give it five stars and here is why..,&lt;br /&gt;I noticed my lashes started to look a bit longer 3 weeks later but did not see any difference in volume. I am not sure if I&#x27;ll spend the money again for this result.</li>
            <li> I actually saw results after about six weeks but it was too tedious to do every morning and night so I stopped and a few weeks later I noticed the long eyelashes has gone</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for about a month now and I definitely see an improvement in my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m korean so my eyelashes are naturally not too long or full but this product, if applied day and night, certainly gave me length.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say my lashes became fuller though-</li>
            <li> It works! Love this product!</li>
            <li> This unfortunately didn&#x27;t work for me like I hoped it would. Length was my main goal. I was using latisse which worked wonderfully, but in effort to save money I decided to try switching over to this. After using this for a little over a month, my eyelashes went back to their pre-latisse length. One thing it did seem to do though, was maintain the thickness of my lashes, so it wasn&#x27;t all bad, but what I was really hoping for was length. I also used this on my eyebrows to encourage thickness but it yielded no results.</li>
            <li> Ill never buy it again! I saw no improvement! Just another crock to get people to buy more stuff that doesn&#x27;t work in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I just started using this product at the suggestion of my eyelash extension girl. I think it has extended the time for &#x27;fills&#x27; to my extensions, but I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know if it has helped my own lashes. It is easy to use, I actually use it twice per day not just at bedtime. You can&#x27;t even tell that you have it on your lids. Its light and the liquid dries fairly quickly. No irritation at all. I like it so far ... especially since it is less than a fourth of the price for Latisse.</li>
            <li> Excellent .. very .. Aashgah used my daughter ... I&#x27;ll buy it for myself..Excellent .. very .. Aashgah used my daughter ... I&#x27;ll buy it for myself</li>
            <li> fake lashes and lash glue have more problems than solutions so this serum is perfect--growth seen in first week and bottle lasts for months. lashes get so long I need to trim them!</li>
            <li> I bought this not too long ago for my eyebrows (not so much my lashes).  I can say that (I feel) it&#x27;s working.  I have seen (some) changes in my brows.  They look thicker.  Maybe the formula makes the strands thicker as well as making them grow on areas that didn&#x27;t have hair before.  My brows are sometimes itchy (not because I&#x27;m allergic) because of the growing hair.  I am still using it and hope to see greater changes ahead.</li>
            <li> It works for me. I love it. I wish I know this product before, so I can save my money.</li>
            <li> Have ben useing it for the weeks. I have not really seen a change so far. Hopefully by the time I use it all I will notice a difference</li>
            <li> I have seen no results with my lash growth using Rapidlash now for 8 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed as the reviews I had read about the product seemed promising.</li>
            <li> In 6 weeks, I have long lashes! I absolutely love it. I wonder tho if it will have some bad &amp;#34;side effects&amp;#34; in a long run.</li>
            <li> It works! My lashes had gotten rough and were falling out--this stuff conditioned them and helped them get back into growing. I&#x27;ve used this product before, and I love it. I always get it when my lashes are having a rough time.</li>
            <li> Used as directed. Doesn&#x27;t work. My lashes turned brittle and didn&#x27;t get longer. Now I use it for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I used this product exclusively on my eyebrows, which I am trying to thicken after too much plucking and generally getting older. I bought this after trying another product I bought on Amazon called Boom Boom Brow Job. That product worked very well, but had very little product in the tube so there wasn&#x27;t much bang for the buck so to speak. This product has a lot more quantity, but the quality seems to be lacking. I have been using it regularly and unlike the other product, I don&#x27;t seem to be noticing any difference. I haven&#x27;t lost the progress I gained from the first product, so perhaps it is maintaining the level of growth I got, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in fullness/darkness of my brows, which is what I&#x27;m after.</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> I was using another lash serum that worked really well but was more expensive, so I thought I would switch after I read the reviews. Sadly, this gave me no results whatsoever, and it made my eyelids itch like crazy. I&#x27;m going back to the other serum.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I have plenty of baby lashes growing. I&#x27;m on my second tube !!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product faithfully for almost 8 weeks and I have not seen a change in my lashes. Waste of my money :(</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;5-Star Rating – Excellent to do business with! Will buy from again! I&#x27;m a happy customer! ;) &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I really like Raptidlash serum. While I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to since it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve used, I do see results.  Don&#x27;t expect to see completely changed lashes in 2 weeks because you are actually growing lashes! I find after 3-4 weeks of consistent, daily use my lashes are noticeable longer (not all of them at the same time) and are more voluminous.  I believe the serum promotes growth and longer life of your existing lashes. This is not a use once type of product - you&#x27;ll need to keep using it otherwise your lashes will go back to what they were before you started.  Considering the costs of other products on the market, Rapidlash is affordable.  You can find a 2-pack for less at your neighborhood big-box store (C) if you are a member.</li>
            <li> I bought thie same item from Costco before and I really love it so I decided to buy another one from Amazon. Don&#x27;t waste your money. The item looks legit but when you open it, there hardly any liquid inside. I should have known and stick with the item from Costco for the same price, at least you can return it to costco. Never again.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product for two and half weeks. Lashes do grow. They look thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in as little as two weeks! It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I began using this product this past August. I had been using Latisse for approximately 4 months prior. Yes, Latiisse did work,  made my eyelashes darker and longer, but good lord, I just could not, with a clear conscience , keep paying the $125 a month upkeep it required. So I began researching and came across this product. I read all the pro and cons on the customer reviews, and I just went for it .As with Latisse, I didn&#x27;t see the results until around, oh, I say, the 6th week. BUT IT DID WORK. It made my eyelashes longer, (no, not quite as long as Latisse), made them stronger, and more resistant to breakage. Did not make them quite as dark I noticed, but I&#x27;m still quite satisfied with this product  and will keep using it. I can forgo mascara all together and just use a eyelash curler and my eyelashes are pretty long. For around 30 bucks a tube, (that last 2 months for me, mind you...) I am saving quite a lot. This is definitely a keeper.The only reason why I am not giving this a 5 is because the seller sent me a expired tube .</li>
            <li> I have tried this and several other Lash Growth products.  This might have given some thickness to my lashes, not enough to be recognizable.  It did not itch or give me any other side effects. I is by not stretch of the imagination near the lengthening and thickening effects I got while using Latisse.  I didn&#x27;t get the results I would want to see to recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of the lash enhancing products and this is my favorite.  It works with no harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> I saw results within the end of the first week of using it.  My eyes lids became dark from using it,  but my eye lashes are lengthy.  I have 2 more weeks to see the ending results. I hope they become longer.  It is a great product to buy.</li>
            <li> I feel one gets results, but the application always feels wanting. I think its about empty when it shouldn&#x27;t be--mainly because of a very thin brush and not much liquid adhering to it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to use this and had hoped for great results. But after 2 uses, my eyes feel like I have gotten something in them. They are irritated, red and scratchy.  I also tried hard to just keep it on the last line.  Unfortunately, this product is not returnable.  But I will say that if you aren&#x27;t allergic to it, it appears to work for many people.  I read from another person&#x27;s review that castor oil works great at stimulating eye lash and brow growth. But it must be cold pressed castor oil. I am going to look for a more natural route for eye lash growth that will not irritate my eyes. I guess there is a reason I have used Clinique all these years!</li>
            <li> Trucking no. Not working</li>
            <li> Okay product.  I did notice a slight difference--not dramatic</li>
            <li> I am following the instructions to a tee.  Haven&#x27;t seen any change at all. But I have only used it about 3 weeks. Call me crazy but I still have hope.</li>
            <li> It came very quick, I started using it immediately, and started seeing results within 4 days.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any changes with my eyelashes. Ive been using this for 2 wks now. Not worth the purchase</li>
            <li> I am a heavy-duty mascara user, so I was looking for something to condition my lashes and help them to grow. I had been using the L&#x27;Oreal lash boosting serum, which helped condition my lashes, but did not help with growth. I decided to try Rapidlash because the reviews on Amazon raved about how amazing Rapidlash was. My natural lashes are medium-thick and straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The short version: I would not spend the money and purchase this product again. I didn&#x27;t hate it, but I didn&#x27;t love it either. Read below for my reasons why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long version: I feel like I gave this product a fair try. I know some products only start working at the beginning of a new lash cycle (for ex: Latisse), which is why it can take up to 4 weeks to even begin seeing some results. So I gave Rapidlash 4 weeks before I made any judgments. After using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s lash serum, my lashes were thick, but with no additional length. I was hoping that Rapidlash would be the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; lash thickener and growth product that was at a reasonable price (compared to Latisse). I stopped using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s lash serum when I was testing out Rapidlash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say, the first week and a half I wanted to cry and give up on Rapidlash because my lashes started thinning (I could literally feel the loss of the conditioning from stopping L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s lash serum) and falling out. (When I was using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s lash serum, I hardly had any lashes falling out--like MAYBE 1 or 2 in two weeks). To reiterate, I am a mascara QUEEN. But I persisted with Rapidlash. I thought that maybe I was applying too little of the product (Rapidlash comes with an eyeliner brush-like wand in the tube, and you apply the product like you would eyeliner), so I tried applying the product more liberally. I noticed no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At about the second week and a half mark, I did notice the TEENIEST bit of growth in my lashes, but also that my lashes were still VERY thin. I still had lashes falling out and easilyprone to breakage. I honestly could not tell if that was just the natural growth of my lashes. Note that I had also been continuing to apply Rapidlash LIBERALLY (which made application a bigger pain in the derriere because the teeny tiny wand only picks up so much product to begin with).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At four weeks, no lash growth, still thin lashes, and SERIOUSLY sparse lashes from all the breakage and falling out. At this point I gave up with just using Rapidlash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still had a good amount of Rapidlash product left, and I couldn&#x27;t bear to waste it, so I decided to use Rapidlash in conjunction with L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s lash serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS WHY I GIVE RAPIDLASH 3 STARS INSTEAD OF 1: Rapidlash and L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s lash serum work REALLY well TOGETHER. When I use Rapidlash and L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s lash serum together, I noticed thicker lashes, no breakage, no falling out, and LENGTH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is, for the price I paid for Rapidlash and the expectations I had for it (based on the reviews), I do not find it a worthy product. I would rather stick with using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s lash serum and have conditioned, albeit normal-length lashes, than spend the money on BOTH Rapidlash and L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s lash serum, which is what I would need to do in order for Rapidlash to be effective on me at all. Also, by doubling up on the products, it&#x27;s so much more high maintenance, which is also annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have money to throw around casually like it grows on trees or something, then I might buy Rapidlash again and give it another go. But again, I absolutely WOULD NOT risk using Rapidlash alone. I&#x27;ve suffered enough the first 4 weeks with my initial experience with Rapidlash (if it&#x27;s not clear, I&#x27;m being dramatic--can&#x27;t help my sarcasm sometimes).</li>
            <li> Originally I used Revitalash for about 6 months  and my lashes grew like crazy.  New lashes came in like weeds&lt;br /&gt;and I was amazed.  Unfortunately Reviatlash changed their formula and it no longer had the same results.&lt;br /&gt;Rapidlash seems to  maintain the lashes I have but I don&#x27;t see them getting any thicker.  I have only used Rapidlash for about&lt;br /&gt;3 months.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are crazy..My mom asked me why I had false eyelashes on??? so much fun!!!!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t irritate, but my lashes absolutely grew NO longer.</li>
            <li> My aunt bought me this as a birthday present like 3 months ago.I love this product my eyelashes are thicker and darker and I always had thin brown/blonde eyelashes.I didn&#x27;t get rapid results it took me a lot of patience,I use to be like this is fake y would she even buy me this.But either way I tried it out.Shipping did come early too.I like the texture it&#x27;s a liquid form but it&#x27;s not all slippery it has grip so it won&#x27;t go in your eyes.It has barely no odor which is awesome so it dosent sting my eyes.I love this product will buy it myself next time If I need thicker eyelashes. :)</li>
            <li> It irritate my eyes like i have eye disease&lt;br /&gt;i have red eyes after the day i use it&lt;br /&gt;wasting money</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year, and I have to say that it works wonderfully for me.  After years of over plucking my brows and my lashes just getting thinner with age (I&#x27;m a young 54) I wanted to try a product like this but really didn&#x27;t want to commit to a very pricey one or one that I had to get a prescription for.  I did some research and found that RapidLash is the one for me.  I didn&#x27;t experience any iritation of the skin anywhere that I used it (upper and lower lashes and brows), as I have read that some have.  The price is one that I can live with especially since I&#x27;m at the point where I don&#x27;t have to use it every night to get the results that I want.  People tell me all the time what beautiful long lashes I have and I&#x27;m quick to pass along the secret.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using now for over 8 weeks and have seen absolutely no difference.  I still have some left in the tube, so I will continue to use until the tube is completely empty.  I hope by then I will see some results.</li>
            <li> This product has worked great w/ no side effects. I&#x27;ve had people comment on my lashes after using for only 1 mth. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as much length as it is the volume of my eyelashes that I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in. I will continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> With age, my lashes have thinned and seem to fall out more easily.  This product has put a stop to the loss and I now have longer lashes.  However, I was hoping the product would also help produce thinker lashes.  I&#x27;ve seen no sign of that after six months.   However, given the improvements, I plan to stick with Rapidlash.</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle Int.Research Labs Rapidlash months ago. I used it  on my eyelids every evening and sometimes  in the morning. I did not have any effects for about  six weeks and was already close to toss it out.   But all by sudden, after about 7 or 8 weeks of use, I noticed a hugh difference in my lashes. Now, I do remorse, I did not took a before pic. Well, my thought was: If I need a before pic to see a difference it&#x27;s not worth it. Well, I do not need a pic to see a difference, I have  much more and much longer lashes than ever before in my life. I am still on my first bottle (3 ml), and I do use it almost every evening. I am going to reorder this serum from this seller, since I could not be happier with a beauty product. It is a fantastic feel to know that I have the longest lashes in my family now.    ADDITION TO MY REVIEW MArch 2011:  I just ordered my 10th bottle. After I  gave my mother this to try she called today, super excited, her lashes showed growing all by sudden after using it  for almost 8 weeks. She was  really happy. None of us do have any side effects. And our lashes , both upper and lower, look better than ever before. We never has  really full or long lashes - but we have now! I orderes a bucnch of bottles now , since I am intending to give them a couple of good friends.</li>
            <li> Takes about 3 weeks for your lashes to start to darken and get fuller.  My daughter noticed right away after I hadn&#x27;t seen her for a month, with no mascara on!  She&#x27;s in the fashion industry in NYC.  Just have to keep applying nightly.</li>
            <li> I have only used the product for four weeks now and im really happy with the results.Every night im using the serum with excitement ,cause every morning i see that my lashes look longer and fuller.The effect is more noticeble with my make up on and now my morninig routine gives me so much pleasure,also during the day im so confident with my apperiance,cause my lashes look great.I totally will be using this product,and the fact that is soo affordable is an extra bonus,i love it.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase so I know that it works, that is, unless it has \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; the product because the price has dropped dramatically. It seems that everytime a product is new and improved, it is totally ruined and never works the same again. (my opinion only)</li>
            <li> I have just recieved my product and before using it I looked on the bottom to make sure of the \\&quot;expiration date\\&quot;, since I&#x27;ve seen so many complaints about the product.  It said 10/10.  Oh no... I thought.  But I decided to call Rapid Lash 1st before yelling at the seller.  Here&#x27;s how it works: the Date on the Bottom of your tube is the Manufacturing Date NOT the Expiration Date.  Unopened product is good for 3 years from this date.  Once you have opened the product - it is only good for a year.  Hope this clears things up. :) Now I&#x27;ve got to get to growing lashes! lol</li>
            <li> I used this product on my eyebrows to the last drop, which lasted about six weeks. It didn&#x27;t work whatsoever for my eyebrows, I was really hoping it would work since I saw all the great reviews for it. I think I will just try a different brand of serum instead.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product about 5 weeks ago and I have not seen any results yet. I had fallen asleep a couple of time with makeup on and rubbed my eyes and my eyelashes started falling off. I thought I would give this product a try since it was getting good reviews. I am not happy with this product, I seem to be losing more eyelashes than gaining any new ones. I am going to stop using this product this was a big waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Works great, lashes will have a two week period or so every few months where they thin a little, but for the price and safety, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> My lashes were short, sparse and brittle. In other words no matter how much I curled and layered on the mascara, my eyelashes were hard to see. I picked up a tube of Rapidlash from another retailer and decided to try it. Am I ever glad I did! My lashes have thickened and grown out considerably. On days that I don&#x27;t wear mascara, I can just curl my lashes and go. After one tube of this miracle in a tube, one coat of mascara makes my eyes pop! This time I ordered 2 tubes so I would never run out! Love, love LOVE this stuff! Try it, you will be amazed how great you will look with long, thick lashes. This stuff works.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many months, and can&#x27;t be happier with the results!!  I used more expensive products in the past, and this out does them all!!</li>
            <li> I was actually really surprised by this product.  Nothing ever seems to work for anything! That sounds so negative...but it feels that way sometimes.  I noticed a major difference in my eyelashes within 2 weeks. They are thicker, darker and longer.  I am extremely impressed and will continue to use this product for a long time.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 48 and naturally have dark eyelashes that are fairly short and straight.  My brows are dark, nicely shaped, and the hairs are dense yet very well-behaved.  However, age has started to erase the portion of my brows that lie to the outside of the arch.  I started using Rapidlash about 7 months ago.  I&#x27;ve never had irritation problems with this product.  My lashes quickly showed about 3mm length extension and that appears to be about it for them, but my brows are still showing signs of continued improvement, and I think I may get to a point some day where the ends are back to like they were in the old days.  I have tried one other lash growth product, Jan Marini&#x27;s Age Intervention Lash, 2nd generation formula.  That may have made my lashes longer still, but it also irritated my eyes and darkened the skin on my eyelids a bit (not permanent).  And it was very dear - I got it online for about $120 but retail was far worse at the time.  I much prefer the Rapidlash.</li>
            <li> I have used Rapidlash for one month and just ordered more. I can see the new hairs in my brows, they are coming in a little darker. My eyelashes are longer and seem a little thicker. No bad side effects at all. So far so good!</li>
            <li> I have used Rapidlash for 9 months now and am very pleased with my results.  My lashes were thin, short and I even had bare spots.  After about 3 weeks of using the product as directed each night, I saw longer, stronger and thicker lashes, NO BARE SPOTS!  With continued use my lashes seem to stay looking good.  There was some slight itching at first but that seemed to subside.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Bimat and within a couple of weeks my lashes get so long that they hit my upper eye lids. I really wanted this to work but so far there is no noticeable difference.  I&#x27;m still hopeful though!</li>
            <li> Noticed a definite positive difference in my eyebrows, not sure on the lashes yet but I will keep using this product.</li>
            <li> It works! I was pleasantly surprised to find something that really helped my skimpy lashes. My lashes are definitely longer and darker :)</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s all relative but I started with LiLash product and got fantastic results. I saw Rapidlash price point and good reviews and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Maybe if I hadn&#x27;t used anything else before I would have seen &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; results but compared to the results Lilash gave me? Nope, I&#x27;m going back to Lilash, which isn&#x27;t that much more if you buy it on Ebay.</li>
            <li> I learned about this product when I was going to start Chemotherapy. After 6 rounds of chemo I started to lose some of my eyelashes.  I used the Rapidlash every night and with in a month or two my lashes are longer then before the chemo.  I&#x27;ve decided to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I had used Smart Lash in the past and decided to try this one instead when I ran out.  MISTAKE!  I&#x27;ve used this for well over 6 weeks with little IF ANY difference!  Don&#x27;t waste your money!&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  You can&#x27;t get a refund either on this... wonder why...???!!!  &amp;#62;:o(  Maybe they would ALL come back?</li>
            <li> I love this product , I can see the diference in my eyebrowns</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are now as long as they were when I was younger. It look a couple of months and I also started wearing the Grand Lash Mascara that was recommended and I can&#x27;t believe the difference. I was very skeptical but it works and I am so ecstatic.</li>
            <li> I cannot rate this product yet, because I have only used it for about three weeks.  Hopefully, I will see results by the time I&#x27;m finished with the first tube, at which time I will be able to give it a rating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this (albeit inconsistently) for about 4 weeks now and I THINK I see a difference, but then again, I&#x27;m not sure.  My eyelashes don&#x27;t seem any thicker or longer without mascara, but there does seem to be a subtle difference WITH mascara. I will keep using it and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, the first week I used it, I did have some slight itching and irritation along my eye lids, but that did go away.</li>
            <li> You lashes will be so full and so long that you won&#x27;t believe it!&lt;br /&gt;I get tons of compliments every day. Great product!</li>
            <li> I read reviews on it wasn&#x27;t sure if they were real or not, but thought I would at least try the product once.  It actually helps strengthen your eyelashes to grow all the way out.  Use it everyday and I have long eyelashes now.  Stopped using it for a little bit and my eyelashes got brittle again and broke off.  Started using this product again and after a couple of weeks they were back to the long length they were when I stopped using this product.  I haven&#x27;t used other eyelash enhancing serums, but I know this one works!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 3 weeks since I started using Rapid Lash and I already notice a visible difference on my eyelashes and eyebrows. Eyelashes look darker.  I also noticed what seems to be new lashes growing in a bald spot on my bottom lash line.  Easy to use, just apply before going to bed at night.</li>
            <li> Really works. It took about two weeks of daily usage (for the lashes themselves to grow out), but once they started growing my lashes looked great. This isn&#x27;t a miracle worker, so you&#x27;re not going to have 2 inch lashes, but it&#x27;s great for filling in lashes. From wearing daily mascara, my lashes were damaged and had missing spots. Friends asked me what mascara I was using because my lashes looked that much better. Will definitely keep buying!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:ee524b6dfa1344f908c384afade8025]]</li>
            <li> Have started to notice growth after 3+ weeks! Worth it!</li>
            <li> Very allergic!!! my eyes were very swollen from first application</li>
            <li> Want to return. Dermatologist said stick with the real stuff-Latisse</li>
            <li> Love it! Been using it every night and can&#x27;t believe how long my lashes are getting. I&#x27;ve used it to help my eyebrows fill in too.</li>
            <li> This is a product I use on a regular basis and I can vouch for the fact that my lashes are noticeably longer.  That&#x27;s why I continue to reorder it.</li>
            <li> this helped my eyebrow hair grow a bit longer, no new growth and t no extra growth or length on my lashes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see big difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days but it has made my eyes completely bloodshot. Long lashes don&#x27;t matter if all anyone notices is how red my eyes are.</li>
            <li> I was using Latisse until a few months ago and when I saw my lashes thinning and losing length I started to use Rapid Lash instead. It&#x27;s been about a month and my lashes are almost as full and long as they were with Latisse. I&#x27;m betting that within another month they will be. I love this product and it&#x27; ssaving me money!</li>
            <li> I was asked by some cosmetologists if I had false eyelashes!  So, I guess it works pretty good!!</li>
            <li> This product starts to work from the first time you use it.  If I discontinue it, my lashes revert  to the way they were before.  So I continue to order it over and over.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do much.  I think plain old Vaseline might do more.</li>
            <li> This made my eyelids swell, and I&#x27;m pretty sure at least a quarter of my existing eyelashes fell out.  I had to get medical treatment for my allergic reaction to this.  I have a friend who uses it and had just a little bit of redness, but if you have sensitive eyes or skin, I would not use this product.</li>
            <li> Going back to Osmotics, as I noticed a difference with that. I did not see a difference with this product.</li>
            <li> My mom had given me a half bottle of Lilash to try and I thought eyelash serums were snake oil but it actually worked.  My lashes were twice as long.  When my long lashes eventually fell out and the Lilash expired I looked for a replacement (apparently it&#x27;s not sold in the US anymore).  Rapidlash seemed like it a cheaper alternative at half the price of the Lilash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;- it did make my lashes about 30% longer w/ nightly use for almost a month, not as long as the Lilash but still noticeable&lt;br /&gt;- bottom lashes grew very well&lt;br /&gt;- no darkening around the eyes, itchy/dry eyes and sensitive eyelids like side effects the Lilash caused&lt;br /&gt;- lashes did seem stronger and less prone to falling out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;- this is a major one - growth of fine hair on upper cheeks right below eyes.  Since this product is supposed to make hair grow, it will do so wherever it goes.  I&#x27;m assuming some of the serum will spread beyond the eye lids when I rub my eyes while sleeping.  The same hair growth also happened with the Lilash and eventually went away with discontinued use.&lt;br /&gt;- it did not make my eyelashes thicker, only longer</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about two months, and will say that I have gotten pretty impressive results. With nightly use, my lashes have absolutely grown much longer and they also are thicker and feel stronger. When I run my finger over them without mascara, they feel thick and waxy - much less likely to fall out than before. With mascara, they nearly touch my eyebrows. BUT - this product also makes NEW lashes grow where there were none before. I realize that this may sound great, but in my case, new baby lashes are growing under my normal ones, straight down into my eye! It is very challenging to get these new lashes into my eyelash curler, but if I get the curler extremely close to where it is actually pinching my lash line, I can get them up. Otherwise these lashes point straight down and look bizarre. I am not really sure what to do about this. I like the product, so maybe these new lashes will just grow long enough eventually to blend in with the ones I already have. I have actually resorted to cutting them off because they were pointing down so dramatically. I don&#x27;t know if this is a common issue or not. I will continue using the serum, and see what happens!</li>
            <li> You have to give this a couple of weeks but it works great!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have not noticed one bit of difference after using this product for over a month.  It might as well be water that I&#x27;m applying.  I used to use Latisse, and got nice results, but Latisse irritates my eyes and I look blood shot with red veins running through my eyes, so I won&#x27;t use it anymore.  Too bad this product doesn&#x27;t work on me, I&#x27;m looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> I was so anxious to start using this product due to so many positive reviews.  After a week of nightly applications, I started breaking out terribly from this product.  It caused a terrible itch all around my eyes top and bottom, swollen and red like a bad sun burn.  It took 5 days after I stopped using this for my eyes to get back to normal.  I went back into my order and seek a refund, the option for refund was not available for this product.  I wrote to Amazon direct to let them know this is a unfair practice.  To my surprise Amazon responded right away, within the same day, issued a credit back to my account.  I wish this would of work for me like the rest of the possitive reviewers out there.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for 3 weeks but haven&#x27;t seen any change so far. Most customers say it takes 4 weeks to see results so the jury&#x27;s still out.</li>
            <li> I recently started to lose a lot of hair (head, eyelashes, eyebrows) due to stress and environment. It got so bad I considered buying false eyelashes. I found this item &amp; decided to give it a try. At first I didn&#x27;t notice much but after a few weeks after washing my face I kept thinking I hadn&#x27;t fully removed my mascara. I kept scrubbing and even used eye make-up remover before I realized these were just my natural eyelashes! I was amazed!!! So much so that I ordered some for my daughter too. This really worked for me. I&#x27;m soo happy I found it.</li>
            <li> I had been getting my lashes done for years until I had to stop because I was spending too much money.  I have been using rapidlash for over 2 months now and I am so glad I spent the money on it.  My lashes look AMAZING!!  They are longer and fuller.  They didnt make my lashes thicker but it makes up in fullness.  One coat of mascara is all I need.  It totally works and its MUCH MUCH cheaper then getting lashes done and filled every 2-3 weeks.  Definetly a buy!</li>
            <li> Caused swelling and itching of eye lids.  I don&#x27;t know if this is a common reaction, but it&#x27;s been 4 days since I used it and my eyes are still swollen.</li>
            <li> I wish I had never tried this stuff. After using it for three days, I have intensely dry and irritated eyes. I just read someone&#x27;s blog saying they developed the same problem and it turned out to be permanent dry eye! I will never use this again and I caution all of you to protect your eyes and stay away from it.</li>
            <li> I did not see any enhancement in my eyebrow.</li>
            <li> I saw results in just two weeks. Amazing.</li>
            <li> This works super well! Whenever i use it for a while i get tons of compliments on my lashes, I even had several people ask me if were fake. There arent many beauty products that actually do what they advertise, this one does! It does take a couple weeks to see a difference but one tube lasted 4-6 months. Can&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
            <li> Absolutely makes the lashes noticeably longer!! I noticed after 2 weeks using it every night, but it was really obvious after 3 weeks. They didn&#x27;t get fuller, but because they are so long, with mascara they do look thicker. I just ordered for a friend who asked.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but decided to try it anyway.  Boy, am I glad I did.  My lashes are noticeably longer and my thinning eyebrows are filling back in, despite the fact that I am &amp;#34;a woman of a certain age.&amp;#34; I learned from Beautypedia.com that this contains some of the same ingredients as Lashtique, the expensive prescription product. This is a great product doing essentially the same thing, without the high price and the doctor&#x27;s visit.</li>
            <li> Ladies, it takes a few weeks, but it works!  I had lost most of my lashes after a bad extension experience. I came across this product and gave it a try.  Now my lashes are long and full.  If I&#x27;d had lashes like this, I never would have tried extensions.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I noticed a slight difference after about a month but then I started using it morning and night and my lashes quickly became longer, fuller and curlier. I still wear mascara, but now my lashes are very noticeable and I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> Takes a couple of months, but works great.</li>
            <li> Used this for months but saw no results. It anything, lost more lashes.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product! My lashes are longer and thicker after 3 weeks of use! Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I did not see any difference. As much as I would really like to, it just did not do a thing</li>
            <li> The active ingredients was taken out  when latisse took them to court. went to  Paul&#x27;s choise who did a review on all eye lash growing products directed me to all day chemist to order Careprost  with a brush. (Bimatoprost ophthalmic solution.) No doctor appt or  perceptions needed. This works! Showed it to my eye doctor who confirmed this is the same as product used for high pressure in eyes that side effect is thick long lashes.do not put the drops in your eye! Use a fine eye liner brush along the base of your lashes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different brands of eyelash growth products over the last several years, including Latise.  They all work well, but some are easier to apply than others and some just work better.  If I had to choose a favorite, this would be it.  The price is reasonable (it&#x27;s an awesome product), it&#x27;s easy to apply at the lash line and within the first week I noticed my lashes were looking healthier.  After four weeks my eyelashes looked long and beautiful!  Women and men ask me regularly if I&#x27;m wearing false lashes.  In fact, a lot of days I do not wear any mascara which makes my mornings a whole lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of months ago, I over groomed my eyebrows. It was not a pretty sight. The tip of the applicator is a small thin brush and was very easy to get to the &amp;#34;bald&amp;#34; areas of my brows. A couple of weeks later, my brows were back to normal~ phew!</li>
            <li> If it were possible to rate less than one star that&#x27;s what this would get. Made my lashes FALL OUT AND BREAK OFF!😡 you certainly get what you pay for with this crap</li>
            <li> A waste of money.  Did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Native American and I have very sparse brows to start with and not dark. Then I became sick, and with meds I lost most of the brows I had. I would color them in but still was not happy. I started looking on the internet and came across this product. I read the reviews and said what the hell, I have nothing to loose. I have now been using it for 2 months and I have brows, they feel thicker and I have small stubble that will grow into longer hair they even appear to be even darker in color. Now I know I won&#x27;t have model type of eyebrows, but they look better than the ones I had before I became sick. I will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I have purchased twice the Rapidlash Eyelash and Eyebrow Enhancing Serum. I use it for my eyebrows only. I have not seen any improvement at all. I use it daily for over 3-4 months.  I am very disappointed in this product and I would never purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. I can see a difference on her eyelash already. If she loves it. Its a 5 Star for me.</li>
            <li> I have used multiple eyelash enhancement products including the prescription Latisse at $120 a shot for a month&#x27;s supply.  I was skeptical when I tried this product because I have tried other over-the-counter products and it did nothing for my lashes.  This product absolutely AMAZED me!  I am shocked at how fast my lashes grew and how full they are in just 1 month!  I noticed after a couple of weeks that I was no longer losing lashes.  I have to admit that I am using the product twice-a-day and the directions say to use it &amp;#34;daily at bedtime&amp;#34;.  Don&#x27;t care-I am going to keep on using it twice-a-day!  People have asked me if I have fake eyelashes added into my eyelashes because they are so long and full now.  What a difference.  This product worked better than the prescription Latisse which gave me &amp;#34;clumpy&amp;#34; uneven growth.  With this product, I have full, long lashes that are roughly equal in size and they are full.  AND I don&#x27;t need to worry about my green eyes turning brown as a side effect!!  Best eyelash enhancement product I have ever tired-and I have tried many!!!!</li>
            <li> No, Rapidlash did NOT work for me. My eyelashes do not show any discernible change after 2 weeks of application. Only 2 weeks because the solution dried up after the second week.I have not used any other product like it.</li>
            <li> I had gotten in the habit of sleeping with my makeup on. Well, after months of that my eyelashes started falling out/breaking off(?) Whatever it was, it looked awful. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on the prescription brand so I thought I&#x27;d try this, I&#x27;m not disappointed. I&#x27;ve been using it for about five weeks now and my lashes are longer and fuller. If you&#x27;re concerned about it changing the color of your eyes, it didn&#x27;t change mine.</li>
            <li> I keep using it for almost half a month and I can really see my eyelash growing significantly. Strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> This worked for me!  Lashes grew noticeably longer.  I had an area on my lower lashes that had 2 hairs.  After 8 weeks it completely filled in.</li>
            <li> This gets 5 stars from me. It&#x27;s working well so far.</li>
            <li> My lashes have never looked as great as they are now. I have been using this stuff every night for years though, you need to give it some time to see results.</li>
            <li> This product is the only one who works on eyelashes .Prety good ladies tried it</li>
            <li> I see some change after 5 weeks.  I bought one a few years ago that was more effective, but I can not remember the name of it.</li>
            <li> i have been using it religiously for a month now , no results . don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> This is a great product that really works.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it does leave your eyes gooey in the morning.</li>
            <li> Has thickened and made longer my lashes. After using RapidLash for several months you do not need to use it daily.</li>
            <li> I have been using this products for nearly 7 weeks and I can see significant change on my eyelash: it becomes longer and thicker. I&#x27;ll recommend this to my friend and purchase a new one when the current one is gone!</li>
            <li> This is the best single cosmetic item I have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes were very thin due to me applying fake lashes. This product is amazing. I have been using it for about a week and I dont even apply it every day but my eye lashes are LONG AND THICK!</li>
            <li> Far exceeded my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had thought to take pictures before I started using this product-</li>
            <li> I  wore individual eyelashes that you glue on for over twenty five years. Consequently, when I stop wearing them I had no eyelashes. Maybe 3 very weak eyelashes left on each eye (what a sight). After researching all the products on the market I decided to try Rapidlash because it was in my price range.Well I am happy to say after 3 weeks of use I had some good results and by the second month I can truthfully say I  know this product works for me. People think I am still wearing the fake glue on individual lashes thats how good this product works and THANK GOD BECAUSE I LOOKED A HOT MESS.</li>
            <li> Seems to be doing the trick!</li>
            <li> It really works! My eyelashes are longer-not thicker, but baby hairs are growing in which might result in a more voluminous effect. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about ten days and I look much younger and more full of life thanks to my longer lashes!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Works great!! Had my doubts but a friend swore by it. I was using La#*##* and boy am I glad I tried this. Wish I had taken before and after cuz I think it works better than La#*##*...also 20 bucks cheaper here than in the drugstore . The tube lasted about 3 months</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely no change in my eyelashes using this for over two months. Two years ago I used Lilash and love the results, but not having access to it this time I had high hopes for rapid lash. The only thing it did for me is stain my up eyelid a darker brown.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working - subtle, but not surprising as my eyelashes are really thin and short.</li>
            <li> Good, my eyelash seems grew longer since I used 3 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!!! Used in past bimaprost and this is the shiznit !! Deff gonna buy again</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff about a year ago. It took about a few months to start seeing results, and it worked really well! My lashes were twice as long and looked great with mascara on. But then I think my body started getting used to it, because by the time I bought a second bottle, the product had no effect on my lashes anymore. Maybe this is something that is unavoidable, because I&#x27;ve heard anything from face washes to makeup products stop reacting with your face after using for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;So sadly I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use this product again, even though it did work initially, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it if its effect stops working after a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 10 days and already see that my lashes are fuller and growing thicker. MUCH better than 3 layers of mascara and a prayer, like on most mornings. I&#x27;m really excited to see my lashes in another few weeks.</li>
            <li> Arrivec on time. Dunno if it works though, I think? Maybe too early</li>
            <li> I am a guy with lighter eyelashes that weren&#x27;t so long, until I started using Rapidlash. About 2 weeks into using the product, I noticed quite a change. Not too drastic, but enough that I could see my lashes. Now its been about a month and I have longer lashes with a healthier look! My mother also has light and short eyelashes so I decided to buy her some as well. Definitely worth it and a great product! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend applying the serum really close to the inside of your eye (where your eye meets your nose) because I started feeling a little tender when I got too close. I don&#x27;t apply that close anymore and I&#x27;m loving the length and no more tenderness.</li>
            <li> I did notice a slight difference in growth (more length but not thickness).  It is a very slight difference.  And I have been using this product for a few months now....every night.  I will continue to try other brands for more length and thickness.</li>
            <li> Love this product, give it a few months and you will truly see the growth!</li>
            <li> With continuing use this product works to thicken and lengthen your lashes. It takes a couple weeks of using it daily though. It does not have the problems li lash had in making your eye lid turn red or itch as does the perscription product.....that is a real plus...I would recommend this product as not being as effective as the prescription product - but it does work and as I mentioned the prescription product does have its drawbacks.</li>
            <li> I love these products!</li>
            <li> Not so happy with this product</li>
            <li> Made my eyes itch terribly .</li>
            <li> My second week using this, I haven&#x27;t see any result yet.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and does everything it says it does!! Will definetley purchase again!</li>
            <li> Did not work for me.  I lost my lashes to Cancer, and when they grew back, very short and sparse, it did not make them any longer.</li>
            <li> I have eye lashes and eyebrows thanks to this stuff.  Have used it for years and will continue to use it because it really works.  Love it.  My lashes are sooooo great and long and look wonderful with mascara.  I am so happy with this product and with my lashes and eyebrows too.  Nice to have hair where it is supposed to be and don&#x27;t have to be hairless due to heredity or age.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Works great on me! My lashes got so long I actually stopped using it for a while because they were touching my sunglass lenses and driving me nuts. My mom and aunt are so sold they&#x27;re using it now as well. The bottle also lasts for months before having to replace. You simply can&#x27;t beat the product for this price.</li>
            <li> I have pretty short and sparse Asian lashes. I&#x27;ve noticed that with consistent use, this does indeed help my lashes look more visible (with a good mascara, of course). I wouldn&#x27;t say I was blown away by the results, but I did notice some lengthening and a little more volume. The downside for me was that when I stopped using this every night, I noticed my lashes returning to their original sad state. So keep that in mind when purchasing.</li>
            <li> This product works! I didn&#x27;t realize just how well it works until I got lazy and stopped using it. My lashes are puny and sad again. Just ordered another bottle.</li>
            <li> I was so shocked to buy a product that actually worked as it advertised! My lashes were a bit longer, but not thicker. After 6 months, it seems like imback to square one. I&#x27;m considering shopping around with another product and see if I can find one that is more effective.</li>
            <li> See FDA warning letter to manufacturer.  Likely why active ingredient isopropyl cloprostenate is no longer used in this product and why it doesn&#x27;t work anymore.  http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2011/ucm251951.htm</li>
            <li> Does grow my lashes longer. Does not make them thicker</li>
            <li> I find the applicator brush too thin and wimpy. I bought a much cheaper serum from Rimmel and it works just as well. I put it below my pillow so I access it easily before going to sleep.</li>
            <li> Used as directed did not work and if any accidentally gets in you eye it does sting</li>
            <li> Save your money &amp; get Latisse. This does not work at all.</li>
            <li> I have tried all different types of products, this is the first one that has lived up to its claims! Love it!</li>
            <li> This product worked extremely well on my eyelashes- have been applying it nightly for the better part of 2 months now and can absolutely see a difference.  It&#x27;s very effective - upper and bottom lashes are not much fuller but significantly longer.  Friends have noticed.  This is a great alternative to eyelash extensions which I had done once and loved but found too expensive to up keep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyebrows are too light and thin so I applied the serum in this area as well hoping to bulk and shape them up a bit but didn&#x27;t see any difference here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy this again for my eyelashes when I run out!</li>
            <li> Product does a great job!</li>
            <li> So far it hasn&#x27;t done much for lengthening my lashes. :(</li>
            <li> unreal !! this stuff works took a couple months HUGE difference in lashes , never had  think or long ,, now I do</li>
            <li> Have not seen the results that I would like to see - hopefully I will see a difference in the next couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working.  My lashes appear thicker and longer.  I just wish it would fill in the bald spots more.  Time will tell</li>
            <li> Me again...I originally purchased Rapidlash Serum about two years ago and after using it for a little over a month, I did see a marked improvement in my thin, light colored lashes.  I used mascara and it really made them &#x27;pop even more&#x27;.  I didn&#x27;t actually see any new lashes but the length and thickness seemed greatly improved.  After using one bottle I discontinued use even though I had read that if you quit using it,your lashes would go back to thin and skimpy.  I recently looked back at some close up face pictures of myself and couldn&#x27;t believe how great my lashes looked compared to the way they now looked.  I immediately started using a second bottle that I had saved and once again within five to six weeks I saw a huge difference in my lashes.  One bottle will last a good two months and I use it nightly.  PS.  I&#x27;m seventy years old.</li>
            <li> So I was using lumigan for eyelash growth because I had this hookup with this doctor who gave me all sorts of free samples of the stuff...  Anyways, had yadda yadda yadda something happened with that doctor and now their license may be restricted...  I won&#x27;t go into details.  My eyelashes looked fantastic with lumigan and I still really miss it.  I&#x27;ve been looking into the black market of foreign online pharmacies...  But this stuff seems to be working pretty well.  No, it&#x27;s not to lumigan standards.  But it&#x27;s better than nothing!  I&#x27;m pairing it with this queen bee eye cream stuff and together they are doing a pretty good job.  My eyelashes are definitely longer and fuller than they are when I use nothing.    By the way, if anyone knows where I can get some lumigan, let me know...</li>
            <li> Does not work. Spend $35 more and get Latisse that actually work.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve had it about a week, and so I waited to write this review. It&#x27;s actually working on my lashes!! Thrilling, as my lashes need help. I did use Lilash for a long time, but they are very expensive, and I worried about the knock offs.&lt;br /&gt;So always do your research on who you buy from.&lt;br /&gt;But after a week or so I am noticing a difference. I hope and expect it will continue as long as I use it. If not, I don&#x27;t really know what I would do. Maybe Latisse since it&#x27;s prescribed.&lt;br /&gt;But I am very happy with the results so far. If it stops working? I will let you know!! I just want to have long lashes and volume. So far so good!! Thanks Rapidlash for making a quality product!! I will be a repeat buyer..... as long as my lashes keep improving. But I&#x27;m not worried to be honest. After seeing with my own eyes the results in just a week?? I can&#x27;t wait to see them in a month! I&#x27;m loving it!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do what it should do.</li>
            <li> Rapidlash is great! It is easy to use and produced the results I wanted. I have not tried it on my eyebrows, but that should work, too.</li>
            <li> I am 52 with dark brown eyes. My lashes had gotten thinner and straighter over time. Even with curling and mascara they would end up sticking straight out and barely be noticeable. I&#x27;ve even tried lash extensions which were nice but temporary and expensive. Tried Rapidlash and the results were impressive. I never had any burning or discoloration. My eyelashes now curl up to my eyelids. I will continue using it and would recommend anyone who is unhappy with their thin or short eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It takes a little time to start but when it does, it makes a real difference. Use lots of mascara and it&#x27;s stunning.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for over a month and I&#x27;ve not seen any difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;I fell for the very reasonable pricing--but there&#x27;s a reason for that. It doesn&#x27;t work. Save your money.&lt;br /&gt;Revitalash did work very well. Tarte also has a serum that works pretty well but it&#x27;s pricey.&lt;br /&gt;Rapidlash is NOT in their category at all...not even close.</li>
            <li> It irritated my eyes and made my eyelid near the lash line go from red to a bruised purple. It did make my eyelashes a bit longer but I stopped using it after a couple of weeks because of the side effect which from what ive read not everyone has had or at least not sharing. So, I&#x27;m giving this product  three stars because I did see some growth in only 2 weeks and that&#x27;s what it says it do.... and it did list possible side effects ^_^</li>
            <li> This absolutely the best product for eyelashe enhancement !&lt;br /&gt;I use to have very thin sparse eyelashes after three months my eyelashes are amazing!! I no longer need flash eyelashes everyone&#x27;s always compliments me on my eyelashes!!!&lt;br /&gt;You may not see results like in a week some do. But if you use the product everynite you WILL not be disappointed!!!! I will never, ever be without this product!!</li>
            <li> It might not fit me because nothing changed.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working. I&#x27;ve applied to only one eye as a test, and it does seem to show a slight difference.  (Don&#x27;t expect drastic miracles, but it&#x27;s worth a try if your lashes are struggling.)</li>
            <li> Not too bad. It irritates my eyes so I can&#x27;t use it everyday. I saw some improvement but nothing mayor. Too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> It worked better then Lattise did for me</li>
            <li> This is a great product, you&#x27;ll see results after a week, my lashes grew fuller and longer, I&#x27;ve tried other products that make you&#x27;re lashes look stringing, this one is great gives you fullness and length!!!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t irritate like other serums. I&#x27;ve tried Grand Lash and it was terrible for it made me look bloodshot all day where as this has thickened and lengthens without side effects.</li>
            <li> I have never used a product to help with growing my lashes. This product does miracles. Of course, you have to be consistent. I applied it for a month and it made such a difference. A lot of people compliment my lashes. And I recently started applying it on my eyebrows because I have very few hairs and it has been working also. :) I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> So far I have seen a noticeable difference in length and fullness. Love!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but this product was amazing.  My lashes were recovering from getting eyelash extensions every 3 weeks for about nine months.  My lashes were left short and stubby.  After only a month of using this product I saw significant growth.  Now, a month and a half later my lashes exceed the length they ever were before getting extensions.  I&#x27;m never getting extensions again!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think its working…. even tho it is, too little to be noticed!!</li>
            <li> I am about 3 weeks into using this product &amp; see NO difference. I am hoping I will see some results in another couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Makes my lashes longer and slightly thicker. I have been using it for about 2 years now, and love how my lashes look.</li>
            <li> With every night use I can definitely tell a difference in my eyelashes. They are growing longer and thicker. I have been using nightly for about 3 weeks and can see results. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> I feel like my eyelashes definitely got a little fuller and longer. Not to an extreme, but I could definitely notice a difference. I pulled out a lot of my lashes wearing fake ones. I finally feel comfortable not wearing fake eyelashes after using this consistently for a couple months.</li>
            <li> This product really worked well for me.  Wish the end result was permanent!</li>
            <li> I had tried a similiar product before but this one works much better.  I would say within a couple of weeks I started noticing that my eyelashes were fuller, longer and darker.  I wear a ton on mascara everyday and I know I am hard on my eyelashes so I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have used this product since I bought it and I have noticed that my eyelashes are longer and then when I put mascara they even look better.  I just gave it to my sister for her stocking for Christmas so I&#x27;m looking forward to see what her results are, because she has really short lashes.  That will be the real test :-)  But, for me it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> Within the 3rd week I noticed the eyelashes I already had were longer. Then around the 5th week noticed my eye lashes are fuller longer and stronger. I love this product...wish it was a little cheaper though.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of SmartLash at an entry level price elsewhere, and loved it, but could not afford to buy more at the regular price.  I found this product read the reviews and since it was half the price, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Absolutely as good as SmartLash.  My lashes are much longer and fuller and darker.  I am a natural blonde with slightly less than average lashes.  After 1 month, the difference is quite noticeable.  I&#x27;m buying again!!</li>
            <li> This is no Latisse but it is the next best eyelash enhancer I&#x27;ve ever tired. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper and easier to get than Latisse. I didn&#x27;t see much change in my eyelash composition until about 8 weeks after I first started applying it. I was a bit discouraged at first, in fact, at one point I almost felt like my lashes were getting thinner. I decided that I would give it a full 8 weeks before giving up use. Suddenly, one day, I noticed my eyelashes were starting to look a bit longer and thicker. Overall I&#x27;m happy with this product and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Given some time, this product does work! I wouldn&#x27;t be without it. My eyelashes were quite thin; however, thanks to Rapidlash, my lashes are filling in! I can&#x27;t say that they are super lush, but at 60+ yrs old, I have lashes that 20 year olds compliment me on. I use this product &amp;#34;every&amp;#34; night. Consistency is everything if you want Rapidlash to work.</li>
            <li> This product works.  My lashes grew longer and filled in a little.  It was worth the price and I&#x27;ll buy it again and again.  I&#x27;m over 60 yrs and this stuff worked on me!!!  My lashes have NEVER been so long and nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 4 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the length or thickness of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this about 1 month ago. I don&#x27;t use it every night, mainly because I forget or fall asleep. But it is already working. My lashes were damaged by extensions, and my brows were not waxed the way I wanted them. My brows are now thicker, I don&#x27;t need to fill them in with shadow, and my lashes are visibly longer. I had the extensions done about 2 years ago. The length never recovered from that damage until I started using this product. I&#x27;ll keep this in my make up bag forever!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several weeks and have noticed no difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Worst product ever!! After ONE use my eyes were so red and irritated it hurt to keep them open. They were also incredibly swollen and red. And i literally had burning in my eyes. Please please do not use this product I have never felt anything like it before.</li>
            <li> I always loved my eye lashes, never really wanted or needed them to be longer or thicker. I wear makeup and mascara on the daily; however, I am going to Cancun in a month and a half and I wanted longer ones so I didn&#x27;t have to wear eye makeup seeing as how I would be in the pool a majority of the time. So, i shopped around, looked at reviews etc and decided on this one. First eye lash enhancer I have ever used and I LOVE IT!! I have attached a photo of before and what only 2 weeks looks like using it on the daily before bed. The &amp;#34;now&amp;#34; photo I am only wearing mascara, not eye liner so you can see what it is capable of turning out like. BUY IT!!!</li>
            <li> It works to lengthen and somewhatdarken eyelashes. No to very minor irritation was observed. The product doesn&#x27;t work as well on eye brows, but anything that gives eyelash improvement is a plus. I have been using this product for almost 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for nearly a month and can definitely see a difference. It&#x27;s made my lashes longer but not thicker. Only complaint is it gets crusty by the time I wake up in the morning but it&#x27;s nothing that washing my face can&#x27;t handle. Also, the price on Amazon is 50% less expensive than buying it in store in Ulta (which is where I first heard of it).</li>
            <li> I should have taken before pictures!  I was pretty skeptical so I didn&#x27;t take the before pictures, but I should have.  It really does work.  It took about a month to show, but it has maintained and really looks great.  My upper and lower lashes are longer and fuller, and my eyebrows are more full at the outside edges.  It hasn&#x27;t bothered my eyes at all.  I really recommend this.</li>
            <li> Very useful. I like it</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are long and full once again! I will continue using Rapidlash and Eyebrow Enhancing Serum!</li>
            <li> After several months of inconsistent use followed by about 3 weeks of daily use, I still see very little difference as far as my skimpy Asian lashes go. It is also irritating for up to several hours after application. However, I do see a noticeable difference in my eyebrows which was so unexpected in light of the disappointing performance with my lashes. I will continue to use on eyebrows as it gives a really nice pump to them. Will have to keep looking for something suitable for the lashes. Mac&#x27;s lash serum worked WAY better for me. I saw a dramatic difference immediately. I don&#x27;t think they sell it anymore.  I got this on Hautelook probably for a similar price as sold here. I&#x27;ve also seen it in a double pack sold at Costco. Only give it 3 stars bc of the burning and who wants to have to buy separate products for lashes and brows? Maybe it&#x27;ll work for both for you. Worth a try.    EDIT: less than 2 wks after posting my initial review, and continued faithful application - alas it really started to work. Almost overnight these lashes sprang forth. Nothing crazy, but yes definite. Definitely and significantly longer. Still thin, but easier to plump up w mascara whereas before it was more of a futile exercise. I continue to use this almost daily. The burning is much less frequent now. Before, I was applying before my eye cream (to give my eye serum ample time to soak in). Now I apply eye cream prior to brushing this on. I thought that maybe the rubbing and subsequent movement of the entire eye area might be causing this product to shift and become irritating. Whatever it was, the burning is much less. Maybe my eye skin just toughened up ; )  I will continue to use and have bumped my rating up one well deserved star</li>
            <li> It has been 4 weeks as of oct 11th. I do see a difference in my lash length.&lt;br /&gt; I will keep using it,definitely .Great stuff well worth it.</li>
            <li> It does make my lashes look curly, but I think it&#x27;s make my lashes off quickly too!! Is it side effect??</li>
            <li> This is a really good product. I have never had eye lashes and this stuff made a noticeable difference in about 4 weeks. After 12 weeks, I actually had very pretty lashes. I quit using it and now I&#x27;m back to No lashes. I am buying more and I hope they never stop making it, because I am never again going to quit using it.</li>
            <li> I bought RapidLash primarily for eyebrow growth. After a month of consistent use, I have seen absolutely no new eyebrow growth or lengthening of current eyebrow hairs-beyond that of what normally grows in a month. Having said that, it might be helpful to know that my eyebrows have *always* been thin and sparse, due to genetics not over-plucking or waxing. So, it might work for people trying to regrow hair they&#x27;ve already had, but it does not work to create new hair or thicken existing hair-for me, anyway. And, really, it didn&#x27;t prompt any new growth in the areas where I&#x27;ve plucked either..</li>
            <li> This caused me severe pain and irritation in my eyes. It is not returnable.</li>
            <li> Really useful, I get long and thick eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;Just the first week of my eyes a little allergy, anyway, I really like this product. I will always use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product from the manufacture&#x27;s website on several occasions and it has always worked on me. After about two -three weeks my lashes are so long I need only swipe my mascara once or twice to darken them.  This is one of the two products that I&#x27;ve ever use from a company that really works.</li>
            <li> I have a  fair complexion and older thus my hair and eyelashes are thinning a often brittle.  I must say that for the first time ever, I found somewhat that REALLY WORKS.  After about four months of use, I do not even wear ANY mascara and have had many people comment on how beautifully i apply my &amp;#34;false lashes.&amp;#34;  I am telling you this because I have never had anything actually work like it promised but this is a true exception.  My eyelashes actually interfere with wearing my glasses because they hit the lens.  Truly a miracle.  Takes a while but IT WORKS.</li>
            <li> Good product and will buy it again soon&lt;br /&gt;I really like it&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to my friends and family</li>
            <li> tomorrow will be 4 weeks I have actually made a pic every week and so far i can see NO change .I am disapointed with the results .</li>
            <li> I bought this due to the reviews and in hopes that it would lengthen and thicken my eye lashes. I have very thin and sparse eyelashes with some lashes missing here and there and not nearly the same lengths. I applied this as directed from the instructions. It took about 2 months to see any results. YES this did make my lashes longer but did not thicken it. I still have the same sparse eyelashes only a little bit longer and for some odd reasons, my eyelashes points out in all direction directions so it&#x27;s not very pretty to curl and put mascara on as my eye lashes will point in many off ways. It&#x27;s not a miracle product but if you already have thick eye lashes and just want to lengthen it then this product might be worth a try.</li>
            <li> They make a huge difference in my look. This year I got blepharitis. The eye doctor did not think it was from mascara or eyelash extensions but the glue always did itch a little and that infection took three weeks to clear. No more extensions. So. I&#x27;m trying this. It looks to me like I lost some lashes w the infection and maybe even from putting extensions in but they&#x27;re filling in a bit. It doesn&#x27;t look as good but I just want my own lashes as nice as possible that&#x27;s good enough for now.</li>
            <li> Rapidlash was EXPIRED since January 2014...Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again! It&#x27;s a rip off!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re growing but you have to keep using eyelash enhancement products to keep the lashes long.</li>
            <li> Used for a substantial amount of time and I seen no difference.</li>
            <li> Results really are noticeable after 1 month of consistent use.  I have noticed about a 50% growth in the density of my lashes.  Love it.  Would definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> This absolutely does what it says it does.  I read other reviews where people have had some adverse reactions.  None of these are happening to my eyes.  My eyelashes are now so long and thick, that I have stopped wearing mascara unless I am dressing for special occasions.  Then I look like I am wearing false eyelashes. FABULOUS!  I have given this as a gift to friends who have commented on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It said Eyelash and Eyebrow but only came as Eyelash.  I was afraid to use it since it is such an important area such as the eyes.  I waited too long to return.  Watch carefully.  There are starting to be more amazon items that are not as advertised.</li>
            <li> Not all that pleased with item.</li>
            <li> First it arrive within 2 days which was great. Also I only paid half of what costs elsewhere like CVS. I have been using it for 5 days now and I already notice that my eyelashes don&#x27;t fall out as much thus I notice the volume increase. Hopefully it also adds length with continuous use.</li>
            <li> Slightly irritating to the eyes at first, but it works!</li>
            <li> After 1 month i could tell my eyelashes were longer and thicker. My eyebrows are even fuller and darker.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Did not see a difference honestly.</li>
            <li> It works, but you must do it daily. I bought this product a while ago and tried it once it a while. It was Ok but nothing noticeable to any one else. I tried more expensive STINGING products daily because it was expensive. I decided to give it Rapidlash another chance because the price was lower and the expensive stuff was worthless (I never used the RX). I applied it every night for less than a month. My mom who never pays attention asked me if I had false eyelashes. Without mascara there isn&#x27;t a difference because my lashes are light brown. But with mascara, OMG. It&#x27;s weird to read negative comments. If you apply every night, it works.</li>
            <li> works awesome.  My lashes are longer.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work for me. I try second bottle it still don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It really helped me! Thank you. No more bold spots on my eyebrows and it made my eyelashes longer. I am glad I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the results! My eyelashes were always weak and breaking. Once I started using this, it grew thicker and so so so long. All my friends noticed. Every time I went out I got compliments on my eyes. I will be buying more of this product. I recommended it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other lash growth products and they worked ok. This worked great for me. A few months back I had lost almost all my lashes I think because of stress. I started using this and after about a month I noticed a huge difference. People that hadn&#x27;t seen me in a while thought I had false lashes on. I was in a car accident when I was a teen and my face went through the wind shield leaving me a scar right on my lash line so I have a space where I can&#x27;t grow lashes but with this I actually grew some lashes, I was so surprised. My lashes look great and I swear they&#x27;re slightly darker. Try this, hopefully it will work for you too.</li>
            <li> I know some say there may be a period of shedding  - but I lost a significant amount , I continued to use though thinking I just need to persist  ; but  after  3 wks without any improvement I&#x27;ve stopped. I was getting down to an almost bare lash line -  I see so many glowing reviews , but honestly I&#x27;ve had much better results with revitalash.</li>
            <li> makes lashes grow to youthful length and thickens.</li>
            <li> This product was a total impulse buy at Costco. I already had long lashes, but thin enough that it took 4-5 coats of mascara and to much time in the morning to get the look I wanted. I picked up this product with not much hope but, WOW!!  My eyelashes are so much thicker now that I only need a quick swipe of mascara. My make-up takes 5 min instead of 15. I started seeing results in about 3 weeks. I will say that I have had much better results on my eyelashes than eyebrows. I haven&#x27;t seen any great change there. Overall, though, I am very, very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  It has really worked for me :)</li>
            <li> I could see that it made my eyebrows and lashes grow but it made my eyes sting all the time.</li>
            <li> I like it 👏 it&#x27;s great Im going to start over cause I had applied it wrong</li>
            <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve used several times for browns</li>
            <li> I would say it works just as well as the prescription product. I&#x27;ve used them both for about a year each and both work great!</li>
            <li> I bought two of there so far and used non stop for about 6 months. no result at all. don&#x27;t bother spending money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for MONTHS and have no results.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does make your lashes grow noticeably longer.  I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for over 2 years.  It will not IMO make them thicker.....just longer.  You&#x27;ll still need your mascara.  You&#x27;ll start to see growth after a few weeks, and your lashes will stop falling out.  BTW, I&#x27;m 65 years old!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. On time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I can honestly say it works. If you&#x27;re consistent with nightly use, you&#x27;ll see results. I&#x27;m using it right now to plump my lashes for my upcoming wedding.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING! My lashes were short and stubby for my entire life! I&#x27;m 50 years old and I have beautiful LONG lashes now! I am NOT KIDDING!!!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> lashes are thicker and longer now, been using it for 3 months and currently stopped just because I already get the desired length of my lashes.. I even used this for my 7 year old niece, and the result is amazing. :D I just used it for about 5 times now for 2 months, and we already noticing some results on her.. note that we didn&#x27;t used it every night on her.. just when she ask for it.. haha!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my eye lashes since using this product. I think for how cheap it is it&#x27;s kind of common sense that it won&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li> Love this serum! I&#x27;ve been using it for years! And it always works!</li>
            <li> Dont ever buy this product</li>
            <li> Definitely going to order more of this. Good results.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used this product for over a month now and definitely see a difference in the length of my lashes,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 2 months now. I was hoping to get the long thick lashes like some of the pictures I saw but unfortunately no real significant changes were made in the length department.  HOWEVER,  I definitely do see the difference in the thickness of my lashes.  It is slightly longer but not to the point where I&#x27;m like WOW. I used lilash before and with that I saw a significant growth in the length though no changes in the thickness. I stopped using lilash because my lashline started getting red and irritated.  With this, so far so good....I will keep using and see if continuous use will give me longer lashes :P crossing my fingers</li>
            <li> It does work, but it takes a good, solid month of application to see a difference.  I&#x27;ve buy it, use it up, see a difference, then stop using it, and my lashes start  breaking all over again.  I wish I could get this on auto-delievery every couple months!</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time. I love this product ,and have tried many.........&lt;br /&gt;Worth the $$, and cheapest price here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are longer but I expected the growth to be faster,  My expectations were wrong, not the product.  Mahalo.</li>
            <li> Well I woke up thinking that I have pinkeye. Nope just very sore , swollen eyes from using Rapidlash. I also had drainage in the corner of my eyes. This is enough to scare me. Not using it anymore! I&#x27;ll stick with Latisse. It&#x27;s more expensive,  but atleast it&#x27;s safe.  I&#x27;m not taking a chance with my eyes.</li>
            <li> I originally started using this product a few years ago and was impressed by the results. After a year and a half however the lash lengths were back to their previous condition before use. I was informed by Rapidlash that the sellers I had recently purchased from (at that time) were probably bogus. After purchasing through licensed sellers and once from the site itself, I did not see any improvement. I believe that after the change in their formula, something is not the same. At any rate, it does not work for me now, no matter who I purchase it from, and I will not be using it again.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this serum moisturizes my eye lids just above my lashes. It has really filled in my lashes. All women want beautiful long, thick eye lashes. This will do the trick. I say, every woman try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paula Heyntsen</li>
            <li> I used this product every night for two months before I really noticed a difference, so be patient!  I noticed a lot of growth on the outer corners of my lashes but I don&#x27;t see any difference in terms of thickness. I enjoy this product and think it works. It&#x27;s not AMAZING and going to magically make your lashes super thick and long but I do think it makes a noticeable difference. Also, because I&#x27;m a hoarder, I&#x27;ve already purchased two back ups. One tube lasts for much longer than it says - two months. I&#x27;m still on my first tube and I&#x27;ve been using it for almost four months.</li>
            <li> I have seen many of these products on the market and the prices vary considerably.  This product has a reasonable price and the product delivers exactly what it claims.  It really works actually faster than it claims!&lt;br /&gt;Sharron</li>
            <li> i love this and it works on my lash, will sure buy again and also I have recommended to friends.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Easy to use and observable results in 2 weeks or so.  I will definitely continue to use this.</li>
            <li> It works! I have short &amp; straight eyelashes after a month I can see the  difference of my eyelashes. Can&#x27;t lived without this product.</li>
            <li> This is easy to apply by simply brushing across the base of your lashes. Since I began using it I have noticed that my lashes are definitely longer and more noticeable. I am a natural blonde so this has helped make my lashes stand out more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands of eyelash enhancing serum and this is the best I&#x27;ve found. I love that it works fast and doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn my eyes.</li>
            <li> have been consistantly on this product for the last 3 years.its much cheaper than most of the lash growth serums out there in the market. it works!</li>
            <li> I received it, and tried it right away, but the brush was dry and there was nothing in there.  The container was opaque and I couldn&#x27;t check to see if there was any liquid.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I have been using this for about a month now and have noticed a difference in the length of my lashes.  They were already thick and long, but now they are even longer than before and very beautiful.  I will continue to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to warn that sometimes when I wake up in the morning my eyes look a little pinkish/reddish, and when I put it on before bedtime it can sting my skin a bit so that is why I am taking one star away.</li>
            <li> This worked. Slowly, but eventually and with noticeable results.  As I started to run out I tried to order more through Amazon, but nowhere will ship to New Zealand anymore, not even this seller that I previously bought Rapidlash off.  I&#x27;m kind of upset because my longer, thicker, darker lashes have all gone back to short, light stubbies and I can&#x27;t get my Rapidlash needs fulfilled.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with some trepidation, as I never seem to have luck with beauty products. After three weeks of daily use my lashes seemed longer, but who can you tell when your lashes are short and stumpy to begin with? Two weeks later, my minor miracle happened. My eyelashes are noticeably longer and thicker. A bit of mascara and my eyes pop. I&#x27;m now a true believer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I was not so sure about how it works when I was reading reviews. I bought it a month ago, and I&#x27;ve been using this since then.&lt;br /&gt;This surely helps my eyelash and eyebrow to grow longer. It is so obvious that I am happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;You need to be patient though, I can say it worth waiting :)</li>
            <li> Still waiting to see results on my eyelashes, but I can see a difference in my eyebrows. Filling in some sparse areas quite nicely!</li>
            <li> It works and it makes your eyelashes really long if you use it everyday, how ever you have to keep using the product to kept the length of your lashes other wise they will go back to the same original length :(</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t spend this much money again on this product.  It has done nothing for my eyelashes.  Live and learn.</li>
            <li> Have used the product for better part of last two years!  Excellent!!!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this before and it works well. You just need to give it some time. Use it nightly for 3-6 weeks and I am sure you will notice much more length.&lt;br /&gt;I have used much more expensive versions but this one works just as well in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was loosing my lashes- I saw the reviews on this and decided to purchase.  So glad I did.  Within 2 weeks I saw a difference and now after 2 months I cant believe how much my lashes have grown and thickened.  This is it!!!  I went to purchase another bottle from them but they are not showing anymore sales for RapidLash.</li>
            <li> This product does not work, I have been using it about 5 weeks now and there is no growth in my eyelashes at all. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because there are no side effects and it seems harmless but it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Look no further if you&#x27;re searching for a lash lengthening product! Five and a half weeks ago, Rapidlash appeared in my mailbox. You would not believe the growth of my eyelashes! My hair stylist noticed how long and dark they were; she thought I had changed makeup products. I didn&#x27;t even have MASCARA on. Complete strangers stop me on the street and in the mall to compliment my eyes; one woman asked where I purchased my FALSE eyelashes. &amp;#34;They look so natural!&amp;#34; she said. She practically fainted when I revealed the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there&#x27;s anything to complain about, it&#x27;s that the product works better and faster than advertised. Recently, I fell asleep in our backyard hammock. Upon wakening, a variety of small insects had been captured in my eyelashes. Because they are so long, the corner lashes often get tangled. At first I used a safety pin to separate them, but I discovered a used, clean mascara wand does an effective job of detangling all the knots. My eyelashes throw their own shadow. I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to contacts I previously wore infrequently but now must wear daily because my thick, strong eyelashes push my glasses down my nose. My toddler LOVES my butterfly kisses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The public response to my eyelashes has been so strong that I am bolder, more assertive, and more confident than ever before. Just yesterday, I asked for and received a raise without even batting an eyelash!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rapidlash for over a month now. Like the reviewers said, just be patient, and at about a month, you will see results. I finally noticed the results in a big way this past weekend when I applied my Benefit mascara. There is no doubt that my lashes are longer than they were a month ago. I even missed applications on a few nights. To remember to apply at bedtime, I keep it right beside my skincare and lip balm.</li>
            <li> Not as quick of results as others I have used, but it is good!</li>
            <li> I love Rapidlash! I have been using it for a month now, within a week or two you start seeing the results and they are amazing! It&#x27;s affordable compared to other brands. I would definitely use it again and recommend it to all my friend and family. Very happy with the results. You can see my picture below for the after results! :)</li>
            <li> This product has always worked for me. This is the 4th or fifth time I buy this product and I always see results. I&#x27;ve spent my money on other more expensive products (except latisse) and I see the best results in the least amount of time.</li>
            <li> Lashes are longer, thicker, &amp; darker. Could see results in about 4 weeks. Full results around 8 weeks. Great product!</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product! I purchased Rapidlash to add fullness to my eyebrows. I applied this morning and night for about 6 weeks. Within 4 weeks I saw new growth that impressed me. I then added it to the base of my eyelashes and after about 4 weeks my lashes were longer! Be sure to only apply along the lash line on TOP side of the lid to avoid getting it in your eye. I must say I am truly amazed how well this works in a short period of time. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> You get what you paid for!! I had been using Revitalash with great result. After I used up the bottle I switched to this Rapidlash thinking I would save some money. This thing does not help my lash grow longer or thicker at all! In fact, my lashes started to fall out! OMG!!! Anyway I switched to Revitalash again, and after many months I got my pretty lash back.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the original formula but still helps some...expensive too. )-:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60+ and never have had great lashes, but over the last few years they&#x27;ve gotten worse due to trying extensions and false strip lashes. So, after reading the good and bad reviews on Amazon about Rapidlash Eyelash Serum, I decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks of continuous use and my natural lashes are definitely more uniform and longer!  So far I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will continue using it. The only drawback that I&#x27;ve noticed is the first 2 weeks of use left my right eyelid a brownish color and slightly puffy but after using another week, the color and puffyness seems to have improved so it must have been an initial reaction to the serum. I&#x27;ve also used it on the outer end of my brow, since it&#x27;s almost non existent, but haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement. Will keep you updated on any progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve increased my star rating from 4 to 5 stars because I&#x27;m in the 5th week of using Rapid Lash and my lashes are definitely longer and fuller than when I wrote my original review!  I now have better lashes than when I was in my 30&#x27;s which was many moons ago!!  I&#x27;m soooo happy with Rapid Lash that I will be reordering as soon as I start to run low on it!  Patience is the key and it will really pay off!  Now if I could just find a product to improve the rest of my face and body!!!  LOL!!  DON&#x27;T WAIT!!  BUY THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> Rapidlash eyelash enhancing serum works without the itching and irritation that I had with other lash enhances.  It&#x27;s simply easy to use too.</li>
            <li> it seemed to work well when I had used it a couple of years ago. I had noticed some eyelash growth. however this time I don&#x27;t really see any difference in my eyelashes. they actually seem to be falling out &amp; my eyes are really irritated. so I am not sure if i will buy again.</li>
            <li> This product works very good, my eye lashes are growing and so are my eyebrows where they were thinning out.</li>
            <li> After four weeks of use I did not notice any difference.  I applied rapid lash every single night as directed to the base of my lashes and to my brows. It even seems as if I lost lashes.</li>
            <li> Although this products does what it claims--at least for eyelash growth--it has major side effects, especially if one has sensitive eyes. It can cause redness, irritation, dryness, sties, itching, pain, and, in my case, blepharitis. For those who are unaware of the effects of blepharitis... EYELASH LOSS! So, not only did I experience all of the unpleasantness described above, I also wound up losing big patches of eyelashes. Please do yourself a favor and consult with your ophthalmologist before using this product.</li>
            <li> This product works well, it just takes a while.  After about 3-4 weeks I could tell my lashes were slightly longer.  They are starting to fill in more now.  I would recommend Rapidlash - it delivers results at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Dec 31, 2014 Let me state that I did not have nubby lashes to begin with, however, I have to say this did not disappoint. I have noticed a significant difference in the length of my lashes. I am currently on my second bottle. The purpose for purchasing this product is because I wanted my lashes to be naturally longer. I didn&#x27;t want to waste money on going to a salon to have eyelashes temporarily put on and I&#x27;m tired of throwing away money on the purchase of false lashes. I&#x27;m getting close to achieving the faux lash look with my own lashes, hoorah!</li>
            <li> Just began to use, estimated to be over a period of time will have the effect, insist on.</li>
            <li> Works 👍&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyebrows looks better now&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
            <li> Surprise!  This product works as advertised.  I have experienced eyelash regrowth of normal eyelashes; like they used to be.  It does take time, maybe a couple months, perhaps longer, depending on where you start.  I have applied it consistently each night before bedtime, and I plan to continue always.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff on my eyebrows when they look a little sparse it works great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months, and I love what it&#x27;s done for my eyelashes. The results are not as dramatic as using a prescription-strength product, but it definitely makes a difference. I noticed the most effect within the first two months of use, and now it&#x27;s just part of my bedtime routine so I use it as maintenance. My eyelashes aren&#x27;t necessarily thicker, but they&#x27;re longer. I apply it generously (a couple of coats) at the base of my lashes and kind of brush it forward to the tips. I make sure I apply it directly on my lash line and in between the rows of hair. When I put on my mascara in the morning, it surprises me how big my eyelashes look and really open up my eyes. I&#x27;ve had no issues with any kind of irritation or color change in my lids. Great product!</li>
            <li> Not as effective as Latisse, but better than some versions.</li>
            <li> Works great! I&#x27;ve used it sparingly on my eyelashes and have noticeably thicker lashes BUT my eyes don&#x27;t care too much for the serum and seem to tear up ... so I mostly use the serum for my eye brows ... amazing - brows are thicker and fuller a month + in ... seems to keep the growth so far (eyelashes) even tho I&#x27;ve stopped using it on them. Try it! Expensive but worth it IMO.</li>
            <li> 100 % effective!!! Does exactly what it suppose to, no side effects at all.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this ( about 2 months) I have definitely seen growth in my lashes. The reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it was not a miracle product for me, but I would only give a product 5 stars if it beyond exceeded my expectations. Bottom line: will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Like so many others I was very surprised at the efficacy of this product and how quickly one can see results. I bought this for my eyebrows. As one gets older the eyebrows tend to thin and in my case I think some of my face cream with glycolic acid accidentally got onto one of my eyebrows and I noticed thinning in one area. I continued to apply a little eyeshadow on my brows while using this product and it stilled worked even though it is recommended to use on a clean brow. The product produces the intended results in a short period of time so it is a five star product in my book.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I&#x27;ve  been using this product for several years and it definitely works. I always buy here on Amazon, and have always been 100% happy.</li>
            <li> My go to!! After pretty much decimating my lashes with fake individuals, faithfully, for years (like 5) I found this stuff and it pretty much gave them life. 1 bottle lasts me about 3 months or so and I have repurchased about 3 going on 4 times. I only use once a day and have noticed immediate, impressive results on both my lashes and my eyebrows (which I had over plucked at one point into pencil thin shadows) ya they&#x27;re back. Both my eyelashes and my brows are healthy and lush thanks to this stuff. It even grew my lower lashes, which I never had any of my entire makeup wearing life, lol. I apply right on my lash line as close to the base of my lashes as I can get. It does build up, so for best results, exfoliate the area regularly. I applied once or twice a day, after showers just cuz I felt the follicles or whatever were more open to allow the formula penetration. Idk. Lol. Either way I have had great results from this stuff and I plan to buy til my lashes are as long as the fake ones I used to wear - which is not far away either! I&#x27;ve used it for about a year now and from where I started, literally bald on my lash line(!!) I&#x27;m very impressed and highly recommend this product. The price is great for what it does.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. People at work compliment my thick brows and long lashed and ask if I am wearing falsies! but no! they are real! :)</li>
            <li> This really works the way it says ... Very quickly too and it works on eyebrows also. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Have seen no progress in the growth of my lashes!  Makes my eyelids red and irritated&lt;br /&gt; and swollen.  Can see no diffence in lashes</li>
            <li> Stopped using it and my eyelashes went back to stubby lashes.  This stuff really works!  The tube lasts for several months so it&#x27;s pretty inexpensive overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I am growing more eyelashes but my eyelashes are definitely longer and thicker than before, I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> It is not very easy to apply since you have to apply it just above the lashes. Furthermore, after two weeks of using it, no noticeable results. I&#x27;ll keep it up to see whether it will still kick in but I have my doubts</li>
            <li> I used this exactly as instructed, daily for 8 weeks, and there was absolutely no difference in the length, thickness or otherwise appearance of my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;I have very &#x27;average&#x27; lashes, light brown in color and of average length and thickness.</li>
            <li> I saw a my lashes longer than before after 4 weeks from using this prodect , i will continue using it and see how long it will grow . Only long lashes not thick</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product mainly for eyebrows and eyelashes that wasn&#x27;t as expensive as Latisse.  I read the reviews on Rapidlash before I purchased, so I was willing to wait a few weeks for results.  I used on my eyebrows where they are thinning, mainly on the outer arch.  I also used on my eyelashes.  After a couple weeks I thought I noticed some improvement on my eyelashes, but where it was really noticeable, was my eyebrows.  Not that they were perfect, but there was clearly some growth noticeable.  I am very happy with the results and believe if I keep using Rapidlash the results will keep improving.  For what I was looking for, this product was easier  to get (no prescription) and much less expensive!</li>
            <li> I rated 1 star because this enhancer didn&#x27;t work on my lashes at all. I saw that many people rated it 5. so maybe it worked for some. also, it stings when I apply.</li>
            <li> Updated Review:  A couple of weeks after I quit using Rapidlash, I noticed that my eyelashes seemed a little longer.  A few weeks after that, I decided to try it again.  This time it did not irritate my eyes.  I began to connect the dots....when I first used the product it was the height of spring allergy season and the product probably exacerbated already irritated eyes.  After re-trying the product I began to have a noticeable difference in my lashes.  My daughter even asked if I was wearing false lashes.  I am almost out of the product and have not had eye irritation again.  I just don&#x27;t use it on high pollen days.  I will be buying this again and would recommend it with the warning that allergy sufferers should not use this during peak allergy season.    Original Review:  I used the product for about 4 weeks and I saw no change in my lashes at all.  I have sensitive skin and was concerned about some other reviews but decided to give it a try.  The first couple of weeks it didn&#x27;t bother me, then they began to itch.  The itching got worse over time so I took a week off.  As soon as I resumed using the product, the itching returned.  It was not they typical red, rashy itch, but was very persistent.  I did not get the darkened appearance other people mentioned.  For me, this was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I got eyelash extensions done and after about a week they got on my nerves so I went to rip them out and a lot of my eyelashes fell out. I bought rapid lash and it&#x27;s done a good job of getting back to my normal thick lashes and made them longer than normal as well. I also took biotin with it (the hair skin and nails vitamin) and bought a mascara infused with grown serum. (Walmart, hard candy brand)</li>
            <li> Used as instructed for 4 weeks. No changes whatsoever. My eyelashes are normal but wanted thicker longer ones. It seems to work on some people and not other. I am one of the unfortunate ones. I didn&#x27;t get any itch or pink eye or secretions or anything read in other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck if you try it.</li>
            <li> I have only started using this in the past week or two, so I haven&#x27;t been able to see results yet. It&#x27;s easier to use than Latisse, which required a different applicator every time.</li>
            <li> Okay so I gave this product four stars because when you drench your eyelashes in it, it actually works! However the whites of my eyes turned an off white/grey and the lids darkened a bit as well. I have brown eyes so I didn&#x27;t noticed a change in the pigment but if you have lighter eyes it will change the pigment so be aware of that. It definitely delivered on the claim that it lengthens. It wasn&#x27;t dramatic at first, very subtle. But with mascara and primer -WOW! So it&#x27;s a good but at the expense of darkening your eyes a bit in addition to lengthening the lashes. You decide.</li>
            <li> This stuff works for me. I have lengthening of my lashes already. Can&#x27;t tell if they are thicker. I will this for a few months and then give my eyes a break from it. Since I have light eyes I want to make sure I don&#x27;t have any darkening of the pupil which can happen to some people on rare occasions.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to only use this on the top lash line. It wasn&#x27;t intended to use on the bottom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 65 and still work to look good. I wanted to see if Rapidlash would help my lashes grow. It really did. My husband even noticed. I will continue to purchase Rapidlash</li>
            <li> Used it faithfully on both eyelashes and eyebrows. I had read that it was good for sparse eyebrows.  I found no noticeable improvement in either one.</li>
            <li> Used every single night for five weeks - didn&#x27;t see any results.  Not happy - especially since, now that it has been a little more than a month, I am unable to return this product because I am not satisfied with it.  Seems like you should have a 60-90 day return period if it takes the product a minimum of 4 weeks to work.  Not cool! I&#x27;d give it 0 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this product at first but when my cousin offered to buy it i said yes and im glad i did. I had thin little lashes that were barely noticeable when i put on mascara but after using this for a little over two months i see results!! There are no more gaps between my lashes their darker, fuller, and longer!!! Their not the desired length yet but i will keep using. Just give it time and make sure to use it every night!</li>
            <li> Using this product for two weeks nightly.  Lashes are growing, especially the really small ones in the inner corners of my eyes.  Hurray!</li>
            <li> After applying the product twice a day for three weeks, I have not seen much progress. Will continue to apply until product is done.</li>
            <li> Being a former Latisse user and had GREAT results I thought I would try this in an effort to save some money.&lt;br /&gt;This product didn&#x27;t do anything for my eyelashes.  I was hoping it would maintain what Latisse had done but it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess you get what you pay for......</li>
            <li> I have stubby lashes... This was the right price so I decided to buy it and try it out. It works!!! I don&#x27;t have movie star lashes, but they are a LOT longer than they used to be about a month or so ago. I feel like they&#x27;re softer and in better condition too. Would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> After a few days of use, little blood vessels on my lids and under my eyes became very prominent and the areas looked bruised. I immediately stopped using the serum and, after a couple of weeks, looked normal again. I don&#x27;t believe the serum is dangerous, but it&#x27;s not for everyone, so please pay attention to it&#x27;s effect on you.</li>
            <li> I guess I expected more, lashes are bit longer but nothing spectacular. Probably I&#x27;m not gonna use the product again.</li>
            <li> I didnt see difference yet i dont use it everyday but like the fact my lashes is condition when i do use it it shows</li>
            <li> I took 4 months before I could see a major difference in my lashes, but after that, my lashes look much, much longer and fuller.  I bought more!</li>
            <li> Well, I had hopes based on a friend&#x27;s report to thicken sparse eyebrows. No luck for me.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product really works to grow lashes.. My lashes were short and few... not now... they are long and full.. fun to apply mascara now.</li>
            <li> Although my lashes do seem to be thicker and a little longer, the serum didn&#x27;t have any affect on my eyebrows. The serum is easy to apply and I didn&#x27;t experience any stinging or burning. I have very light green eyes and haven&#x27;t noticed any color change. I guess from the description of the product, I was expecting much more.</li>
            <li> I used to have great eyebrows.  Thick, natural arch, dark...I wish I had appreciated them when I had them.  But noooo...I wanted that over-plucked look that was so popular for many years (which looked terrible on everyone, by the way.  What were we thinking??).  My brows paid the price and have become a source of major annoyance.  I have to fill them in every day with pencil and powder.  The ends won&#x27;t grow back, and I have a small bald hole where it is supposed to be the widest.  (What can I say?  I had a bad day and decided it was a great time to do my brows. NEVER angry pluck - it&#x27;s like deciding bangs are a *great* idea and cutting them yourself.  Just don&#x27;t.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve been basically drawing on eyebrows for over a year, and had resigned myself to this time consuming morning ritual. To be honest, I had become a bit obsessed about them, hoping they would just start growing again on their own. Turned 40, sparse brows can age you...yada, yada. Obviously, the miracle growth didn&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this product advertised, I was very skeptical.  Magically grow lashes and brows back?  Yeah, sure.  But for $20, what did I really have to lose?  I&#x27;ve spent 5x that on various brow pencils. It&#x27;s been about a week and a half of nightly application, and to my amazement, this morning I see baby hairs growing!  Yay!!  My brows are starting to fill in again!!  Both in that annoying small hole and on the ends!  I mean, I&#x27;m not in Cara Delevigne territory, but it&#x27;s a modest start. Now I will be obsessed with watching them grow back, but I guess everyone needs a hobby.  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it on my lashes too, and without mascara, I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.  With mascara, they are starting to look crazy long, but I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s really good mascara or this stuff making a difference. I will update after the four weeks have passed.  Anyway, if you are an eyebrow obsessive like me, and are thinking about giving it a try, definitely do!  It works.</li>
            <li> I wanted brow enhancing and the product I received says nothing about brows....so I really haven&#x27;t used much at all</li>
            <li> Just started it so can&#x27;t give it an accurate rating as of yet...it takes about a month to notice any change if there is any.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for exactly a month and half.  Didn&#x27;t really have a high expectations, but my eye lashes are really long now!!!!! I started noticing just after a month when I wear mascara, and now  it&#x27;s noticable to others. I did not have any discomfort using the product, besides that i thought it gave me more eye crust in the morning.  I&#x27;m ordering another one.</li>
            <li> Works as well as latisse but less expensive and doesn&#x27;t cause eye irritation</li>
            <li> Great delivered quick been using for a month noticed a real difference in my eyebrows not my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it</li>
            <li> This stuff works amazingly!! I used to use Arbone&#x27;s eyelash conditioner and now I only use Rapidlash!! The difference is amazing!</li>
            <li> At first i notice some result after that it remaines at the first result and didnt improve</li>
            <li> So far so good, about 3-4 weeks using it and it seems like my lashes are a little longer, nothing too dramatic so far cuz I alr had long lashes, but seems to work well</li>
            <li> i like it and would buy it again.. i saw an improvement in the month that i was using it</li>
            <li> I Lost my eye lashes after chemotherapy and this really helped! I just put it on before bed and now They are longer than ever!</li>
            <li> Been using now for several weeks and don&#x27;t see much change.  After trying artificial lashes and losing some of my own in the process, I was hoping for a miracle cure....not so much so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product before at my local beauty salon for quite a bit more money. It works amazingly well and now several of my friends are trying it also!</li>
            <li> Actually no results, I have not seen any improvement.  I have been using it for about two months now.  I would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using since Sept. 2013. My lashes are LONG now. Can&#x27;t say it does as much for the thickness, but I definitely have some new growth. I&#x27;ve always had sparse lashes and I didn&#x27;t expect miracles. I use it on my brows as well and I have new growth there too. This is well worth the price because I JUST finished the first tube (it came 2 to a pack), so it&#x27;s very economical. And here&#x27;s a tip: Since January, I just use it every other day and it&#x27;s still working. I also use the Ardell lash conditioner before mascara (got it here-super cheap!) and I think it prevents my lashes from getting brittle and breaking. So between these 2 products I have lashes again almost like I had in high school. I will definitely order again.  So now it&#x27;s May 2014. I have long, thick lashes ( they finally filled in and got denser). I get comments all the time, but only one asked if I was wearing false lashes. They look natural, long and thick and they&#x27;re staying that way. I still use every other day and pair it with the Ardell everyday. Good Stuff!  PS: It  is now Dec. 2014 and I still have long, thick lashes. Still using it every other day and pairing it with Ardell.</li>
            <li> It works really well I love it I&#x27;m going to order again when I&#x27;m done ....&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need to put fake eye lash anymore</li>
            <li> I am using it for 3 weeks and I am very happy with the results..Surely I will continue buying the product..</li>
            <li> Uh for a second I thought wow this is working but still on the fence. It definitely made my &amp;#34;already there&amp;#34; strands grow longer but as for the bald scarce spots? No</li>
            <li> My girlfriend bought this product through my account, and it&#x27;s her writing this review. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try this serum to attempt to grow back areas of my eyebrows that I subjected to over-plucking in my teen years. I like it, but it&#x27;s a little hard to tell whether it&#x27;s actually making the hair grow, or if it&#x27;s just the fact that I&#x27;ve stopped plucking altogether that&#x27;s allowing the hair to grow. And unfortunately there are patches where the hair just will not grow back, so the serum can&#x27;t work miracles if you&#x27;ve destroyed the follicles. But I figure using the product can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks and I can honestly say I see a difference when I put on my mascara. The lashes are much fuller and longer. And it seems like I have more lashes. You see the difference more with mascara. I put is on every night before I go to sleep, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes either. I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff and is effective for hair grown on her eyelashes and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> it is what I expected</li>
            <li> This product works! I was considering Latisse but didn&#x27;t want to spend that much. I started noticing a difference after using this product for 3-4 weeks. My lashes are now at least twice as full and long and are even darker. See for yourself in my before and after pictures. No makeup or mascara. My eye color looks a little different in the after because I am wearing contact lenses.</li>
            <li> add me to the list of people who have undeniably longer lashes! I noticed NOTHING at first, but kept using it...and after about two months or so I started noticing that when I put on my mascara...my lashes POPPED! At first I thought it was just my imagination or the mascara I was using, but no matter what brand I used, my lashes were there!  Can I go mascara less as I had hoped?  Perhaps more now than ever, although they are not as thick yet as I&#x27;d like them yet, and you wouldn&#x27;t necessarily notice them longer without mascara if you weren&#x27;t paying close attention BUT&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;BUT  I can say they have a very pretty curl now! The tips curl upwards on their own and I&#x27;ve never had that! The difference with my mascara is undeniable! I ABSOLUTELY have longer lashes ...no question!</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews bu this one is worth the praise.  I&#x27;ve had really short lashes my whole life that no amount of mascara could fix.  This isn&#x27;t an eyelash product where you layer on different coats of product lengthen lashes.  I put a line around my eyelash line at night and after a few weeks noticed that my eyelashes were definitely longer.  I had no side effects, no discoloration, or irritation.  This product is perfect.</li>
            <li> I definitely noticed growth in the length of my eyelashes.  Not so much in fullness or in darkness of them, but hey that&#x27;s what mascara is for.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and I didn&#x27;t have any burning or other side effects.  Overall I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable product!!  It really does what it promises!!  I&#x27;ve never had lashes this long in all of my 45 years!  It took about 3-4 weeks to notice, but WOW!!  You WILL notice a difference.  I highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past few years.  It works.  As I have gotten older, I noticed my lashes thinning out.  This has helped to reverse the process and keeps lashes from thinning for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about 4 weeks.  I do notice some growth, but not as much as I had hoped for.  I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Two things that may be the reason are my age (65) and also the Serum sent to me had a date of 2012 on it.  I&#x27;m not sure&lt;br /&gt;it is as effective because of this.</li>
            <li> I had extensions removed and they trashed my eye lashes. After using Rapid Lash for about a week my lashes looked visibly thicker &amp; fuller. Daily use for two months and I look like I have extensions but it&#x27;s my real lashes. Paired w/ &amp;#34;they&#x27;re real&amp;#34; mascara from Ulta beautiful lashes little effort</li>
            <li> I bought this and did an experiment for a month.  I only used it on one eye.  No difference from what I could see.</li>
            <li> So this is a first time writing a review. So I lost most of my lashes with the individual glued-ones. I&#x27;ve never been one to care about my lashes until now so I purchased this because I saw all the reviews on YouTube. I have to say that it does work because I just started using this product like less than a week. This Sunday, I went to an event and I put on mascara something I don&#x27;t even  bother with and my lashes looked so long that I was shocked. My eyes looked totally different with long lashes so I was very happy with the results and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> It doesnt work at all! Waste of money! I dont recommend this product. I was very disapointed with it. :(</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months and I see no difference at all. No bad side effects either, but not positive impact at all.</li>
            <li> Went through menopause and I started noticing that my brows were getting a little thinner. My lashes were shrinking to nothing....lashes were both thinner and shorter. No type of mascara would make my lashes look any better. I started using Rapid Lash in February. It took about 8 weeks to really start seeing the change. The results are not dramatic like with Latisse but that is fine with me. I used Latisse and I hated the reddish brown discoloring of my skin above my top lashes. I like that you can use Rapid Lash on both brows and all lashes and no skin discoloration! I am sure to use my Rapid Lash everyday. I consider it one of my best daily beauty rituals. I put it on brows and top and bottom lashes. Now when I wear mascara, my lashes look long and lush. My brows look darker and thicker as well. I know that Latisse takes 16 weeks to see full effects so I am thinking I will continue to see some more improvements over the next 6 weeks. If I do, I will update my review.</li>
            <li> I had eyelash extensions for the past couple of months. I decided that I didn&#x27;t want to get them anymore because of the maintenance and cost. The eyelash extensions ruined my eyelashes and broke/made most of them fall out. I decided to use Rapidlash to attempt to grow them back. After 2 weeks of using it day and night, they were growing back! Fast forward to today (about 2 months after purchasing) my lashes are strong, long and thicker than before. Love this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an experienced user of different brands of lash growth serum, and a huge advocate because they&#x27;ve all worked! Not only did this one not work, I only got the bad &amp;#34;side effects&amp;#34; which is darker and sensitized eyelids and loss of lashes.</li>
            <li> It really does work.. I had thinning eyelashes and now I can see them. i will use this stuff for as long as they make it and its way way less money than the prescription eye lash enhancer. Way to go!!!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product.  I can&#x27;t swear that it made my lashes grow, but it DOES strengthen them.  It might even make them fuller (I can&#x27;t judge based on my own eyes and I didn&#x27;t take photos before starting this product), but I honestly think it strengthens them and makes any product you place on your lashes much more effective.  I will happily repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are definitely longer that before. I also use it on my eyebrows. I recommend this product. Very east to use</li>
            <li> -0 would of been my review. As soon as I&#x27;m got this item, I look for the expiration date. I&#x27;ve read a lot of customers have had expired items sent to them. My item expired on 12/13 today&#x27;s date is 6-24-14. Ii said maybe they did a mistake and they will exchange my item for a unexpired one but when I clicked on the return button it said THIS ITEM  IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR RETURNS. if I would of gotten an exchange I wouldn&#x27;t have left a negative return.</li>
            <li> I have tried revita lash before and that serum was a miracle. I was skeptical about this one since I haven&#x27;t tried it and it was much cheaper on Amazon but it made my lashes super LONG!! after 3 weeks or so and after using this for a few months now they are still very long. At first I used the serum twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. Then I started using it once at night and now I use it a couple times a week and my lashes are still strong and long.</li>
            <li> i had been looking for eye lash growth products, this fits the bill to start with. after reading reviews, some said it worked, i belong to that category. i started using this for a week, nightly, once a day use as indicated in the box instruction. i have seen my lashes start to curl bc it&#x27;s growing longer at the tip. also i noticed new growths, i thought this is like fertilizer or miracle gro for the eye lashes. i cant wait for it to grow even longer.. or somebosy to notice the difference. like what i sadi it&#x27;s only been one week. but i thought i would write about this discovery of a product that works.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are much fuller and darker. They are closer to my idea of perfection. :)</li>
            <li> I read the reviews carefully after I bought this eyelash serum.  I&#x27;ve been using it daily for well over a month with no discernible results--only the dark circles under my eyes have gotten worse.  My advice to those reading the reviews before buying the product: believe only the &amp;#34;purchase verified&amp;#34; ones.</li>
            <li> Ok.. By now not enough time to judge</li>
            <li> Horrible Product - past expiration - and burned my eyes - need to take off Amazon.</li>
            <li> I used this product for over a month and can&#x27;t say I see added fullness or length. I have noticed less lash loss. I used Lilash in the past and that stuff REALLY works, wish I could find the old version before they changed formula.</li>
            <li> Made my lashes fall out, would of loved to get a refund&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT TAKE THE RISK :(</li>
            <li> The one I received was empty. i shacked and put it upside down, but nothing came out, very odd.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it was a manufacturing error?</li>
            <li> I tried an expensive brand from upscale store that didn&#x27;t work. I took it back. I tried this years ago and this one worked to make brows grow. So bought this again and it&#x27;s slowly growing brows back.</li>
            <li> This works...I don&#x27;t know how but it does.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a few days, and have noticed my eyelids are a gross bright pink/red color there is not itchiness but I do not like it and it lasts all day everyday every since I started.  As well as this a friend of mine says her eyelashes fell out a week after use.  I do not like the reviews and dangerous side effects I have read about this product and am afraid to continue use.  Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Makes lashes soft and easier when applying mascara.i use it on my eyebrows too.</li>
            <li> What else can I say? I didn&#x27;t have any eyebrows. AND NOW I DO! EXCELLENT!</li>
            <li> It takes around 4 weeks before you start to see the growth, and sure enough I got long lashes.  At first, it felt a little irritating on my lash line and I used it every other night until I got use to it.  Need to apply every night for best results.  Several of my friends got on it too because of my lashes.</li>
            <li> I used one bottle (maybe 2?) and I did not notice a difference at all.  Latisse worked but was too expensive so I stopped using it.  And NO your eyelashes don&#x27;t fall out if you stop using Latisse.  People who think that are too gullible.  Duh!  Anyway, I don&#x27;t think any product besides Latisse will actually grow your lashes.  I have used the Loreal Paris lash serum with the blue lid, gold middle and clear bottom and the Rimmel London Lash accelerator serum with the lime green metallic lid, gold middle and clear tube.  I like both but neither actually grew my lashes.  I think it moisturizes your lashes so they don&#x27;t fall out maybe? So now I use the DHC eyelash tonic with aloe at night and under my mascara.  It moisturizes them so they don&#x27;t fall out and break off.  I would not recommend you waste your money on the Rapidlash but if you are like me, you will want to try it for yourself anyway so good luck to you!</li>
            <li> People think I have false eyelashes on. Great results and I have only used it for the time they recommended and my eyelashes are still full. No more skimpy eyelashes!</li>
            <li> This is a review after my wife tried this for a month.&lt;br /&gt;It does not grow lashes&lt;br /&gt;It does not do anything but waste time, hope and money..&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t have any side effects or real effects.</li>
            <li> I cleaned off my make-up each night and applied as directed. I&#x27;ve tried it and unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 6 weeks, can&#x27;t see any visible result&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use and hope it works as they promise.</li>
            <li> I am not an allergic person but this stuff caused a reaction and I had to stop using it. A waste of money because I had ordered TWO.</li>
            <li> I am so surprised this works as well as it does, I was nervous that I was going to waste my money. I have used Revitalash Conditioner in the past but i got tired of spending $130 for it.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Rapidlash now for 2 weeks and my lashes almost hit my eyebrows if I open my eyes so my lashes rest on my eyelids. It took over 45 days for Revitalash to start working.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy I made a good buy on this one!! Whew!!&lt;br /&gt;So for the price this is great, just hope they don&#x27;t catch on start charging more...&lt;br /&gt;I do think with these products it works differently with people&#x27;s chemistry makeup. If you are healthy and take vitamins it will work faster. My friend uses this (that&#x27;s how I heard of it) she was so shocked how fast it started to work for me. She said it took her about a month to really notice. But she is a smoker and smoking blocks the absorption of vitamins and minerals. Plus, the smoke coats her lashes or may be burning them... not sure.</li>
            <li> Works great but you have to be patient and your lashes show improvement after about three weeks.  Best price out there.</li>
            <li> Purchased from a dermatologist office and product worked great and lasted a month or so. Purchased this product through Amazon and do not see results with use and also tube has very little in it. I have to push the wand towards the sides to get the product on the tip. Not impressed at all! Expensive little tube with little product and little results! Maybe this is a knock off, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> when i first tried it, it burned my eyes like hell, and the second day my eyes were red for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i stopped it for couple of days and used it again, but this time no burning &amp; no redness in my eyes, that is because i was careful not to put the solution inside my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you do use it constantly, you will see the results within 14 - 20 days.</li>
            <li> my lashes and brows started getting full only within 2-3 weeks and I thought it would take 6 weeks. now, ill have to put this on auto-order since I cant live w/out!</li>
            <li> Not as effective as Latisse. But if you use it religiously ( I put mine next to my toothbrush!) you will see results!!! It&#x27;s now much more fun to apply mascara!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product nightly for 5 weeks and i can tell a difference in my lashes. I recommend this product if you are looking to give your lashes a boost.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t be dissapointed</li>
            <li> It REALLY works!  I seldom write any reviews but I would write one for RapidLash!  I&#x27;m Asian so my lashes are short, straight and thin.  I think this stuff worked after the first use!  I noticed my lashes were longer after the FIRST USE!  Now, it&#x27;s been 2 weeks, my lashes are definitely much longer and thicker! It&#x27;s amazing! One thing to note however, you will get eye irritation if you get the serum inside your eyes. Make sure your eyelids are free of other creams/chemical as well, since the serum would react with some eye creams that could result in redness and irritations.</li>
            <li> At first I really like this item however I realize fairly quickly that if I&#x27;m not constantly applying this item my eyelashes do not stay long I realize that biologically that seems almost impossible but it&#x27;s the truth after two weeks of not applying this year him after I ran out my eyelashes were exactly the same way they were prior to using the product. Please note that if you want this product be prepared to use it long term</li>
            <li> It thickens the hair you have, but it doesn&#x27;t regrow your eyebrows</li>
            <li> Rapidlash works I have been using the product for 2 weeks and have noticed longer and thicker lashes.  Have used other products like City Lash with modest results but this stuff really does work.  For the price I thought I&#x27;d try it sure am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Asian girl. I have just used it for two days. But it seems not suitable for me. I don&#x27;t know if I put too much on or something else. The next morning there will be small, white, dry pieces on my eye. It&#x27;s like gum in the eye. And my eyes felt very dry and hurt alot. And I even see that the place I put on this product is red and my eye felt uncomfortable. I have to stop using it, cause I&#x27;m afraid it will irritate my eye.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 yrs and love the results.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I can see my eyelash is growing! I&#x27;m gonna get another one!</li>
            <li> Works! I&#x27;m an impatient person but you can definitely see quick results with this product. If applying to eyebrows, but sure to pluck off any outside hairs that are unwanted after overnight growth. Looks ten times better. Great product! Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I would not even purchase this again.  I have used it all up and there is no difference.  I had high hopes for this but sorry to say it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I tried to like this product, but my eyes became dry and scratchy after 1 week. I took a couple of days off and started again, but that didn&#x27;t seem to help. I re-read instructions and was careful not to get the product in my eyes. Still didn&#x27;t help. I also learned that buying from Amazon means you can&#x27;t return the product. Buying directly from the manufacturer or distributors may allow it. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> Have used it for a while now- no difference to my lashes. No side effects either- no redness or burning. Just nothing.... won&#x27;t buy again. I wasted my money on this one.</li>
            <li> But be careful: I put some on the bottom lashes and hair UNDER the eye area grew on my cheeks! So of course, I stopped. But I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
            <li> This product made my eyes very itchy and I will not be able to use it for that reason. This product not good for me.</li>
            <li> I refuse to spend the amount of money it costs to purchase Latisse or one of the other, very expensive lash growth products on the market, but I really wanted to try something to get my lashes a little longer and a little thicker.  I purchased Rapidlash in November and noticed a difference within a month!  I apply it once per night, and I am still using my second tube in May, so I&#x27;d say it lasts a fair amount of time.  I would say the difference is subtle, but enough that I will continue to purchase it.  For the price, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> It takes some time to see results,but it does work. Be patient.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this serum was going to give me incredibly full and thick lashes. OK, maybe I was asking too much, but this serum has definitely made my eyelashes longer. They aren&#x27;t crazy scary long, but definitely longer than they were. My eyelashes seem to get tangled a bit now, so putting on mascara is a little more difficult. But, the end product is pretty impressive. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 months (3-5 nights per week), and noticed a difference within the first month. A few people have commented on my lashes, but I do believe it is noticeable. My daughter (14) who is infatuated with lashes (she spends more time on her lashes than her hair!) has commented a few times that my lashes are so long. I haven&#x27;t told her that I&#x27;m using the serum (bc 1, she&#x27;d probably try stealing it from me and 2, I don&#x27;t think she needs the product so young). I&#x27;m curious and a little afraid of what will happen to my lashes if I stop using the serum. Now, if this serum could make my eyelashes thicker (or more plentiful), it would be worth its weight in gold. The Amazon price was approximately 45% less expensive than what I saw at the store. I&#x27;ll purchase it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> some sort of crystals form after it dries on the lid margins and eyelashes&lt;br /&gt;I expected more liquid inside the containers; applying it twice a day, the entire container did not last 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom who has short eyelashes and shaved her brows as a teenager. This works phenomenally well for both and she has noticed a very significant difference. Amazon had the best deal.</li>
            <li> No stars is what this product deserve because it was expired...</li>
            <li> The product was expired before it even arrived to house!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slow process but I&#x27;ve noted my lashes are longer and worked really fast on the brows</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this product, I used it as described but it didn&#x27;t follow through on its claims. The only reason I gave it any stars was because I think it was conditioning, however there was no increase in length or thickness at all. Very disappointing .</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff. I purchase it on a regular basis. I have sensitive skin and often have allergic reactions to beauty products but not this. My eyelashes are so much longer than they used to be. I don&#x27;t need to wear as much eye make-up as I used to. It is one of the best beauty products to use!</li>
            <li> Did not really work for me.  Used for 2+ months straight every night.  I am finishing the tube, I think there are no results or if so, it is so marginal that I cannot tell the difference.  There is a lot of work involved... imagine having to put on eyeliner every night before you go to bed.  and for no results, for 10 weeks etc.  Also, I started to do the bottom lashes but my eyes got a little red and irritated when I did that for a week- my daughter asked me if I had been crying.  So I am only doing the top now and finishing the tube... but like I said, did not work for me.  Not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been consistently applying the serum as instructed. I have uneven thin Asian lashes, but this serum not only increases my length, but it thickens it which makes it look like I am wearing false lashes after I applied mascara. After two weeks, I notice the difference. There is a product out there for everyone...some may work on others, but won&#x27;t work on you and vice versa. The best way is to do your research and try it out. I did my research for about 3 weeks before settling on this one and I&#x27;m glad I did. I will not say I highly recommend this because the affect varies from person to person. I do, however think it&#x27;s worth the shot. Good luck guys!</li>
            <li> It DOES lengthen lashes, it really, really does.  SIGNIFICANTLY.  Mine didn&#x27;t show any change until the 8-week mark.  Be aware; this product does NOT grow additional lashes or thicken existing lashes, but it does make the ones you have grown longer.  I have the finest, thinnest, sparshes lashes and this product helps make my lashes look so much better (with the help of mascara).  You gotta keep it up to, no slacking.</li>
            <li> not sure - my lashes look a bit longer but still waiting for them to look a good bit longer</li>
            <li> This product more than lived up to my expectations</li>
            <li> Very difficult to apply with the tiny brush and also almost impossible to load onto the brush. There doesn&#x27;t appear to be much liquid at all in the bottle and seems to be very expensive for the quantity received.</li>
            <li> So far this product is working great.</li>
            <li> i have been using it for a month now and i definitely see a difference in my eyelashes. they are longer and a little darker, but they did not get thicker. still i love the results i got. the instructions say to apply the product on the top lid lashes, in doing this i also put the product on the bottom side of my top lid lashes (if you can stand to get some in your eye). i pretty much smothered the product all over my lash line and my lashes. even doing this for 30 days i still have a TON left over. give the product time to do its job, because you wont see it in the first week.</li>
            <li> Oh yea it works longer grows brows also love this product just have to keep using it no fake lashes for me or extensions to break my own lashes great product works like the prescription products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this religiously every night for about 6 weeks now and I&#x27;ve seen very slight results. I&#x27;m not super impressed, but it has made a little bit of improvement.</li>
            <li> Thrilled to find an affordable lash enhancer that works. I&#x27;ve experienced no side-effects; only fabulous lashes. Started seeing positive results in just a few weeks. With Rapidlash, my lashes are darker, more plentiful, longer, and the growth comes through with a natural curl, unlike other more expensive products I&#x27;ve tried that result in rogue lashes that make me look like the leader of the Droogs in A Clockwork Orange. Started using it on my brows recently and I&#x27;m eagerly awaiting the results. Recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is very good and gives quick results</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work at all. I used it faithfully. I bought three tubes. It burns like crazy. No improvement in lashes. Going to get the prescription from a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Works great! I put this on every night. Noticeable difference after about one week</li>
            <li> I only used this product for two nights because it made the skin around my eyes red!  Maybe I am just sensitive to an ingredient, but I will no longer use this AND it is not returnable!  Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference. Waste of money</li>
            <li> Product prob works but would wake up the red sensative eyes the couple times I tried it....cant finish bottle so feel as tho i&#x27;ve wasted $</li>
            <li> IT WORKS!  MY EYELASHES ARE A LOT LONGER AND A LITTLE THICKER. IT&#x27;S WONDERFUL TO BUY SOMETHING AND HAVE IT ACTUALLY DO WHAT IT SAYS. I BOUGHT MY DAUGHTER ONE AND IT WORKED EVEN BETTER FOR HER.</li>
            <li> This stuff works!  My eyelashes grow like crazy, but I have to use it every night.  That&#x27;s the only down side.</li>
            <li> Ana A - that&#x27;s when it was made. The product is good til last day of January 2015. I had same problem.  I called &amp; they explained the #&#x27;s on box to me. I was told alot of people have called because of it. You can go to website &amp; see it.</li>
            <li> This stuff lasts FOREVER and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. My lashes don&#x27;t look super long, but they seem much stronger, healthier, and aren&#x27;t falling out so they are definately growing longer.</li>
            <li> It really works, I was skeptical at first but the product proved itself with no problems</li>
            <li> I have seen extreme growth on both my upper and lower lashes, This product really works it actually grow your lashes. So long and goodbye to fake lashes.</li>
            <li> It started working about 8 weeks after purchase so I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product in the past and it takes about 2 weeks to see results but the product lasts 3-5 months</li>
            <li> The first week into using this product my lashes darkened, the second week my lashes started to fill in, by the third week i started noticing the length was becoming longer And by the end of the fourth week my lashes were looking more volumous, longer and darker just as advertised. I absolutely love this product and plan to continue using it until i reach my desired results! one tube lasted me two months, i have purchased my second tube and can&#x27;t wait to see even better results!! This stuff is not a joke, i&#x27;ve recommended this to all my girlfriends with short lashes.  I&#x27;ve posted a picture of my one month mark results, on day one you can see how i barely had any lashes from excessive use of fake eyelashes, on day 30 i did apply one coat of mascara so you can see the length much better. I hope this helps everyone who&#x27;s looking to enhance their lashes!! i LOVE the product, it really works! :)</li>
            <li> Works the same if not better than Grande Lash. Great to save $$</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any development with my lashes yet. I will still try it ....then let you know ....</li>
            <li> Does not grow or thicken lashes - complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> For the price this is a great product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and have had great results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using a couple of days, but I think I&#x27;m noticing hair growth. Will continue use.</li>
            <li> After 6 months of use, I can confirm this does absolutely nothing. If you&#x27;re looking for a product like this, go to a dermatologist and get a script for Latisse. That stuff works great, fast, and with noticable results!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year now and am very pleased with the results.  I stopped using it for about a month at one point and definitely noticed the difference in my eyelash length and strength.  I use it every night and my eyelashes look full, long and healthy.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product, but decided to give it a try anyway because of the price.  I&#x27;ve used it every night for six weeks and can&#x27;t really see much of a difference.  When I put on my mascara, it seems that some of the lashes seem a bit longer, but it&#x27;s very negligible.  I&#x27;m remaining hopeful, however, and will continue to use it until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> Excellent it works,,,,,thank you. actually I didn&#x27;t believed it at the beginning but after 1 month I saw the result :)</li>
            <li> I had great results from Revitalash and then it was changed  to a much less effective formula. Rapidlash is even worse. No appreciable results after many weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to rate. I think it&#x27;s starting to work but need to us&lt;br /&gt;e the product a little longer to see results.</li>
            <li> I bought this 5 months ago. It really works in making the lashes longer. The only thing I was disappointed with is it didn&#x27;t make my lashes thicker.</li>
            <li> when dry it leaves a crust</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this pretty faithfully for about 3 months now and see almost N-O change. :( I used Latisse and it worked much MUCH better. (I think I saw results w/in 2 weeks w/that one! Sigh, if only it weren&#x27;t 4 x the cost! Anyway, this I would skip and actually put the $$ towards a product that&#x27;s more likely to actually WORK!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for almost 1 year and had to stop just recently. It began to work in 4 weeks and the results were excellent. My eye lashes grew longer and darker. I was very happy until I noticed that this product stopped working in about 8 months. I kept using it anyway for another month and now discontinued completely because of no growth at all. My eye lashes went to my regular short length and I lost a few more of them then usual. I am very upset about it and wish I would of known about this side effect in advance. This company lost a loyal customer for life.&lt;br /&gt; So, do not count on your beautiful eye lashed for no longer then 6-8 months! Your carriage will turn into a pumpkin sooner then you hope....</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last two months but not regularly and still noticed a pretty big difference they are longer but not so much fuller yet I barely ever wear makeup so I think that helps make them healthier</li>
            <li> I have never written a review for any product but just had to for this one. It has significantly grown my lashes and just made them overall a better and fuller shape. I was skeptical at first but results really did begin to show within about 4 weeks. Just be patient and you will love the results. My holy grail product. :)</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for this product, I decided to give it a try. This stuff works!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month and my upper and lower lashes are visibly longer. You can&#x27;t go wrong with giving this product a try! After all ladies, we all deserve to look fabulous.</li>
            <li> It seems to work.  Lashes are considerably longer fairly quickly.  Unlike Latisse, my eyes are not left discolored and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and works wonderfully</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. Lashes held mascara better. Not the dramatic results advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about 8 weeks into using this on a nightly basis, and I can say that I am very happy with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little hesitant after reading some negative reviews, but I guess whenever there are thousands of people using a project, statistically, there will always be some negative ones. My biggest concern were reviews about the product causing eye irritation, darkening pigmentation of the skin where the product is applied, and eyelashes falling out. Everyone&#x27;s body can react differently to the same product, so I understood there was a chance I could fall under the minority of people who had adverse reactions to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started noticing a difference in my lashes about 4 weeks in. Nothing super apparent, but I could tel they were a little longer. 6 weeks in, I noticed it more, and now, at 8 weeks, they are definitely longer than they were pre-rapidlash! I don&#x27;t think its dramatic enough that another would notice, but it&#x27;s does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note: Rapidlash did lengthen my lashes, but it did not make them thicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m korean-american and this serum does nothing for me. It supposedly works wonders on my white(irish/german) friend though.</li>
            <li> I read many beauty blogs and this was recommended on more than one.  I first starting using Rapidlash a couple years ago when it wasn&#x27;t as easy to find as it is now (I have even seen it in Costco at times). This stuff works!  I noticed my eyelashes weren&#x27;t as full as they used to be so I researched products that might help.  I decided on this one.  It took a few months to see the results but it works!  I had a woman coworker come up to me one day and ask me if I was wearing false eyelashes!  I have never worn false eyelashes simply because I have never needed to.  I always had long full lashes but the older we get we know this doesn&#x27;t last forever (I wish I had appreciated all these little things when I was young).  With all that being said, I do feel like you reach a point where it doesn&#x27;t seem to continue to work.  I still use it to keep the results that I have but I don&#x27;t feel like it works like it did when I first began using it.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous when i saw on the package that it was only studied on like 45  people.  but after about 6 weeks i noticed a difference in my eye lashes.  After about 3 I had new eye brow hair and so I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would like to preface that I am the stereotypical Asian that has short, stumpy, straight eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the first week, I found this to cause some itchiness around my eyes. I would say it was a bit annoying, but it wasn&#x27;t unbearable. That said, I persisted and used it fairly consistently, probably 4X a week based on my laziness. I would say there were truly noticeable results after two months. Prior to using this, my eyelashes were never really a feature in my eye makeup, it was more so the eyeliner that made an impact. Now, the eyelashes (with mascara) make all the difference in the world in my makeup look. I have had numerous friends and my mother ask if I was using fake lashes. They aren&#x27;t theatrically long, but they are naturally and NOTICEABLY long, and very flattering.I also found it effective for regrowing the tail of my eyebrows. Finally, I have seen no problems with dark stains left behind due to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it a chance. As long as you aren&#x27;t one of those reviewers who experience extreme irritation, a bit of early stage itchiness is worth the results, especially for the price. The tube is lasting me well beyond 4 months.</li>
            <li> Rapidlash needs to change it&#x27;s products name! There was nothing rapid with it&#x27;s results! It took 2 months to see any results (which were barely noticeable). You can&#x27;t wear this under makeup as it leaves a crusty film where you apply it. Don&#x27;t ever get it in your eye! Burns like crazy! Rapid lash didn&#x27;t help with any lash fall out either. Also whatever results you have don&#x27;t last! As soon as you stop using Rapidlash, somehow your lashes go back to your normal length. - Bottom line is. Save your money and don&#x27;t put this chemical on your eyelashes. Better off using something natural. Like some oils (castor, olive oil, coconut, etc.). You&#x27;ll get better faster results, your lashes won&#x27;t shed as much and your results lasts!</li>
            <li> seems to work ok after a couple of weeks with constant use</li>
            <li> Used daily, works great.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about this product is the amount in the container.  I have purchased this product several times and sometimes it last for a month or two. This time very little in container.  Product works really well if you get enough in container to last at least a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> i notice som growth, not a lot</li>
            <li> it is 2 weeks for me till now i didn&#x27;t see diference i will wait till i finish it then i will desided if it good or not cuz it needs time</li>
            <li> I have deep set eyes with short spindly eyelashes &amp; saw a big enough improvement to make me want to continue  purchasing this. My lashes are thicker &amp; longer - no adverse effects.  I&#x27;ve been using Rapidlash for a about a yr. &amp; unless they change their formula or I suddenly develop a negative reaction, I plan to keep using it.</li>
            <li> i purchased this after I tried lash extension and didn&#x27;t like them. Let me mention , I do have good lashes, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I live in South Korea and they are HUGE on lashes here, kinda funny. I used it every night for a month and one day realized my lashes were darker and longer, which is great because I am a blonde. I noticed it most when I was using my eye lash curler. I couldn&#x27;t believe it actually worked! I am serious, it really does work. I am going to purchase my next tubs next week. Although the I am going on month 2 and have plenty left.</li>
            <li> Works great. Just as good as latisse</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical, but I do see improvement in the fullness of the eye lashes and I am using it every other day now (after 3-4 weeks of every day).  I have only seen minimal improvement for the eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I can tell that my eyelashes are longer. It does actually work after a few weeks of routine use.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. I use it mainly for the eyebrows &amp; I don&#x27;t see any difference on my brows.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see improvement</li>
            <li> Been using it for about 3 years now. Had short, super sparse lashes. Experienced some itching and mild redness initially for only about a week when I started using it. Took about a month to notice some obvious changes. Boy, changes were OBVIOUS! People do mistake me for wearing falsies when I&#x27;m wearing mascara. It did give me a slight curl to some of my lashes, but I do use lash curler. Have tried few different brands looking for &amp;#34;something better&amp;#34;, but so far others failed to beat the performance and the price of this one. Recommended.</li>
            <li> My lashes didn&#x27;t really grow long, but they are better than before.</li>
            <li> This item really works</li>
            <li> I have been diligently using this serum for my eyelashes. I am blonde with blue eyes and my lashes are blonde. This product has made them not only longer, but they are dark lashes. You can see them without mascara for the first time. When I apply mascara it is amazing. I did not have any dark line on where I have applied the serum for the lashes as I did with another brand, nor did I experience any itchiness. It is amazing product and I will purchase again. I will be trying this out on a friend for her eye brows since she has lost some of them.</li>
            <li> In just a few weeks my eyelashes are thicker and longer.... I have lost my lashes since I have been going through menopause.  I was so discouraged since I hate using so much mascara. Now I put just a little mascara and my lashes look so natural... love this Serum!!!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for 4 years on and off mostly on , but take breaks to get full effect again when restarting. Now it&#x27;s not  false lash expectations but realist expectation, with product I would say gives your lashes a extra 40% thicker and 20% darker. You should see results in a week, assuming you don&#x27;t get lazy and not follow instructions, wash your makeup off every night!! And put product on and it well do its job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a long time.  Have probably re ordered 4-5 times.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> excellent and in the time</li>
            <li> This product It&#x27;s really work. My lashes got longer and stronger. I noticed the results after 1 month when my friends start giving me compliments on my long lashes. I didn&#x27;t realized they are already changed because i was expecting it will happen after 2 or 3 months. I have sensitive skin and blue eyes and i don&#x27;t have any of side effects. I recommend it</li>
            <li> Has made my lashes longer! Not so much thicker. When I use mascara my lashes look amazing. I just wish they got thicker...I use it twice a day. I started applying it closer to my eyelid. So hopefully that makes a difference. Otherwise very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying this product to my upper and lower lashes every night and even some mornings for at least 3 months now, and my eyelashes are about as short and thin as they were when I first started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it three stars because for the price it&#x27;s certainly lasted me a while, especially given how often I apply it. also, when I wear it in place of mascara, it&#x27;s lighter, not clumpy, and gives the appearance of *slightly* longer and fuller lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;maybe it works for some, but not for me. I think I&#x27;ll just start taking hair &amp; nail vitamins again and hope that helps.</li>
            <li> This stuff really really works!  Double the length and strength, and thickness! I&#x27;m running low, gonna buy asap.  BTW  I have not had any issues of my lashes all falling out, so might be a personal problem.  And I still got the results I wanted even with missing days.  That&#x27;s just how it worked for me.  I maybe use it once or twice a week now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this product my self but my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a day, so not sure how well it works.  I am hoping to regrow my eyebrows and lengthen my lashes.  It did seem as if the lashes seemed longer, but I can&#x27;t imagine I would see results in 24 hours.</li>
            <li> truly helps your lashes grow long</li>
            <li> Amazing product but it gets finished fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using rapid lash for about 2 years now. Only thing i use! This stuff works amazing! I get so many compliments on my lashes.</li>
            <li> Have used this for 3 weeks..big difference in lashes.</li>
            <li> I would say this product is okay. I have noticed minimal changes in my eyelash length/thickness. But I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try. I also bought this for my mom to use on her eyebrows and she hasn&#x27;t seen any growth. So based off our experiences I would say it works better for growing your eyelashes vs brows.</li>
            <li> This rapid lash works if you continue to use it which I don&#x27;t do often enough.  I actually use it to clear up some dry skin that occasionally starts developing on my eyelid at the lash line.  It works to condition that skin very quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars on the off chance it will be better if I use it longer. But after 4 weeks I don&#x27;t see any improvement. I&#x27;ve used the product before and had success. I read that they have changed the formula. The new formula is no improvement.  Change for the sake of change is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It really works! I already had long eyelashes but this made them so much more voluminous! I totally Recommend it!</li>
            <li> Should insist on using a little effect? But it is not recommended to use on the eyebrows, because of too little, it took me two weeks has gone. And the brush head is too small, does not apply to brow!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about this product, but IT DOES WORK!!! you just have to be consistent with it. But my lashes are definately longer now after 3 weeks of using it nightly.</li>
            <li> I feel nothing and I see no changes in my lashes.  Going back to another brand.</li>
            <li> I have been using this since July, it is now March and my first tube just ran out! It definitely took me longer to see results and I honestly didn&#x27;t feel like it was working until 2 months after my first use. That&#x27;s when relatives started commenting on my lashes, asking what kind of mascara I was using because my lashes were looking long! You have to very patient with it and use it as directed. Don&#x27;t expect fast results, it&#x27;s a slow process but worth it. I don&#x27;t ever plan to stop using this!</li>
            <li> So glad I finally decided to purchase this product! My best friend has been using it for years, and I finally decided to try it for myself! My eyelashes have already gotten so much longer and thicker in just two weeks! I can&#x27;t wait to see what they will look like in a couple of months!</li>
