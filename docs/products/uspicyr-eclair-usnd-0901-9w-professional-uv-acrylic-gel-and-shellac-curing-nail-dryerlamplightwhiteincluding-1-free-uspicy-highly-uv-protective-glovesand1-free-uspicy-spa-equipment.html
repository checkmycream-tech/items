            <li>It&#x27;s a great light.</li>
            <li>Great thing is I can change my nails as often as I want for free.</li>
            <li>I knew before I bought it that it doesn&#x27;t have a built in timer, but a cheap timer works great</li>
            <li>BUT WHAT A VALUE IS ALL I CAN SAY GREAT COMPANY SHIPPED FAST EVERYTHING WORKS JUST GREAT.</li>
            <li>The accessories were really nice for a one time use.</li>
            <li>Loved it works like it said couldn&#x27;t be more pleases.  </li>
            <li>I can do my own nails, and decided to use gel nail products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen this in saloons, always wanted to do my nails in comfort of my own home and still feel like its been done professionally.&lt;br /&gt;Cool</li>
            <li>If you do your own nails</li>
            <li>You will need to set your own timer to know when your nails are cured, then hit the off button after set amount of time.</li>
            <li>Really nice the gloves being included so</li>
            <li>It was a nice change.</li>
            <li>I was provided this sample in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this is a MUST HAVE for all you who do your own nails.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a machine that will be so handy</li>
            <li>I purchased this UV lamp to make my own cabochons not for gel nail.</li>
            <li>I find the gloves nice, but cumbersome.</li>
            <li>This would make a nice gift.</li>
            <li>My fingers didn&#x27;t even get warm after being under the machine for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>And it comes with a pair of protective fingerless gloves and a nail filer which are a nice gift ( freebies are always nice).</li>
            <li>She likes to do her own nails</li>
            <li>After receiving this wonderful gift, I went straight to the store and got me some Gelish nail polish to try out with this baby.</li>
            <li>I received this item from the company, and was asked to give my honest review within 10 days.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item to do my own shellac mani&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>i really liked it.</li>
            <li>nail dryer, its a nice size, just like the ones in the salon&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lamp came packaged nicely with a nail file and uv protection gloves.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice weight and sturdy feel to it.  </li>
            <li>I did my own nails with this</li>
            <li>Works nice with my gel products.</li>
            <li>Used this once and liked it.  </li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s kind of my way of Zen-ing out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I even made an account to comment on how awesome she is and to wish her warm toes every night for writing it. :)</li>
            <li>It is so nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice that it comes with anti UV gloves and a nail file.</li>
            <li>Nicely priced..</li>
            <li>so affordable and comes in handy for at&lt;br /&gt;Home</li>
            <li>Easy to use for my own mani and pedis!</li>

            <li>Worth every penny, works well and very cute!</li>
            <li>I bought this uv light and resived an update for a vogue one and works good</li>
            <li>So far has worked perfectly!</li>
            <li>I looking forward to seeing if I can make my nails as nice as they do in the nail salon :)</li>
            <li>so I have done my best to be honest and objective.</li>
            <li>Very cute lamp good practice to get comfortable and in good condition with all the accessories I recommend Haunted has worked very well ...</li>
            <li>The dryer came before the date they stated, which is aways great, and it cures my uv polish and makes my nails pretty and shiny.</li>
            <li>Works great, fast delivery!</li>
            <li>and he explained to me that samples do not come with the gloves, but when you purchase it they come with gloves which is very important to wear, and use sunscreen to protect your hands against the UV</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use, effective.  </li>
            <li>The dryer came super duper fast and everything works perfectly.</li>

            <li>AND HAS SAVED MY WIFE LOTS OF PRECIOUS TIME.</li>
            <li>JUST MAKE SURE</li>
            <li>This unit is perfect for me and I am able to achieve the same salon look.</li>
            <li>I find the results of the UV lamp are better than the LED.</li>
            <li>Also to note again the lightbulb does not come pre-installed so make sure you put the bulb in before use to avoid believing that it is defective.</li>
            <li>Overall my sister and cousins were very happy with this product and remember to have all safeties in place when using any product like this!</li>

            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad my friend bought me this for my birthday</li>
            <li>The included glove and nail file are really cute also.</li>
            <li>And I love the skin protecting gloves.</li>
            <li>I love your product and I will buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li>Works fast and goes a great job of curing nails.</li>
            <li>I love painting my nails, I also have 3 girls</li>
            <li>Make sure you turn the device off when not in use, When changing the bulbs also make sure the device is off,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this UV nail dryer.  </li>
            <li>Its really cute and doesn&#x27;t take up alot of space.</li>
            <li>so make sure your gel polish doesn&#x27;t require LED.</li>
            <li>I used Sally Hanson brand gel and timed at 3 minutes for it to cure to my liking (make sure to use rubbing alcohol to wipe the tackiness away after curing your gel).</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more than paid for itself.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>but I like having them nonetheless (say, for a friend to use who might be more concerned about the UV exposure than I</li>
            <li>Even she commented my nails looked way better than 3/4 of the people she trained with</li>
            <li>(I find that most seem to indicate 36w), you will be well on your way to having lovely nails at a fraction of the price in no time.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li>but that is OK.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I leave each coat in 4 minutes instead of 3 just to make sure they cure well.  </li>
            <li>Works perfectly i love it</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t spend a fortune..</li>
            <li>I love the lamp.</li>
            <li>first time I used OPI gel nail polish and it worked great with the uv light.</li>
            <li>It works quick and I&#x27;m able to go within 10 minutes!</li>
            <li>I love doing my own manicures at home because I just do not like others doing my nails unless it&#x27;s something super fancy and intricate.</li>
            <li>I was so happy with this that I had to write a review, and I normally don&#x27;t write reviews for anything</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t Really had a successful go of it.</li>
            <li>But as I got better it was super easy and it works Fantastic!!</li>
            <li>I was extremely excited to receive it the day after I ordered it!</li>
            <li>i can always buy a new one for the smae great price.</li>
            <li>Arrived in great working new condition.</li>
            <li>It works great and equally as important, the price was very affordable.  </li>
            <li>I love the size, easy to use for your toes.</li>
            <li>Works awesome for my girls to dry there nails.</li>
            <li>Lamp also does not get super warm like some lamps at the salon</li>
            <li>A great buy so far!</li>
            <li>This one acted more like a fine sander/buffer for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well...For Something named Spicy I&#x27;d say More like Mild!</li>
            <li>However, I finish with a UV- light accelerated top coat polish.</li>
            <li>I love the dryer and the size but the light came break</li>
            <li>I did notice it seems better if I leave nails under light for upwards of 8-10 minutes so</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the lamp was secured with bubble wrap and that it comes with the light bulb.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works great as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a cheap lamp that would work good and this one is exactly that.</li>
            <li>Good product and affordable.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much....</li>
            <li>its good but not that fast</li>
            <li>, it makes my nails look and feel gummy and is not the nail product because with other lamp it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I received it in a timely fashion, I thought it&#x27;d take longer, it works great and love the uv gloves that Come included&lt;br /&gt;Due to financial hardship, I had decided to do my part by forgoing my nail salon luxury</li>
            <li>product works great easy to use, came in a timely manner even though we have been hit with multiple snow storms I enjoy it !</li>
            <li>I got my package very quick and no damage was done when arrived.</li>
            <li>I can use the timer on my phone easily.</li>
            <li>(Finding replacement bulbs is easy as well when needed so no worries there.)</li>
            <li>First of all i thought dryer meant some kind of blower since its says ..</li>
            <li>I painted my own nails and tried out this beauty for the first time.</li>
            <li>follow the directions on the gel polish bottles and your fine.</li>
            <li>hardens gel well and fine in all wayys</li>
            <li>but I think that it works just fine for what I am doing with it.</li>
            <li>Arrived working fine.</li>
            <li>It work just fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light in weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Used it for 4 times and everything seems fine.</li>
            <li>Lightbulb is working fine, had no problem with it.</li>
            <li>This light is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I purchased his product, and was satisfied the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li>It comes with two little added perks... the gloves for your protection... shows looking out for customers best interest.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much for great service</li>
            <li>Drys fast very convenient, compact and the gloves were great.</li>
            <li>I must also mention the company provides terrific customer service and it is def important to them that their customers are happy...</li>
            <li>I got is a cheap cheap looking box written \\&quot;Kang Tuo\\&quot; on it</li>
            <li>Also the light has a removeable shield.</li>
            <li>Also used with regular polish and worked great.</li>
            <li>it is really something you should own.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have nice nails but not spend a fortune at the nail salon.</li>
            <li>Pop the light bulb in -</li>
            <li>Plus my dryer came with free gloves.</li>
            <li>So if you used the OPI brand just try to keep it light.</li>
            <li>think USpicy is great to have at home especially if you have the time to create salon nails and save money.</li>
            <li>YOU WANT A CHEAP UV LIGHT LAMP THING</li>
            <li>I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>I had my hand in the uv light for over an hour</li>
            <li>It arrived earlier then what it was supposed to and was packaged great.</li>
            <li>One problem is once the light goes out</li>
            <li>I gave this 5 stars because all in all it is a fabulous light</li>
            <li>And I can fit both of my fit in at once.</li>
            <li>I can do my own nails and save so much money.</li>
            <li>then the light bulb I ordered arrives.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s under the light</li>
            <li>it was cheap</li>
            <li>The light had to be inserted - no directions on how to do this.</li>
            <li>I fit my two hands in there at once.</li>
            <li>but my free gift kinda cheesy...white UV gloves???</li>
            <li>I paid 19.99 for this nail dryer and $30 for bottom &amp; top coat CND and $13 for fresh scrub.</li>
            <li>I finally got a chance to try after a month and it works great.</li>
            <li>so your hands should remain comfortable.</li>
            <li>They were snug where they needed to be and comfortable everywhere else.</li>
            <li>I had known problem with the light bulb .I</li>
            <li>I tried the USpicy light with CND Shellac polish.  </li>
            <li>However, I have had a couple nail polishes not work with this light, even though they are supposed to work with UV.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I am unsure if this is a issue with the light or the nail polishes.</li>
            <li>didnt realize what i was buying when i realized the danger of an ultra violet light i thru it away</li>
            <li>It worked fabulously for about 2 minutes, before sputtering out.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>And a top grade UV GEL nail filer to help make those little beauties be lookin&#x27; their best! ;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But on both accounts it really set my polish nice and clean.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use.  </li>
            <li>have been doing my own nails with gel polish for quite some time and just needed a new light however this is not</li>
            <li>and this is a great light to help dry nails since i dont have a fan.</li>
            <li>It worked perfectly and dried them quickly.</li>
            <li>price friendly</li>
            <li>But for the price, it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li>but i am familiar with the brand</li>
            <li>First off make sure you snap the bulb in as it doesn&#x27;t seem to come connected.  </li>
            <li>Its simple on/off switch makes doing my own nails a breeze!</li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for the original one I had bought in a starter kit.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited, that within a day of getting it, I decided to go all out and do my nails.</li>
            <li>Light turns on quickly.</li>
            <li>this thing works great, I have used it both for my nails and for craft projects to dry uv epoxy.</li>
            <li>But since you most definitely can&#x27;t do UV GEL nails, without buying a UV light, I&#x27;m definitely recommending this as a great UV Lamp to be able to test out the water with.  </li>
            <li>I thought I ordered a nice USpicy unit in a nice pink box with a manual and a file.</li>
            <li>this heater is a great size for home manicures and the uv bulb is a single bulb and should not give off a lot of harmful rays.</li>
            <li>This is very cheap and does not dry the gel top coat.</li>
            <li>My item arrived in full functioning order.</li>
            <li>good drying time for a 9w bulb with regular nail polish- haven&#x27;t tried gel/shellac yet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for traveling or when you are short of space.</li>
            <li>In which, my daughter has learned the techniques so far on her own.</li>
            <li>Im looking forward to doing a full 4th of July mani.</li>
            <li>so I know I&#x27;m getting full coverage).  </li>
            <li>since I purchased the USpicy Professional UV Acrylic Gel &amp; Shellac Nail Dryer, I can do my own manicures at home and save the money and time going to the salon....  </li>
            <li>This product is simple to use and handy because of it&#x27;s size, packs easily for trips, I take it with me all the time with all the bottles I need packed inside.</li>
            <li>I experienced no wrinkling or other curing issues while using this lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nail file</li>
            <li>Everything cured the way it&#x27;s supposed to cure and was super shiny.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how good this would really work.</li>
            <li>Recieved my purchase quickly.   </li>
            <li>it with different kinds of nail polish (gel &amp; regular) - Worked Great on ALL !</li>
            <li>everything was neatly packaged, and came in super quick.</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>My only concern is since this has a UV light bulb in this unit,I would think it would warn you about using sunglasses,or some kind of protection for your eyes.</li>
            <li>It performed just as I expected and fulfilled my need to be able to do my own nails (gel/regular).  </li>
            <li>, I can only physically DO one hand at a time anyway, LOL!</li>
            <li>dryer was on my wish list, and lucky me, was purchased for me.</li>
            <li>I think this is a very good size (compact, but not so small you cannot get all your finger nails in there on one hand).</li>
            <li>I need to send it back now, I turned the light on and flickers, never stays on, it is more like a torture light than anything else.</li>
            <li>I was able to cure my nails within a normal time.</li>
            <li>I choose this product as a first time at home user of uv nail gel polish and uv nail light.</li>
            <li>This is the first UV light I&#x27;ve purchased and it meets my needs and works well, however, based on some trial and error</li>
            <li>but this gets super hot!</li>
            <li>An instruction manual would be nice, but pretty basic and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great buy and the light area is big enough to comfortably use.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m excited to use it , I&#x27;ll be back to put a more accurate review ..</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t live at home, but have told me they love this item.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, easy and very light weight.</li>
            <li>Works fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s fingers are long enough and work great for her!</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it is supposed to do!</li>
            <li>My first time working with gel and im excited.</li>
            <li>This is not a problem because this litttle guy is still saving me a TON of time and money by not having to go to a salon in the first place!</li>
            <li>As I said, this may be because I used it after using a new color and top coat over an old color and top coat.</li>
            <li>Great little machine.</li>
            <li>I ordered this uv light because of its reasonable price and it&#x27;s reviews.</li>
            <li>You could fit your whole hand with thumb</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unpack the box, unwrap the cord, pop the light in (gently), plug it in and go.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I bought one at Sallys and the lights blew out and I must say for the price, it was well worth</li>
            <li>we had so much fun painting our nails and</li>
            <li>Worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Will start fresh and update review.</li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I hope I get as many years use as my last light.</li>
            <li>It works great with my gels and is not huge</li>
            <li>Product ok, expected to be perform better</li>
            <li>Okay so I still haven&#x27;t really learned how to use this very well.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price</li>
            <li>For this price it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>So far I love it.  </li>
            <li>The product came so quick and does exactly what it suppose to do.</li>
            <li>the curing window is a nice decent size where you can fit your entire hand or one foot at a time in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>It is very good for drying your nails..just be careful not to leave your fingers under the light for too long as it will burn your fingers just like the sun..  </li>
            <li>YOU GET THE RIGHT POLISHES FOR IT.</li>
            <li>Shipped right away and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>Right out of the box it worked as described.</li>
            <li>the bulb clicks right into place, snug.  </li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Just the right size.</li>
            <li>The U-Spicy 9 watt lamp is not only portable and effective, it is an absolute steal at $17.95!</li>
            <li>It takes a good 15-20 mins of direct uv light to fully dry the polish.</li>
            <li>And I would totally recommend this to everyone who&#x27;s interested in doing their own at home manis.</li>
            <li>Might be good if you want a small UV light</li>
            <li>It was very easy to use and definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>It is worth a little more money for an upgrade to a better, heavier product.</li>
            <li>It dries my gel polish pretty quick and it&#x27;s very affordable!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using it for a short time, but so far the uspicy nail dryer has been excellent.</li>
            <li>I have larger hands and they fit just fine.  </li>
            <li>My nails last about 2 weeks before I have to do them again, polish holds strong but my nails grow out!</li>
            <li>I use the uv protecting gloves provided every time and that&#x27;s nice since it takes a little longer under the light.</li>
            <li>but the only problem is that the light and the atachment to it inside sounds lose when i move it but other than that works great</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping</li>
            <li>It worked ok, but not much power in the light.</li>
            <li>This nail dryer allows me to do professional looking gel nails, and it&#x27;s so easy.</li>
            <li>I actually plugged it up to make sure it worked right out the box.</li>
            <li>, she like very much and its work very fast</li>
            <li>but the company was very fast with letting me know and even faster at taking care of the issue.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working fine</li>
            <li>Worked fine, my nails looked professionally done.</li>
            <li>it is small, and for most, only made for one had at a time,  it still gets the job done, nice and well, and in a fair enough amount of time.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>No problems so far enjoy it very much.</li>
            <li>SO FIRST OF ALL THIS HAS SAVED ME</li>
            <li>I just got this lamp and used it for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li>I purchased the USpicy but was upgraded to a different one because the Uspicy had too many complaints on it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>with the USpicy Nail dryer it made it so much faster and fun.</li>
            <li>This really helps her out and was very much worth it.</li>
            <li>well with many different brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t exactly do them every week.  </li>
            <li>Reapply your colored coat if first coat is not to your satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Pretty nails.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>Pretty nails.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>An added bonus is it&#x27;s portable which means you can take it with you to a girlfriend&#x27;s house when you&#x27;re getting ready for a girl&#x27;s night out!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I finally got it.</li>
            <li>The lamp is not to small but not to big, it is a perfect size if you want to leave it out on a table or tuck in a corner out of the way.</li>
            <li>Extremely fast shipment!</li>
            <li>Like blowwww me away fast!</li>
            <li>I just wish it had a higher voltage or stronger lighting (yes I know it describes as 9W dryer).</li>
            <li>you cannot use regular nail polish top coat</li>
            <li>A couple of my friends are interested in purchasing this nail dryer after trying mine.  </li>
            <li>It works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>when I first received the dryer, I didn&#x27;t realize that I needed to insert the UV bulb into its socket.</li>
            <li>cannot at this time give  it  a higher  mark until  I</li>
            <li>I went  exactly  step  by  step  </li>
            <li>Personally, I didn&#x27;t have many problems with this lamp.</li>
            <li>I switched to a different brand and have had no issues with gel setting up appropriately.</li>
            <li>It works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I only used the bottom &amp; top coats.</li>
            <li>Plus, you don&#x27;t have to replace batteries, and it doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and works as it should.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>then I come home and use a gel top coat (over regular polish)</li>
            <li>love the dryer though the cord is starting to break after 2 uses and i have not bent or wound the cord up.</li>
            <li>I can squeeze both hands in at once, including my thumbs and be done with the whole mani in about 20 minutes!</li>
            <li>I picked out another unit at a similar price point, so hopefully it will be a better experience.</li>
            <li>It is a little small but it works fine for home manicures and my hand fits perfect too.</li>
            <li>SERVES ITS PURPOSE AND HAS A NICE LITTLE UV LIGHT, CAN ONLY FIT ONE HAND AT A TIME</li>
            <li>I love this little light.</li>
            <li>Thank you for bringing an affordable option like this to those of us who have been on the fence about trying gels on our own, and/or other lights are too out of our price range to consider.</li>
            <li>Fast and good service , started up a little off</li>
            <li>Overall, great value for the money spent, and the application of the product.</li>
            <li>Worked great didn&#x27;t take long to dry my nails.</li>
            <li>i received this pretty fast as well</li>
            <li>I got it pretty fast.</li>
            <li>just processed my return request and will be getting a better more expensive light.</li>
            <li>I love gel shellac and was going to to the salon to get them because the manicures lasted so long.  </li>
            <li>Very happy to give something this teen really used since she changes her nail polish at least once a day.</li>
            <li>dryer comes witha soft pair of beautiful long white cloves, they are to be used while drying your nails, I suggest putting them on before painting that way</li>
            <li>This UV light is effective for drying shellac -- it does not seem to be as powerful as salon models and does not have an internal fan, so the drying process is a little bit longer.  </li>
            <li>By removing the shield I was able to dry both hands at one.</li>
            <li>The top coat never did dry, even after an hour.  </li>
            <li>It took me about an hour to paint my nails, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s still not fully dry yet.</li>
            <li>Worked when I plugged it in and seems to dry okay</li>
            <li>but you have to use a gel top coat to dry</li>
            <li>and this lamp is used to dry the gel top coat.</li>
            <li>Usage time does take longer then most nail gells say to dry, example if it states 30 seconds in directions, I found that in reality it takes 60 seconds......</li>
            <li>I tried to dry a gel top coat</li>
            <li>I love how fast my nails and feet dry with this dryer.  </li>
            <li>The depth of the lamp is pretty decent.</li>
            <li>For those who don&#x27;t, you will start once you&#x27;ve tried this handy little dryer.</li>
            <li>nice little unit, compact and seems sturdy.  </li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a really nice little perk to this kit.</li>
            <li>The lamp set itself is extremely basic, which explains it&#x27;s extremely reasonable cheap price.</li>
            <li>But for the price doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>Just gently snap it in..</li>
            <li>works very well, does not over heat.</li>
            <li>It will last longer and with this UV light, dries in 2 minutes .&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>Thanks Uspicy.</li>
            <li>this works well,Also very convenient for storing.</li>
            <li>It fits your whole hand.</li>
            <li>Drying is very quick,heats right-up.</li>
            <li>I really like this uv lamp...</li>
            <li>Also the whole process took about 25 minutes for one hand.</li>
            <li>but they cured really</li>
            <li>It works really well and cured each coat in 2 mins.</li>
            <li>now everyone wants to come over and do their nails.  </li>
            <li>The seller was very prompt with sending out the product..</li>
            <li>My manicures came out very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The quality of this mini UV dryer was actually more than I had expected, considering its inexpensive price tag, when compared to others.  </li>
            <li>The light bulb wattage is too low.  </li>
            <li>This is a very convenient product to have at home.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on my nails before going to a family dinner, and it really did speed up the polish drying process.  </li>
            <li>I dont hear the whole, I fudged a nail help.</li>
            <li>Plus...it really damages your nails.  </li>
            <li>My nails were really think when the polish came off.</li>
            <li>though, cause I really wanted to test it quite a bit, before I post my review.  </li>
            <li>Made me feel like, I really knew what I was doing.</li>
            <li>Very pleases with it.</li>
            <li>It seems like a big investment, but I can now enjoy the comfort of staying at home, and hopefully the saving will adds up later.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy this for the gel polish, which is what it&#x27;s really for, but it dries my polish (varnish, shellac, whatever)</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Product as described,  very eaay to use</li>
            <li>how much you use</li>
            <li>nail filer is very sturdy and durable.</li>
            <li>The nail filer is very sturdy and durable.</li>
            <li>but its more then I expected.</li>
            <li>I tried the light with regular polish.  </li>
            <li>Better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Worked better than expected</li>
            <li>The UV led lamp works quite well and fast too.</li>
            <li>We would like to add that this is a very reliable company.</li>
            <li>This worked fine the first time, but it is frankly not helping my UV polish dry much faster.</li>
            <li>MUCH.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because the unit seemed to really pump out some heat before it took a shiz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a good lamp, smaller than I expected but gets the job done.</li>
            <li>There is only an on/off switch on the back side of this unit so it is very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this numerous times, and it has not disappointed.</li>
            <li>When I looked at other products I didn&#x27;t like the prices and your product matched what I could afford and the quality is better than exspected.</li>
            <li>dryer/lamp/light all it is ,is a plasic , small, cheap, light.</li>
            <li>It is very durable and constructed of high quality materials.  </li>
            <li>it comes with, just for some extra UV protection, but it&#x27;s not as vital for me as it would be if I had to fry my entire hand at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;The smaller size of this great machine</li>
            <li>From start to finish each cycle I do my left 4 fingers first, then right 4 fingers, then</li>
            <li>It gets the job done, but I have to put my thumb in to dry on its own or my fingers bump the back and ruin my manicure.</li>
            <li>I have used it several times and it really sets the polish quickly.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes the light would be out for 5 seconds, and at longer stretched 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is barely more than a gel color change and half the cost of a manicure.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised and it worked better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>so now i can&#x27;t use it because they don&#x27;t sell those particular i</li>
            <li>You have to turn it off manually but is so much bigger than most others personal ones I have seen.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s small, and very portable!  </li>
            <li>So, for my left hand, I used the top coat and sat my hand under the lamp for only 10 minutes this time, then I put alcohol on tissue and wiped off the sticky residue ( I should have done if for 15 minutes instead of 10).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right starter uv lamp for me since I&#x27;m just starting out with the whole gel nails and curring thing.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this seller to others</li>
            <li>/&gt;The dryer is also high efficiency for faster , drying and its safer, plus compared to salon dryer’s</li>
            <li>I am not a pro, so I do not have high expectations.</li>
            <li>I have experience with three other UV lamps and I would definitely pick this one over the others because of how effective it is.</li>
            <li>there is a little more prep work and up front cost.</li>
            <li>I love this little thing and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Get a better machine this one is not worth it!</li>
            <li>beautiful pink and white nail filer that is extremely</li>
            <li>I believe it takes 5 minutes because the lamps aren&#x27;t as strong as other gel lamps.</li>
            <li>SO IT MIGHT BE BETTER TO INVEST IN A LARGER ONE IN THE LONG RUN.</li>
            <li>I love the gel manicures because they last so long</li>
            <li>and it never dried the first clear gel coat of gel nail polish.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s normal for all gel polishes.</li>
            <li>normally cost me $25-35 for the manicure plus tip every two weeks.</li>
            <li>It just would not dry very Fast at all.</li>
            <li>I had ordered a machine with more watts, this one does not dry the nails fast enough or throughly enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this unit for several months, and it fires right up every time.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m not using the right polish, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my polish stay or last any longer using this product like I thought it would.</li>
            <li>My full manicure was completed and 100% dry in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Due to the fact too much UV light can cause radiation damage and can lead to skin cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Due to the fact too much UV light can cause radiation damage and can lead to skin cancer.  </li>
            <li>in all, this is a great set up, especially for beginners not sure if they want to invest a lot into gel mani/pedi vs traditional polish.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>fits one hand at a time, and gets a little warm after both hands and several coats.</li>
            <li>Remember I&#x27;m still new at this.</li>
            <li>I should note I mainly use Gelish as a clear nail wrap, but I will try it with a color and update the review to reveal my findings of curing a darker color.</li>
            <li>The gloves are ok, I have short fingers, so I have to be careful for the tips not to touch my nails.</li>
            <li>Very professional.</li>
            <li>but i mean really guys, it took two minutes top for each coat.</li>
            <li>cause I wasn&#x27;t sure how long it would take to dry.</li>
            <li>I thought it didnt get hot enough.</li>
            <li>First of all, they delivered the next day.</li>
            <li>I was even able to incorporate a small stone in one of my manicures for an accent on my ring fingers.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve used it several times now without any issues, it doesent get too hot like some do.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Wow!</li>
            <li>Their higher end products are definitely something to consider.</li>
            <li>(I guess because it is smaller and more inexpensive light than \\&quot;salon\\&quot; brands but worked just as well, albeit taking a little longer...or maybe because I didn&#x27;t make a complete mess of myself as a new DIY-er, haha).</li>
            <li>but I did apply the new color over an old color.  </li>
            <li>and I paid less for this light.</li>
            <li>It took me more than an hour to dry just one coat of polish, and it still felt that  it didn&#x27;t dry completely</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely basic and easy to use, minus the no timer installed in it.</li>
            <li>each (with a dry wipe in between), 1 min for the color (Simple Sheer) and 2 minutes for the Top</li>
            <li>It even came with little gloves to wear to protect your fingers from the UV light.</li>
            <li>your whole hand comfortable no need to bend your hand at an awkward angle to fit all your fingers in it.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li>I feel like a professional...</li>
            <li>Shield removal and reinstall requires a bit of a delicate touch, but I was able to snap it in and out in about 10 seconds.     </li>
            <li>absolutely could not get it to Cure in the Proper Time Frame</li>
            <li>It beats going to have them professionally done.  </li>
            <li>Go to a professional if in doubt.</li>
            <li>Works well so far no problems</li>
            <li>The warnings I seen was to use the gloves to protect your skin,and it did state do not look directly at the bulb when it was on.&lt;br /&gt;Felt</li>
            <li>It actually works really well.  </li>
            <li>Saves a lot of money since we now don&#x27;t have to go to the nail salon for professional looking nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the light dried faster.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost a professional myself!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>On the second use, the bulk was blinking so fast, like it was going to blow</li>
            <li>I like that it is smaller than the salon sizes (your whole hand isn&#x27;t intended to go in, just the fingers)</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really heat up enough but it still does the job.</li>
            <li>My shipment came days early</li>
            <li>I would give this lamp 5 stars as I feel it&#x27;s good quality for the price, but as I&#x27;m not sure how long this lamp will hold up, I&#x27;ll leave it at 4 for now and update this review later on.</li>
            <li>sure the  local ovoltage supply matches the unit, otherwise you can destroy your unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was a little excited about the box</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and compact for easy storage.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, the item was packed extremely well, and the freebies are appreciated although I can&#x27;t say I use the gloves</li>
            <li>Why use for regular nail polish, when you can buy a $.99 cent quick dry polish?</li>
            <li>I imagine I could wear this file down quickly though.</li>
            <li>Seriously :)</li>
            <li>First of all upon receiving the nail dryer the uv light bulb was broken.</li>
            <li>It works exactly like it should, and it&#x27;s big enough for my toes too.</li>
            <li>The file is a pretty pink and white and has a decent thickness to it.</li>
            <li>arrived quickly and well packaged - was actually larger than expected -</li>
            <li>The opening is so small barely fit 3 fingers in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small though and cannot fit two hands.  </li>
            <li>design - me like Pink and pretty flowers!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Takes way too long to dry, definitely expected more power and quicker results.</li>
            <li>This product waiting time is too long for domestic use, you need a stronger light which comes with more expensive products.</li>
            <li>I didnt really think that this type of product was available,I always just let me nails air dry.</li>
            <li>and I wish it had not taken so much time to dry.</li>
            <li>This unit is really nice,looks like it will last for years,really built to last.</li>
            <li>Especially considering the low cost of this uv lamp, it works really well.</li>
            <li>I used to have a bigger one that would let you put your whole hand in, with this one you only get to put 4 fingers in at a time (no thumbs).</li>
            <li>I can do my nails at home, save money and get the same results as a professional!</li>
            <li>This is a great value compared to all of the other expensive lights on the market.</li>
            <li>This little dryer is well worth the cost.    </li>
            <li>It did not work and the light hardly stayed on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really sure why the gloves that fit all the way up to my elbows were necessary because I will never use them.</li>
            <li>I used it with just regular clear nail hardner and once with the gel type of nail polish.</li>
            <li>If you want to do both hands and feet, consider the time frame and complete the job as quickly as possible.  </li>
            <li>have had my Nails Done Professionally for years, Regular &amp; Gel Polishes.</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised that only took about 20 minutes for both hands.</li>
            <li>So I think there should be a how-to or a nail 101 booklet that would complete this entire product.</li>
            <li>The product came in a very lavish pink box.</li>
            <li>Makes acrylic and polish results professional, and lasting!</li>
            <li>For those who said their gel wouldn&#x27;t cure, make sure you&#x27;re doing thin coats as thicker coats can lead to an extended cure time.</li>
            <li>on the down side, the polish was so great that it made me think I had &#x27;tephon nails&#x27; needless to say</li>
            <li>Just not exactly what I wanted, so I&#x27;m going to pay a little more for a larger lamp with a timer.</li>
            <li>I used this dryer and it sucks, it took more than 20 minutes to dry the gel on my nails</li>
            <li>However it does not dry or cure the nails at all!</li>
            <li>still not dry!</li>
            <li>Bulbs were not loose as some others have stated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read some reviews about other lamps and how you have to screw in the bulb, well this lamp is out the box ready.</li>
            <li>Used to get my nails dry in 3 minutes at the nail bar, now with this light that takes OVER 20 min, it absolutely not what I expected.  </li>
            <li>It only took about ten minutes per hand to completely cure.</li>
            <li>I cant get my fingers in far enough without bumping the back and denting my polish.  </li>
            <li>This product melts the polish on my nails it will not dry</li>
            <li>After an HOUR it was not dry.  </li>
            <li>It tends to get a little hot.  </li>
            <li>At first i was a little concerned because the bulb wouldn&#x27;t turn on</li>
            <li>but you have to give it a little push so some assembly required at first.</li>
            <li>This little machine does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>If you are just beginning to explore this new fad in nail art, having to buy all these special products just to do so can be money frustrating.  </li>
            <li>It works very well, less time at the salon.</li>
            <li>9 watts meant I had to keep my hand in there a bit longer but not long enough to complain about.</li>
            <li>gloves were a little tight but it was a snug fit.</li>
            <li>The gel type took alittle longer to set and dry than the regular clear.</li>
            <li>I read a ton of reviews on this good and bad and it actually works you just need to know how to read directions</li>

            <li> and I love this bail dryer!</li>
            <li> It works really good, easy to remove, looks like I went to get my nails done with a profesional !</li>
            <li> Very excited when I received the nail dryer because this was my attempt to do my own shellac gel manicures!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS SO AMAZING AND</li>
            <li> a manual to help you if you need help or figure our how to use this amazing device.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great light.</li>
            <li> Great thing is I can change my nails as often as I want for free.</li>
            <li> I knew before I bought it that it doesn&#x27;t have a built in timer, but a cheap timer works great</li>
            <li> BUT WHAT A VALUE IS ALL I CAN SAY GREAT COMPANY SHIPPED FAST EVERYTHING WORKS JUST GREAT.</li>
            <li> The accessories were really nice for a one time use.</li>
            <li> Loved it works like it said couldn&#x27;t be more pleases.  </li>
            <li> I can do my own nails, and decided to use gel nail products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this in saloons, always wanted to do my nails in comfort of my own home and still feel like its been done professionally.&lt;br /&gt;Cool</li>
            <li> If you do your own nails</li>
            <li> You will need to set your own timer to know when your nails are cured, then hit the off button after set amount of time.</li>
            <li> Really nice the gloves being included so</li>
            <li> It was a nice change.</li>
            <li> I was provided this sample in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this is a MUST HAVE for all you who do your own nails.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a machine that will be so handy</li>
            <li> I purchased this UV lamp to make my own cabochons not for gel nail.</li>
            <li> I find the gloves nice, but cumbersome.</li>
            <li> This would make a nice gift.</li>
            <li> My fingers didn&#x27;t even get warm after being under the machine for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> And it comes with a pair of protective fingerless gloves and a nail filer which are a nice gift ( freebies are always nice).</li>
            <li> She likes to do her own nails</li>
            <li> After receiving this wonderful gift, I went straight to the store and got me some Gelish nail polish to try out with this baby.</li>

            <li> I did my own nails with this</li>
            <li> Works nice with my gel products.</li>
            <li> Used this once and liked it.  </li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s kind of my way of Zen-ing out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I loved it so much that I even made an account to comment on how awesome she is and to wish her warm toes every night for writing it. :)</li>
            <li> It is so nice</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice that it comes with anti UV gloves and a nail file.</li>
            <li> Nicely priced..</li>
            <li> so affordable and comes in handy for at&lt;br /&gt;Home</li>
            <li> Easy to use for my own mani and pedis!</li>

            <li> Worth every penny, works well and very cute!</li>
            <li> I bought this uv light and resived an update for a vogue one and works good</li>
            <li> So far has worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> I looking forward to seeing if I can make my nails as nice as they do in the nail salon :)</li>

            <li> Very cute lamp good practice to get comfortable and in good condition with all the accessories I recommend Haunted has worked very well ...</li>

            <li> Works great, fast delivery!</li>
            <li> and he explained to me that samples do not come with the gloves, but when you purchase it they come with gloves which is very important to wear, and use sunscreen to protect your hands against the UV</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use, effective.  </li>
            <li> The dryer came super duper fast and everything works perfectly.</li>

            <li> AND HAS SAVED MY WIFE LOTS OF PRECIOUS TIME.</li>
            <li> JUST MAKE SURE</li>
            <li> This unit is perfect for me and I am able to achieve the same salon look.</li>
            <li> I find the results of the UV lamp are better than the LED.</li>
            <li> Also to note again the lightbulb does not come pre-installed so make sure you put the bulb in before use to avoid believing that it is defective.</li>
            <li> Overall my sister and cousins were very happy with this product and remember to have all safeties in place when using any product like this!</li>

            <li> I look forward to more manicures with this lamp.  </li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad my friend bought me this for my birthday</li>
            <li> The included glove and nail file are really cute also.</li>
            <li> And I love the skin protecting gloves.</li>

            <li> Works fast and goes a great job of curing nails.</li>
            <li> I love painting my nails, I also have 3 girls</li>
            <li> Make sure you turn the device off when not in use, When changing the bulbs also make sure the device is off,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this UV nail dryer.  </li>
            <li> Its really cute and doesn&#x27;t take up alot of space.</li>
            <li> so make sure your gel polish doesn&#x27;t require LED.</li>
            <li> I used Sally Hanson brand gel and timed at 3 minutes for it to cure to my liking (make sure to use rubbing alcohol to wipe the tackiness away after curing your gel).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s more than paid for itself.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> but I like having them nonetheless (say, for a friend to use who might be more concerned about the UV exposure than I</li>
            <li> Even she commented my nails looked way better than 3/4 of the people she trained with</li>
            <li> (I find that most seem to indicate 36w), you will be well on your way to having lovely nails at a fraction of the price in no time.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li> but that is OK.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fabulous!  </li>
            <li> I leave each coat in 4 minutes instead of 3 just to make sure they cure well.  </li>
            <li> Works perfectly i love it</li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t spend a fortune..</li>
            <li> I love the lamp.</li>
            <li> first time I used OPI gel nail polish and it worked great with the uv light.</li>
            <li> It works quick and I&#x27;m able to go within 10 minutes!</li>
            <li> I love doing my own manicures at home because I just do not like others doing my nails unless it&#x27;s something super fancy and intricate.</li>
            <li> I was so happy with this that I had to write a review, and I normally don&#x27;t write reviews for anything</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t Really had a successful go of it.</li>
            <li> But as I got better it was super easy and it works Fantastic!!</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited to receive it the day after I ordered it!</li>
            <li> i can always buy a new one for the smae great price.</li>
            <li> Arrived in great working new condition.</li>
            <li> It works great and equally as important, the price was very affordable.  </li>
            <li> I love the size, easy to use for your toes.</li>
            <li> Works awesome for my girls to dry there nails.</li>
            <li> Lamp also does not get super warm like some lamps at the salon</li>
            <li> A great buy so far!</li>
            <li> This one acted more like a fine sander/buffer for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well...For Something named Spicy I&#x27;d say More like Mild!</li>
            <li> However, I finish with a UV- light accelerated top coat polish.</li>
            <li> I love the dryer and the size but the light came break</li>
            <li> I did notice it seems better if I leave nails under light for upwards of 8-10 minutes so</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the lamp was secured with bubble wrap and that it comes with the light bulb.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works great as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cheap lamp that would work good and this one is exactly that.</li>
            <li> Good product and affordable.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much....</li>
            <li> its good but not that fast</li>
            <li> , it makes my nails look and feel gummy and is not the nail product because with other lamp it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I received it in a timely fashion, I thought it&#x27;d take longer, it works great and love the uv gloves that Come included&lt;br /&gt;Due to financial hardship, I had decided to do my part by forgoing my nail salon luxury</li>
            <li> product works great easy to use, came in a timely manner even though we have been hit with multiple snow storms I enjoy it !</li>
            <li> I got my package very quick and no damage was done when arrived.</li>
            <li> I can use the timer on my phone easily.</li>
            <li> (Finding replacement bulbs is easy as well when needed so no worries there.)</li>
            <li> First of all i thought dryer meant some kind of blower since its says ..</li>
            <li> I painted my own nails and tried out this beauty for the first time.</li>
            <li> follow the directions on the gel polish bottles and your fine.</li>
            <li> hardens gel well and fine in all wayys</li>
            <li> but I think that it works just fine for what I am doing with it.</li>
            <li> Arrived working fine.</li>
            <li> It work just fine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light in weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Used it for 4 times and everything seems fine.</li>
            <li> Lightbulb is working fine, had no problem with it.</li>
            <li> This light is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I purchased his product, and was satisfied the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li> It comes with two little added perks... the gloves for your protection... shows looking out for customers best interest.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much for great service</li>
            <li> Drys fast very convenient, compact and the gloves were great.</li>
            <li> I must also mention the company provides terrific customer service and it is def important to them that their customers are happy...</li>
            <li> I got is a cheap cheap looking box written \\&quot;Kang Tuo\\&quot; on it</li>
            <li> Also the light has a removeable shield.</li>
            <li> Also used with regular polish and worked great.</li>
            <li> it is really something you should own.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have nice nails but not spend a fortune at the nail salon.</li>
            <li> Pop the light bulb in -</li>
            <li> Plus my dryer came with free gloves.</li>
            <li> So if you used the OPI brand just try to keep it light.</li>
            <li> think USpicy is great to have at home especially if you have the time to create salon nails and save money.</li>
            <li> YOU WANT A CHEAP UV LIGHT LAMP THING</li>
            <li> I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I had my hand in the uv light for over an hour</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier then what it was supposed to and was packaged great.</li>
            <li> One problem is once the light goes out</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 stars because all in all it is a fabulous light</li>
            <li> And I can fit both of my fit in at once.</li>
            <li> I can do my own nails and save so much money.</li>
            <li> then the light bulb I ordered arrives.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s under the light</li>
            <li> it was cheap</li>
            <li> The light had to be inserted - no directions on how to do this.</li>
            <li> I fit my two hands in there at once.</li>
            <li> but my free gift kinda cheesy...white UV gloves???</li>
            <li> I paid 19.99 for this nail dryer and $30 for bottom &amp; top coat CND and $13 for fresh scrub.</li>
            <li> I finally got a chance to try after a month and it works great.</li>
            <li> so your hands should remain comfortable.</li>
            <li> They were snug where they needed to be and comfortable everywhere else.</li>
            <li> I had known problem with the light bulb .I</li>
            <li> I tried the USpicy light with CND Shellac polish.  </li>
            <li> However, I have had a couple nail polishes not work with this light, even though they are supposed to work with UV.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I am unsure if this is a issue with the light or the nail polishes.</li>
            <li> didnt realize what i was buying when i realized the danger of an ultra violet light i thru it away</li>
            <li> It worked fabulously for about 2 minutes, before sputtering out.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> And a top grade UV GEL nail filer to help make those little beauties be lookin&#x27; their best! ;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But on both accounts it really set my polish nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use.  </li>
            <li> have been doing my own nails with gel polish for quite some time and just needed a new light however this is not</li>
            <li> and this is a great light to help dry nails since i dont have a fan.</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly and dried them quickly.</li>
            <li> price friendly</li>
            <li> But for the price, it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li> but i am familiar with the brand</li>
            <li> First off make sure you snap the bulb in as it doesn&#x27;t seem to come connected.  </li>
            <li> Its simple on/off switch makes doing my own nails a breeze!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for the original one I had bought in a starter kit.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited, that within a day of getting it, I decided to go all out and do my nails.</li>
            <li> Light turns on quickly.</li>
            <li> this thing works great, I have used it both for my nails and for craft projects to dry uv epoxy.</li>
            <li> But since you most definitely can&#x27;t do UV GEL nails, without buying a UV light, I&#x27;m definitely recommending this as a great UV Lamp to be able to test out the water with.  </li>
            <li> I thought I ordered a nice USpicy unit in a nice pink box with a manual and a file.</li>
            <li> this heater is a great size for home manicures and the uv bulb is a single bulb and should not give off a lot of harmful rays.</li>
            <li> This is very cheap and does not dry the gel top coat.</li>
            <li> My item arrived in full functioning order.</li>
            <li> good drying time for a 9w bulb with regular nail polish- haven&#x27;t tried gel/shellac yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for traveling or when you are short of space.</li>
            <li> In which, my daughter has learned the techniques so far on her own.</li>
            <li> Im looking forward to doing a full 4th of July mani.</li>
            <li> so I know I&#x27;m getting full coverage).  </li>
            <li> since I purchased the USpicy Professional UV Acrylic Gel &amp; Shellac Nail Dryer, I can do my own manicures at home and save the money and time going to the salon....  </li>
            <li> This product is simple to use and handy because of it&#x27;s size, packs easily for trips, I take it with me all the time with all the bottles I need packed inside.</li>
            <li> I experienced no wrinkling or other curing issues while using this lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nail file</li>
            <li> Everything cured the way it&#x27;s supposed to cure and was super shiny.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how good this would really work.</li>
            <li> Recieved my purchase quickly.   </li>
            <li> it with different kinds of nail polish (gel &amp; regular) - Worked Great on ALL !</li>
            <li> everything was neatly packaged, and came in super quick.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> My only concern is since this has a UV light bulb in this unit,I would think it would warn you about using sunglasses,or some kind of protection for your eyes.</li>
            <li> It performed just as I expected and fulfilled my need to be able to do my own nails (gel/regular).  </li>
            <li> , I can only physically DO one hand at a time anyway, LOL!</li>
            <li> dryer was on my wish list, and lucky me, was purchased for me.</li>
            <li> I think this is a very good size (compact, but not so small you cannot get all your finger nails in there on one hand).</li>
            <li> I need to send it back now, I turned the light on and flickers, never stays on, it is more like a torture light than anything else.</li>
            <li> I was able to cure my nails within a normal time.</li>
            <li> I choose this product as a first time at home user of uv nail gel polish and uv nail light.</li>
            <li> This is the first UV light I&#x27;ve purchased and it meets my needs and works well, however, based on some trial and error</li>
            <li> but this gets super hot!</li>
            <li> An instruction manual would be nice, but pretty basic and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great buy and the light area is big enough to comfortably use.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m excited to use it , I&#x27;ll be back to put a more accurate review ..</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t live at home, but have told me they love this item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, easy and very light weight.</li>
            <li> Works fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s fingers are long enough and work great for her!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it is supposed to do!</li>
            <li> My first time working with gel and im excited.</li>
            <li> This is not a problem because this litttle guy is still saving me a TON of time and money by not having to go to a salon in the first place!</li>
            <li> As I said, this may be because I used it after using a new color and top coat over an old color and top coat.</li>
            <li> Great little machine.</li>
            <li> I ordered this uv light because of its reasonable price and it&#x27;s reviews.</li>
            <li> You could fit your whole hand with thumb</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unpack the box, unwrap the cord, pop the light in (gently), plug it in and go.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I bought one at Sallys and the lights blew out and I must say for the price, it was well worth</li>
            <li> we had so much fun painting our nails and</li>
            <li> Worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Will start fresh and update review.</li>
            <li> Worth the price</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I hope I get as many years use as my last light.</li>
            <li> It works great with my gels and is not huge</li>
            <li> Product ok, expected to be perform better</li>
            <li> Okay so I still haven&#x27;t really learned how to use this very well.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price</li>
            <li> For this price it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> So far I love it.  </li>
            <li> The product came so quick and does exactly what it suppose to do.</li>
            <li> the curing window is a nice decent size where you can fit your entire hand or one foot at a time in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> It is very good for drying your nails..just be careful not to leave your fingers under the light for too long as it will burn your fingers just like the sun..  </li>
            <li> YOU GET THE RIGHT POLISHES FOR IT.</li>
            <li> Shipped right away and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box it worked as described.</li>
            <li> the bulb clicks right into place, snug.  </li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> Just the right size.</li>
            <li> The U-Spicy 9 watt lamp is not only portable and effective, it is an absolute steal at $17.95!</li>
            <li> It takes a good 15-20 mins of direct uv light to fully dry the polish.</li>
            <li> And I would totally recommend this to everyone who&#x27;s interested in doing their own at home manis.</li>
            <li> Might be good if you want a small UV light</li>
            <li> It was very easy to use and definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> It is worth a little more money for an upgrade to a better, heavier product.</li>
            <li> It dries my gel polish pretty quick and it&#x27;s very affordable!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using it for a short time, but so far the uspicy nail dryer has been excellent.</li>
            <li> I have larger hands and they fit just fine.  </li>
            <li> My nails last about 2 weeks before I have to do them again, polish holds strong but my nails grow out!</li>
            <li> I use the uv protecting gloves provided every time and that&#x27;s nice since it takes a little longer under the light.</li>
            <li> but the only problem is that the light and the atachment to it inside sounds lose when i move it but other than that works great</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping</li>
            <li> It worked ok, but not much power in the light.</li>
            <li> This nail dryer allows me to do professional looking gel nails, and it&#x27;s so easy.</li>
            <li> I actually plugged it up to make sure it worked right out the box.</li>
            <li> , she like very much and its work very fast</li>
            <li> but the company was very fast with letting me know and even faster at taking care of the issue.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working fine</li>
            <li> Worked fine, my nails looked professionally done.</li>
            <li> it is small, and for most, only made for one had at a time,  it still gets the job done, nice and well, and in a fair enough amount of time.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> No problems so far enjoy it very much.</li>
            <li> SO FIRST OF ALL THIS HAS SAVED ME</li>
            <li> I just got this lamp and used it for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li> I purchased the USpicy but was upgraded to a different one because the Uspicy had too many complaints on it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> with the USpicy Nail dryer it made it so much faster and fun.</li>
            <li> This really helps her out and was very much worth it.</li>
            <li> well with many different brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t exactly do them every week.  </li>
            <li> Reapply your colored coat if first coat is not to your satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Pretty nails.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> Pretty nails.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> An added bonus is it&#x27;s portable which means you can take it with you to a girlfriend&#x27;s house when you&#x27;re getting ready for a girl&#x27;s night out!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I finally got it.</li>
            <li> The lamp is not to small but not to big, it is a perfect size if you want to leave it out on a table or tuck in a corner out of the way.</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipment!</li>
            <li> Like blowwww me away fast!</li>
            <li> I just wish it had a higher voltage or stronger lighting (yes I know it describes as 9W dryer).</li>
            <li> you cannot use regular nail polish top coat</li>
            <li> A couple of my friends are interested in purchasing this nail dryer after trying mine.  </li>
            <li> It works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> when I first received the dryer, I didn&#x27;t realize that I needed to insert the UV bulb into its socket.</li>
            <li> cannot at this time give  it  a higher  mark until  I</li>
            <li> I went  exactly  step  by  step  </li>
            <li> Personally, I didn&#x27;t have many problems with this lamp.</li>
            <li> I switched to a different brand and have had no issues with gel setting up appropriately.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I only used the bottom &amp; top coats.</li>
            <li> Plus, you don&#x27;t have to replace batteries, and it doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and works as it should.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> then I come home and use a gel top coat (over regular polish)</li>
            <li> love the dryer though the cord is starting to break after 2 uses and i have not bent or wound the cord up.</li>
            <li> I can squeeze both hands in at once, including my thumbs and be done with the whole mani in about 20 minutes!</li>
            <li> I picked out another unit at a similar price point, so hopefully it will be a better experience.</li>
            <li> It is a little small but it works fine for home manicures and my hand fits perfect too.</li>
            <li> SERVES ITS PURPOSE AND HAS A NICE LITTLE UV LIGHT, CAN ONLY FIT ONE HAND AT A TIME</li>
            <li> I love this little light.</li>
            <li> Thank you for bringing an affordable option like this to those of us who have been on the fence about trying gels on our own, and/or other lights are too out of our price range to consider.</li>
            <li> Fast and good service , started up a little off</li>
            <li> Overall, great value for the money spent, and the application of the product.</li>
            <li> Worked great didn&#x27;t take long to dry my nails.</li>
            <li> i received this pretty fast as well</li>
            <li> I got it pretty fast.</li>
            <li> just processed my return request and will be getting a better more expensive light.</li>
            <li> I love gel shellac and was going to to the salon to get them because the manicures lasted so long.  </li>
            <li> Very happy to give something this teen really used since she changes her nail polish at least once a day.</li>
            <li> dryer comes witha soft pair of beautiful long white cloves, they are to be used while drying your nails, I suggest putting them on before painting that way</li>
            <li> This UV light is effective for drying shellac -- it does not seem to be as powerful as salon models and does not have an internal fan, so the drying process is a little bit longer.  </li>
            <li> By removing the shield I was able to dry both hands at one.</li>
            <li> The top coat never did dry, even after an hour.  </li>
            <li> It took me about an hour to paint my nails, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s still not fully dry yet.</li>
            <li> Worked when I plugged it in and seems to dry okay</li>
            <li> but you have to use a gel top coat to dry</li>
            <li> and this lamp is used to dry the gel top coat.</li>
            <li> Usage time does take longer then most nail gells say to dry, example if it states 30 seconds in directions, I found that in reality it takes 60 seconds......</li>
            <li> I tried to dry a gel top coat</li>
            <li> I love how fast my nails and feet dry with this dryer.  </li>
            <li> The depth of the lamp is pretty decent.</li>
            <li> For those who don&#x27;t, you will start once you&#x27;ve tried this handy little dryer.</li>
            <li> nice little unit, compact and seems sturdy.  </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a really nice little perk to this kit.</li>
            <li> The lamp set itself is extremely basic, which explains it&#x27;s extremely reasonable cheap price.</li>
            <li> But for the price doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> Just gently snap it in..</li>
            <li> works very well, does not over heat.</li>
            <li> It will last longer and with this UV light, dries in 2 minutes .&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> Thanks Uspicy.</li>
            <li> this works well,Also very convenient for storing.</li>
            <li> It fits your whole hand.</li>
            <li> Drying is very quick,heats right-up.</li>
            <li> I really like this uv lamp...</li>
            <li> Also the whole process took about 25 minutes for one hand.</li>
            <li> but they cured really</li>
            <li> It works really well and cured each coat in 2 mins.</li>
            <li> now everyone wants to come over and do their nails.  </li>
            <li> The seller was very prompt with sending out the product..</li>
            <li> My manicures came out very well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> The quality of this mini UV dryer was actually more than I had expected, considering its inexpensive price tag, when compared to others.  </li>
            <li> The light bulb wattage is too low.  </li>
            <li> This is a very convenient product to have at home.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on my nails before going to a family dinner, and it really did speed up the polish drying process.  </li>
            <li> I dont hear the whole, I fudged a nail help.</li>
            <li> Plus...it really damages your nails.  </li>
            <li> My nails were really think when the polish came off.</li>
            <li> though, cause I really wanted to test it quite a bit, before I post my review.  </li>
            <li> Made me feel like, I really knew what I was doing.</li>
            <li> Very pleases with it.</li>
            <li> It seems like a big investment, but I can now enjoy the comfort of staying at home, and hopefully the saving will adds up later.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this for the gel polish, which is what it&#x27;s really for, but it dries my polish (varnish, shellac, whatever)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Product as described,  very eaay to use</li>
            <li> how much you use</li>
            <li> nail filer is very sturdy and durable.</li>
            <li> The nail filer is very sturdy and durable.</li>
            <li> but its more then I expected.</li>
            <li> I tried the light with regular polish.  </li>
            <li> Better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Worked better than expected</li>
            <li> The UV led lamp works quite well and fast too.</li>
            <li> We would like to add that this is a very reliable company.</li>
            <li> This worked fine the first time, but it is frankly not helping my UV polish dry much faster.</li>
            <li> MUCH.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame because the unit seemed to really pump out some heat before it took a shiz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a good lamp, smaller than I expected but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> There is only an on/off switch on the back side of this unit so it is very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this numerous times, and it has not disappointed.</li>
            <li> When I looked at other products I didn&#x27;t like the prices and your product matched what I could afford and the quality is better than exspected.</li>
            <li> dryer/lamp/light all it is ,is a plasic , small, cheap, light.</li>
            <li> It is very durable and constructed of high quality materials.  </li>
            <li> it comes with, just for some extra UV protection, but it&#x27;s not as vital for me as it would be if I had to fry my entire hand at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;The smaller size of this great machine</li>
            <li> From start to finish each cycle I do my left 4 fingers first, then right 4 fingers, then</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but I have to put my thumb in to dry on its own or my fingers bump the back and ruin my manicure.</li>
            <li> I have used it several times and it really sets the polish quickly.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes the light would be out for 5 seconds, and at longer stretched 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is barely more than a gel color change and half the cost of a manicure.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised and it worked better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> so now i can&#x27;t use it because they don&#x27;t sell those particular i</li>
            <li> You have to turn it off manually but is so much bigger than most others personal ones I have seen.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s small, and very portable!  </li>
            <li> So, for my left hand, I used the top coat and sat my hand under the lamp for only 10 minutes this time, then I put alcohol on tissue and wiped off the sticky residue ( I should have done if for 15 minutes instead of 10).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right starter uv lamp for me since I&#x27;m just starting out with the whole gel nails and curring thing.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this seller to others</li>
            <li> /&gt;The dryer is also high efficiency for faster , drying and its safer, plus compared to salon dryer’s</li>
            <li> I am not a pro, so I do not have high expectations.</li>
            <li> I have experience with three other UV lamps and I would definitely pick this one over the others because of how effective it is.</li>
            <li> there is a little more prep work and up front cost.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Get a better machine this one is not worth it!</li>
            <li> beautiful pink and white nail filer that is extremely</li>
            <li> I believe it takes 5 minutes because the lamps aren&#x27;t as strong as other gel lamps.</li>
            <li> SO IT MIGHT BE BETTER TO INVEST IN A LARGER ONE IN THE LONG RUN.</li>
            <li> I love the gel manicures because they last so long</li>
            <li> and it never dried the first clear gel coat of gel nail polish.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s normal for all gel polishes.</li>
            <li> normally cost me $25-35 for the manicure plus tip every two weeks.</li>
            <li> It just would not dry very Fast at all.</li>
            <li> I had ordered a machine with more watts, this one does not dry the nails fast enough or throughly enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this unit for several months, and it fires right up every time.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not using the right polish, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my polish stay or last any longer using this product like I thought it would.</li>
            <li> My full manicure was completed and 100% dry in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Due to the fact too much UV light can cause radiation damage and can lead to skin cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Due to the fact too much UV light can cause radiation damage and can lead to skin cancer.  </li>
            <li> in all, this is a great set up, especially for beginners not sure if they want to invest a lot into gel mani/pedi vs traditional polish.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> fits one hand at a time, and gets a little warm after both hands and several coats.</li>
            <li> Remember I&#x27;m still new at this.</li>
            <li> I should note I mainly use Gelish as a clear nail wrap, but I will try it with a color and update the review to reveal my findings of curing a darker color.</li>
            <li> The gloves are ok, I have short fingers, so I have to be careful for the tips not to touch my nails.</li>
            <li> Very professional.</li>
            <li> but i mean really guys, it took two minutes top for each coat.</li>
            <li> cause I wasn&#x27;t sure how long it would take to dry.</li>
            <li> I thought it didnt get hot enough.</li>
            <li> First of all, they delivered the next day.</li>
            <li> I was even able to incorporate a small stone in one of my manicures for an accent on my ring fingers.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve used it several times now without any issues, it doesent get too hot like some do.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Wow!</li>
            <li> Their higher end products are definitely something to consider.</li>
            <li> (I guess because it is smaller and more inexpensive light than \\&quot;salon\\&quot; brands but worked just as well, albeit taking a little longer...or maybe because I didn&#x27;t make a complete mess of myself as a new DIY-er, haha).</li>
            <li> but I did apply the new color over an old color.  </li>
            <li> and I paid less for this light.</li>
            <li> It took me more than an hour to dry just one coat of polish, and it still felt that  it didn&#x27;t dry completely</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely basic and easy to use, minus the no timer installed in it.</li>
            <li> each (with a dry wipe in between), 1 min for the color (Simple Sheer) and 2 minutes for the Top</li>
            <li> It even came with little gloves to wear to protect your fingers from the UV light.</li>
            <li> your whole hand comfortable no need to bend your hand at an awkward angle to fit all your fingers in it.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li> I feel like a professional...</li>
            <li> Shield removal and reinstall requires a bit of a delicate touch, but I was able to snap it in and out in about 10 seconds.     </li>
            <li> absolutely could not get it to Cure in the Proper Time Frame</li>
            <li> It beats going to have them professionally done.  </li>
            <li> Go to a professional if in doubt.</li>
            <li> Works well so far no problems</li>
            <li> The warnings I seen was to use the gloves to protect your skin,and it did state do not look directly at the bulb when it was on.&lt;br /&gt;Felt</li>
            <li> It actually works really well.  </li>
            <li> Saves a lot of money since we now don&#x27;t have to go to the nail salon for professional looking nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the light dried faster.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost a professional myself!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> On the second use, the bulk was blinking so fast, like it was going to blow</li>
            <li> I like that it is smaller than the salon sizes (your whole hand isn&#x27;t intended to go in, just the fingers)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really heat up enough but it still does the job.</li>
            <li> My shipment came days early</li>
            <li> I would give this lamp 5 stars as I feel it&#x27;s good quality for the price, but as I&#x27;m not sure how long this lamp will hold up, I&#x27;ll leave it at 4 for now and update this review later on.</li>
            <li> sure the  local ovoltage supply matches the unit, otherwise you can destroy your unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little excited about the box</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and compact for easy storage.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, the item was packed extremely well, and the freebies are appreciated although I can&#x27;t say I use the gloves</li>
            <li> Why use for regular nail polish, when you can buy a $.99 cent quick dry polish?</li>
            <li> I imagine I could wear this file down quickly though.</li>
            <li> Seriously :)</li>
            <li> First of all upon receiving the nail dryer the uv light bulb was broken.</li>
            <li> It works exactly like it should, and it&#x27;s big enough for my toes too.</li>
            <li> The file is a pretty pink and white and has a decent thickness to it.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly and well packaged - was actually larger than expected -</li>
            <li> The opening is so small barely fit 3 fingers in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small though and cannot fit two hands.  </li>
            <li> design - me like Pink and pretty flowers!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Takes way too long to dry, definitely expected more power and quicker results.</li>
            <li> This product waiting time is too long for domestic use, you need a stronger light which comes with more expensive products.</li>
            <li> I didnt really think that this type of product was available,I always just let me nails air dry.</li>
            <li> and I wish it had not taken so much time to dry.</li>
            <li> This unit is really nice,looks like it will last for years,really built to last.</li>
            <li> Especially considering the low cost of this uv lamp, it works really well.</li>
            <li> I used to have a bigger one that would let you put your whole hand in, with this one you only get to put 4 fingers in at a time (no thumbs).</li>
            <li> I can do my nails at home, save money and get the same results as a professional!</li>
            <li> This is a great value compared to all of the other expensive lights on the market.</li>
            <li> This little dryer is well worth the cost.    </li>
            <li> It did not work and the light hardly stayed on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure why the gloves that fit all the way up to my elbows were necessary because I will never use them.</li>
            <li> I used it with just regular clear nail hardner and once with the gel type of nail polish.</li>
            <li> If you want to do both hands and feet, consider the time frame and complete the job as quickly as possible.  </li>
            <li> have had my Nails Done Professionally for years, Regular &amp; Gel Polishes.</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised that only took about 20 minutes for both hands.</li>
            <li> So I think there should be a how-to or a nail 101 booklet that would complete this entire product.</li>
            <li> The product came in a very lavish pink box.</li>
            <li> Makes acrylic and polish results professional, and lasting!</li>
            <li> For those who said their gel wouldn&#x27;t cure, make sure you&#x27;re doing thin coats as thicker coats can lead to an extended cure time.</li>
            <li> on the down side, the polish was so great that it made me think I had &#x27;tephon nails&#x27; needless to say</li>
            <li> Just not exactly what I wanted, so I&#x27;m going to pay a little more for a larger lamp with a timer.</li>
            <li> I used this dryer and it sucks, it took more than 20 minutes to dry the gel on my nails</li>
            <li> However it does not dry or cure the nails at all!</li>
            <li> still not dry!</li>
            <li> Bulbs were not loose as some others have stated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some reviews about other lamps and how you have to screw in the bulb, well this lamp is out the box ready.</li>
            <li> Used to get my nails dry in 3 minutes at the nail bar, now with this light that takes OVER 20 min, it absolutely not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> It only took about ten minutes per hand to completely cure.</li>
            <li> I cant get my fingers in far enough without bumping the back and denting my polish.  </li>
            <li> This product melts the polish on my nails it will not dry</li>
            <li> After an HOUR it was not dry.  </li>
            <li> It tends to get a little hot.  </li>
            <li> At first i was a little concerned because the bulb wouldn&#x27;t turn on</li>
            <li> but you have to give it a little push so some assembly required at first.</li>
            <li> This little machine does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> If you are just beginning to explore this new fad in nail art, having to buy all these special products just to do so can be money frustrating.  </li>
            <li> It works very well, less time at the salon.</li>
            <li> 9 watts meant I had to keep my hand in there a bit longer but not long enough to complain about.</li>
            <li> gloves were a little tight but it was a snug fit.</li>
            <li> The gel type took alittle longer to set and dry than the regular clear.</li>
            <li> I read a ton of reviews on this good and bad and it actually works you just need to know how to read directions</li>
            <li> So the second hand didn&#x27;t quite take that long, and I used only one layer of gel polish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;No more expensive salon visits with snooty people and long waits...</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because sometimes the motor can be noisy and you have to silence it by either pressing down hard while your fingers are in it or holding the top part down.</li>
            <li> I have long nails and didn&#x27;t worry about the nail tips hitting the back of the casing.</li>
            <li> i would definitely recommend this to anyone else, although i havent used it very long</li>
            <li> Used it to dry regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> I estimated that it took about 5 minutes per hand, but I still had to put it back to dry fully.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly but arrived broken.  </li>
            <li> The extra time to use this lamp is not significant enough to present an issue for me.</li>
            <li> If you want one that works in a reasonable amount of time, go with at least 36 watts.</li>
            <li> It dried my nails like the professional.</li>
            <li> I got it about 3 weeks earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> In the long run it will save you money as well.  </li>
            <li> It only fits one hand, but that&#x27;s not really a problem.</li>
            <li> It can be quite a long process</li>
            <li> The cord is 3 maybe 4 feet long.</li>
            <li> My fingers are not as long as the gloves</li>
            <li> It’s white and has pink flowers on it and says U-Spicy, which is wheresuggest putting them on before painting that way</li>
            <li> It’s white and has pink flowers on it and says U-Spicy, which is where</li>
            <li> Spend the money on a higher watt light, or go to the salon, because this product is worthless.</li>
            <li> It takes way to long to dry</li>
            <li> So it takes twice as long to dry each coat.</li>
            <li> only downside is that you can only dry one hand at a time and it gets slightly warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t use it, as it takes to long to dry her nails.</li>
            <li> but they are a little more expensive</li>
            <li> Overall you get what you pay for &amp; think it&#x27;s my money well spent!</li>
            <li> Other reviewers stated that this worked for regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> I found I have to double the drying time recommended by the brands I use (IBD, FingerPaints, NailBliss, etc) due to the lower wattage (9w vs. 36w).</li>
            <li> My nails wouldn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this light expecting the worst because it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> I can do my nails and dry them in the comforts of my home.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely dry her nails</li>
            <li> It didnt dry my nails at all&lt;</li>
            <li> you could ruin your nails and dry out your fingertips.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use to dry it.  </li>
            <li> and I soon&#x27;t have to see her waving her hands around trying to dry her nails.</li>
            <li> The unit has a 9W UV lamp to quickly dry your nails.  </li>
            <li> It took forever for the gel to dry</li>
            <li> It did not work well to dry gel polish.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It took awhile for the coats on the nails to dry (about 2-4min)</li>
            <li> &amp; I also had to put my thumbs in separately to dry.</li>
            <li> The Gelish polish I bought to use with this says it takes 1 minute to dry under a 36w bulb.  </li>
            <li> I kept my hands in it for over 10 minutes and they were not even close to dry.  </li>
            <li> Takes longer than expects to dry nails.</li>
            <li> it takes forever to dry your nails with maybe becUse</li>
            <li> i thought it would help dry my nails</li>
            <li> but instead it doesnt and takes for ever to dry with the gel on.</li>
            <li> Takes longer to dry your nails</li>
            <li> and  after  thirty minutes  it still DIDNOT dry...</li>
            <li> I do wish it had a timer but for the price I can&#x27;t complain; I just use a stopwatch-type timer app on my cell phone and read or watch tv while my nails dry.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t dry anything.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money, buy more expensive one but</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s dried the regular nail polish and gel nail polish which i was a little hesitant it could do</li>
            <li> Only complaint she had was she could only do one hand at a time which means double the time.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how well this lamp worked because Gelish usually calls for a 36 watt lamp.</li>
            <li> My little sister has gone through two other brands, so I finally got her the same one I have...</li>
            <li> Be careful not to dry gel nails no longer than 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> I need at least 5 minutes for a complete dry.   </li>
            <li> and it only takes a few seconds for the gel polish to dry.</li>
            <li> but again, not significant enough to discourage use.</li>
            <li> it has lower wattage than some other lights and some people complain that it takes longer to dry their gel nails</li>
            <li> Unit works as expected.</li>
            <li> and my nails are wet and sticky.  </li>
            <li> , the pink gel polish began to pool in areas, and became spotty.</li>
            <li> Works as will as expected.  </li>
            <li> I do not have to redo my nails anymore or worry about destroying my polish because this product actually works!  </li>
            <li> I am notorious for messing up my wet nails and having to re-paint one or two of them.  </li>
            <li> This did not perform the way I expected it to.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very patient.</li>
            <li> The product come on time and worked as expected.</li>
            <li> I sometimes use a regular base coat and my favorite polish.</li>
            <li> top and base coat only need 30 secs, gel polish should be 60 secs-1 minute</li>
            <li> I only did a base and top coat, no color, since I just wanted to try both the gel polishes and uv lamp before my son woke up and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d certainly not do a shellac nail with this.</li>
            <li> Im so upset as I followed directions and steps from other posts that i read</li>
            <li> I returned mine due to the unit heating up and smelling like it was burning.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to try to get dressed with wet nails!</li>
            <li> I am also trying to find out other uses for this uv dryer.</li>
            <li> got the next day saved my small biz...</li>
            <li> Gloves are definitely needed and usually don&#x27;t come with.</li>
            <li> Note to other buyers--</li>
            <li> Other than that, I had no problems.</li>
            <li> I used to spend $30 at the salon every other week.  </li>
            <li> I did not have to snap my bulb in place as some other reviews have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> worked well, took little time to work and dry nails.  </li>
            <li> &quot; is it takes a little longer to dry the shellac than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> After re-reading some negative reviews I was ready to just return it without even opening the box, however, I decided to try it at least once before returning.</li>
            <li> It also takes a few seconds longer to cure than a salon brand, but for the money I can spare a few extra seconds.</li>
            <li> after reading negative reviews i was skeptical to buy this product, but i went ahead anyways because it&#x27;s so cheap compared to others.</li>
            <li> A little slower than I expected</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry regular nail polish, but its not meant to, so I&#x27;m not sure why that&#x27;s a complaint in other reviews.</li>
            <li> I used a base coat(light) which took about 3-5 minutes to cure and a top coat(1-3 minutes).  </li>
            <li> I used BMC UV/LED Gel Nail Art Lacquer Polish Top and Base Coat Manicure Essentials Set, which I also purchased with the lamp.  </li>
            <li> I let my nails cure for 4 minutes after each step (base coat, coat of color, another coat of color and top coat)</li>
            <li> i have had it for several months without failure or problems.  </li>
            <li> oh and rubbing alcohol because the base coat will be sticky, rub with a little alcoholl and then apply top coat.</li>
            <li> This is very small and only has one bulb.</li>
            <li> That set lasted less than one week</li>
            <li> My nails were done in less than 8 minutes from start to finish.</li>
            <li> There was a slight issuse about the color</li>
            <li> After drying my hands for a minute and a half, the bulb starts to flicker.</li>
            <li> I received my order in less than a week.</li>
            <li> All i wound up with is a sticky mess.</li>
            <li> I had a mess on my hands.</li>
            <li> and they mess them all up.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a tight squeeze but you should manage to get it snapped in.</li>
            <li> this little guy does the trick.</li>
            <li> now I gave it to my little daughter</li>
            <li> I was looking for a little help drying my nails at home.</li>
            <li> I ended up using a little desk fan to finish drying my nails</li>
            <li> User manual little to no information.</li>
            <li> Had a little trouble with the postal system getting it</li>
            <li> but mine where missing so I am upset.</li>
            <li> MAY 15, 2013 received this product,I used a few times,</li>
            <li> It was a weird experince but completely avoid if you cure your gel polish for 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Nail polish dries in just a few minutes.. and will not dent.</li>
            <li> Totally dead.  </li>
            <li> I used this quite often for a few months for at home gel nails, it took forever for the gel to set with this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been used a few times but 10, 8, and 5 year olds don&#x27;t have the patience to sit for 10 minutes while it dries their nails.</li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> Please be sure to use those protective gloves since UV lights are dangerous if over exposed!!</li>
            <li> If you want to build it up, just do multiple thin coats instead of one thick coat.  </li>
            <li> The unit is approximately the size of an average shoe and slightly taller in height.</li>
            <li> I used a OPI gel polish painted a thin layer 1 hour of having my nails in the dryer they are still wet...</li>
            <li> My wife is an amateur at doing nails, but now some people are asking her who does her nails.  </li>
            <li> Before you take the plunge or if you&#x27;re not sure gel polish is for you, buy some gel polish and this lamp.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to return this item now</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the type of polish</li>
            <li> I have tiny hands, so this seems like a fail to me.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s kinda a small space to put your hand in.</li>
            <li> Past 30, 60, 90 days</li>
            <li> I like it because its small doesnt take up alot of space,and the added bonus to me was that it does have an on and off switch,</li>
            <li> No more nail salons for me.</li>
            <li> She opened it this past weekend.</li>
            <li> I usually get my nails polished at the salon</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t, Ill definitely give you guys an update.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!  </li>
            <li> Works as intended, just too small for my taste</li>
            <li> The gloves are too small.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m impatient!)</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the polish I&#x27;m using, but this is terrible and a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> I did get to use it once, and it is not a very good curing lamp.</li>
            <li> I always have a hard time painting their nails</li>
            <li> It is just two small not a good lamp at all.</li>
            <li> I was not very happy with the dryer.</li>
            <li> no more smudges!</li>
            <li> my nails are completely dry and wake up to disappointment because I had no patience the night before.  </li>
            <li> Only bad thing is that it burns my skin wen</li>
            <li> and I concluded is not a good product</li>
            <li> However, you can only do one hand at a time, so if you are desperate for time, buy two!</li>
            <li> Definitely buy one or two, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> When I first turn the dryer on it made this awful noise like it was going to explode</li>
            <li> work as advertised - cutting down drying time!&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li> , It was very hard but now with my uv dryer and all the goodies my hubby gets me from Amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m truly annoyed.</li>
            <li> Came with a broken bulb.</li>
            <li> i bought it about 4 months ago and it hasnt broken or anything.  </li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> which is approximately 6 to 12 months if not longer depending</li>
            <li> The material is thin and breathable.</li>
            <li> also keeps me from rushing and doing a sloppy job on my gel manicures at home.</li>
            <li> What a mess!!!!</li>
            <li> Annoying as it was, I had wet nails</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost useless.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I cannot tell a Lie.</li>
            <li> I have no idea of what I did wrong.</li>
            <li> I am just sorry</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was skeptical after reading some reviews on this product and others</li>
            <li> this company is stands behind every product that they offer!</li>
            <li> and unfortunately my cat knocked it off of my table and ever since I can&#x27;t get it to turn on.</li>
            <li> Very weak!</li>
            <li> 😩😢 I was so looking forward to this needless to say!</li>
            <li> Bad business</li>
            <li> felt bad telling my fiance that we would have to return it.</li>
            <li> My daughter was shocked when she received this package.</li>
            <li> Never again a waste of money!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I did 2 coats of Foundation base coat at 1 min</li>
            <li> hate this product.</li>
            <li> This is a worthless product all around, for nails.</li>
            <li> Apply directed base coat.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> quite annoying.  </li>
            <li> Breaking at the base where it connects to the dryer.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I am very disappointed with the product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> No timer, but does a great job!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Easy to use for my own mani and pedis!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after having my nieces sell me the lasting of gel nails. That set lasted less than one week but I found out after the fact that you must seal the edges. Great product !</li>
            <li> Unit works as expected. No issues with it. But the gloves were not included. But for the price doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> but receiving in it the mail speaks volumes.....wasn&#x27;t as big as the picture depicts...I cannot wait to use it tonight&lt;br /&gt;July 25th....I used this dryer and it sucks, it took more than 20 minutes to dry the gel on my nails and I felt no heat or air....I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I feel like a professional... this little guy does the trick. However, you can only do one hand at a time, so if you are desperate for time, buy two! I don&#x27;t always do the gel polish. I sometimes use a regular base coat and my favorite polish. However, I finish with a UV- light accelerated top coat polish. Note: the bulb isn&#x27;t pushed in so, when you get it and hit the \\&quot;on\\&quot; switch, don&#x27;t freak out. Just gently snap it in.. it&#x27;s a tight squeeze but you should manage to get it snapped in. Also it doesn&#x27;t come with instructions, I would have loved to read tips and techniques.</li>
            <li> This product waiting time is too long for domestic use, you need a stronger light which comes with more expensive products. It is worth a little more money for an upgrade to a better, heavier product.</li>
            <li> I thought I ordered a nice USpicy unit in a nice pink box with a manual and a file. This is a gift so I wanted a presentable box...&lt;br /&gt;All I got is a cheap cheap looking box written \\&quot;Kang Tuo\\&quot; on it that has the unit in it.&lt;br /&gt;The unit works so I will keep it and avoid the hassle to return this item but it is definitely not as described...</li>
            <li> Bought this one as a gift because I love mine. I have not been dissapointed in their brand. Works wonderful for all nail types , acrylic or gel! Would not hesitate to buy again and again !</li>
            <li> SO FIRST OF ALL THIS HAS SAVED ME A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY AND HAS SAVED MY WIFE LOTS OF PRECIOUS TIME. THIS PRODUCT IS SO AMAZING AND MY SISTER IN LAWS ALSO USE IT. EVERY WEEKEND IT IS A NAIL SALON AT OUR PLACE. JUST MAKE SURE YOU GET THE RIGHT POLISHES FOR IT. BUT WHAT A VALUE IS ALL I CAN SAY GREAT COMPANY SHIPPED FAST EVERYTHING WORKS JUST GREAT.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work. My nails wouldn&#x27;t dry. Sent back for a refund</li>
            <li> This dryer is neat for at home use only.  I wish I had gotten one with a fan.  It tends to get a little hot.  If you want to do both hands and feet, consider the time frame and complete the job as quickly as possible.  This unit is perfect for me and I am able to achieve the same salon look. I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this light expecting the worst because it was so cheap. i do acrylic nails at home and this is a great light to help dry nails since i dont have a fan. i would definitely recommend this to anyone else, although i havent used it very long i can always buy a new one for the smae great price. i received this pretty fast as well and thats always a plus!! thank you</li>
            <li> This product works great. I have not had any issues with it. I received it in a timely manner and have used it about 5 times. Works fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I just got this lamp and used it for the first time yesterday. After re-reading some negative reviews I was ready to just return it without even opening the box, however, I decided to try it at least once before returning. I was pleasantly surprised and it worked better than I expected.  I use the Gelish brand and I did not need to extend the cure time. I did 2 coats of Foundation base coat at 1 min each (with a dry wipe in between), 1 min for the color (Simple Sheer) and 2 minutes for the Top It Off topcoat. Everything cured the way it&#x27;s supposed to cure and was super shiny. I find the results of the UV lamp are better than the LED. I had issues with the gel staying softer and not as shiny with the LED lamp.  For those who said their gel wouldn&#x27;t cure, make sure you&#x27;re doing thin coats as thicker coats can lead to an extended cure time. If you want to build it up, just do multiple thin coats instead of one thick coat.  I would give this lamp 5 stars as I feel it&#x27;s good quality for the price, but as I&#x27;m not sure how long this lamp will hold up, I&#x27;ll leave it at 4 for now and update this review later on. I should note I mainly use Gelish as a clear nail wrap, but I will try it with a color and update the review to reveal my findings of curing a darker color.</li>
            <li> This is a great, reliable light! My little sister has gone through two other brands, so I finally got her the same one I have...we love them!</li>
            <li> I love the dryer and the size but the light came break so now i can&#x27;t use it because they don&#x27;t sell those particular i&lt;br /&gt;lights here in the Bahamas.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this again.  It takes way to long to dry it&#x27;s almost useless.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for a friend. I gotta say it worked out well for her. Only complaint she had was she could only do one hand at a time which means double the time. So far it&#x27;s dried the regular nail polish and gel nail polish which i was a little hesitant it could do but boy did it surprise me. At first i was a little concerned because the bulb wouldn&#x27;t turn on but you have to give it a little push so some assembly required at first. The accessories were really nice for a one time use. Please be sure to use those protective gloves since UV lights are dangerous if over exposed!! I highly recommend this product it is great!! The accessories that come along with this product are great and definitely nice quality. Also to note again the lightbulb does not come pre-installed so make sure you put the bulb in before use to avoid believing that it is defective. Overall my sister and cousins were very happy with this product and remember to have all safeties in place when using any product like this! Recommended Product!</li>
            <li> Loved it works like it said couldn&#x27;t be more pleases.  It came in a timely manner and we started using it immediately. Great Product</li>
            <li> Excellent UV gel drier! works very well, does not over heat. An instruction manual would be nice, but pretty basic and easy to use. I would buy again if I had a need.</li>
            <li> This is almost as good as going to the salon.  I was surprised at how good this would really work. It dried my nails like the professional. This is good for home beauty</li>
            <li> Recieved my purchase quickly.   The product was wrapped in bubble wrap inside the box, and amazon added additional packaging in the overshipper. Arrived in great condition.  Light turns on quickly. Also the light has a removeable shield. By removing the shield I was able to dry both hands at one. Shield removal and reinstall requires a bit of a delicate touch, but I was able to snap it in and out in about 10 seconds.     Used with gellish product and drying time needed to be increased by an additional minute or two, but it was not a big deal.  Also used with regular polish and worked great. I need at least 5 minutes for a complete dry.   The only downside is that there are no instructions and it took me a minute to relize I had to plug the bulb in.  Overall, great value for the money spent, and the application of the product.</li>
            <li> This works alright. it&#x27;s not wonderful and not terrible.</li>
            <li> Well...For Something named Spicy I&#x27;d say More like Mild! Kinda like the difference in Taco Sauce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Sorry, but I cannot tell a Lie. This Product does Not Work up to my Expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely could not get it to Cure in the Proper Time Frame Given. I had my Hand in the machine for increments of 10-15 minutes and then repeatedly. That cannot be Good for you even with the gloves. It just would not dry very Fast at all. I would Test &amp; Test My Nail Polish; &amp; it was still Tacky. I tried over &amp; over, besides I am not a NewBee to the Gel Polish System Either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had my Nails Done Professionally for years, Regular &amp; Gel Polishes. After trying the USpicy to try and save some Money, I have decided to just go back to the Salon; it&#x27;s Faster.</li>
            <li> Totally not what i exsected. First of all i thought dryer meant some kind of blower since its says ..dryer/lamp/light all it is ,is a plasic , small, cheap, light. The opening is so small barely fit 3 fingers in. hate this product. All i wound up with is a sticky mess. But my fault. What did i exspect for 22$</li>
            <li> I can do my own nails, and decided to use gel nail products. It takes a 36 watt bulb. I was sold this by local store, and they said it would work for gel nails. It&#x27;s only 9 watts, and my gel nails,  took forever to cure, some not at all. I had a mess on my hands. This is a worthless product all around, for nails. I had my hand under this bulb for over 7 minutes. The correct curing time is 2 minutes. I&#x27;d certainly not do a shellac nail with this. Skip this and by the 36 watt UV lamp.</li>
            <li> it said on the description that it came with uv protective gloves. but mine where missing so I am upset. I contacted the seller today I hope I here from them soon so I can up grade my rating because I love the machine it works well.</li>
            <li> works great I got it pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m truly dissapointed of this product, it sounded good when I bought it... but when I started using it! it doesn&#x27;t work!! I&#x27;ve extend the time again and again and it simply doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ve used it just twice and I concluded is not a good product, it makes my nails look and feel gummy and is not the nail product because with other lamp it works perfectly. This lamp doesnt work!!! I&#x27;m truly annoyed. Mrs. Padilla.</li>
            <li> It took me more than an hour to dry just one coat of polish, and it still felt that  it didn&#x27;t dry completely (I used Gelish). Very weak! Don&#x27;t waste your time and money, buy more expensive one but with more WW.</li>
            <li> Its for Gel Nail Polish. If your in a hurry you can only do 1 hand at a time. It comes with a Nail File, Anti UV Gloves, and a manual to figure this out. It is not meant for regular nail polish, only Gel type of coating.&lt;br /&gt;If you never have tried Gel Nail polish there is a little more prep work and up front cost. It will save you in the end. It will last longer and with this UV light, dries in 2 minutes .&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Small footprint (you can place all 5 finger nails in)</li>
            <li> I just love my lamp. I got it about 3 weeks earlier than expected. I actually plugged it up to make sure it worked right out the box. It had all things in the box. It set my daughters gel set perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dominique</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my nail dryer. I purchased the USpicy but was upgraded to a different one because the Uspicy had too many complaints on it. I only gave it 4 stars because sometimes the motor can be noisy and you have to silence it by either pressing down hard while your fingers are in it or holding the top part down. It also takes a few seconds longer to cure than a salon brand, but for the money I can spare a few extra seconds. All in all, very pleased!</li>
            <li> The 1st I used it I thought it didnt get hot enough. But as I got better it was super easy and it works Fantastic!! Great Product, very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Works great. I love the size, easy to use for your toes.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I bought one at Sallys and the lights blew out and I must say for the price, it was well worth it now I gave it to my little daughter so she can use it in her room and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with this since, I bought it it works great better than the one from Sallys...I think I&#x27;ve had it for like 6 or 7 months now and I haven&#x27;t had the lights blow out yet :)</li>
            <li> Cute, and very effective, my nails dry quickly and the effect is perfect and defect-free</li>
            <li> Im so upset as I followed directions and steps from other posts that i read and my nails are wet and sticky.  I used a OPI gel polish painted a thin layer 1 hour of having my nails in the dryer they are still wet...I have no idea of what I did wrong. .This was a waste of time,  money and straight up headache.  😩😢 I was so looking forward to this needless to say!</li>
            <li> SERVES ITS PURPOSE AND HAS A NICE LITTLE UV LIGHT, CAN ONLY FIT ONE HAND AT A TIME THOUGH, SO IT MIGHT BE BETTER TO INVEST IN A LARGER ONE IN THE LONG RUN.</li>
            <li> Excellent gift to my gf, she like very much and its work very fast</li>
            <li> worked well, took little time to work and dry nails.  good product.  I used it maybe once or twice and I ended up re-gifting it, my friend&#x27;s daughter was very happy to have it</li>
            <li> This UV lamp is great!! I use it to cure my shellac/gel nails!!! Perfect lamp for a very inexpensive price! Fast shipping! Thanks Uspicy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this in saloons, always wanted to do my nails in comfort of my own home and still feel like its been done professionally.&lt;br /&gt;Cool design - me like Pink and pretty flowers!&lt;br /&gt;It work as advertised - cutting down drying time!&lt;br /&gt;Used it with different kinds of nail polish (gel &amp; regular) - Worked Great on ALL !&lt;br /&gt;Good product for the price!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product. I used it when my niece came over we had so much fun painting our nails and with the USpicy Nail dryer it made it so much faster and fun. The nail dryer take about 5min per hand. I will be saving myself money by not having to go to the Salon for my manicures.</li>
            <li> I bought this way over a year ago and it still works. Yes it&#x27;s probably not as strong as some, but for this price it is great! Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Great product love this thing</li>
            <li> 1.Love this for doing gel nails!&lt;br /&gt;2. All 5 fingers fit in it! Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;3. Bulb was installed, I did not have to install bulb.&lt;br /&gt;4. Instruction book was included&lt;br /&gt;5. Why use for regular nail polish, when you can buy a $.99 cent quick dry polish? It&#x27;s NOT a fan or meant for regular nail polish!&lt;br /&gt;6. Only downside- no timer&lt;br /&gt;Gel top and base coat only need 30 secs, gel polish should be 60 secs-1 minute</li>
            <li> this thing works great, I have used it both for my nails and for craft projects to dry uv epoxy.</li>
            <li> I bought this uv light and resived an update for a vogue one and works good it does what it should but the only problem is that the light and the atachment to it inside sounds lose when i move it but other than that works great</li>
            <li> This dryer is perfect!!!  I can do my nails and dry them in the comforts of my home.  I love how fast my nails and feet dry with this dryer.  I am just sorry tha I haven&#x27;t brought one sooner.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all. It was just a waist of my money !!!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife, and she loves it.  She is very happy with it.  If you do your own nails it is really something you should own.  It beats going to have them professionally done.  In the long run it will save you money as well.  My wife is an amateur at doing nails, but now some people are asking her who does her nails.  This really helps her out and was very much worth it.</li>
            <li> Loved it. Worth the price I paid. Would definitely recommend it to my family &amp; friends. It&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Came with a broken bulb. Had to return it</li>
            <li> Shipped right away and arrived on time. Arrived in great working new condition. Bulbs were not loose as some others have stated. It does seem to work quite well, I use the BMC UV Gel Nail rt Polish 3 pc kit with it. I did notice it seems better if I leave nails under light for upwards of 8-10 minutes so give yourself plenty of time..oh and rubbing alcohol because the base coat will be sticky, rub with a little alcoholl and then apply top coat. My nails last about 2 weeks before I have to do them again, polish holds strong but my nails grow out! I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have nice nails but not spend a fortune at the nail salon.</li>
            <li> I really like this item is as practical as it states very nice looking and does a really good job for my needs.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use.  Pop the light bulb in - you will hear it click.  To use, just read the bottle for the time of exposure.  The gloves are ok, I have short fingers, so I have to be careful for the tips not to touch my nails.</li>
            <li> MAY 15, 2013 received this product,I used a few times, this works well,Also very convenient for storing.Seller will call client  concerned about products,If you like to do your nails at home, I think also can used in nail salons.The price is good.Recommend!</li>
            <li> The dryer came super duper fast and everything works perfectly. Will be ordering in the future. Plus my dryer came with free gloves.😄</li>
            <li> The lamp set itself is extremely basic, which explains it&#x27;s extremely reasonable cheap price. It&#x27;s roomy enough to do one hand at a time, thumbs included (I&#x27;m looking at you Sally Hansens LED gel lamp). It only has an on\off button, no timer. You will need to set your own timer to know when your nails are cured, then hit the off button after set amount of time. Speaking of time, it takes about 5 minutes to properly cure each layer. I believe it takes 5 minutes because the lamps aren&#x27;t as strong as other gel lamps. When curing Gel polish with this lamp wouldn&#x27;t be about speed but rather about quality of a Gel manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this UV lamp out with 3 different gel brands. INK, Sally Hansen  and Gelish. I found out it took about 5 minutes to cure when I had a hiccup in my gel manicure process. After I applied gelish nail hardener cured it for two minutes, than went to paint my gelish neon pik, the pink gel polish began to pool in areas, and became spotty. It was a weird experince but completely avoid if you cure your gel polish for 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lamp worked great with all three brands. After the cure time was adjusted I had no hiccups or problems doing a gel manicure with this UV lamp. When you buy this off of amazon you recieve a pair of fingerless UV protecting gloves. I did not, so I emailed my contact about it and he explained to me that samples do not come with the gloves, but when you purchase it they come with gloves which is very important to wear, and use sunscreen to protect your hands against the UV rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Simple design&lt;br /&gt;FIts your whole hand comfortable no need to bend your hand at an awkward angle to fit all your fingers in it.&lt;br /&gt;Works well with many different brands.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with UV protecting fingerless gloves&lt;br /&gt;Very price friendly&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for those wanting to try out gel polish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Only an on/off switch, no timer&lt;br /&gt;Cure time 5minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERDICT: I may not pickthis lamp to use when I&#x27;m in a time crunch but I do like it a lot. It fits your whole hand. It&#x27;s extremely basic and easy to use, minus the no timer installed in it. For a Starting point of $18I reccomend this as a starter gel lamp. Before you take the plunge or if you&#x27;re not sure gel polish is for you, buy some gel polish and this lamp. Your wallet will thank you. Can be bought on amazon here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review written by beauty on a college budget</li>
            <li> It works really good, easy to remove, looks like I went to get my nails done with a profesional !</li>
            <li> Great. Lamp,but no timer!!!!</li>
            <li> When I plugged in the UV lamp it did not work. After taking apart the bulb had a crack in it. Not sure how to return this item now</li>
            <li> This nail dryer made a great surprise gift for my wife. It doesn&#x27;t completely dry her nails but it definitely does speed up her drying time.</li>
            <li> 1. It smells horrible&lt;br /&gt;2. The directions were not spell checked or written by someone who can speak english&lt;br /&gt;3. It didnt dry my nails at all&lt;br /&gt;4. Broke second use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just dont do it.</li>
            <li> Drying is very quick,heats right-up.</li>
            <li> This is very small and only has one bulb. It also has no timer, which is why I returned it. For the price it seems fair. Just not exactly what I wanted, so I&#x27;m going to pay a little more for a larger lamp with a timer.</li>
            <li> I really like this uv lamp...It dries my gel polish pretty quick and it&#x27;s very affordable! My sisters and I have already got many uses out of it!  It&#x27;s not the best out there, but for the price, it works great! Great starter lamp!</li>
            <li> I returned mine due to the unit heating up and smelling like it was burning. I did get to use it once, and it is not a very good curing lamp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for months already and I do the nails for my mom and my sisters and of course myself and it works perfect! I use it with gelish products and it works great. It is a little small but it works fine for home manicures and my hand fits perfect too. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the gel manicures because they last so long but they are a little more expensive so you can&#x27;t exactly do them every week.  With this dryer, now I can.</li>
            <li> First of all, they delivered the next day. I have used once and it was enough to know whether it works or not, and it does. It&#x27;s wonderful and does it part. It only fits one hand, but that&#x27;s not really a problem. I truly recommended! It will pay off all the visits to the salon! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I was worried the 9W bulb wouldn&#x27;t be enough to cure my gel nails.  But it did a great job!</li>
            <li> When I got the USpicy I was a little excited about the box itself.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:&lt;br /&gt;Definitely love the illustration on the box. Inside you get the 9W UV Nail Lamp, a manual, a nail file , and I also have protection gloves. I love the fact that the lamp was secured with bubble wrap and that it comes with the light bulb.&lt;br /&gt;Functionality:&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used OPI gel nail polish and it worked great with the uv light. It wasn&#x27;t until I added a second coat that I notice it started to wrinkle a bit. So if you used the OPI brand just try to keep it light. Also the whole process took about 25 minutes for one hand. I used a base coat(light) which took about 3-5 minutes to cure and a top coat(1-3 minutes).  Remember I&#x27;m still new at this. So the second hand didn&#x27;t quite take that long, and I used only one layer of gel polish. I also tried Ruby Kisses nail polish and a glitter nail polish. I was quite surprised that only took about 20 minutes for both hands. Not sure if it&#x27;s the type of polish but they cured really fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think USpicy is great to have at home especially if you have the time to create salon nails and save money. It can be quite a long process but it&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;ve had it for over three weeks, used it myself a couple of times, and also let friends use it and it stills work with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;The gloves were a little tight but it was a snug fit. I actually got help with knowing how to use this lamp. Being a first time user, it was difficult to know exactly what to do. So I think there should be a how-to or a nail 101 booklet that would complete this entire product. These are the steps I received from someone who knows how this works:&lt;br /&gt;1. Apply directed base coat.&lt;br /&gt;2. Use the USpicy lamp and cure at double or triple the suggested time.&lt;br /&gt;3. Wipe off any excess gel/shellac from your nails with rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply your desired colored coat and repeat steps 2 and 3.&lt;br /&gt;5. Reapply your colored coat if first coat is not to your satisfaction. Repeat steps 2 and 3.&lt;br /&gt;6. Apply top coat and repeats steps 2 and 3.&lt;br /&gt;7. Tada! Pretty nails.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps.is not to your satisfaction. Repeat steps 2 and 3.&lt;br /&gt;6. Apply top coat and repeats steps 2 and 3.&lt;br /&gt;7. Tada! Pretty nails.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps.</li>
            <li> Works as will as expected.  Used it to dry regular nail polish. Haven&#x27;t used it for gel polish at this time.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product. It was very easy to use and definitely recommend it to others. It&#x27;s like getting your nails done at a salon without the hassle.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but I have to put my thumb in to dry on its own or my fingers bump the back and ruin my manicure. So it takes twice as long to dry each coat. I have tiny hands, so this seems like a fail to me.</li>
            <li> The dryer came before the date they stated, which is aways great, and it cures my uv polish and makes my nails pretty and shiny. i&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Great buy and the light area is big enough to comfortably use.  The cord is 3 maybe 4 feet long. I used an extension cord to reach my table. Read the directions on your polishes (not included)  to follow procedure, time for processing of EACH step. Works with both UV or LED polish but the processing time is different for each. This unit does not have a timer built in hence the good price.  I used my phone stop watch app as a timer. This is a good machine but if you don&#x60;t  follow the directions or know how to work with Gel polish you could ruin your nails and dry out your fingertips. Go to a professional if in doubt. Otherwise you&#x27;ll  Love your nails.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! What a great investment. I have to admit that I was skeptical after reading some reviews on this product and others but I am so happy that I made the decision to choose this one. The lamp works just as well as a salon lamp. My nails looked just like I came from the salon and I didn&#x27;t have to overpay or give a tip! I even used a gel topcoat over regular nail polish. I used BMC UV/LED Gel Nail Art Lacquer Polish Top and Base Coat Manicure Essentials Set, which I also purchased with the lamp.  It only took about ten minutes per hand to completely cure. I&#x27;m not really sure why the gloves that fit all the way up to my elbows were necessary because I will never use them. A nail file was included too, so that is always useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more expensive salon visits with snooty people and long waits...I can do my nails at home, save money and get the same results as a professional!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the lamp for about over a month now and I&#x27;ve used to cure the Kiss brand gel on my nails and toes. It works really well and cured each coat in 2 mins. The polish has been on my toes for 3 weeks with no chipping. Love it!</li>
            <li> I dont use gel polish, i use just regular nail polish. I bought this to use to dry it.  I works great. i bought it about 4 months ago and it hasnt broken or anything.  Now all my nail polish looks great! no more smudges!</li>
            <li> Wife loves it and I soon&#x27;t have to see her waving her hands around trying to dry her nails. lol</li>
            <li> Has everything you need to get started.  Really nice the gloves being included so didn&#x27;t have to purchase separately. So far has worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!! I had a last minute party to attend and didn&#x27;t have time to hit the nail salon. I painted my own nails and tried out this beauty for the first time. It was AWESOME!!! It worked perfectly and dried them quickly. It was a nice change. I didn&#x27;t have to try to get dressed with wet nails! Such a life and time saver! :-D I give it 5 stars and would recommend it to everybody. An added bonus is it&#x27;s portable which means you can take it with you to a girlfriend&#x27;s house when you&#x27;re getting ready for a girl&#x27;s night out!</li>
            <li> Love my uv dryer...now everyone wants to come over and do their nails.  I am also trying to find out other uses for this uv dryer.</li>
            <li> Just received and tried this evening and works wonderfully. Had a little trouble with the postal system getting it but I&#x27;m glad I finally got it.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I was provided this sample in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend tested this over the weekend and loved it. The product came in a very lavish pink box. The unit is approximately the size of an average shoe and slightly taller in height. It weighs about 1.5lbs. It also includes a nail file and a pair of gloves to protect your hand and arm while curing. The unit has a 9W UV lamp to quickly dry your nails.  There is only an on/off switch on the back side of this unit so it is very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that you can only dry one hand at a time and it gets slightly warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great product at a great price. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This UV lamp is a great product. It works every time and does the job! It&#x27;s small and compact for easy storage.</li>
            <li> I purchased his product, and was satisfied the very first time I used it. It gave me that salon look that I wanted to achieve. Great product!!</li>
            <li> What a great investment.  This UV light is all I needed to do my own nails at home.</li>
            <li> after reading negative reviews i was skeptical to buy this product, but i went ahead anyways because it&#x27;s so cheap compared to others. it has lower wattage than some other lights and some people complain that it takes longer to dry their gel nails but i mean really guys, it took two minutes top for each coat. follow the directions on the gel polish bottles and your fine. there&#x27;s no timer by the way (but you can use your phone no big deal). everything was neatly packaged, and came in super quick. BOTTOM LINE: YOU WANT A CHEAP UV LIGHT LAMP THING WHATEVER, THIS IS WHERE YOU STOP LOOKING OKAY? OKAY.</li>
            <li> I just received my package this morning, I already love it! It&#x27;s work great!</li>
            <li> I love this little light. I think this is a MUST HAVE for all you who do your own nails. For those who don&#x27;t, you will start once you&#x27;ve tried this handy little dryer. It works quick and I&#x27;m able to go within 10 minutes! Definitely buy one or two, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I will update this review once I have used it a second time.  It took forever for the gel to dry but I did apply the new color over an old color.  The top coat never did dry, even after an hour.  As I said, this may be because I used it after using a new color and top coat over an old color and top coat. Will start fresh and update review.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly. Works well. I&#x27;m happy and it&#x27;s cute.. 2 gloves came with mine.  Gets the job done. Worth the price</li>
            <li> This product DOES NOT work!!! I had my hand in the uv light for over an hour and it never dried the first clear gel coat of gel nail polish. I do not recommend this product to ANYONE!!</li>
            <li> I was not very happy with the dryer. It does not cure the Gel. I followed the directions but could not get the gel to cure as I did when I used my friends dryer from another brand. It is to bothersome to return it so I am just stuck with it. I do like the gloves to protect your skin and the nail file which was part of the reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> I think once I get the top coat primer, etc. I&#x27;ll completely love it.  I looking forward to seeing if I can make my nails as nice as they do in the nail salon :)</li>
            <li> Very cute lamp good practice to get comfortable and in good condition with all the accessories I recommend Haunted has worked very well ...</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the polish I&#x27;m using, but this is terrible and a huge waste of money. It took me about an hour to paint my nails, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s still not fully dry yet. I estimated that it took about 5 minutes per hand, but I still had to put it back to dry fully. I&#x27;ll try again, but so far, I&#x27;m really not liking this...</li>
            <li> Perfect light perfect size&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a machine that will be so handy&lt;br /&gt;Wish cord was longer but works perfectly on my nails</li>
            <li> This works as well as the professionals used for my last manicure.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This UV light is effective for drying shellac -- it does not seem to be as powerful as salon models and does not have an internal fan, so the drying process is a little bit longer.  But for the price, it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li> This is very cheap and does not dry the gel top coat. It was a waste of money and time. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this UV lamp to make my own cabochons not for gel nail. I used it today and I am very impressed with this lamp. Right out of the box it worked as described. I also liked the fact it came with a great nail file and the protective gloves. I&#x27;ve read some reviews about other lamps and how you have to screw in the bulb, well this lamp is out the box ready. Controlled by one on and off switch. Curing time for my 3d molds is about 2 mins. with enough room to put several molds in at one time. The lamp is not to small but not to big, it is a perfect size if you want to leave it out on a table or tuck in a corner out of the way. I would highly recommend this product. I may review again if my daughter uses it to do her gel manicure.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the USpicy Gel Led Lamp. It arrived earlier then what it was supposed to and was packaged great. This product is a lot nicer than what you would see in stores. It comes with gloves and a nail file. Thanks so much for great service and I will order from you all again in the future!</li>
            <li> I ordered this uv light because of its reasonable price and it&#x27;s reviews. I was extremely excited to receive it the day after I ordered it! It came with everything it&#x27;s said and it cured my gel topcoat in 2 min! I love this little thing and will continue to use it. One problem is once the light goes out I will have to replace it myself. Another con is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a timer and it&#x27;s kinda a small space to put your hand in. I gave this 5 stars because all in all it is a fabulous light and I will continue to use it!:)</li>
            <li> My item arrived in full functioning order. I just unpacked it, plugged it in and voila...simple as that. I find the gloves nice, but cumbersome. My fingers are not as long as the gloves so they get in the way, so I just don&#x27;t use them. My daughter&#x27;s fingers are long enough and work great for her!</li>
            <li> I need to send it back now, I turned the light on and flickers, never stays on, it is more like a torture light than anything else. quite annoying.  Not happy</li>
            <li> Very good quality and price!!!  I have seen very cheap looking ones in the store for much more.  Works well so far no problems</li>
            <li> I love it. I hope I get as many years use as my last light. It works great as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> For the price how could you complain? You have to turn it off manually but is so much bigger than most others personal ones I have seen. And I can fit both of my fit in at once.</li>
            <li> Very professional. Makes acrylic and polish results professional, and lasting! I&#x27;d buy again. I&#x27;ve had this unit for several months, and it fires right up every time. Nail polish dries in just a few minutes.. and will not dent. scratch,  or chip, and lasts until the next manicure!</li>
            <li> This is s great Product! I love that it&#x27;s small, and very portable!  Works great, nail designs lasts weeks!</li>
            <li> I believe I returned this product because it didn&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
            <li> It is very good for drying your nails..just be careful not to leave your fingers under the light for too long as it will burn your fingers just like the sun..  Hence, UV rays..  The seller was very prompt with sending out the product.. I am very pleased..</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and great priced! Very good shipping time!</li>
            <li> I love this lamp. It works great with my gels and is not huge so I can store it with my nail products :)</li>
            <li> It did not work well to dry gel polish.&lt;br /&gt;I had my nails under it for over 10 minutes and it still wasn&#x27;t cured.&lt;br /&gt;I have been doing my own nails with gel polish for quite some time and just needed a new light however this is not the light.&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for however.&lt;br /&gt;I just processed my return request and will be getting a better more expensive light.</li>
            <li> I bought this item in March 2014.  My mistake for not trying to use until July.  Totally dead.  Past 30, 60, 90 days - Can I still return it!</li>
            <li> This product is simple to use and handy because of it&#x27;s size, packs easily for trips, I take it with me all the time with all the bottles I need packed inside.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny, works well and very cute! Love that it came with gloves and a nail file.  The packaging is also cute!</li>
            <li> Product is very nice, and customer care is awesome. The UV lamps works perfectly and is well worth the price. I would definately recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The product had a short in the cord and flickered on for about 10 seconds and then broke and would not turn on. I tried several outlets.</li>
            <li> nice little unit, compact and seems sturdy.  the bulb clicks right into place, snug.  good drying time for a 9w bulb with regular nail polish- haven&#x27;t tried gel/shellac yet. fits one hand at a time, and gets a little warm after both hands and several coats.</li>
            <li> A very nice product!  It is very durable and constructed of high quality materials.  I have used it several times and it really sets the polish quickly.  This nail curer/dryer is one of my most valued assets.  Before owning this product I would have to redo my nails every time I painted them because I would brush up against something or nick them in some way.  I do not have to redo my nails anymore or worry about destroying my polish because this product actually works!  I have already recommended this nail curer/dryer to my friends.  Take my advice and purchase one today!</li>
            <li> I received it in a timely fashion, I thought it&#x27;d take longer, it works great and love the uv gloves that Come included&lt;br /&gt;Due to financial hardship, I had decided to do my part by forgoing my nail salon luxury, It was very hard but now with my uv dryer and all the goodies my hubby gets me from Amazon I can do my own nails and save so much money.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how well this lamp worked because Gelish usually calls for a 36 watt lamp. 9 watts meant I had to keep my hand in there a bit longer but not long enough to complain about. My full manicure was completed and 100% dry in 10 minutes. The U-Spicy 9 watt lamp is not only portable and effective, it is an absolute steal at $17.95! I have experience with three other UV lamps and I would definitely pick this one over the others because of how effective it is.</li>
            <li> This produce works great for the use of a UV lamp. It&#x27;s simple, easy and very light weight. Also the low price makes its even more perfect.</li>
            <li> This unit is really nice,looks like it will last for years,really built to last.I didnt really think that this type of product was available,I always just let me nails air dry.But this works great.I tried it two different ways.I used it with just regular clear nail hardner and once with the gel type of nail polish.The gel type took alittle longer to set and dry than the regular clear.But on both accounts it really set my polish nice and clean.I like it because its small doesnt take up alot of space,and the added bonus to me was that it does have an on and off switch,alot of products the unit turns on by just plugging it in.My only concern is since this has a UV light bulb in this unit,I would think it would warn you about using sunglasses,or some kind of protection for your eyes.The warnings I seen was to use the gloves to protect your skin,and it did state do not look directly at the bulb when it was on.&lt;br /&gt;Felt like I was at a salon! This would make a nice gift.</li>
            <li> prompt delivery...works  great i have had it for several months without failure or problems.  hardens gel well and fine in all wayys</li>
            <li> Loved the packaging.  Gloves, 2 files, and a manual came with it.  Worked when I plugged it in and seems to dry okay (haven&#x27;t fully tested it yet). Came 5 days after ordered on estimated delivery date (July 23-28 and came on July 23). Seems to be in perfect condition so I definitely recommend it!! Is only big enough for one hand though, so if you want to do both at the same time you will need a bigger one.</li>
            <li> For the voltage style price and gloves.....worth every Affordable penny</li>
            <li> Product ok, expected to be perform better</li>
            <li> I love it! Drys fast very convenient, compact and the gloves were great. Good product and affordable.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much....</li>
            <li> Works great and it lasted!</li>
            <li> Especially considering the low cost of this uv lamp, it works really well. I would recommend giving it a shot.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product....this company is stands behind every product that they offer! Nails look fantastic!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a little help drying my nails at home. My fingers didn&#x27;t even get warm after being under the machine for 10 minutes. I ended up using a little desk fan to finish drying my nails</li>
            <li> Okay so I still haven&#x27;t really learned how to use this very well.I may not be good at using it but I think that it works just fine for what I am doing with it. LOL so I forgot to add that everything that was suppose to come with it did. Also for me the build was already in the lamp.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly and well packaged - was actually larger than expected - could cure all 10 toes at once :)</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipment! Like blowwww me away fast! This little machine does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. My only \\&quot;eh\\&quot; is it takes a little longer to dry the shellac than I&#x27;d like. It takes a good 15-20 mins of direct uv light to fully dry the polish. But for the price I think it&#x27;s totally great and a superb machine to start home gel-nailing with! I use the uv protecting gloves provided every time and that&#x27;s nice since it takes a little longer under the light. Happened to notice those gloves cost about $8-$20 sold separately so that&#x27;s a really nice little perk to this kit. I must also mention the company provides terrific customer service and it is def important to them that their customers are happy...quite refreshing. I&#x27;d give 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the longer curing time.</li>
            <li> This is a good lamp, smaller than I expected but gets the job done. I used to have a bigger one that would let you put your whole hand in, with this one you only get to put 4 fingers in at a time (no thumbs). It doesn&#x27;t have a set time button like others meaning you have to turn it on and off yourself. It&#x27;s good for traveling or when you are short of space. I was looking for a cheap lamp that would work good and this one is exactly that. And it comes with a pair of protective fingerless gloves and a nail filer which are a nice gift ( freebies are always nice).</li>
            <li> No problems so far enjoy it very much. Love the way my nails come out. Practicing gel nails a lot.</li>
            <li> Very excited when I received the nail dryer because this was my attempt to do my own shellac gel manicures! The product comes perfectly as advertised &amp; comes with the cute hand gloves &amp; filer. I did have to push the bulb in place before I turned it on to work. I just wish it had a higher voltage or stronger lighting (yes I know it describes as 9W dryer). It took awhile for the coats on the nails to dry (about 2-4min) &amp; I also had to put my thumbs in separately to dry. I wish the during process could be faster but it definitely delivers &amp; my shellac manicures come out great! Overall you get what you pay for &amp; think it&#x27;s my money well spent!</li>
            <li> First of all upon receiving the nail dryer the uv light bulb was broken. So I had to order another bulb. When I first turn the dryer on it made this awful noise like it was going to explode and it never came on again. so I have a dryer that does not work and then the light bulb I ordered arrives. What a mess!!!! Never again a waste of money!!!!!!</li>
            <li> got the next day saved my small biz...</li>
            <li> I have completed two manicures with this lamp and have loved both.  I do not use name brand Gelish or Shellac. I use BlueSky Shellac.  My manicures came out very well.  I was even able to incorporate a small stone in one of my manicures for an accent on my ring fingers.  I look forward to more manicures with this lamp.  A great buy so far!</li>
            <li> I started doing my own nails and purchased this because of the good reviews. However it does not dry or cure the nails at all! It did not do it in three minutes or twenty. It is just two small not a good lamp at all. Do not buy if you are looking for a salon look.</li>
            <li> It works great.  No more nail salons for me.</li>
            <li> Arrived working fine. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but i am familiar with the brand so I know it going to work well. Super fast shipping</li>
            <li> This product meets all claims as advertised. It speeds up the drying time of both gel overlays and regular nail polish. Great for feeling spoiled at home and would work well in a salon. The only downside is you will need two machines if you wish to do both hands at the same time. However, for the price this is a great bargain. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter was shocked when she received this package. It was a set for beginner nail techs. It came with UV glove and a starter kit. In which, my daughter has learned the techniques so far on her own. I just wanted her to have the materials to have to maybe help her become an expert. I received this ahead of schedule and without any damage. Thanks.</li>
            <li> The quality of this mini UV dryer was actually more than I had expected, considering its inexpensive price tag, when compared to others.  If you are just beginning to explore this new fad in nail art, having to buy all these special products just to do so can be money frustrating.  But since you most definitely can&#x27;t do UV GEL nails, without buying a UV light, I&#x27;m definitely recommending this as a great UV Lamp to be able to test out the water with.  * Granted it is small, and for most, only made for one had at a time,  it still gets the job done, nice and well, and in a fair enough amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;  **+ It comes with two little added perks... the gloves for your protection... shows looking out for customers best interest.  And a top grade UV GEL nail filer to help make those little beauties be lookin&#x27; their best! ;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I&#x27;d Definitely recommend this one to all the newl users and or the people who like to keep it simple!</li>
            <li> First off make sure you snap the bulb in as it doesn&#x27;t seem to come connected.  It actually works really well.  I have used for the gel polish and also regular polish.  Definitely worth buying.  No disappointments for this one!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price... satisfied with it!</li>
            <li> product works great easy to use, came in a timely manner even though we have been hit with multiple snow storms I enjoy it !</li>
            <li> The light bulb wattage is too low.  The Gelish polish I bought to use with this says it takes 1 minute to dry under a 36w bulb.  This is a 9 watt bulb.  I kept my hands in it for over 10 minutes and they were not even close to dry.  Get a better machine this one is not worth it!</li>
            <li> This is a great value compared to all of the other expensive lights on the market. I have used this numerous times, and it has not disappointed. I use it with CND shellac and Gelish, and it works great! Its simple on/off switch makes doing my own nails a breeze! Saves me lots of money in going to the salon, too!</li>
            <li> Takes longer than expects to dry nails. If you&#x27;ve got 45mins to an hour then this is your item</li>
            <li> I very happy to get this product . Shipping came in time . I used those lump for my nails with pleasure .</li>
            <li> Great product for price. Gloves are definitely needed and usually don&#x27;t come with. Have had it for 6 months and am very happy with it</li>
            <li> This dryer was purchased for my daughter. She likes to do her own nails and she loves shellac. She uses it every week or two and loves it. She said it works wonderful.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working fine I have had it for a couple months now. Be careful not to dry gel nails no longer than 2 to 3 minutes. It&#x27;s works with UV gel polish and LED gel polish. I even used this with regular nail polish but you have to use a gel top coat to dry you cannot use regular nail polish top coat it will not work.</li>
            <li> excellent product! my wife love it!</li>
            <li> Great little machine. Works perfectly for the price I paid. Very happy with my purchase. Only bad thing is that it burns my skin wen it&#x27;s under the light but it&#x27;s possible it could be because of the gel I&#x27;m using. Otherwise it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> it takes forever to dry your nails with maybe becUse it was cheap but i still ue it jaha jana</li>
            <li> This is a very convenient product to have at home.  I tried it on my nails before going to a family dinner, and it really did speed up the polish drying process.  A couple of my friends are interested in purchasing this nail dryer after trying mine.  I am notorious for messing up my wet nails and having to re-paint one or two of them.  I made it to dinner without any mishaps with my polish...love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item so that I could do gel nails at home. It works exactly as described. I was able to cure my nails within a normal time. This little dryer is well worth the cost.    Note to other buyers--when I first received the dryer, I didn&#x27;t realize that I needed to insert the UV bulb into its socket. You need to get your hand up into the unit and plug it in. Other than that, I had no problems.</li>
            <li> I love doing my own manicures at home because I just do not like others doing my nails unless it&#x27;s something super fancy and intricate. I&#x27;m so glad my friend bought me this for my birthday so now I can do gel manis and pedis at home! I was so happy with this that I had to write a review, and I normally don&#x27;t write reviews for anything so that says a lot. After receiving this wonderful gift, I went straight to the store and got me some Gelish nail polish to try out with this baby. The gel cured wonderfully under this lamp. There was some tacky residue but that&#x27;s normal for all gel polishes. Looooove it! And I would totally recommend this to everyone who&#x27;s interested in doing their own at home manis. I&#x27;m thinking of getting their bigger lamps for faster curing.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it is supposed to do! It doesn&#x27;t dry regular nail polish, but its not meant to, so I&#x27;m not sure why that&#x27;s a complaint in other reviews. Love that it came with UV protection gloves! Happy with my product!</li>
            <li> i thought it would help dry my nails but instead it doesnt and takes for ever to dry with the gel on.</li>
            <li> I had to pick a star. This is a big zero!! I bought this for my wife. She opened it this past weekend. It did not work. The light had to be inserted - no directions on how to do this. User manual little to no information. I would not recommend this product at all. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works awesome for my girls to dry there nails. I dont hear the whole, I fudged a nail help.</li>
            <li> Love it, works like a charm!</li>
            <li> For this price it&#x27;s definitely worth it. I fit my two hands in there at once. Works with gel nails.</li>
            <li> I do not like this.  It did not work and the light hardly stayed on.  Plus...it really damages your nails.  My nails were really think when the polish came off.</li>
            <li> Does not work good at all.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use, effective.  It&#x27;s small though and cannot fit two hands.  works well and I like it on different types of nail polish</li>
            <li> This did not perform the way I expected it to.  Takes way too long to dry, definitely expected more power and quicker results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been quite satisfied with my lamp! Affordable and does the job!! Ive recommended to friends and family who all love as well! I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Very happy to give something this teen really used since she changes her nail polish at least once a day.</li>
            <li> It worked ok, but not much power in the light. Takes longer to dry your nails then I would like. May just be me. I&#x27;m not very patient.</li>
            <li> This works great, now  I don&#x27;t go to sleep thinking my nails are completely dry and wake up to disappointment because I had no patience the night before.  No complaints..  but my free gift kinda cheesy...white UV gloves???</li>
            <li> cannot at this time give  it  a higher  mark until  I but  another  nail  gel  brand... I bout  china  glaze  gel  and  after  thirty minutes  it still DIDNOT dry...China glaze says it&#x27;s products works with  uv or led lights?... this  is  uv???... I went  exactly  step  by  step  guide  of  China  glaze??? 0.don&#x27;t  know, who  to  blame yet  but  have  an  idea it&#x27;s a bit of  both.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and we have been very pleased with it.  Saves a lot of money since we now don&#x27;t have to go to the nail salon for professional looking nails.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> If you do your nails at home and like the gel polish, this UV light nail dryer is the best for you!</li>
            <li> I received this item from the company, and was asked to give my honest review within 10 days. I&#x27;ve had it way longer than that though, cause I really wanted to test it quite a bit, before I post my review.  Personally, I didn&#x27;t have many problems with this lamp. Made me feel like, I really knew what I was doing. Worked fine, my nails looked professionally done. The included glove and nail file are really cute also. Overall, I would say ladies give it a try. Remember you can even do your toe nails in this one.</li>
            <li> The dryer works great. It&#x27;s just what I was looking for. I use it on a daily basis with my clients.</li>
            <li> This product melts the polish on my nails it will not dry and I was informed that I would get a return label and I never did. They gave me a call as well saying that they would but did not follow through. Bad business and I am very disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> It work just fine, I&#x27;ve used it several times now without any issues, it doesent get too hot like some do. The only thing that is inconvienient is it only fits 4 fingers at a time (I have pretty small hands) so I do my thumbs seprately</li>
            <li> Does not cure nails at all had them under the lamp for 20 mins! still not dry! I would save your money!</li>
            <li> I used this quite often for a few months for at home gel nails, it took forever for the gel to set with this and unfortunately my cat knocked it off of my table and ever since I can&#x27;t get it to turn on. I changed the bulb but that didn&#x27;t fix it. I switched to a different brand and have had no issues with gel setting up appropriately.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t Really had a successful go of it. Maybe I&#x27;m not using the right polish, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my polish stay or last any longer using this product like I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Used to get my nails dry in 3 minutes at the nail bar, now with this light that takes OVER 20 min, it absolutely not what I expected.  But I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Works great, very effective for home use on my gel nails.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item so that I could do gel nails at home. It works exactly as described. Very pleases with it.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Wow! The product came so quick and does exactly what it suppose to do. It looks identical to the one they use in a nail salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened it up and immediately used it with CND Shellac products which I purchased at the same time. My nails were done in less than 8 minutes from start to finish. I only used the bottom &amp; top coats. The curing time was only 30 secs to 2 minute for each step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It normally cost me $25-35 for the manicure plus tip every two weeks. I paid 19.99 for this nail dryer and $30 for bottom &amp; top coat CND and $13 for fresh scrub. It seems like a big investment, but I can now enjoy the comfort of staying at home, and hopefully the saving will adds up later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using it for a short time, but so far the uspicy nail dryer has been excellent.</li>
            <li> There was a slight issuse about the color but the company was very fast with letting me know and even faster at taking care of the issue. The product works wonderfully and it was definetly a good investment!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to do my own shellac mani&#x27;s. i really liked it. It was great, my mani&#x27;s lasted forever. on the down side, the polish was so great that it made me think I had &#x27;tephon nails&#x27; needless to say, I do not...&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> Useful:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;finally I have a way to achieve dryed painted nails inmediately, and the size it&#x27;s not so big, it&#x27;s compact</li>
            <li> very good and responsibility</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this for the gel polish, which is what it&#x27;s really for, but it dries my polish (varnish, shellac, whatever) very nicely anyway.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good value, they have lowered the price. Plus, you don&#x27;t have to replace batteries, and it doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li> This lamp is a great purchase.  It performed just as I expected and fulfilled my need to be able to do my own nails (gel/regular).  It works great and equally as important, the price was very affordable.  Just perfect for me!</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t use it, as it takes to long to dry her nails. It&#x27;s been used a few times but 10, 8, and 5 year olds don&#x27;t have the patience to sit for 10 minutes while it dries their nails.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Product as described,  very eaay to use and it only takes a few seconds for the gel polish to dry.</li>
            <li> I choose this product as a first time at home user of uv nail gel polish and uv nail light. When I looked at other products I didn&#x27;t like the prices and your product matched what I could afford and the quality is better than exspected. Very easy to read instructions. And I love the skin protecting gloves. I got my package very quick and no damage was done when arrived. I love your product and I will buy from this seller again. I highly recommend this seller to others</li>
            <li> Works fast and goes a great job of curing nails. I am new to trying gel nails, and having a great time learning with great products.</li>
            <li> I love painting my nails, I also have 3 girls but 2 of them are at the age to get their nails painted. I always have a hard time painting their nails cause they dont like to sit still and they mess them all up. So, when this came in the mail I wanted to try it out right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what is in the box?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail dryer, nail filer and Anti – UV GLOVES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail dryer, its a nice size, just like the ones in the salon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A beautiful pink and white nail filer that is extremely durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and you also get a pair of silky U-Spicy Uv Gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also a manual to help you if you need help or figure our how to use this amazing device. You can use this for various types of nail beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. the nail dryer- What I like about this dryer is the curing window is a nice decent size where you can fit your entire hand or one foot at a time in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can work without using brand requirements on the nail polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer is also high efficiency for faster , drying and its safer, plus compared to salon dryer’s this one is odorless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a chip in the machine as i was reading the manual that increases the reliability and life spand of the device. It also has a disinfection feature while drying your nails. You can use this either at home or at a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are must known factors to know about before using this product,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Make sure the  local ovoltage supply matches the unit, otherwise you can destroy your unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To know if your machine is on the / means its on and the 0 means its off. Make sure you turn the device off when not in use, When changing the bulbs also make sure the device is off,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bulb lasts a life span of 3,000 hours. which is approximately 6 to 12 months if not longer depending how much you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using it at home they suggest you change the bulb every 6 to 12 months , if your using it at a salon then change it every 3 to 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer comes witha soft pair of beautiful long white cloves, they are to be used while drying your nails, I suggest putting them on before painting that way you dont get paint on the gloves trying to put them on. The gloves have holes where the tips of your fingers go. Due to the fact too much UV light can cause radiation damage and can lead to skin cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail filer is very sturdy and durable. This to me a salon styler . It’s white and has pink flowers on it and says U-Spicy, which is wheresuggest putting them on before painting that way you dont get paint on the gloves trying to put them on.

            <li> Great product for the value price!  I love this UV nail dryer.  I used to spend $30 at the salon every other week.  Now I do my own nails at home for a fraction of the price!  Great investment!</li>
            <li> have not tried it yet but its more then I expected. Its really cute and doesn&#x27;t take up alot of space. The fact that it comes with a pair of gloves and file is a plus. I finally got a chance to try after a month and it works great. I left my nails in for 5mins cause I wasn&#x27;t sure how long it would take to dry. My first time working with gel and im excited. I only did a base and top coat, no color, since I just wanted to try both the gel polishes and uv lamp before my son woke up and im happy. Im looking forward to doing a full 4th of July mani.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me but this gets super hot! Besides this annoyance it works as it should!</li>
            <li> Love it it gets the job done!!</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly the first time I ever did my nails.  I had never done it before, but I followed all the directions I had for gel nails and they came out great.  The only thing I wish it had was a timer.  My friend&#x27;s nail dryer had a 45 second timer so we knew to push it twice, but it was much more expensive.  I can use the timer on my phone easily.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and works as it should. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is a great lamp. Lamp came packaged nicely with a nail file and uv protection gloves.  I did not have to snap my bulb in place as some other reviews have mentioned.  Let&#x27;s start with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lamp:  the lamp is UV, not UV/LED so make sure your gel polish doesn&#x27;t require LED. The casing doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;. It has a nice weight and sturdy feel to it.  The depth of the lamp is pretty decent. I have long nails and didn&#x27;t worry about the nail tips hitting the back of the casing. You could fit your whole hand with thumb in if you wanted (I prefer curing thumbs separate so I know I&#x27;m getting full coverage).  I used Sally Hanson brand gel and timed at 3 minutes for it to cure to my liking (make sure to use rubbing alcohol to wipe the tackiness away after curing your gel). I can usually get away with 1 minute with my higher wattage lamp. The extra time to use this lamp is not significant enough to present an issue for me. Other reviewers stated that this worked for regular nail polish. This was NOT the case for me when I tested it just to see. Purchase this lamp for the intent of using gels, etc and NOT regular polish as there isn&#x27;t a fan built into this unit.  The only thing I wish this lamp had was an automatic timed shut off...but again, not significant enough to discourage use. Lamp also does not get super warm like some lamps at the salon so your hands should remain comfortable. I experienced no wrinkling or other curing issues while using this lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nail file: It was a bonus to get a nail file. The file is a pretty pink and white and has a decent thickness to it. I imagine I could wear this file down quickly though. I prefer a file that has a tougher grit.  This one acted more like a fine sander/buffer for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UV Gloves:  The gloves are a white faux silk/acrylic type material. I have larger hands and they fit just fine.  They were snug where they needed to be and comfortable everywhere else. The material is thin and breathable. Stitching on them seems to be sturdy and look as if they will last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great set up, especially for beginners not sure if they want to invest a lot into gel mani/pedi vs traditional polish.&lt;br /&gt;Note: product was sampled to me in exchange for my review so I have done my best to be honest and objective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great light. It&#x27;s light in weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> USpicy UV Acrylic Gel &amp; Shellac Curing Nail Dryer Lamp works just as described. Very happy with the nail dryer.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! The price is barely more than a gel color change and half the cost of a manicure. It works exactly like it should, and it&#x27;s big enough for my toes too. One mani pedi and it&#x27;s more than paid for itself. I&#x27;ve already recommended it to several friends.</li>
            <li> Works great and came with nice gloves and nail file :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit to do at home manicures….sorta. I usually get my nails polished at the salon but I REFUSE to pay for the gel nail polish. Instead, I let them polish my nails then I come home and use a gel top coat (over regular polish) and this lamp is used to dry the gel top coat.Tonight, I let my nails sit under the lamp for an ENTIRE HOUR and the gel polish was still sticky. Then i began to read reviews (while my hand was still under the lamp). I came across a review that mentioned putting rubbing alcohol on tissue to wipe off the sticky residue. IT WORKED!! So, for my left hand, I used the top coat and sat my hand under the lamp for only 10 minutes this time, then I put alcohol on tissue and wiped off the sticky residue ( I should have done if for 15 minutes instead of 10). All done! Im giving this lamp 5 stars for now. Lets see if my polish lasts 2 weeks. If it doesn&#x27;t, Ill definitely give you guys an update. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Works great, fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This is the first UV light I&#x27;ve purchased and it meets my needs and works well, however, based on some trial and error I found I have to double the drying time recommended by the brands I use (IBD, FingerPaints, NailBliss, etc) due to the lower wattage (9w vs. 36w). This is not a problem because this litttle guy is still saving me a TON of time and money by not having to go to a salon in the first place! Shipping was fast, the item was packed extremely well, and the freebies are appreciated although I can&#x27;t say I use the gloves but I like having them nonetheless (say, for a friend to use who might be more concerned about the UV exposure than I am).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unpack the box, unwrap the cord, pop the light in (gently), plug it in and go. I do wish it had a timer but for the price I can&#x27;t complain; I just use a stopwatch-type timer app on my cell phone and read or watch tv while my nails dry. I don&#x27;t mind that I can only do one hand at a time, since I&#x27;m doing this myself, I can only physically DO one hand at a time anyway, LOL! Thank you for bringing an affordable option like this to those of us who have been on the fence about trying gels on our own, and/or other lights are too out of our price range to consider. (Finding replacement bulbs is easy as well when needed so no worries there.) My friend (who is a trained and licensed stylist) was impressed I did my own nails with this and they came out so well and wanted to know where I got it (I guess because it is smaller and more inexpensive light than \\&quot;salon\\&quot; brands but worked just as well, albeit taking a little longer...or maybe because I didn&#x27;t make a complete mess of myself as a new DIY-er, haha). Even she commented my nails looked way better than 3/4 of the people she trained with so if you follow the directions on your products but double the time they recommend based for this wattage lamp (I find that most seem to indicate 36w), you will be well on your way to having lovely nails at a fraction of the price in no time. And if I can do it, anyone can. Seriously :)</li>
            <li> love the dryer though the cord is starting to break after 2 uses and i have not bent or wound the cord up. Breaking at the base where it connects to the dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this i apply gel polish about twice a month to my nails and ive had this product for about 6-7 months and its still working like a charm! Recommended!</li>
            <li> Just receive my UV Acrylic. It arrive on time. I had known problem with the light bulb .I plug the unit in and it did the job. I couldn&#x27;t be happy with it.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!  I tried the USpicy light with CND Shellac polish.  After an HOUR it was not dry.  I tried the light with regular polish.  The hand *outside* the light dried faster.  Spend the money on a higher watt light, or go to the salon, because this product is worthless.</li>
            <li> I think this is a very good size (compact, but not so small you cannot get all your finger nails in there on one hand). However, I have had a couple nail polishes not work with this light, even though they are supposed to work with UV. Therefore, I am unsure if this is a issue with the light or the nail polishes.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for Shellac polish! I love it.  WOrks great! Better than I expected.  Can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li> The product come on time and worked as expected. Used it for 4 times and everything seems fine. A little slower than I expected but that is OK. Lightbulb is working fine, had no problem with it. Hopefully it will keep working like this in the future. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I have used this lamp with Shellac polishes and it&#x27;s fabulous!  I let my nails cure for 4 minutes after each step (base coat, coat of color, another coat of color and top coat) since this is a lower watt bulb, but it works great.  I can squeeze both hands in at once, including my thumbs and be done with the whole mani in about 20 minutes!</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughters... they don&#x27;t live at home, but have told me they love this item.</li>
            <li> when I  received this item  it came in great  condition  and works wonderful</li>
            <li> Product performs as advertised.  Usage time does take longer then most nail gells say to dry, example if it states 30 seconds in directions, I found that in reality it takes 60 seconds......</li>
            <li> Worked better than expected</li>
            <li> Fast and good service , started up a little off but I&#x27;m excited to use it , I&#x27;ll be back to put a more accurate review .. Waiting for the rest of my supplies to get started.</li>
            <li> Worked great didn&#x27;t take long to dry my nails. I use it every time I do my nails now. I would reccomend</li>
            <li> I tried to dry a gel top coat and I wish it had not taken so much time to dry.</li>
            <li> I had ordered a machine with more watts, this one does not dry the nails fast enough or throughly enough. I need to return it.</li>
            <li> The UV led lamp works quite well and fast too. I&#x27;m almost a professional myself!&lt;br /&gt;I will totally recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> We returned this item. 9 watts is not enough drying power. If you want one that works in a reasonable amount of time, go with at least 36 watts. We would like to add that this is a very reliable company. The refund was prompt. Their higher end products are definitely something to consider.</li>
            <li> Works nice with my gel products.</li>
            <li> Used this once and liked it.  It even came with little gloves to wear to protect your fingers from the UV light.</li>
            <li> Great price. Works just as well as the ones in the salon. Great thing is I can change my nails as often as I want for free.</li>
            <li> Works as intended, just too small for my taste</li>
            <li> This worked fine the first time, but it is frankly not helping my UV polish dry much faster. I cant get my fingers in far enough without bumping the back and denting my polish.  On the second use, the bulk was blinking so fast, like it was going to blow, I had to turn it off for fear of having a seizure. On the third use, the bulb blew out. I don&#x27;t even feel like doing the research to find a replacement. Will stick to the salon. The gloves are too small. For my money, I got a nail file.</li>
            <li> This light is easy to use. I leave each coat in 4 minutes instead of 3 just to make sure they cure well.  I&#x27;ve used it several times now and have had no problem.  I knew before I bought it that it doesn&#x27;t have a built in timer, but a cheap timer works great and I paid less for this light. So far I love it.  It came promptly and in excellent shape.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for the original one I had bought in a starter kit.  This works great with the gel nail polish I have.  The only issue I have is that there is no timer on it.  But I just set the timer on my phone and set for a minute and it works great!!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work. waste of money</li>
            <li> This is perfect for home. Wonderful price, convenient size for storage, and works great. I like that it is smaller than the salon sizes (your whole hand isn&#x27;t intended to go in, just the fingers) so you don&#x27;t have to deal with that burning sensation of keeping your entire hand in.&lt;br /&gt;I still use SPF &amp; the gloves it comes with, just for some extra UV protection, but it&#x27;s not as vital for me as it would be if I had to fry my entire hand at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;The smaller size of this great machine also keeps me from rushing and doing a sloppy job on my gel manicures at home. (I&#x27;m impatient!) From start to finish each cycle I do my left 4 fingers first, then right 4 fingers, then my thumbs.&lt;br /&gt;I save SO. MUCH. MONEY. doing gel at home. Plus it&#x27;s kind of my way of Zen-ing out.&lt;br /&gt;I found a blog online called Lulu and Sweetpea, she gives a WONDERFUL tutorial on how to do gel at home. I loved it so much that I even made an account to comment on how awesome she is and to wish her warm toes every night for writing it. :)</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly but arrived broken.  I returned and purchased a different style.  Might be good if you want a small UV light and it arrived in one piece.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really heat up enough but it still does the job. Have to stand there for a quite bit longer but it still does its job.</li>
            <li> I love gel shellac and was going to to the salon to get them because the manicures lasted so long.  It is so nice since I purchased the USpicy Professional UV Acrylic Gel &amp; Shellac Nail Dryer, I can do my own manicures at home and save the money and time going to the salon....  It works wonderful and my nails turn out just like the salon...</li>
            <li> this heater is a great size for home manicures and the uv bulb is a single bulb and should not give off a lot of harmful rays. Great for quick drying nails.</li>
            <li> didnt realize what i was buying when i realized the danger of an ultra violet light i thru it away</li>
            <li> This nail dryer allows me to do professional looking gel nails, and it&#x27;s so easy. It&#x27;s really nice that it comes with anti UV gloves and a nail file. This is a great value for the price!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a nail dryer that will work, I suggest moving on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer was on my wish list, and lucky me, was purchased for me. I was so excited, that within a day of getting it, I decided to go all out and do my nails. I am not a pro, so I do not have high expectations. After drying my hands for a minute and a half, the bulb starts to flicker. Annoying as it was, I had wet nails so I decided to ride it out. Sometimes the light would be out for 5 seconds, and at longer stretched 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured maybe it had something to do with the bulb, so I tried tightening, untightening, moving the cord, shifting the unit - nothing worked. I decided that I would give it another shot. So the next day I plugged it in and turned it on. The SAME thing happened. It worked fabulously for about 2 minutes, before sputtering out.  It&#x27;s a shame because the unit seemed to really pump out some heat before it took a shiz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt bad telling my fiance that we would have to return it. I picked out another unit at a similar price point, so hopefully it will be a better experience.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly i love it</li>
            <li> I received my order in less than a week. My UV light works perfectly and came with a pair of protective gloves along with a cute nail file. I would definitely recommend this product and seller!</li>
            <li> My shipment came days early and I love this bail dryer! Works just as well as the salon dryers. I will do business with this company again. I appreciate the gloves and mini manicure set. I give 10 stars !!!!!!</li>
            <li> this lamp works wonderfully for the money.. Nicely priced..&lt;br /&gt;Have used it several times.. Glad I didn&#x27;t spend a fortune..</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t dry anything. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> Very nice. Just the right size.</li>
            <li> I love my light !! It does exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I read a ton of reviews on this good and bad and it actually works you just need to know how to read directions amd you are good to go. Obviously you need to leave your nails I&#x27;m for longer then the nail salon because the Watt is a lot weaker then what pros use but I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Do not buy. Does not work!!</li>
            <li> I love the lamp. It works great. The size is perfect. It&#x27;s just the right starter uv lamp for me since I&#x27;m just starting out with the whole gel nails and curring thing.</li>
            <li> Very cute and works just as well as the salons do! so affordable and comes in handy for at&lt;br /&gt;Home manis and pedis! this is a must have for any fashonista!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it. It works very well, less time at the salon. Does her nails at home.</li>
            <li> its good but not that fast</li>
