            <li>I have been dying to get this color because it&#x27;s so beautiful and perfect for spring, but I came home to a bottle of China Glaze in Bahamanian Escape.</li>

            <li>What a lovely color...totally perfect for Spring/Summer!  </li>
            <li>Out of the bottle the color is not as blue/grey as it appears online; it&#x27;s more of a perfect lilac.</li>
            <li>A perfect light purple for Spring and Summer!</li>
            <li>Lilacism is a gorgeous color for spring &amp; summer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprisingly neutral</li>
            <li>It does not provide good coverage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect purple too... nice and light.</li>
            <li>Essie makes nice nail polish, and this lilac is a good spring color.  </li>
            <li>I love this nail polish!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and Essie nail polish is the best quality!</li>
            <li>I love this brand!</li>
            <li>Love this polish!</li>
            <li>This creamy pastel lilac looks great with my light skin, but I think it would look equally as nice with a tan.</li>
            <li>so if you are a Ballet Slippers or Limousine kind of gal (or even Fiji)</li>
            <li>Was good and easy transaction.</li>
            <li>Essie&#x27;s a good brand, nice and smooth, wears well.  </li>
            <li>Happy to get it all taken care of, but it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle -</li>
            <li>Would have loved to get this fabulous color...</li>
            <li>At the beginning I wasn&#x27;t sure to order it because in some pictures it looks too whitish; but still I took the risk</li>
            <li>The more I used it the more</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I have received so many compliments</li>
            <li>At night time OPI looks more pinkish.</li>
            <li>What can I say I Love the quality, and the color, is my favorite.   </li>
            <li>received many compliments.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this lilac color.  </li>
            <li>I am buying more bottles</li>
            <li>I have 2 coats on + top coat</li>
            <li>The texture is nice and smooth though I think it requires two coat for even color.</li>
            <li>LOVE this polish.</li>
            <li>i love this color ..</li>
            <li>Flattering to my fair skin tone, but I think that it would look pretty against just about any skin tone.</li>
            <li>The color was a bit bright for me, but eSSIe makes a lot of other great colors.  </li>
            <li>It does not take many coats, even being a light color.</li>
            <li>essie has gorgeous colors and this is by far my favorite</li>
            <li>I want to say that two coats covers just fine for me.  </li>
            <li>This is opaque and the shade is accurate to the one in the photograph.</li>
            <li>pale lilac, looks wonderful with a tan.  </li>
            <li>Super cute and fun for spring/summer.</li>
            <li>Original review:   </li>
            <li>But it looks great, and, as is always my experience with Essie polish, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>This color applies smoothly, rarely chips, and comes off easily.</li>
            <li>I wore it for much of August and September and was constantly complimented on the \\&quot;beautiful shade.\\</li>
            <li>It was nice of them, but I think they need to be more careful.</li>
            <li>It also came really quickly...</li>
            <li>&quot; I love that it lets me stand out without being obnoxious or too loud.</li>
            <li>I think that the drying time is worth it, since these polishes DON&#x27;T CHIP FOR A WEEK.</li>
            <li>Summer fun ..</li>
            <li>It covers just as good as any other color in the Essie brand.  </li>
            <li>I would have even loved any other color from Essie as the mistake, but I do not wear China Glaze products.</li>
            <li>I did have to use three coats to get the right coverage.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for shimmer or shiny shades, this is just right.</li>
            <li>I love the color and it flows on smoothly and lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Great color, requires very few applications and lasts longer than any over the counter manicure.</li>
            <li>Noticed the difference right away on first paint.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact light-purplish color I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>in the bottle it looks even more blue.</li>
            <li>It is not the fastest drying polish I have ever tried, but it is on the higher end.</li>
            <li>All in all, I will be back to buy more.</li>
            <li>The color is exactly what I wanted...</li>
            <li>It applies evenly and very well, and lasts a very long time (up to 5-6 days using Seche Vite as a top coat).</li>
            <li>had I known it would be this much work</li>
            <li>Very in indeed.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for almost two years for a lilac shade without sparkles, and was so excited to finally find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>light lavender with a hint of grey.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not a thick feeling.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very much a periwinkle blue to me,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a dangerous, but beautiful thing.</li>
            <li>As usual, I am incredibly satisfied with my Amazon order.</li>
            <li>I bought this only a few weeks ago and love the shade so much, I&#x27;m already thinking about purchasing an extra in case it gets discontinued.  </li>
            <li>Pretty color, especially for spring, but you&#x27;ll need several coats.</li>
            <li>Sweet on little girls though.</li>
            <li>I had to use two coats to get it completely opaque, but I don&#x27;t mind since it seems to dry relatively fast.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I adore this color and Essie polishes in general!</li>

            <li> Not to mention, Essie is available at Walmart, doesn&#x27;t bubble like Revlon polishes do, and is cheaper than China Glaze, OPI, Chanel, and Sephora (expensive ones seem to chip faster, btw).</li>
            <li> Need lots of coats and takes a while to dry.</li>
            <li> In my experience, I find that the longer a polish takes to dry, the less likely it is to chip and vice versa.</li>
            <li> Definitely one of my favorite brands, I just wish it was a little less expensive per bottle!</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s a purple without too much pink undertone.</li>
            <li> I had stopped painting my nails years ago because every brand I tried chipped off within a few hours of application; therefore, making it a major waste of time to paint my nails (I an not \\&quot;careful\\&quot; with my hands.)</li>
            <li> Essie never chips on me, and I don&#x27;t use base coats, top coats, etc.</li>
            <li> Essie polish is always a little runnier and thinner than other polishes but the staying and anti chipping power makes up for it.</li>
            <li> Like I said before, it would be one thing if they just sent the wrong color, but they sent an entirely different color from an entirely different brand.</li>
            <li> Not a true Essie.</li>
            <li> The only polish I would rank higher than the Essie line is the Nicole line by OPI (which is also sold at Walmart) since it dries super-fast and also does not chip (I&#x27;m talking about not chipping for 3+ weeks).</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be the formula, too thin.  </li>
            <li> so I could send back the wrong color.</li>
            <li> You need at least 3-4 coats.</li>
            <li> Slightly thin- I needed to apply three coats.</li>
            <li> (I mean, the purple smells REALLY bad).</li>
            <li> Downside to the Nicole line is the awful smell when it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m obsessed with the fact that I can get Essie polishes for cheaper on Amazon.com (including shipping!)</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Great Color and Staying Power. takes 3 coats to become opaque. Essie polish is always a little runnier and thinner than other polishes but the staying and anti chipping power makes up for it.</li>
            <li> Lilacism is a gorgeous color for spring &amp; summer. I like that it&#x27;s a purple without too much pink undertone. Perfect on fingernails or toes. Slightly thin- I needed to apply three coats. I ordered from Beauty4U and my package arrived within three days of my order.</li>
            <li> If you like lilacs, this is it! At the beginning I wasn&#x27;t sure to order it because in some pictures it looks too whitish; but still I took the risk and I don&#x27;t regret it. The more I used it the more I love it. My only complaint would be the formula, too thin.  This is not for a last minute mani/pedi.  You need at least 3-4 coats. Since the color is really awesome and I have received so many compliments, I don&#x27;t mind the extra time.   Very very similar to OPI Rumples Wiggin during the daylight.  At night time OPI looks more pinkish.</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect. It&#x27;s the exact light-purplish color I&#x27;ve been looking for. Lilac is a great color on its own, now picture them on your nails! Super cute and fun for spring/summer.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a while this color and finally I Got it.   What can I say I Love the quality, and the color, is my favorite.   Was good and easy transaction. Thank you</li>
            <li> great color for spring.    essie is always reliable when it comes to quality.   received many compliments.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this lilac color.  I want to say that two coats covers just fine for me.  It covers just as good as any other color in the Essie brand.  I am buying more bottles so I know I&#x27;ll have it in case they ever discontinue the color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Essie Lilacism because it&#x27;s purple without being too purple. I wore it for much of August and September and was constantly complimented on the \\&quot;beautiful shade.\\&quot; I love that it lets me stand out without being obnoxious or too loud. And I&#x27;m obsessed with the fact that I can get Essie polishes for cheaper on Amazon.com (including shipping!) than I can anywhere else in my area. It&#x27;s a dangerous, but beautiful thing.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: After writing this review and contacting the sellers, they sent me the correct color and a prepaid postage label so I could send back the wrong color. It was nice of them, but I think they need to be more careful. Like I said before, it would be one thing if they just sent the wrong color, but they sent an entirely different color from an entirely different brand. Happy to get it all taken care of, but it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle - had I known it would be this much work, I would have just bought it from the store!    Original review:   The sellers sent me an entirely different brand and color of nail polish!! I have been dying to get this color because it&#x27;s so beautiful and perfect for spring, but I came home to a bottle of China Glaze in Bahamanian Escape. Would have loved to get this fabulous color... I would have even loved any other color from Essie as the mistake, but I do not wear China Glaze products.</li>
            <li> I bought this color at Walgreens today (paid 8$ for it, eep!) and it&#x27;s definitely not a lilac color that the picture shows that it is. I have 2 coats on + top coat and it&#x27;s very much a periwinkle blue to me, in the bottle it looks even more blue. I definitely do not see the purple at all.  Regardless, I adore this color and Essie polishes in general! Definitely one of my favorite brands, I just wish it was a little less expensive per bottle!</li>
            <li> This is opaque and the shade is accurate to the one in the photograph. Flattering to my fair skin tone, but I think that it would look pretty against just about any skin tone. I had to use two coats to get it completely opaque, but I don&#x27;t mind since it seems to dry relatively fast. In my experience, I find that the longer a polish takes to dry, the less likely it is to chip and vice versa. With Essie however, this does not seem to be the case. It is not the fastest drying polish I have ever tried, but it is on the higher end. I think that the drying time is worth it, since these polishes DON&#x27;T CHIP FOR A WEEK. I am in school 6 days a week, and do my nails once a week on my day off. Essie never chips on me, and I don&#x27;t use base coats, top coats, etc. Not to mention, Essie is available at Walmart, doesn&#x27;t bubble like Revlon polishes do, and is cheaper than China Glaze, OPI, Chanel, and Sephora (expensive ones seem to chip faster, btw). The only polish I would rank higher than the Essie line is the Nicole line by OPI (which is also sold at Walmart) since it dries super-fast and also does not chip (I&#x27;m talking about not chipping for 3+ weeks). Downside to the Nicole line is the awful smell when it&#x27;s wet (I mean, the purple smells REALLY bad). Essie has your standard nail polish smell, and isn&#x27;t offensive. All in all, I will be back to buy more.</li>
            <li> What a lovely color...totally perfect for Spring/Summer!  It&#x27;s surprisingly neutral so if you are a Ballet Slippers or Limousine kind of gal (or even Fiji) this would be a great color to mix into the rotation. Out of the bottle the color is not as blue/grey as it appears online; it&#x27;s more of a perfect lilac. The texture is nice and smooth though I think it requires two coat for even color.</li>
            <li> I love the color and it flows on smoothly and lasts for a long time.  I will definitely purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> Essie makes nice nail polish, and this lilac is a good spring color.  It reminds me of Easter eggs.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish! This creamy pastel lilac looks great with my light skin, but I think it would look equally as nice with a tan. I had been looking for almost two years for a lilac shade without sparkles, and was so excited to finally find it on Amazon! I did have to use three coats to get the right coverage. But it looks great, and, as is always my experience with Essie polish, lasts a long time. I bought this only a few weeks ago and love the shade so much, I&#x27;m already thinking about purchasing an extra in case it gets discontinued.  Thank you Essie!!</li>
            <li> LOVE this polish. The color is exactly what I wanted... light lavender with a hint of grey. Very in indeed.</li>
            <li> Summer fun .. pale lilac, looks wonderful with a tan.  Essie&#x27;s a good brand, nice and smooth, wears well.  I don&#x27;t care for shimmer or shiny shades, this is just right.</li>
            <li> Great color for fall! It does not take many coats, even being a light color. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best nail polish I have ever used.  I had stopped painting my nails years ago because every brand I tried chipped off within a few hours of application; therefore, making it a major waste of time to paint my nails (I an not \\&quot;careful\\&quot; with my hands.) But this polish lasts up to six days before it shows any signs of wear. That&#x27;s a record for me. The color was a bit bright for me, but eSSIe makes a lot of other great colors.  I will continue to buy this brand from now on.</li>
            <li> i love this color .. everyone loved it and wanted it !!! essie has gorgeous colors and this is by far my favorite</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and Essie nail polish is the best quality! It also came really quickly... As usual, I am incredibly satisfied with my Amazon order.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this color. A perfect light purple for Spring and Summer! To get the purple to show up, it requires about 3-4 layers but it&#x27;s not a thick feeling.</li>
            <li> Wonderful polish. Great color, requires very few applications and lasts longer than any over the counter manicure. I love this brand!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful nail polish. It applies evenly and very well, and lasts a very long time (up to 5-6 days using Seche Vite as a top coat). Whenever I wear it, I receive lots of compliments on the color!!</li>
            <li> Not a true Essie. Noticed the difference right away on first paint.  Need lots of coats and takes a while to dry. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> This color is perfect for the spring. It&#x27;s like you have easter eggs on your nails! It&#x27;s the perfect purple too... nice and light.</li>
            <li> Love this polish! Whenever it goes with an outfit you bet this is what I&#x27;m wearing! I work in customer service and every day I wear this polish I receive countless complements. This color applies smoothly, rarely chips, and comes off easily. Perfect.</li>
            <li> Pretty color, especially for spring, but you&#x27;ll need several coats. It does not provide good coverage. Sweet on little girls though. My granddaughter loves to wear it on her toes!</li>
