            <li>It is a great product &amp; I have already ordered another color.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>

            <li>Great color</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>said and my nails looked very nice.  </li>
            <li>and it still look good.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say that using it with the top coat was that great.  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this brand of polish!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>Love this polish!</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more in a polish!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>I am hoping they come out with more in the warm neutral family.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is the light sheer color that makes it seem so perfect after 7 days but nonetheless, it is beautiful and I am 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>This nail polish dries very quickly and stays on for over a week!</li>
            <li>my daughters favorite</li>
            <li>You can build it up more for more opaque color.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Is more of a creamy peach with sparkles in it.</li>
            <li>Love these polishs.</li>
            <li>They stay for a week with the top coat.</li>
            <li>so I do not do well with many polishes</li>
            <li>I use it with the Vinylux top coat.</li>
            <li>Product does not perform to expectations, mine or manufacturers regardless of how many blog spots I read or tips tried.</li>
            <li>My favorite of all colors.  </li>
            <li>It adds the best sparkle, especially in the sun.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the top coat.</li>
            <li>and then Seche Vite top coast</li>
            <li>for the top coat..</li>
            <li>I find 3 coats plus the top coat for a total of 4 is ideal.</li>
            <li>Color was lighter than expected but wears great!!</li>
            <li>My nails peel and wear easily</li>
            <li>but I bought this because I like a light shade with sparkle.  </li>
            <li>, looks great and truly DOES last the full week.</li>
            <li>CND is my new favorite!</li>
            <li>This color is a great combination of light pink and sparkle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty and light for summer.</li>
            <li>but I do a lot of dishes and work at an elementary school, so if I&#x27;m using my hands a lot, it will last more like 4 days (which is way better than even my favorite Essie brand polish).</li>
            <li>Love it!!!Lasts a good week at leastWill be ordering other colors.....</li>
            <li>it gives me the best results- polish remover with any kind of moisturizing element will not clean them well enough to bond to the nail as it&#x27;s designed.</li>
            <li>After much trial and error, I love Vinylux.</li>
            <li>The polish lasted a full two weeks without a chip.</li>
            <li>I prefer a full coverage.</li>
            <li>But with a quick touch up, it then lasts the seven days.</li>
            <li>The nail polish came a day before expected which was nice, however the color is not as shown in the picture!</li>
            <li>The color is gorgeous!!!Light,subtle sparkle with a very elegant light pink color.</li>
            <li>This particular color is not as pretty as the Shellac version, which I LOVE.</li>
            <li>If you have a salon nearby, it&#x27;s worth checking out the colors in person and then ordering the colors you like online.</li>
            <li>Fresh-</li>
            <li>This is lovely polish &amp; the first that I have ever used on natural nails with any &#x27;success&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Right now I had this polish on for over a week</li>
            <li>The color is still pretty, though.</li>
            <li>This product will last 7 days with the top coat.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really nice pink color but noting close to what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>These polishes are OK - but don&#x27;t equal my gel manicure I get at the salon.  </li>
            <li>It is more sheer and very sparkly.</li>
            <li>The top coat also helps it to dry really fast saving me lots of time!</li>
            <li>This product definitely helps make my beauty routine easier, which is very important since I&#x27;ve got a busy 5&lt;br /&gt;&amp; 7 yo!!</li>
            <li>I love the colors and the fact that it lasts a long time without chipping!</li>
            <li>and it stays on VERY well for over a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it that much of a try.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely buy more natural sparkle colors.</li>
            <li>As with other VINYLUX polish, don&#x27;t forget your VINYLUX top coat.</li>
            <li>My friend at work has the polishes easily last for a full week plus.  </li>
            <li>Very light with a sparkly touch almost like a clear with a hint of pink and sparkles.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s less sparkly and more matte.</li>
            <li>The polish is not as pink as shown but fine for me.  </li>
            <li>super cute sheer glittery color, but doesn&#x27;t last as long as I was hoping.  </li>
            <li>so they shine a little more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about a light skin-tone color; not all that pink.</li>
            <li>Think that is due to light pigment.</li>
            <li>New color - couldn&#x27;t get it at the beauty supply shop nearby</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more translucent than sheer... and not TOO pink.</li>
            <li>If anyone wants it I&#x27;ll sell it to you for $2 over 1st class shipping costs (just for my trouble and envelope) if you want to try it on the cheap.  </li>
            <li>This is really pretty and sheer.</li>
            <li>i LOVE CND Vinylux and own a few other colors that I really like, it&#x27;s hard to choose a fave.</li>
            <li>Not bad if you mix with other polishes</li>
            <li>so your  natural nail shows through.</li>
            <li>Vinylux polish does last a whole week.</li>
            <li>This is not any more long lasting than any other polish.</li>
            <li>Pretty pink, but the semi-opaque color isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>for the &#x27;Grapefruit Sparkle&#x27; color, it IS very sheer, needs at least 2 coats (I did 2 coats but could have done 3) and is a very light color</li>
            <li>When the bottle is new, 3 coats are needed for coverage, then 2 only once the polish gets thicker.</li>
            <li>This one is lovely and delicate but definitely needs 3 coats of color.</li>
            <li>This product  work as advertise by lasting at least a week or more.  </li>
            <li>I love pale pink.</li>
            <li>This item is not pink.</li>
            <li>However, ALL other colors I&#x27;ve used by CND rock and really do stay on for a week.</li>
            <li>too pink and too sparkly, not subtle, not dainty-looking at all.</li>
            <li>The sparkle is subtle and very fine and it&#x27;s not like big pieces of glitter that you see in other sparkle polishes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been search high and low for a \\&quot;baby\\&quot; pink for when my nails are in a growth period.</li>
            <li>The grapefruit sparkle is a very natural looking pink color that is sheer</li>

            <li> The grapefruit sparkle is a very natural looking pink color that is sheer</li>
            <li> With 2 coats of color it doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> I know these Vinylux polishes work on a lot of people, but apparently I&#x27;m not one of them.  </li>
            <li> Too much grey in a lot of the neutrals</li>
            <li> This lasted just as long for me</li>
            <li> My nails peel and polish typically peels right off within a day, or at least starts to chip.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> This is a very sheer pale almost white nail polish with sparkle.</li>
            <li> This did not stay on my nails - caused them to become very dry and peel.</li>
            <li> While it is not gel, clearly, it does not hold up very well, some colors do not correspond to the same colors in shellac, and the worst thing of all - the product does not go on the nail smoothly - it stays streaky and does not give you that thick glossy finish that shellac does.</li>
            <li> translucent pink sparkle</li>
            <li> Much less saturated color than I expected and a shimmer finish which never lasts long.</li>
            <li> On me it was no better than regular polish.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t even hand wash dishes other than my dogs water &amp; food bowls.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only negative with Vinylux.</li>
            <li> This one is definitely the worse color I&#x27;ve own/seen:</li>
            <li> but you have to buy the CND base to get the full effect.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s 7 day claim whether you are hard on your nails or not.</li>
            <li> Slow shipping.</li>
            <li> I had to put 3 thick coats on just to make it look like I had polish on.</li>
            <li> I took my acrylic nails off after 20 years and I like just a little something on them while they are recovering from the damage fake nails do.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not a good color with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> Sadly...</li>
            <li> I do have very thin nails if that makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> Base coat, 2 of this</li>
    </ol>

            <li> my daughters favorite</li>
            <li> New color - couldn&#x27;t get it at the beauty supply shop nearby but you had it!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have use CND shellacs for years and they are the best product on the market. However, Vinilux series are not at all living up to the same standards in it&#x27;s class. While it is not gel, clearly, it does not hold up very well, some colors do not correspond to the same colors in shellac, and the worst thing of all - the product does not go on the nail smoothly - it stays streaky and does not give you that thick glossy finish that shellac does. Frankly, I think it is even inferior to a regular OPI  nail polish. Dissappointed.</li>
            <li> super cute sheer glittery color, but doesn&#x27;t last as long as I was hoping.  I got like 2 or 3 days....</li>
            <li> The grapefruit sparkle is a very natural looking pink color that is sheer so your  natural nail shows through. The sparkle is subtle and very fine and it&#x27;s not like big pieces of glitter that you see in other sparkle polishes. The polish does last well beyond it&#x27;s 7 day claim whether you are hard on your nails or not. If you have a salon nearby, it&#x27;s worth checking out the colors in person and then ordering the colors you like online. Love this product!</li>
            <li> The color is gorgeous!!!Light,subtle sparkle with a very elegant light pink color.Love it!!!Lasts a good week at leastWill be ordering other colors.....</li>
            <li> i LOVE CND Vinylux and own a few other colors that I really like, it&#x27;s hard to choose a fave. This one is definitely the worse color I&#x27;ve own/seen: too pink and too sparkly, not subtle, not dainty-looking at all. will be giving this away.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of polish! I love the colors and the fact that it lasts a long time without chipping! The top coat also helps it to dry really fast saving me lots of time!</li>
            <li> The color in the photo does not match the color on my nails</li>
            <li> After much trial and error, I love Vinylux. My nails peel and polish typically peels right off within a day, or at least starts to chip. Vinylux has made them stronger again. I do prep my nails with Scrub Fresh- it gives me the best results- polish remover with any kind of moisturizing element will not clean them well enough to bond to the nail as it&#x27;s designed. I find 3 coats plus the top coat for a total of 4 is ideal. With 2 coats of color it doesn&#x27;t last as long. I like to wear darker or bolder colors, but with a tan I love pale pink. This one is lovely and delicate but definitely needs 3 coats of color. I am hoping they come out with more in the warm neutral family. Too much grey in a lot of the neutrals and it&#x27;s not a good color with my skin tone. That&#x27;s my only negative with Vinylux.</li>
            <li> This is really pretty and sheer. You can build it up more for more opaque color. Lasts FOREVER.</li>
            <li> CND is my new favorite! A manicurist introduced me to this and I absolutely LOVE it. The polish lasted a full two weeks without a chip. The only reason I removed it is because my nails grew out. I can&#x27;t use gel/shellac because it damages my nails. This lasted just as long for me and my nails are still in great shape.</li>
            <li> Binylux Weekly Nail Polish was advertised to stay on a week.  I like the polish.  I put on 2 coats of polish and a coat of the topcoat like the directions said and my nails looked very nice.  The big problem is that the polish was chipped and pealing after only two days.  I would not buy this product again</li>
            <li> Very light with a sparkly touch almost like a clear with a hint of pink and sparkles.  I took my acrylic nails off after 20 years and I like just a little something on them while they are recovering from the damage fake nails do.</li>
            <li> Vinylux polish does last a whole week. When the bottle is new, 3 coats are needed for coverage, then 2 only once the polish gets thicker.</li>
            <li> Did not look like the color on the bottle. It is more sheer and very sparkly. Not bad if you mix with other polishes</li>
            <li> Lasts well, but takes about 5 coats to even show up.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, unless you are looking to layer with it.</li>
            <li> Love! Love! Love this polish!</li>
            <li> Much less saturated color than I expected and a shimmer finish which never lasts long. It&#x27;s a shame.</li>
            <li> I like the Vinylux because it is quick-drying. This particular color is not as pretty as the Shellac version, which I LOVE. It&#x27;s less sparkly and more matte. The color is still pretty, though.</li>
            <li> Pretty pink, but the semi-opaque color isn&#x27;t for me. I prefer a full coverage. For me, this polish lasts around four days before it starts to chip at the tip. But with a quick touch up, it then lasts the seven days. As with other VINYLUX polish, don&#x27;t forget your VINYLUX top coat.</li>
            <li> Did not last but two days</li>
            <li> This item is not pink. Is more of a creamy peach with sparkles in it.</li>
            <li> Love these polishs. They stay for a week with the top coat. I like this color on my toes so they shine a little more.</li>
            <li> This is lovely polish &amp; the first that I have ever used on natural nails with any &#x27;success&#x27;. My nails peel and wear easily so I do not do well with many polishes but this goes on well, looks great and truly DOES last the full week. I am on day 7, have no wear or chips &amp; don&#x27;t even  need to redo my nails yet. It is still perfect. With the exception of the short period of time that I had acrylic nails I have never had a polish last like this one. It is a great product &amp; I have already ordered another color.&lt;br /&gt;As for the &#x27;Grapefruit Sparkle&#x27; color, it IS very sheer, needs at least 2 coats (I did 2 coats but could have done 3) and is a very light color but I think it&#x27;s beautiful. Maybe it is the light sheer color that makes it seem so perfect after 7 days but nonetheless, it is beautiful and I am 100% satisfied. RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> Great transaction. Nice product.</li>
            <li> This color is a great combination of light pink and sparkle. I use it with the Vinylux top coat. This nail polish dries very quickly and stays on for over a week! Couldn&#x27;t ask for more in a polish!</li>
            <li> I have a friend that uses this product and loves it.  This did not stay on my nails - caused them to become very dry and peel.</li>
            <li> The color has sparkles, didn&#x27;t notice that in the picture. Takes forever to dry. Think that is due to light pigment. However, ALL other colors I&#x27;ve used by CND rock and really do stay on for a week.</li>
            <li> Great color and it looks awsome after 8 days!</li>
            <li> Great product but you have to buy the CND base to get the full effect.</li>
            <li> Product does not perform to expectations, mine or manufacturers regardless of how many blog spots I read or tips tried. Non returnable even in unused. Beware! Slow shipping.</li>
            <li> translucent pink sparkle</li>
            <li> My favorite of all colors.  I layer it with a solid color underneath.  It adds the best sparkle, especially in the sun.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Once again, the color is deceiving but I bought this because I like a light shade with sparkle.  The polish is not as pink as shown but fine for me.  This product will last 7 days with the top coat.  I would definitely buy more natural sparkle colors.</li>
            <li> Just enough sparkle and it&#x27;s more translucent than sheer... and not TOO pink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been search high and low for a \\&quot;baby\\&quot; pink for when my nails are in a growth period. And THIS is the color I&#x27;ve been searching for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that using it with the top coat was that great.  I didn&#x27;t like the top coat. I&#x27;ve been using this just like regular nail polish.  Base coat, 2 of this and then Seche Vite top coast and it stays on VERY well for over a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the top coat..I didn&#x27;t give it that much of a try.  If anyone wants it I&#x27;ll sell it to you for $2 over 1st class shipping costs (just for my trouble and envelope) if you want to try it on the cheap.  Reply to this review if you want it and we can work out the details.</li>
            <li> This is a very sheer pale almost white nail polish with sparkle. If you are looking for a lot of coverage, this is not for you. It&#x27;s very pretty and light for summer.</li>
            <li> This product  work as advertise by lasting at least a week or more.  Right now I had this polish on for over a week and it still look good.</li>
            <li> Needs 3 coats but great color!</li>
            <li> Love this color!!! Sometimes it lasts me a week...but I do a lot of dishes and work at an elementary school, so if I&#x27;m using my hands a lot, it will last more like 4 days (which is way better than even my favorite Essie brand polish). Yay! This product definitely helps make my beauty routine easier, which is very important since I&#x27;ve got a busy 5&lt;br /&gt;&amp; 7 yo!!</li>
            <li> I know these Vinylux polishes work on a lot of people, but apparently I&#x27;m not one of them.  My friend at work has the polishes easily last for a full week plus.  On me it was no better than regular polish.  I&#x27;ve tried twice.  I do have very thin nails if that makes a difference.  I have a dish washer so I don&#x27;t even hand wash dishes other than my dogs water &amp; food bowls.  Even after just that, I have chips.</li>
            <li> When looking at the picture you assume it&#x27;s a solid color. Wrong. Beware that it&#x27;s almost opaque. It&#x27;s a really nice pink color but noting close to what I was expecting. I had to put 3 thick coats on just to make it look like I had polish on. Maybe it&#x27;s my fault for not reading the shimmer part.</li>
            <li> Color was lighter than expected but wears great!!</li>
            <li> This is regular polish. This is not any more long lasting than any other polish. Kinda bummed.</li>
            <li> The nail polish came a day before expected which was nice, however the color is not as shown in the picture! It&#x27;s about a light skin-tone color; not all that pink. :c but it&#x27;s a good product so 4 stars!!</li>
            <li> These polishes are OK - but don&#x27;t equal my gel manicure I get at the salon.  Sadly...</li>
