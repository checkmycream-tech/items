    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for us!</li>
            <li>Its a wonderful leave in conditioner</li>
            <li>I buy Garnier Frutis Orange Argan oil bottle that leaves my hair smelling wonderful</li>
            <li>Very good product and DOES help with split ends!</li>
            <li>it works great for my hair</li>
            <li>This product works well and smells great.</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>The scent was pleasant as well.</li>
            <li>however I have not found the perfect product to remove tangles easily.</li>
            <li>and if you don&#x27;t like to use conditioner all the time this is a good alternative .</li>
            <li>even if i straighten it, if i put this product in while/before straightening it my hair looks 20 times better!</li>
            <li>My children, ages 14 and 7, use this product for their mixed/curly hair and we love it!  </li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>It gets a star for smelling nice.</li>
            <li>I liked this leave in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;PS, it does smell nice.</li>
            <li>I love this product but it came with a fabric defect, the spray cap is not working</li>
            <li>As a leave in conditioner for tangles, it works great (which is why I gave it three stars) but for split ends I had very so-so results.</li>
            <li>My hair has felt softer and looked better since I began using it.  </li>
            <li>so I just rinse and go most days and spray in the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I find that when I don&#x27;t use this product, my hair is in way better condition (no pun intended).</li>
            <li>the spray was better, I would give a &amp;#34;5&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have used many different conditioning sprays but this one is cheap and works great!</li>
            <li>This is a good leave in conditioner, keeps the hair very moist.</li>
            <li>The pump/spray does need some work as it sprays more like a stream than a full coverage spray thus 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li>I have fine, then hair</li>
            <li>with this product my hair becomes much softer and smoother and more bouncy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I tested it on a section of clean damp hair.</li>
            <li>Smells pleasant with a white, thicker liquid when sprayed in palm.</li>
            <li>I started using this product a couple of months ago, and for the most part, I really like what it does for my hair.</li>
            <li>Not as effective as spraying on hair directly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad hair product.</li>
            <li>So far pleased.</li>
            <li>I have been pleased with this product so far.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair and only get it trimmed about twice a year, and this line of products is great for taming my splits ends in the interim.</li>
            <li>My frizz is usually pretty uncontrollable, but this made my hair feel softer and kept the frizz under control.</li>
            <li>Overall, I was pleased with the results on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a skincare routine that&#x27;s worked well for me for several years, and for the most part, I might get a zit once in a while, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well with the conditioner</li>
            <li>so I have to spray it into my hand first.</li>
            <li>Not only did this product give me MORE split ends than I had, it completely dries out my hair as well!</li>
            <li>Smooths on hair nicely with little effort.</li>
            <li>I used this daily for two weeks and noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It feels stringy, as if I ran too much mousse or hair spray into it.</li>
            <li>Tresemme, next time don&#x27;t go cheap on the pump itself.</li>
            <li>Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>gave this product two stars because it really did help my hair.</li>
            <li>But it really destroyed my face for a while.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>You SO much</li>
            <li>However, the bottle doesn&#x27;t really spray evenly</li>
            <li>It provides better conditioning than other, more expensive brands, and I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave their hair yucky looking, like brands we&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found it is far easier to put some of the conditioner into my hand and work gently through my hair.  </li>
            <li>I used it in damp hair after my showers for about a month straight and saw almost no reduction in the frizz of my split ends or improvement in general.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually one with problem skin.</li>
            <li>I stayed consistent in my skin care routine, staying extra diligent in washing 2x a day, using all the products that have always worked for me... but no results.</li>
            <li>So many times I use too much product and my hair is left feeling heavy and greasy, but I have not found that with this product.  </li>
            <li>First, the liquid is the consistency of regular conditioner (the kind you rinse out) but slightly thinned down with water.</li>
            <li>i bought this product because my hair is a bit damaged, i straighten it more than i should and it became lifeless and dull.</li>
            <li>Makes hair soft and not oily helps  alot with after shower brushing</li>
            <li>I took out the twist and it was soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>My hair is natural</li>
            <li>/&gt;It tames my flyaway hair and leaves my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>2 shampoos later, my face started to clear up.</li>

            <li> but it makes my hair soft and silky without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> The only time it will leave your hair crunchy or greasy is of you don&#x27;t fully dry your hair after applying it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After towel drying, I just spray it onto my daughter&#x27;s hair and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> I use this product as directed and finish with a blow dry and styling.</li>
            <li> I just be careful not to over spray my hair</li>
            <li> It could be because my hair is a little dry from dying it (not recently, old dye job that I&#x27;m trying to grow out)</li>
            <li> However, shortly after starting to use this product, I started getting a new deep, swollen, painful pimple almost every day, all over my face.</li>
            <li> I have colored hair that is a little dry</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; is so thick that it squirts out of the bottle, almost like regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews in hopes it would make my constant split ends come to a slow halt.</li>
            <li> Will try using less.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t detangle the hair, it doesn&#x27;t add any moisture; it made my hair a sticky, hard-to-comb mess.</li>
            <li> but I think it is also making my hair a little greasy.  </li>
            <li> and I will use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m just waiting for the scars to fade, hopefully before my wedding in a few months... :</li>
            <li> Ladies, this product is the worse excuse for leave-in conditioner</li>
            <li> The instructions say that after you&#x27;ve put it on and combed your hair all the way through, you just leave it in and go on as usually.</li>
            <li> Did that, what I got was very nasty clumped together hair towards the top of my head.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Then I twisted the section and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> This product sucks</li>
            <li> my hair type is medium-long length and not too thick or thin and wavy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still very thick, and too think for the type of spray nozzle they used with the bottle.</li>
            <li> This makes it difficult to distribute the product evenly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, for the past couple of months, I have also had a terrible ongoing breakout on my face.</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m really disappointed in you, TRESemme.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product but it came with a fabric defect, the spray cap is not working so I have to open it to use it, no big deal but not my preference either.</li>
            <li> i bought this product because my hair is a bit damaged, i straighten it more than i should and it became lifeless and dull. with this product my hair becomes much softer and smoother and more bouncy! even if i straighten it, if i put this product in while/before straightening it my hair looks 20 times better! my hair type is medium-long length and not too thick or thin and wavy</li>

It&#x27;s perfect for us!</li>
            <li> It gets a star for smelling nice. THAT&#x27;S IT. Don&#x27;t be deceived buy the quantity of product you receive. First, the liquid is the consistency of regular conditioner (the kind you rinse out) but slightly thinned down with water. It&#x27;s still very thick, and too think for the type of spray nozzle they used with the bottle. This makes it difficult to distribute the product evenly. The instructions say that after you&#x27;ve put it on and combed your hair all the way through, you just leave it in and go on as usually.

            <li> I have used many different conditioning sprays but this one is cheap and works great! I have long hair and only get it trimmed about twice a year, and this line of products is great for taming my splits ends in the interim.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my split ends. As a leave in conditioner for tangles, it works great (which is why I gave it three stars) but for split ends I had very so-so results. I used it in damp hair after my showers for about a month straight and saw almost no reduction in the frizz of my split ends or improvement in general.

            <li> it works great for my hair</li>
            <li> This product works well and smells great. Its a wonderful leave in conditioner and I will use it everyday. The pump/spray does need some work as it sprays more like a stream than a full coverage spray thus 4 stars instead of 5. Tresemme, next time don&#x27;t go cheap on the pump itself.</li>
            <li> I liked this leave in. I used it as a leave in and a detangler. I tested it on a section of clean damp hair. First I smoothed a small dab of extra virgin coconut oil on hair and ends, then sprayed the conditioner twice in my hand, rubbing hands together and then smoothed it on my hair, all of this focusing on the ends and smoothing in a downward motion. Then I twisted the section and let it air dry. I took out the twist and it was soft and moisturized. I used this for my entire head after this test, even using a bit of it to detangle hair after the wash. Smells pleasant with a white, thicker liquid when sprayed in palm. Smooths on hair nicely with little effort. So far pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American with relaxed hair. Ladies, this product is the worse excuse for leave-in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever had the displeasure of using. It doesn&#x27;t detangle the hair, it doesn&#x27;t add any moisture; it made my hair a sticky, hard-to-comb mess. The &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; is so thick that it squirts out of the bottle, almost like regular conditioner. I even tried making some of the conditioner with a bunch of water in another spray bottle -- it didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really disappointed in you, TRESemme. Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS, it does smell nice.</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with this product so far.  I found it is far easier to put some of the conditioner into my hand and work gently through my hair.  My hair has felt softer and looked better since I began using it.  So many times I use too much product and my hair is left feeling heavy and greasy, but I have not found that with this product.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It does detangle my hair and my hair feels healthier but I think it is also making my hair a little greasy.  Will try using less.</li>
            <li> I started using this product a couple of months ago, and for the most part, I really like what it does for my hair. My frizz is usually pretty uncontrollable, but this made my hair feel softer and kept the frizz under control. Overall, I was pleased with the results on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for the past couple of months, I have also had a terrible ongoing breakout on my face. I&#x27;m not usually one with problem skin. I have a skincare routine that&#x27;s worked well for me for several years, and for the most part, I might get a zit once in a while, but that&#x27;s about it. However, shortly after starting to use this product, I started getting a new deep, swollen, painful pimple almost every day, all over my face. They were big ones, that stuck around for a lot longer than I&#x27;m used to. I stayed consistent in my skin care routine, staying extra diligent in washing 2x a day, using all the products that have always worked for me... but no results. Finally, I remembered that I had started using this product about the same time I started breaking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I cut this spray from my routine, and guess what? 2 shampoos later, my face started to clear up. Now I&#x27;m just waiting for the scars to fade, hopefully before my wedding in a few months... :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product two stars because it really did help my hair. It&#x27;s not a bad hair product. But it really destroyed my face for a while.</li>
            <li> This is a good leave in conditioner, keeps the hair very moist. My hair is natural so I just rinse and go most days and spray in the conditioner.  I wish it were cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have never used a leave in conditioner before trying out this one. I read the reviews in hopes it would make my constant split ends come to a slow halt. WRONG! Not only did this product give me MORE split ends than I had, it completely dries out my hair as well! I find that when I don&#x27;t use this product, my hair is in way better condition (no pun intended). Don&#x27;t waste your money! I buy Garnier Frutis Orange Argan oil bottle that leaves my hair smelling wonderful and so so so silky! This product sucks</li>
            <li> I have colored hair that is a little dry so it I suffer from winter flyaway hair.  I tried several products that did not work.  This does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tames my flyaway hair and leaves my hair soft.  The sprayer is messed up though. It does spray out in a stream rather than in a spray, which I would prefer.  I just be careful not to over spray my hair so it doesn&#x27;t appear greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the spray was better, I would give a &amp;#34;5&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I use this product as directed and finish with a blow dry and styling. It is the only leave-in conditioner I like. I have fine, then hair but it makes my hair soft and silky without weighing it down. The only time it will leave your hair crunchy or greasy is of you don&#x27;t fully dry your hair after applying it.</li>
            <li> I bought to remove my tangles. It works pretty well with the conditioner however I have not found the perfect product to remove tangles easily.</li>
            <li> This product is great. IT DOES NOT MAKE YOUR HAIR GREASY OR STRINGY!!!  The only problem would be that the pump does not distribute evenly. But all you have to do is run your fingers or comb through your hair after you spray. Very good product and DOES help with split ends!</li>
            <li> After a summer of damaging my hair with the sun, swimming and bleaching it I thought it would never recover. I used this daily for two weeks and noticed a huge difference. The scent was pleasant as well.</li>
            <li> Love this! and i only have to wait 3 days to have it in myy hands!! Thanks You SO much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, and leaves my hair soft. However, the bottle doesn&#x27;t really spray evenly so I have to spray it into my hand first. Not as effective as spraying on hair directly</li>
