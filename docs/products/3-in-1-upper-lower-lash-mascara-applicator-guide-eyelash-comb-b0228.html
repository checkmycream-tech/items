            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I think this is cool!!</li>
            <li>Does a good job of keeping mascara off your eyelids so you don&#x27;t have to clean up after applying.</li>
            <li>a good magnifying mirror,  I can see to get the mascara on and with this, it always goes on clean.  </li>
            <li>I ordered 4 more.  </li>
            <li>Wished I had bought more for friends.</li>
            <li>Just bought 4 more for my friends</li>
            <li>also it uses more mascara using this, a lot more seems to get onto the comb than my lashes.</li>
            <li>And very easy to clean and store.</li>
            <li>Allows easy application of mascara, including brushing out the clumps.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are cheap and easily lost.</li>
            <li>So simple but very effective and easy.</li>
            <li>and I liked it so much</li>
            <li>/&gt;These should be available in all drugstores.  </li>
            <li>I love this so much!</li>
            <li>I have to order another one because I&#x27;m pretty sure my friend took this from me after she tried using it.</li>
            <li>I had bought one the first time</li>
            <li>Works exactly as intended.</li>
            <li>but i feel like theyre using double or maybe more mascara by using this.</li>
            <li>It makes it easy to grab every lash all the way at the base so that you can get the best coverage and definition.  </li>
            <li>and it really does help out a lot.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>only downside is it is a pain to clean</li>
            <li>I use a makeup remover towelette to clean it of excess mascara daily.  </li>
            <li>and I just want something a little more official.</li>
            <li>but i dont think it was 100% ready for use or its just way to big for me..</li>
            <li>I looked this up online to see how to use it, though it&#x27;s not hard to figure out if I had actually tried.</li>
            <li>It seems like such a simple little accessory but will make a HUGE difference in your ability to apply mascara.  </li>

            <li> I love this so much! I don&#x27;t do the business card trick because well, I don&#x27;t have any and I just want something a little more official. This is great! I have to order another one because I&#x27;m pretty sure my friend took this from me after she tried using it. She loved it as well.</li>
            <li> Terrible. Save your money</li>
            <li> It works. Packaging comes in a foreign language. I looked this up online to see how to use it, though it&#x27;s not hard to figure out if I had actually tried.</li>

            <li> Mine came broken, but took forever to get</li>
            <li> Very simple principle. Works really well.</li>

            <li> Love it!  It seems like such a simple little accessory but will make a HUGE difference in your ability to apply mascara.

            <li> Works exactly as intended.</li>
            <li> This works.  It&#x27;s hard with baby boomer eyes to put mascara on without glasses.  And with glasses it&#x27;s a mess.&lt;br /&gt;With a good magnifying mirror,  I can see to get the mascara on and with this, it always goes on clean.  And no mascara clumps on lashes to fix.  If only I&#x27;d had one of these 30 years ago, would have saved a lot of misplaced globs of mascara.</li>
            <li> These are cheap and easily lost. Sadly I paid for them, when I should&#x27;ve just learned how to apply with better techniques.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money...don&#x27;t bother!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for protecting the skin around the eyes from unwanted mascara. And very easy to clean and store.</li>
            <li> it defiantly wasn&#x27;t what i was expecting.. i wanted it to help keep from getting mascara on my eyelid and it only made things that much harder. also it uses more mascara using this, a lot more seems to get onto the comb than my lashes. other people said it worked for them but i feel like theyre using double or maybe more mascara by using this. it was a good idea but i dont think it was 100% ready for use or its just way to big for me..</li>
            <li> Hard plastic.  Didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
