    <ol>
            <li>It blends my concealer perfectly into my skin.</li>
            <li>Sets the concealer great with no streaks!</li>
            <li>Awesome seller, awesome brush!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mostly great to blend, blend, blend.</li>
            <li>BUT, this brush seems like it could be good for contouring/blending out bronzer in the hollows of the cheeks.  </li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li>Good one and I like it üëçüèº</li>
            <li>What it is good for is,  blending in  concealer or setting it with powder after you applied it.  </li>
            <li>Good for around the nose too.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Good to lightly stipple blush to cheeks, and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>I love love love this brush!  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this brush elsewhere, but it&#x27;s the best concealer brush I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>I LOVE how effortlessly this brush blends out my concealer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad i got it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not the best brush out there</li>
            <li>There is nothing fancy about this brush,  but serves a unique purpose.</li>
            <li>ELF sells this for less, but it&#x27;s a very nice brush.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush for applying concealer powder under the eye and for lightly dusting over my eye shadow to lessen the color when I have applied to much.</li>
            <li>This brush is thick and would be great to blend eye shadow, not for defining your brows when using concealer.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s pretty versatile otherwise tbh</li>
            <li>but it applies eye shadow very well!</li>
            <li>This brush is super soft and so dense!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and fluffly, it puts just the right amount of concealer under my eyes without any streaks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highlighter, light bronzing, crease work, a sheer dusting on the lids...amazing for all of those things.</li>
            <li>It is very soft!</li>
            <li>It out beats any high end brush I have...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very soft and blends the concealer evenly without moving your foundation around.</li>
            <li>It looks so natural!</li>
            <li>this brush is pretty wide and has no angle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way too big and soft for that.  </li>
            <li>Soft enough not to irritate.</li>
            <li>Since it will become unevenness and will not be well attached if it will be easy to blend it if this brush is a liquid thing, but it is a hard texture, it is somewhat regrettable only there.</li>

            <li> I had to look for long time about this brush I find it and was $ 3 only.</li>
            <li> I realized I needed a different brush to blend in and set my concealer, as concealer brushes are too stiff and blending brushes too soft for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I have several small brushes I use to apply concealer, but they didn&#x27;t work for blending it.  </li>
            <li> Not scratchy, but dense enough to get a thick creamy concealer pressed in.</li>
            <li> This is not your typical concealer brush and cannot be used to apply concealer.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting something a little thinner</li>
            <li> This gets into the eye socket and other small areas around the nose and presses the concealer in.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little too fluffy to be a concealer brush for me</li>
            <li> But unless your concealer is powder, this will be useless for concealer.</li>

            <li> In stores you can get this for $3. it&#x27;s very soft and blends the concealer evenly without moving your foundation around.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It blends my concealer perfectly into my skin. The size and fluffiness work setter for me than the flatter, thinner concealer brushes.</li>
            <li> I had to look for long time about this brush I find it and was $ 3 only. I love it.</li>
            <li> This brush is thick and would be great to blend eye shadow, not for defining your brows when using concealer.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something a little thinner so I could conceal smaller areas- this brush is pretty wide and has no angle</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this brush elsewhere, but it&#x27;s the best concealer brush I&#x27;ve used! It&#x27;s very soft and fluffly, it puts just the right amount of concealer under my eyes without any streaks. It looks so natural!</li>
            <li> I used to apply my concealer with my finger before I fount this brush. Sets the concealer great with no streaks!</li>
            <li> Concealer? In what world?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highlighter, light bronzing, crease work, a sheer dusting on the lids...amazing for all of those things. But unless your concealer is powder, this will be useless for concealer. But it&#x27;s pretty versatile otherwise tbh</li>
            <li> I bought this not for concealer, but for a wash of eye shadow color on the lid.  Turned out to be too big for that purpose.  BUT, this brush seems like it could be good for contouring/blending out bronzer in the hollows of the cheeks.  It is very soft!</li>
            <li> I LOVE how effortlessly this brush blends out my concealer. I use it set my powder under my eyes, blend concealer, and blend eyeshadow. It&#x27;s mostly great to blend, blend, blend. For the price, it&#x27;s really good. I&#x27;m glad i got it, I might get another one so for my eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> Since it will become unevenness and will not be well attached if it will be easy to blend it if this brush is a liquid thing, but it is a hard texture, it is somewhat regrettable only there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not the best brush out there but it does get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little too fluffy to be a concealer brush for me but it applies eye shadow very well!</li>
            <li> Awesome seller, awesome brush!!! Will order E.L.F brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> Good one and I like it üëçüèº</li>
            <li> Good to lightly stipple blush to cheeks, and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> This brush is super soft and so dense! It is just pefect for applying concealer and for setting that concealer with powder. Love it!</li>
            <li> ELF sells this for less, but it&#x27;s a very nice brush. It is bigger and denser than it looks and dense.  This is not your typical concealer brush and cannot be used to apply concealer.  It&#x27;s way too big and soft for that.  What it is good for is,  blending in  concealer or setting it with powder after you applied it.  I have several small brushes I use to apply concealer, but they didn&#x27;t work for blending it.  This gets into the eye socket and other small areas around the nose and presses the concealer in.  Can be used to spread it out too or to apply a dusting of powder.  Good for around the nose too.  I realized I needed a different brush to blend in and set my concealer, as concealer brushes are too stiff and blending brushes too soft for that purpose. The last thing you want to do is set your concealer with left over eye shadow. There is nothing fancy about this brush,  but serves a unique purpose. Not scratchy, but dense enough to get a thick creamy concealer pressed in. Soft enough not to irritate. For me it solved a problem.</li>
            <li> I love love love this brush!  It out beats any high end brush I have... It blends effortlessly! 5 stars!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this brush for applying concealer powder under the eye and for lightly dusting over my eye shadow to lessen the color when I have applied to much.</li>
