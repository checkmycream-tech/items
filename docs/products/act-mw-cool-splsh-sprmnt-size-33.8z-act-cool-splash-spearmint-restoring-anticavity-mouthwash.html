            <li>Good product, great buy on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this before and found it very good, for keeping your teeth healthy.</li>
            <li>In any case, this is a good product.</li>
            <li>Dentist says its a good idea, so i use it.</li>
            <li>Good price for a good product.</li>
            <li>Good product, appears to be doing its job..</li>
            <li>It tastes good.  </li>
            <li>It feels good in your mouth, too.</li>
            <li>On time, plentiful, good stuff</li>
            <li>but Probably good for your teeth</li>
            <li>it feels good.....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for your gums....</li>
            <li>good price just buy it.</li>
            <li>Great taste, not too strong, fluoride!</li>
            <li>Very Satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this mouthwash when I receive it.</li>
            <li>Great product I love act restoring mouthwash work so well</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>The product keeps my teeth brilliant and although I don&#x27;t visit the dentist every 6 mo as recommended, my dentist says my enamel is nice a strong and I haven&#x27;t had any oral problems.</li>
            <li>Refreshing and makes for a pleasant good night kiss ( providing both recipients use it).</li>
            <li>Not too strong, tastes great, and does everything I expect from a mouthwash.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also tastes great, was cheap as part of this 3-pack, and helps A LOT with sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>gotta say that this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than most brands, works and tastes good.</li>
            <li>Used it as a teenager and liked it and still do.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>Effective.</li>
            <li>Nice to find this for my dad.</li>
            <li>Good taste, not too strong.</li>
            <li>the taste of this is very strong.  </li>
            <li>Nice size bottles and has been refreshing to use every morning.</li>
            <li>I purchased this on-line because it is way more cost effective to buy ACT mouthwash on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The best mouthwash for sensitive teeth and decaying enamel.</li>
            <li>Good to clean, freshen and helps breathe also</li>
            <li>Whenever you buy this product, make sure to check the fluoride concentration on whatever bottle you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li>I think it has been more helpful than the sensodine I have been using for over 5 years</li>
            <li>Been using for years, love it :)</li>
            <li>If the bottle was more rigid, I&#x27;d rate it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the bottle is better.</li>
            <li>Cheaper to buy on bulk through Amazon and more convenient also.</li>
            <li>He must love the smell of pine sol.</li>
            <li>However rebuilding of enamel is borderline hilarious.</li>
            <li>Crossing fingers that it helps prevent more problems with my teeth.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m the type of person that has excellent dental hygiene (daily flosser, brush 3x a day) but still manages to get cavities every year.</li>
            <li>Love the taste.</li>
            <li>So pleased with this.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it.</li>
            <li>My favorite mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>and/or make sure you&#x27;ve tried this flavor/type before you order.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for one of the best deals (in terms of bang for your Amazon buck), look no further.</li>
            <li>the taste is just not my favorite.</li>
            <li>it is one of the better mouthwash&#x27;s on the market.</li>
            <li>Reviewed from my 6 year old daughter &amp;#34;It is smelling good and every time I swish it, it um it feels good in my mouth&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>mouthwash OK, but can&#x27;t pour it if you can&#x27;t hold onto the bottle.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>My favorite mouthwash for giving my teeth the protection against enamel breakdown.</li>
            <li>This is perfect because the lower concentration is made for multiple rinsings per day.</li>
            <li>Prices on Amazon are better than in the stores.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this, though I can&#x27;t imagine needing to replace more often than once a year.</li>
            <li>Refreshing flavor.</li>
            <li>Our favorite mouthwash as it doesn&#x27;t leave our gums on fire.</li>
            <li>Yeah, that kind of clean.</li>
            <li>Tastes great and is rated highly by dentists.</li>
            <li>However, I gave it 4 starts because the smell wears off very quickly, maybe 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>So easy to receive it thru the mail.</li>
            <li>However, it also isn&#x27;t painfully strong</li>
            <li>This mouth wash is way to strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not too strong.</li>
            <li>The spearmint flavor is a bit strong</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It seems to be fine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this before, it works fine, price is decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tastes fine, supposedly is helping.</li>
            <li>Several HUGE bottles for a really great price.</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s not alcohol free.</li>
            <li>This is the same great product bought in the stores.  </li>
            <li>but overall I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Economical and satisfying</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous mouth wash products and I&#x27;m happy with ACT.</li>
            <li>so far so good</li>
            <li>It is really good for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Crest pro-health complete isn&#x27;t as good a mouthwash</li>
            <li>fast shipping, fair price, easy transaction, my thanks!</li>
            <li>My husband is okay with it, but I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this on subscribe and save as it comes with 3 very  large bottles and</li>
            <li>This particular flavor is her favorite, and one pharmacies in our area mostly refuse to carry.</li>
            <li>I always buy this at the grocery store and was excited to see it available as a subscriptions.  </li>
            <li>MAKES MY MOUTH FEEL SO CLEAN.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>and  it makes my mouth feel exceptionally clean.</li>
            <li>Helps keep teeth clean &amp; never have any cavities, use it morning &amp; night...</li>
            <li>RInse for a full 60 seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t eat or drink for a full 30 mins after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you feel like you just drank a full gallon of pine-sol floor cleaner.</li>
            <li>But keep in mind, since this is an alcohol free product, your breath won&#x27;t be as fresh as using Listerine.</li>
            <li>Overall I think this is a good product.</li>
            <li>Overall good product though</li>
            <li>When I did wake up, I was in the desert with a blood-stained shirt and a suitcase full of money.</li>
            <li>My local stores don&#x27;t carry this, so I have no idea about the price difference, although this seems like a good price (about $14 for a 3-pack).</li>
            <li>Other than that, is great</li>
            <li>Who knew they made a product that can make your breath so fresh and clean</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day after brushing and it leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>That being said, it still leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh after use</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve found a quick rinse after using it helps.  </li>
            <li>Lucky for me, I found this product on Amazon, and boy, are things looking up for me these days.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and with the subscribe and safe</li>
            <li>I have used other ACT mouth washes and liked them for the most part.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also does not dry out your mouth and it creates amazing</li>
            <li>It has saved me from so much pain and sensitivity!!</li>
            <li>The first time I opened a bottle and picked it up, mouthwash squirted out all over the bathroom, yikes !  </li>
            <li>it really works!!</li>
            <li>The large bottles are diluted more because of government regulations about how much fluoride can be in one bottle.</li>
            <li>Fresh taste and smell.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my breath fresh and mouth cavity-free</li>
            <li>I get my money worth.</li>
            <li>Ensure that you are NOT using this product more than 2x per day (as your teeth / gums may become sensitive and hurt a bit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall a good product that the family likes as a whole.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s fresh breathe that lasts.</li>
            <li>Great product, especially if you have sensitive teeth and need your mouthwash to not have alcohol in it.</li>
            <li>It foams up well and makes my breath and mouth feel fresh.</li>
            <li>We had used the original Act for years but tried this and really like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve lost track of how many years I&#x27;ve been using this, but as long as I remain cavity free, I see no reason to ever stop using</li>
            <li>ACT is the only mouthwash I will use, and Cool Splash Spearmint is my favorite flavor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe they use this squishy kind of bottle due to the original Act bottle with the measuring thingy on it ?&lt;</li>
            <li>The fresh breath you get after using it is great, it appears to be helping with tooth enamel restoration (its hard to tell without prolonged use and another trip to the dentist).</li>
            <li>very gentle compare to crest mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different mouthwash agents and the ACT brand</li>
            <li>AT FIRST</li>
            <li>The fourth thought it was just OK.  </li>
            <li>If like the convenience of having it delivered, you might want to order just one first to see if you like it</li>
            <li>No questionable whitening chemicals.</li>
            <li>Arrived sooner than promised and exactly as expected-thanks</li>
            <li>I think it has a positive effect too.</li>
            <li>last time that I used Act was many years ago when I was in high school and my Orthodontist suggested it during the years that I wore braces.</li>
            <li>Feels fresh and clean for a long time</li>
            <li>Would give it 5 if it didn&#x27;t make me salivate so much after</li>
            <li>Very stinky.</li>
            <li>My mouth is much healthier when using this mouthwash.</li>
            <li>really like the ACT brand</li>
            <li>I drank the whole bottle and didn&#x27;t wake up for two days.</li>
            <li>But my breath smelled fantastic and my teeth were pearly white.</li>
            <li>and I really do like ACT</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted thanks</li>
            <li>Reasonable price</li>
            <li>Reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Use twice a day, very day.</li>
            <li>The flavor feels right unlike some other ones that are too strong.</li>
            <li>It was a little peppery at first, but I got used to it fast and it leaves my mouth feeling amazing!</li>
            <li>Decent price and beats goin&#x27; to Walgreens.</li>
            <li>It is a bit more expensive than others, but used along with flossing and brushing, it&#x27;s better than the dentist.</li>
            <li>; Look it up yourself and decide if you want to take chances on a substance that is easily absorbed through the skin and possibly cause a multitude of problems.</li>
            <li>After walking out of the house for the first time in more than eight years, I found offer in the local newspaper they give out in the deli down the road from me that I didn&#x27;t even know existed!</li>
            <li>Not a strong flavor, so its nice for daily use.</li>
            <li>; He is familiar with plain old fluoridated ACT - which has a higher concentration of fluoride that this product here.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smaller bottles have a higher concentration of fluoride.</li>
            <li>My breath remains minty fresh for a long time.</li>
            <li>The 18 oz is only intended for once a day rinsing, so it is a higher concentration.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ll let you know how my next  dental hygiene appointment goes ;)</li>
            <li>never seems to give me the feeling of clean like the other name-brands do.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t mind killing your taste bud for half an hour, these huge bottles are the cheapest way to buy Act</li>
            <li>I was exeperiencing a lot a tooth sensitivity that had become more frequent and more painful.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed it helped with my sensitive teeth a lit since using it about three months ago.</li>
            <li>the county morgue and the only real relationship I&#x27;ve had  was with a stray cat that took a liking urinating on my garden gnomes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soft plastic, if you try to grab with one hand, pour in cup, can&#x27;t be done.</li>
            <li>I think you may be surprised.  </li>
            <li>I have soft teeth</li>
            <li>This proves there are other ways.</li>
            <li>My condition has been the reason why the only real job I&#x27;ve had for my entire adult life was for</li>
            <li>I personally use this at least twice a day and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>It really works miracles, but only if you brush and floss regularly of course.</li>
            <li>I was recommended this mouthwash from a dentist a while back because my teeth are very sensitive.</li>
            <li>The first few days were a bit of an adjustment from the sweet mouthwash we had been using (with little to no effect), but we stuck with it and now are used to it and cannot imagine returning to the old brand.</li>
            <li>I had stopped buying it for a little while because I only like this flavor and cannot stand the too strong blue one</li>
            <li>Make sure you read the directions because you only need a very small amount (the line in the cap/cup will be your guide).</li>
            <li>/&gt;ACT is much less intensive than Listerine or some of the more harsh mouthwashes</li>
            <li>Not as intense as other mouthwash products I have used.</li>
            <li>My dentist actually recommended that I purchase this ACT Restoring Mouthwash and after using it for approximately 1 month, I&#x27;m pleased with how the product works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not too strong and not too weak.</li>
            <li>On the inside of the cap, there&#x27;s a line indicating how much mouthwash to use (it&#x27;s actually less than you would expect).  </li>
            <li>but the color is far from natural, it looks like it might glow in the dark.</li>
            <li>Too much alcohol in this and too little fluoride.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Good product, great buy on Amazon.</li>

            <li> Great taste, not too strong, fluoride!</li>
            <li> Very Satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this mouthwash when I receive it.</li>
            <li> Great product I love act restoring mouthwash work so well</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> The product keeps my teeth brilliant and although I don&#x27;t visit the dentist every 6 mo as recommended, my dentist says my enamel is nice a strong and I haven&#x27;t had any oral problems.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and makes for a pleasant good night kiss ( providing both recipients use it).</li>
            <li> Not too strong, tastes great, and does everything I expect from a mouthwash.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also tastes great, was cheap as part of this 3-pack, and helps A LOT with sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> gotta say that this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than most brands, works and tastes good.</li>
            <li> Used it as a teenager and liked it and still do.</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> Effective.</li>
            <li> Nice to find this for my dad.</li>
            <li> Good taste, not too strong.</li>
            <li> the taste of this is very strong.  </li>
            <li> Nice size bottles and has been refreshing to use every morning.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on-line because it is way more cost effective to buy ACT mouthwash on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The best mouthwash for sensitive teeth and decaying enamel.</li>
            <li> Good to clean, freshen and helps breathe also</li>
            <li> Whenever you buy this product, make sure to check the fluoride concentration on whatever bottle you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li> I think it has been more helpful than the sensodine I have been using for over 5 years</li>
            <li> Been using for years, love it :)</li>
            <li> If the bottle was more rigid, I&#x27;d rate it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the bottle is better.</li>
            <li> Cheaper to buy on bulk through Amazon and more convenient also.</li>
            <li> He must love the smell of pine sol.</li>
            <li> However rebuilding of enamel is borderline hilarious.</li>
            <li> Crossing fingers that it helps prevent more problems with my teeth.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m the type of person that has excellent dental hygiene (daily flosser, brush 3x a day) but still manages to get cavities every year.</li>
            <li> Love the taste.</li>
            <li> So pleased with this.</li>
            <li> So glad I found it.</li>
            <li> My favorite mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> and/or make sure you&#x27;ve tried this flavor/type before you order.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for one of the best deals (in terms of bang for your Amazon buck), look no further.</li>
            <li> the taste is just not my favorite.</li>
            <li> it is one of the better mouthwash&#x27;s on the market.</li>
            <li> Reviewed from my 6 year old daughter &amp;#34;It is smelling good and every time I swish it, it um it feels good in my mouth&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> mouthwash OK, but can&#x27;t pour it if you can&#x27;t hold onto the bottle.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> My favorite mouthwash for giving my teeth the protection against enamel breakdown.</li>
            <li> This is perfect because the lower concentration is made for multiple rinsings per day.</li>
            <li> Prices on Amazon are better than in the stores.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this, though I can&#x27;t imagine needing to replace more often than once a year.</li>
            <li> Refreshing flavor.</li>
            <li> Our favorite mouthwash as it doesn&#x27;t leave our gums on fire.</li>
            <li> Yeah, that kind of clean.</li>
            <li> Tastes great and is rated highly by dentists.</li>
            <li> However, I gave it 4 starts because the smell wears off very quickly, maybe 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> So easy to receive it thru the mail.</li>
            <li> However, it also isn&#x27;t painfully strong</li>
            <li> This mouth wash is way to strong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not too strong.</li>
            <li> The spearmint flavor is a bit strong</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It seems to be fine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before, it works fine, price is decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tastes fine, supposedly is helping.</li>
            <li> Several HUGE bottles for a really great price.</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s not alcohol free.</li>
            <li> This is the same great product bought in the stores.  </li>
            <li> but overall I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Economical and satisfying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous mouth wash products and I&#x27;m happy with ACT.</li>
            <li> so far so good</li>
            <li> It is really good for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Crest pro-health complete isn&#x27;t as good a mouthwash</li>
            <li> fast shipping, fair price, easy transaction, my thanks!</li>
            <li> My husband is okay with it, but I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this on subscribe and save as it comes with 3 very  large bottles and</li>
            <li> This particular flavor is her favorite, and one pharmacies in our area mostly refuse to carry.</li>
            <li> I always buy this at the grocery store and was excited to see it available as a subscriptions.  </li>
            <li> MAKES MY MOUTH FEEL SO CLEAN.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> and  it makes my mouth feel exceptionally clean.</li>
            <li> Helps keep teeth clean &amp; never have any cavities, use it morning &amp; night...</li>
            <li> RInse for a full 60 seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t eat or drink for a full 30 mins after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you feel like you just drank a full gallon of pine-sol floor cleaner.</li>
            <li> But keep in mind, since this is an alcohol free product, your breath won&#x27;t be as fresh as using Listerine.</li>
            <li> Overall I think this is a good product.</li>
            <li> Overall good product though</li>
            <li> When I did wake up, I was in the desert with a blood-stained shirt and a suitcase full of money.</li>
            <li> My local stores don&#x27;t carry this, so I have no idea about the price difference, although this seems like a good price (about $14 for a 3-pack).</li>
            <li> Other than that, is great</li>
            <li> Who knew they made a product that can make your breath so fresh and clean</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day after brushing and it leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> That being said, it still leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh after use</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve found a quick rinse after using it helps.  </li>
            <li> Lucky for me, I found this product on Amazon, and boy, are things looking up for me these days.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and with the subscribe and safe</li>
            <li> I have used other ACT mouth washes and liked them for the most part.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also does not dry out your mouth and it creates amazing</li>
            <li> It has saved me from so much pain and sensitivity!!</li>
            <li> The first time I opened a bottle and picked it up, mouthwash squirted out all over the bathroom, yikes !  </li>
            <li> it really works!!</li>
            <li> The large bottles are diluted more because of government regulations about how much fluoride can be in one bottle.</li>
            <li> Fresh taste and smell.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my breath fresh and mouth cavity-free</li>
            <li> I get my money worth.</li>
            <li> Ensure that you are NOT using this product more than 2x per day (as your teeth / gums may become sensitive and hurt a bit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall a good product that the family likes as a whole.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s fresh breathe that lasts.</li>
            <li> Great product, especially if you have sensitive teeth and need your mouthwash to not have alcohol in it.</li>
            <li> It foams up well and makes my breath and mouth feel fresh.</li>
            <li> We had used the original Act for years but tried this and really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost track of how many years I&#x27;ve been using this, but as long as I remain cavity free, I see no reason to ever stop using</li>
            <li> ACT is the only mouthwash I will use, and Cool Splash Spearmint is my favorite flavor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe they use this squishy kind of bottle due to the original Act bottle with the measuring thingy on it ?&lt;</li>
            <li> The fresh breath you get after using it is great, it appears to be helping with tooth enamel restoration (its hard to tell without prolonged use and another trip to the dentist).</li>
            <li> very gentle compare to crest mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different mouthwash agents and the ACT brand</li>
            <li> AT FIRST</li>
            <li> The fourth thought it was just OK.  </li>
            <li> If like the convenience of having it delivered, you might want to order just one first to see if you like it</li>
            <li> No questionable whitening chemicals.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than promised and exactly as expected-thanks</li>
            <li> I think it has a positive effect too.</li>
            <li> last time that I used Act was many years ago when I was in high school and my Orthodontist suggested it during the years that I wore braces.</li>
            <li> Feels fresh and clean for a long time</li>
            <li> Would give it 5 if it didn&#x27;t make me salivate so much after</li>
            <li> Very stinky.</li>
            <li> My mouth is much healthier when using this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> really like the ACT brand</li>
            <li> I drank the whole bottle and didn&#x27;t wake up for two days.</li>
            <li> But my breath smelled fantastic and my teeth were pearly white.</li>
            <li> and I really do like ACT</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted thanks</li>
            <li> Reasonable price</li>
            <li> Reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Use twice a day, very day.</li>
            <li> The flavor feels right unlike some other ones that are too strong.</li>
            <li> It was a little peppery at first, but I got used to it fast and it leaves my mouth feeling amazing!</li>
            <li> Decent price and beats goin&#x27; to Walgreens.</li>
            <li> It is a bit more expensive than others, but used along with flossing and brushing, it&#x27;s better than the dentist.</li>
            <li> ; Look it up yourself and decide if you want to take chances on a substance that is easily absorbed through the skin and possibly cause a multitude of problems.</li>
            <li> After walking out of the house for the first time in more than eight years, I found offer in the local newspaper they give out in the deli down the road from me that I didn&#x27;t even know existed!</li>
            <li> Not a strong flavor, so its nice for daily use.</li>
            <li> ; He is familiar with plain old fluoridated ACT - which has a higher concentration of fluoride that this product here.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smaller bottles have a higher concentration of fluoride.</li>
            <li> My breath remains minty fresh for a long time.</li>
            <li> The 18 oz is only intended for once a day rinsing, so it is a higher concentration.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ll let you know how my next  dental hygiene appointment goes ;)</li>
            <li> never seems to give me the feeling of clean like the other name-brands do.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t mind killing your taste bud for half an hour, these huge bottles are the cheapest way to buy Act</li>
            <li> I was exeperiencing a lot a tooth sensitivity that had become more frequent and more painful.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed it helped with my sensitive teeth a lit since using it about three months ago.</li>
            <li> the county morgue and the only real relationship I&#x27;ve had  was with a stray cat that took a liking urinating on my garden gnomes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Soft plastic, if you try to grab with one hand, pour in cup, can&#x27;t be done.</li>
            <li> I think you may be surprised.  </li>
            <li> I have soft teeth</li>
            <li> This proves there are other ways.</li>
            <li> My condition has been the reason why the only real job I&#x27;ve had for my entire adult life was for</li>
            <li> I personally use this at least twice a day and LOVE it.</li>
            <li> It really works miracles, but only if you brush and floss regularly of course.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this mouthwash from a dentist a while back because my teeth are very sensitive.</li>
            <li> The first few days were a bit of an adjustment from the sweet mouthwash we had been using (with little to no effect), but we stuck with it and now are used to it and cannot imagine returning to the old brand.</li>
            <li> I had stopped buying it for a little while because I only like this flavor and cannot stand the too strong blue one</li>
            <li> Make sure you read the directions because you only need a very small amount (the line in the cap/cup will be your guide).</li>
            <li> /&gt;ACT is much less intensive than Listerine or some of the more harsh mouthwashes</li>
            <li> Not as intense as other mouthwash products I have used.</li>
            <li> My dentist actually recommended that I purchase this ACT Restoring Mouthwash and after using it for approximately 1 month, I&#x27;m pleased with how the product works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too strong and not too weak.</li>
            <li> On the inside of the cap, there&#x27;s a line indicating how much mouthwash to use (it&#x27;s actually less than you would expect).  </li>
            <li> but the color is far from natural, it looks like it might glow in the dark.</li>
            <li> Too much alcohol in this and too little fluoride.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product by my dentist for my sensitive teeth due to gum loss.</li>
            <li> , however, this specific product one has a little too much alcohol and burn a little if you have sensitive cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I have used ACT for years, but apparently not this flavor/type.</li>
            <li> I even almost went for a tongue amputation procedure after an awful holiday family reunion at which I sent Great Aunt Millie headfirst into the cheese fondue after I  tried talking loudly in her ear</li>
            <li> It works for me and does seem to make those areas on my teeth much less sensitive.</li>
            <li> The alcohol limits how long I can keep the rinse in my mouth, but probably the alcohol has to be there as a solvent carrier for the fluoride.</li>
            <li> the chemical burn from the flavor lingers on, long after the shock of putting this in your mouth.</li>
            <li> It turns a smart choice (getting the value of the larger bottle) into a dumb choice (paying a 60% premium based on the fluoride concentration).</li>
            <li> It did not work (still got cavities) and is a waste of money (typically not covered under dental insurance).</li>
            <li> This has only 0.02% fluoride, compared to other products that have 0.05%.</li>
            <li> He likes to use it multiple times per day to help with his extreme tooth sensitivity, and the stronger concentration made me nervous.</li>
            <li> I have an interview tomorrow and, aside from that, the boy behind the counter said thank you in a pretty suggestive way.</li>
            <li> I Purchased the larger bottle and saw They Cut The Flo-ride in half.</li>
            <li> Otherwise the small amount left over in the cap drips all over the outside of the bottle and it gets sticky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a little prone to think that this product actually doesn&#x27;t contain fluoride.</li>
            <li> Makes bad breath go away and fights cavities and does not burn your mouth :)</li>
            <li> On time and as expected.  </li>
            <li> This $15 will go a LONG way as it will typically take you at-least a month or 2 to go through 1 bottle if you&#x27;re using it 2x per day.</li>
            <li> I like it because it doesn&#x27;t burn like other brands.</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> Cheap per Gallon / Vulgar Taste /</li>
            <li> Based on the previous review, I became suspicious about the fluoride concentration, so I double-checked it on their website, and the previous reviewer is correct.</li>
            <li> The previous posters all focus on the dilution without understanding why.  </li>
            <li> I get this order every couple of months for my husband and I, it was recommended by our dentist and we use it everyday.</li>
            <li> If you use it everyday then I do feel that it will help with keeping cavities from forming.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s definitely less than the grocery store!</li>
            <li> Not overwhelmingly strong, works well</li>
            <li> I brush too hard and it has cost me my gums and since I have been using this product a few weeks</li>
            <li> Non- alcoholic a must for asthmatics.</li>
            <li> The bottles arrive permanently dented due to the poor Amazon packing practices.  </li>
            <li> you are a recovering alcoholic (not that my son is an alcoholic!)</li>
            <li> As a lifetime sufferer of halitosis and other awfully putrid mouth maladies, I have experimented with every possible solution to my rancid breath.</li>
            <li> Enamel is weak as hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ergonomics fail, even hard to pour using two hands!</li>
            <li> A couple of years ago, after my frustration at being unable to stop the annual cavities, my dentist recommended that I try a fluoride mouthwash to strengthen my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is unfortunate that the product description on this page does not contain that information.</li>
            <li> (she suffers from hearing loss as well as dementia).</li>
            <li> Why don&#x27;t they make a version which doesn&#x27;t add this much artificial colors.</li>
            <li> this mouthwash has eliminated the sensitivity to cold</li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hate to have my tooth fall out.</li>
            <li> As well, the taste and smell are horrible.</li>
            <li> I was cursed with terrible gums and teeth which require brushing, flossing and mouthwash 4</li>

            <li> it came on time and one year no cavities  so far so good</li>
            <li> This is the best mouthwash I have used.  It is really good for sensitive teeth.  I was exeperiencing a lot a tooth sensitivity that had become more frequent and more painful.  My dentist recommended I add ACT to my daily routine and I am very happy with it. I will continue using this mouthwas for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> This stuff works.  Fresh taste and smell.  Repeat buyer.</li>
            <li> Would give it 5 if it didn&#x27;t make me salivate so much after</li>
            <li> Nice size bottles and has been refreshing to use every morning.</li>
            <li> The dental hygienist recommended to our daughter; and she likes it and uses it regularly.</li>
            <li> Great Product.  Very Satisfied.  Not as intense as other mouthwash products I have used.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It has saved me from so much pain and sensitivity!!</li>
            <li> If you check out the 18 oz bottle of this product, you&#x27;ll note that it has a concentration of .05% fluoride. However, for the larger bottle they didn&#x27;t put the same product in a larger size---they DILUTED it to .025%---half-strength. You are *not* getting the same product. Whenever you buy this product, make sure to check the fluoride concentration on whatever bottle you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li> I have noticed it helped with my sensitive teeth a lit since using it about three months ago. I think it has been more helpful than the sensodine I have been using for over 5 years</li>
            <li> I Purchased the larger bottle and saw They Cut The Flo-ride in half. Thus No Effect on tooth enamel. DILUTED it to .025%---half-strength.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended this to me.  It seems to be fine.  It&#x27;s mouthwash.  Tastes minty... the end.</li>
            <li> This has only 0.02% fluoride, compared to other products that have 0.05%. As well, the taste and smell are horrible. It smells &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; somehow. Very stinky.</li>
            <li> People read the bottles--this size is for twice a day usage. I personally use this at least twice a day and LOVE it. I was cursed with terrible gums and teeth which require brushing, flossing and mouthwash 4+ times a day just to keep them in check. ACT is the only mouthwash I will use, and Cool Splash Spearmint is my favorite flavor. I can definitely tell if I&#x27;ve slacked off on using this, my gums start to hurt. My mouth is much healthier when using this mouthwash. Just ask my dentist!</li>
            <li> Been using for years, love it :)</li>
            <li> I use this with  Therabreath. I bought the 3 pack. Works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before, it works fine, price is decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I don&#x27;t like is the bottle, it&#x27;s too squishy.  The bottles arrive permanently dented due to the poor Amazon packing practices.  The first time I opened a bottle and picked it up, mouthwash squirted out all over the bathroom, yikes !  If the bottle was more rigid, I&#x27;d rate it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe they use this squishy kind of bottle due to the original Act bottle with the measuring thingy on it ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest pro-health complete isn&#x27;t as good a mouthwash but the bottle is better.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this before and found it very good, for keeping your teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> Think before ordering ACT Restoring Anti–Cavity Fluoride Mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand how 10% alcohol fights dental decay.&lt;br /&gt;I sent this to my son who is in college. He told me today that he hates it not only because it contains 10% alcohol which burns his mouth but he claims this ACT causes him to have &amp;#34;bad breath the rest of the day.&amp;#34; He is familiar with plain old fluoridated ACT - which has a higher concentration of fluoride that this product here.&lt;br /&gt;If you are a recovering alcoholic (not that my son is an alcoholic!), DON&amp;#34;T USE THIS!</li>
            <li> Best mouthwash out there that doesn&#x27;t require a prescription. Cheaper to buy on bulk through Amazon and more convenient also.</li>
            <li> Keeps my breath fresh and mouth cavity-free</li>
            <li> The large bottles are diluted more because of government regulations about how much fluoride can be in one bottle. The smaller bottles have a higher concentration of fluoride. See the FAQs on the manufacturer&#x27;s website. &amp;#34;Once a day&amp;#34; vs. &amp;#34;twice a day&amp;#34; is not why the concentration are different; that is a rationalization, a folktale. In any case, this is a good product. The alcohol limits how long I can keep the rinse in my mouth, but probably the alcohol has to be there as a solvent carrier for the fluoride.</li>
            <li> This is the only mouthwash we use. The flavor feels right unlike some other ones that are too strong. Feels fresh and clean for a long time</li>
            <li> Based on the previous review, I became suspicious about the fluoride concentration, so I double-checked it on their website, and the previous reviewer is correct. There is a big difference in the concentration. I agree 100%, it&#x27;s deceptive and should be labeled and marketed completely differently. It turns a smart choice (getting the value of the larger bottle) into a dumb choice (paying a 60% premium based on the fluoride concentration). I did the math based on the fluoride concentration and Amazon&#x27;s current price for the 2 different bottles. Shame on you, ACT!    I&#x27;m going to start looking for another product to replace ACT.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great packaged price.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this mouthwash to prevent cavities. Since I began using this product, I have not had any cavities. My breath remains minty fresh for a long time. The product keeps my teeth brilliant and although I don&#x27;t visit the dentist every 6 mo as recommended, my dentist says my enamel is nice a strong and I haven&#x27;t had any oral problems.</li>
            <li> Not overwhelmingly strong, works well</li>
            <li> Not a strong flavor, so its nice for daily use. Dentist says its a good idea, so i use it.</li>
            <li> Combined with Crest Pro-Health, this mouthwash is great for my teeth.  It&#x27;s the only combo of toothpaste and mouthwash I&#x27;ve found that helps control thrush on my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also tastes great, was cheap as part of this 3-pack, and helps A LOT with sensitivity.  Some things to note, in case you never read the instructions:&lt;br /&gt;1. On the inside of the cap, there&#x27;s a line indicating how much mouthwash to use (it&#x27;s actually less than you would expect).  Also, I&#x27;ve found a quick rinse after using it helps.  Otherwise the small amount left over in the cap drips all over the outside of the bottle and it gets sticky.&lt;br /&gt;2. RInse for a full 60 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;3. Don&#x27;t eat or drink for a full 30 mins after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone out there.</li>
            <li> As a lifetime sufferer of halitosis and other awfully putrid mouth maladies, I have experimented with every possible solution to my rancid breath. I&#x27;ve tried everything from hypnosis to walking around in a surgeon&#x27;s mask like they do in China after an outbreak of SARS, swine flu, or whatever is the pandemic du jour. I even almost went for a tongue amputation procedure after an awful holiday family reunion at which I sent Great Aunt Millie headfirst into the cheese fondue after I  tried talking loudly in her ear (she suffers from hearing loss as well as dementia). My condition has been the reason why the only real job I&#x27;ve had for my entire adult life was for the county morgue and the only real relationship I&#x27;ve had  was with a stray cat that took a liking urinating on my garden gnomes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I saw an advertisement on television for mouthwash it was an epiphany! Who knew they made a product that can make your breath so fresh and clean you feel like you just drank a full gallon of pine-sol floor cleaner. Yeah, that kind of clean. Lucky for me, I found this product on Amazon, and boy, are things looking up for me these days. After walking out of the house for the first time in more than eight years, I found offer in the local newspaper they give out in the deli down the road from me that I didn&#x27;t even know existed! I have an interview tomorrow and, aside from that, the boy behind the counter said thank you in a pretty suggestive way. He must love the smell of pine sol.</li>
            <li> Seems to work good! However rebuilding of enamel is borderline hilarious.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me to get a flouride rinse because I&#x27;m prone to cavities even though I have very good dental habits. Enamel is weak as hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems to work well. Crossing fingers that it helps prevent more problems with my teeth.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price!  The same ACT mouthwash you get at the store or pharmacy delivered to your door.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the ACT brand, however, this specific product one has a little too much alcohol and burn a little if you have sensitive cheeks.  Other than that, is great and I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good price for a good product.</li>
            <li> Very good price for this product!</li>
            <li> Decent price and beats goin&#x27; to Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than most brands, works and tastes good.</li>
            <li> When you spit it out after swishing it around for 5 minutes; it tastes just like Dentyne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also cleans your tongue completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is the perfect amount of alcohol at 11% and I prefer a mouthwash with some alcohol than without because it cleans your mouth better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also does not dry out your mouth and it creates amazing breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last time that I used Act was many years ago when I was in high school and my Orthodontist suggested it during the years that I wore braces. I never got one cavity in those 2 years. Just wish that I had stuck with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figure as we age we lose enamel, so I thought it would be beneficial to add this product to my oral care.</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for 8 years and since then haven&#x27;t have any cavity. My dentist recommended me to combine using Braun-OralB electric teeth brush though.</li>
            <li> Great value! I bought 3 bottles for $15. That&#x27;s definitely less than the grocery store!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m the type of person that has excellent dental hygiene (daily flosser, brush 3x a day) but still manages to get cavities every year. A couple of years ago, after my frustration at being unable to stop the annual cavities, my dentist recommended that I try a fluoride mouthwash to strengthen my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 months later, no cavity!&lt;br /&gt;1 year later, no cavity!&lt;br /&gt;2 years later, still no cavity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gotta say that this stuff is amazing. I use it twice a day after brushing and it leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean. But keep in mind, since this is an alcohol free product, your breath won&#x27;t be as fresh as using Listerine. However, it also isn&#x27;t painfully strong either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you tend to get cavities, you owe it to your teeth to try this product out for 6 months. It really works miracles, but only if you brush and floss regularly of course. I&#x27;ve lost track of how many years I&#x27;ve been using this, but as long as I remain cavity free, I see no reason to ever stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I used to get the concentrated fluoride treatment each time I went to the dentist for my semi-annual checkup. It did not work (still got cavities) and is a waste of money (typically not covered under dental insurance). I stopped doing the treatment switched over to ACT, and no cavities since.</li>
            <li> Overall I think this is a good product. The taste isn&#x27;t bad and I feel like it freshens my breath. However, I gave it 4 starts because the smell wears off very quickly, maybe 15 minutes. Overall good product though</li>
            <li> ITS JUST WHAT IT IS/ BUT AMAZON PRIME IS THE WAY TO GO</li>
            <li> This mouth wash is way to strong. My husband is okay with it, but I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this on subscribe and save as it comes with 3 very  large bottles and this will probably last him the entire year. I have used other ACT mouth washes and liked them for the most part.</li>
            <li> Makes bad breath go away and fights cavities and does not burn your mouth :)</li>
            <li> After years of using Listerine, decided to try this again. Used it as a teenager and liked it and still do.</li>
            <li> Good taste, not too strong. I think it has a positive effect too. I use it before bedtime.</li>
            <li> On time and as expected.  Refreshing and makes for a pleasant good night kiss ( providing both recipients use it).</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this mouthwash when I receive it. I highly recommend this product and with the subscribe and safe I get my money worth.</li>
            <li> I am a little prone to think that this product actually doesn&#x27;t contain fluoride. I&#x27;ve tried many different mouthwash agents and the ACT brand never seems to give me the feeling of clean like the other name-brands do.</li>
            <li> Love the taste. Nice. So pleased with this. Taste just like  spearmint gum. So glad I found it. Must have..</li>
            <li> A lot of mouthwash, and I thought it had all of the features I was looking for. But, it&#x27;s not alcohol free. I prefer and would recommend the ACT alcohol-free flouride mouth wash. When I run out, probably a year from now, I&#x27;ll order something else.</li>
            <li> My favorite mouthwash.  Not too strong, tastes great, and does everything I expect from a mouthwash.</li>
            <li> The product tastes &amp; functions okay but the color is far from natural, it looks like it might glow in the dark.</li>
            <li> I get this order every couple of months for my husband and I, it was recommended by our dentist and we use it everyday.</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR, ESPECIALLY THE FLUORIDE.  MAKES MY MOUTH FEEL SO CLEAN.  AT FIRST I DIDN&#x27;T KNOW IF I WOULD LIKE THE SPEARMINT, BUT AM GETTING USED TO IT NOW.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this mouthwash from a dentist a while back because my teeth are very sensitive. It works for me and does seem to make those areas on my teeth much less sensitive. I had stopped buying it for a little while because I only like this flavor and cannot stand the too strong blue one and I can&#x27;t find this one in any stores anymore. So I finally found it on Amazon and purchased it so I could get back on track with it again. I think it does its job.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels cleaner when using this product. It has a great taste, too.</li>
            <li> I have used ACT for years, but apparently not this flavor/type. The taste is awful!!!!! 3 out of 4 of us could not stand it. The fourth thought it was just OK.  I found another type of ACT at a local store and will stick with that.  If like the convenience of having it delivered, you might want to order just one first to see if you like it and/or make sure you&#x27;ve tried this flavor/type before you order.</li>
            <li> I drank the whole bottle and didn&#x27;t wake up for two days. When I did wake up, I was in the desert with a blood-stained shirt and a suitcase full of money. But my breath smelled fantastic and my teeth were pearly white.</li>
            <li> Great bargain, but I should have read it closer-contains alcohol, which stings my oral mucosa. Next time I will buy the alcohol-free product. In the meantime, it will be given away to my daughter-in-law, who uses this daily.</li>
            <li> Tastes great for a great price with Amazon Prime!</li>
            <li> We rated this 5* until I learned that one of the ingredients &amp;#34;polysorbate 20&amp;#34; is a problematic chemical. It&#x27;s thought that polysorbate 20—&amp;#34;May Be Contaminated with Carcinogenic 1,4-Dioxane...&amp;#34; Look it up yourself and decide if you want to take chances on a substance that is easily absorbed through the skin and possibly cause a multitude of problems. I threw away 3 when my dentist already knew about these issues and advised me to switch to the Crest brand ProHealth, also a fluoride rinse.</li>
            <li> I always buy this at the grocery store and was excited to see it available as a subscriptions.  Now I can save time/money too!</li>
            <li> The previous posters all focus on the dilution without understanding why.  I searched for this 33 oz bottle specifically because ACT recommends the lower concentration for twice a day rinsing.  The 18 oz is only intended for once a day rinsing, so it is a higher concentration.  From the ACT website: \\&quot;The 18oz bottle is formulated for once-a-day usage, while the 33oz bottle should be used twice daily.\\&quot;  It is unfortunate that the product description on this page does not contain that information.</li>
            <li> Works well and plenty of it! My kids like the taste, and no one has tipped the package over yet while open. The cap doubles as a cup, too!</li>
            <li> I prefer ACT mouthwashes because of the lightweight consistency of the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not too strong. Leaves my mouth feeling clean. Tolerable taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy with confidence!</li>
            <li> My dentist actually recommended that I purchase this ACT Restoring Mouthwash and after using it for approximately 1 month, I&#x27;m pleased with how the product works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ACT is much less intensive than Listerine or some of the more harsh mouthwashes that our out there. That being said, it still leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh after use but there&#x27;s no &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; like you get with Listerine. Ensure that you are NOT using this product more than 2x per day (as your teeth / gums may become sensitive and hurt a bit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for one of the best deals (in terms of bang for your Amazon buck), look no further. With this purchase, you will receive 33.8 ounces of ACT mouthwash for only $15. This $15 will go a LONG way as it will typically take you at-least a month or 2 to go through 1 bottle if you&#x27;re using it 2x per day.</li>
            <li> Product as listed.  Prompt shipping</li>
            <li> Works well and was recommended by our dentist for our son. Good pricing here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I purchased this on-line because it is way more cost effective to buy ACT mouthwash on Amazon.  This is the same great product bought in the stores.  The spearmint flavor is a bit strong but overall I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Good product, appears to be doing its job.. the taste is just not my favorite. The fresh breath you get after using it is great, it appears to be helping with tooth enamel restoration (its hard to tell without prolonged use and another trip to the dentist). Overall a good product that the family likes as a whole. Best thing, no sting when using it.. and there&#x27;s fresh breathe that lasts. I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> On the dentist&#x27;s recommendation I am using this.  Let&#x27;s hope is does the work as promised.  I&#x27;d hate to have my tooth fall out.</li>
            <li> Good to clean, freshen and helps breathe also</li>
            <li> Why don&#x27;t they make a version which doesn&#x27;t add this much artificial colors.</li>
            <li> This is a great mouthwash.  I like that it&#x27;s a flouride mouthwash which is something you have to look out for - not all mouthwashes are flouride.  It is a bit more expensive than others, but used along with flossing and brushing, it&#x27;s better than the dentist.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. It was a little peppery at first, but I got used to it fast and it leaves my mouth feeling amazing! And I&#x27;ll let you know how my next  dental hygiene appointment goes ;)</li>
            <li> Great price. Great product. Would by again and would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Great value and I really do like ACT it is one of the better mouthwash&#x27;s on the market.</li>
            <li> I always buy Act moutwash.  My dentist told me about it.  It tastes good.  It feels good in your mouth, too.</li>
            <li> the taste of this is very strong.  I find i have to dilute it to make it bearable. Kids can&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted thanks</li>
            <li> Good product, great buy on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Reviewed from my 6 year old daughter &amp;#34;It is smelling good and every time I swish it, it um it feels good in my mouth&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Economical and satisfying</li>
            <li> A good price for a good item! You can&#x27;t beat getting three for almost the retail price of one bottle.</li>
            <li> Great taste, not too strong, fluoride! No questionable whitening chemicals. Its mouthwash.</li>
            <li> On time, plentiful, good stuff</li>
            <li> I used this twice daily (morning and night) just as recommended and, to my surprise, it even helped my tooth sensitivity that I had been having such a problem with but didn&#x27;t have insurance to see the dentist.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this perticular mouth wash as suggested by her dentist. This particular flavor is her favorite, and one pharmacies in our area mostly refuse to carry. This proves there are other ways.</li>
            <li> Tastes fine, supposedly is helping.</li>
            <li> Teeth and gum problems run in our family &amp; Act helps a lot. We had used the original Act for years but tried this and really like it.</li>
            <li> mouthwash OK, but can&#x27;t pour it if you can&#x27;t hold onto the bottle. Ergonomics fail, even hard to pour using two hands! Soft plastic, if you try to grab with one hand, pour in cup, can&#x27;t be done.</li>
            <li> Works great and a great price. I&#x27;ve tried numerous mouth wash products and I&#x27;m happy with ACT. Not too strong and not too weak. It does have 11% alcohol but I don&#x27;t feel it burning like Listerine does. I like it.</li>
            <li> Makes your teeth protected against pain, like in the whitening strips.I used this twice a day, and then gargled with this before the whitestrips.</li>
            <li> Cheap per Gallon / Vulgar Taste / but Probably good for your teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind killing your taste bud for half an hour, these huge bottles are the cheapest way to buy Act fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the chemical burn from the flavor lingers on, long after the shock of putting this in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price and it&#x27;s okay except that I didn&#x27;t notice that it has alcohol.  Otherwise recommendable</li>
            <li> Great product recommended by my dentist.  Hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> Great taste. Effective. Reasonable price. I always use ACT mouthwash. It seems to provide the cleansing feeling and results I&#x27;m looking for</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than promised and exactly as expected-thanks</li>
            <li> Since I started using this mouthwash i don&#x27;t have teeth sensitivity anymore and my visits to the dentist have improved greatly!</li>
            <li> Nah it is....it&#x27;s mouth wash....it feels good.....it&#x27;s good for your gums....possibly your teeth....buy it....I think you may be surprised.  What do I know....</li>
            <li> fast shipping, fair price, easy transaction, my thanks!</li>
            <li> My favorite mouthwash for giving my teeth the protection against enamel breakdown.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product by my dentist for my sensitive teeth due to gum loss. I brush too hard and it has cost me my gums and since I have been using this product a few weeks now I have noticed my teeth feel stronger, the sensitivity has gone done and  it makes my mouth feel exceptionally clean. Make sure you read the directions because you only need a very small amount (the line in the cap/cup will be your guide). 33.8 oz is a lot of mouthwash and therefore this is great for the price. I would strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years-religiously. My dentist told me about it over 20 years ago and my teeth are in great shape.</li>
            <li> Nice to find this for my dad. He likes to use it multiple times per day to help with his extreme tooth sensitivity, and the stronger concentration made me nervous. This is perfect because the lower concentration is made for multiple rinsings per day. Awesome. I have it on Subscribe and Save. My local stores don&#x27;t carry this, so I have no idea about the price difference, although this seems like a good price (about $14 for a 3-pack). However, the Subscribe &amp; Save keeps going out of stock, which is a hindrance.</li>
            <li> Tastes great and is rated highly by dentists.</li>
            <li> great smell and taste. very gentle compare to crest mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Great product, especially if you have sensitive teeth and need your mouthwash to not have alcohol in it.</li>
            <li> good price just buy it.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, if you brush regularly.</li>
            <li> Dentists recommend Act and I can see why. Best on the market in my opinion. I like the 3 pack as well so I don&#x27;t have to purchase so often. Prices on Amazon are better than in the stores.</li>
            <li> Too much alcohol in this and too little fluoride.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> The best mouthwash for sensitive teeth and decaying enamel.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, and a great price.  So easy to receive it thru the mail.</li>
            <li> Great product I love act restoring mouthwash work so well</li>
            <li> All I ever use, great product</li>
            <li> If you use it everyday then I do feel that it will help with keeping cavities from forming. I have soft teeth so that is always a concern.</li>
            <li> Best fluoride mouth wash i have tried. My dentist  recommended it. I like it because it doesn&#x27;t burn like other brands.</li>
            <li> Several HUGE bottles for a really great price. I will continue to buy this, though I can&#x27;t imagine needing to replace more often than once a year.</li>
            <li> Refreshing flavor. Non- alcoholic a must for asthmatics. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> The best  good for plaque</li>
            <li> Our favorite mouthwash as it doesn&#x27;t leave our gums on fire.</li>
            <li> Our dentist recommended this so my hubby and I got some. The first few days were a bit of an adjustment from the sweet mouthwash we had been using (with little to no effect), but we stuck with it and now are used to it and cannot imagine returning to the old brand. The hygenist has already commented on my husband&#x27;s improved gums!!!</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does.  Use twice a day, very day.</li>
            <li> Like that it protects my teeth.</li>
            <li> also helps with gum problems</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist told me to get specifically Act mouthwash to assist with preventing future cavities and use every night. The taste is great and not nauseating like mouthwash can sometimes be. It foams up well and makes my breath and mouth feel fresh.</li>
            <li> this mouthwash has eliminated the sensitivity to cold it really works!!</li>
            <li> Helps keep teeth clean &amp; never have any cavities, use it morning &amp; night...</li>
