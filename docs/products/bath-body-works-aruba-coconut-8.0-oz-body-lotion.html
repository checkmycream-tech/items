            <li>This lotion is awesome if you love coconut flavored body lotion.  </li>
            <li>tried lots lotion with coconut nothing as good as aruba</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll get her a tub of the really good stuff from The Body Shop.</li>
            <li>Made for a good gift.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprising her with this at Christmas.</li>
            <li>Love the smell!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lotion!  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I get comments from complete strangers, asking what that awesome scent is.  </li>
            <li>and I feel like it isn&#x27;t overwhelming</li>
            <li>Fabulous scent!  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion and everyone around me too.</li>
            <li>If you love the beach smell, this is the lotion for you.</li>
            <li>but the bottles were obviously filled with another kind of lotion.</li>
            <li>But was a gift for a friend so was ok for now</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also a somewhat interesting spicy-ness to this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Extremely potent fragrance</li>
            <li>She will love it.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering some more soon</li>
            <li>So glad we can still buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Smell so good shipping was fast love it  </li>
            <li>but oh so authentic, rich and lovely.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent and how rich the lotion feels.</li>
            <li>Strong fragrance ...</li>
            <li>It smells so damn cheap that it kinda pisses me off.  </li>
            <li>Far superior to BBW Aruba.  </li>
            <li>Original wrap was tampered with.</li>
            <li>yourselves a favor and spend a little more on Body Shop Coconut Butter or their Coconut Milk Moisturizing Spray (a very effective spray lotion).  </li>
            <li>Now thats an amazing coconut smell with far better moisturizing ingredients, and lots of real coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it may seem moisturizing at first, but in my experience those two ingredients  </li>
            <li>They could have at least put more authentic coconut oil in here.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You know how McDonalds has a certain unmistakeable flavor to all of their menu?</li>
            <li>Well... I suppose sometimes you really do get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I shouldnt have expected more, but I am on a coconut kick and the reviews here are what had me give it a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>far as lotion goes, I am not a big fan of cheap shortcuts like petrolatum, dimethicone...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this highly and buy it often for gifts.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t have one where we live</li>
            <li>Almost every food there has a certain &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34;  and its the same?  </li>
            <li>goes on smooth, no greases feeling,wear it everyday, people say you smell just coconut.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give this one to my darling 11 year old niece...</li>
            <li>Its not that big of a deal, but I know instantly how little love and care or quality went into these kinds of lotions when i see those ingredients listed.</li>
            <li>scent comes on strong Pina Colada with extremely tart pineapple (pineapple on steroids) front and center.  </li>

            <li> (petrolatum is basically mineral oil) dry out the skin in the long run.</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of other sights and you were the only sight to have it !  </li>
            <li> The sugared coconut dances around it, but never takes center stage.</li>
            <li> I love the small - too bad Bath &amp; body Works discontinued it</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this smell and hate, hate, hate that Bath and Body Works discontinued it for the season.  </li>
            <li> Seems like a little defect.</li>
            <li> Its a certain scent underlying everything... a base of some sort that is unmistakeable.</li>
            <li> it is a very hard to find sent  !  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad that B&amp;B works don&#x27;t sell this anymore.</li>
            <li> Very expensive ....</li>
            <li> Stupid move!</li>
            <li> So disappointed!!!!</li>

            <li> Smells wonderful. Like to put on when I go to bed. Makes my sheets smell like coconuts to.</li>
            <li> This lotion is awesome if you love coconut flavored body lotion.  The only drawback was the lid leaks and doesn&#x27;t seem to work properly.  Seems like a little defect.</li>
            <li> Love this scent!!! Wish they would bring it back to the stores!!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this lotion!</li>
            <li> I love the scent and how rich the lotion feels. I get a lot of compliments on it and I feel like it isn&#x27;t overwhelming</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this smell and hate, hate, hate that Bath and Body Works discontinued it for the season.  Stupid move!</li>

            <li> I love this lotion and everyone around me too. Smells great! I would recommend this highly and buy it often for gifts.</li>
            <li> This was chosen because of the coconut scent. If you love the beach smell, this is the lotion for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad that B&amp;B works don&#x27;t sell this anymore. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> goes on smooth, no greases feeling,wear it everyday, people say you smell just coconut. tried lots lotion with coconut nothing as good as aruba</li>
            <li> So disappointed!!!! I purchased four bottles of what i thought was Bath And Body Works Aruba Coconut but the bottles were obviously filled with another kind of lotion. Original wrap was tampered with. Never again and don&#x27;t recommend anyone buy from this site!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product! Love the smell!</li>
            <li> Very expensive .... But was a gift for a friend so was ok for now</li>
            <li> it is a very hard to find sent  !  I tried a lot of other sights and you were the only sight to have it !  it was a good deal also !</li>
            <li> Well... I suppose sometimes you really do get what you pay for.  You know how McDonalds has a certain unmistakeable flavor to all of their menu? Almost every food there has a certain &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34;  and its the same?  Well I think its the same type of &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; that you find in BBW products (lotions especially).  Its a certain scent underlying everything... a base of some sort that is unmistakeable. I dont like it.  It smells so damn cheap that it kinda pisses me off.  Plastic or something.&lt;br /&gt;This scent comes on strong Pina Colada with extremely tart pineapple (pineapple on steroids) front and center.  The sugared coconut dances around it, but never takes center stage. There&#x27;s also a somewhat interesting spicy-ness to this lotion.  Extremely potent fragrance here.&lt;br /&gt;But again... underneath all that is that signature yucky generic BBW smell.  I cant get passed it.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I shouldnt have expected more, but I am on a coconut kick and the reviews here are what had me give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;As far as lotion goes, I am not a big fan of cheap shortcuts like petrolatum, dimethicone... etc.  Yes, it may seem moisturizing at first, but in my experience those two ingredients  (petrolatum is basically mineral oil) dry out the skin in the long run. Its not that big of a deal, but I know instantly how little love and care or quality went into these kinds of lotions when i see those ingredients listed.

Now thats an amazing coconut smell with far better moisturizing ingredients, and lots of real coconut oil.  Strong fragrance ... but oh so authentic, rich and lovely.  Far superior to BBW Aruba.  I&#x27;ll give this one to my darling 11 year old niece... This lotion feels totally like a teeny bopper perfume to me.  She will love it.  When she turns 16 I&#x27;ll get her a tub of the really good stuff from The Body Shop.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Quality product. Love it!</li>
            <li> Smell so good shipping was fast love it  I will be ordering some more soon</li>
            <li> Coconut, coconut, coconut... like the smell of coconut get this product... don&#x27;t like the smell of coconut then this is not for you...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion!  Everybody loves the scent.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is one of the best Bath and Body has ever produced. So glad we can still buy it on Amazon. Get several compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Smells amazing. Came on Time.</li>
            <li> An excellent fragrance. Made for a good gift.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend who loves this lotion. We don&#x27;t have one where we live and she was bummed when we went to a Vegas BBW and it was not there. I&#x27;m surprising her with this at Christmas. I hope she likes it!</li>
