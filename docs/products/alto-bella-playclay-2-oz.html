            <li> I have tried many other products to style my short hair and either they were too gluey, too oily, too too</li>
            <li> Recently, I have found it much more difficult to find, but I have tried other waxes and pomades.  </li>
            <li> It gives you the right amount of texture without making your hair look wet or hard like gel does.  </li>
            <li> too many artificial ingredients in this product.</li>
            <li> It has replaced other products that I used to use such as Morocan oil, pomade, manipulator and wax sticks.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, somewhat coarse hair that is just wavy and frizzy enough to require daily flat ironing.  </li>
            <li> This is our second round of ordering this product.  </li>
            <li> And only have to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> Since changing hair stylists I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding this product locally.</li>
            <li> It only takes a very small amount.</li>
            <li> Just a little dab will do you and we used to find these in stores but online works for my husband and me.  </li>
            <li> Little dab will do.  </li>
            <li> It is a little grainy.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday no matter how I style my hair.  </li>
            <li> Just a small amount works.</li>
            <li> Small dab on Palm, rub palm and dab hair.</li>
            <li> , you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Not to thick or thin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find in salons anymore.  </li>
            <li> were artificial</li>
