            <li>Super product...</li>
            <li>First, the lavender scent is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is a natural soap and contains no nasty fillers and rinses clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t rave about personal care products, but this soap is amazing.</li>
            <li>I love its natural and not over powering.</li>
            <li>Although this soap is a bit pricey, it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and break out easily with perfumed soap.</li>
            <li>It also makes my face feel soft, smooth, and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Dead sea salt is good for the body.  </li>
            <li>I have an oily complexion and it keeps my skin clear and clean.</li>
            <li>This soap is a real treat to use, the fragrance is very relaxing and it leaves your skin so soft and smooth.</li>

            <li>I will still buy it and it is far better than you find a general store.</li>
            <li>Plus the bar itself is large and lasts for well over a month.</li>
            <li>It does not leave any residue and it cleaned very well.  </li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll really like it.</li>
            <li>No longer do I need special facial cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I STRONGLY recommend this soap - especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I like to change scents fairly often, but it last SO DARN LONG that I actually have to take it out of the shower and store it in a ziplock bag</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product..</li>
            <li>I also use this to clean my face while showering, and it never leave dryness on my face after usage like other type of soap.  </li>
            <li>skin.&lt;br /&gt;The soap was packed in conventional packing box, then in a white box that would be nice if you were to give the soap as a gift and all the bars were individually wrapped.</li>
            <li>The bars last quite a while and really help to clear up skin problems.</li>
            <li>I bought a bar of this soap at Central Market, but got it much cheaper through Amazon.  </li>

            <li> The Dead ea Mineral soap is exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I finally found a soap that I can use on my extremely sensitive skin - when I was little, I could only use Ivory soap, but as I am over 40 now, it dries my skin.  </li>
            <li> and you get 6 bars which will last a long time.</li>
            <li> lavendar fragrance is subtle and so far, this soap has not caused any problems to my extra sensitive</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time!  </li>
            <li> If you like the smell of lavender and you suffer from dry, itchy skin, give it a shot.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin from getting too dry.</li>
            <li> I looked on Amazon and they had the same product in a larger size for less money!</li>
            <li> - it lasts too long!!  </li>
            <li> Plus my skin is very dry.</li>
            <li> It soothes my psoriasis and never burns or hurts cracked rough skin.  </li>

            <li> I am disappointed though in the price hike of over $10 above the price I paid a few months ago when I originally purchased the lavender soap bars.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint</li>
            <li> After few weeks the smell starts to fade out.</li>
            <li> One with Nature Dead Sea Mineral Soap is a God sent.  </li>

            <li> But, I went over to this soap because other triple milled soap was getting expensive.</li>
            <li> When he has a really bad break out he only use the cortizone then.  </li>
            <li> He is also under a physician&#x27;s care and uses cortizone, but cortizone is not good to use all the time.</li>
            <li> Well, this brand became expensive too.</li>

This soap was such a relief!  It moisturizes my skin and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation at all!!  My only complaint - it lasts too long!!  I like to change scents fairly often, but it last SO DARN LONG that I actually have to take it out of the shower and store it in a ziplock bag so I can switch scents!!  I STRONGLY recommend this soap - especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this soap.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  I have an oily complexion and it keeps my skin clear and clean.</li>

            <li> Some of the best soap I have used.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t rave about personal care products, but this soap is amazing. First, the lavender scent is fantastic. It doesn&#x27;t smell sweet or flowery, it just smells like a field of lavender. It&#x27;s like an aromatherapy treatment every time you shower. The bars last quite a while and really help to clear up skin problems. If you like the smell of lavender and you suffer from dry, itchy skin, give it a shot. I think you&#x27;ll really like it.</li>
            <li> My husband has eczema. Especially in the winter time. His skin gets so dry and the eczema really breaks out.  He was watching Dr. Oz one day, and they said to use lavender for eczema break outs.  He really has to watch what kind of soap he baths in. One with Nature Dead Sea Mineral Soap is a God sent.  He also uses Lavender oil with this, and keeps his eczema pretty much under control.   I bought a bar of this soap at Central Market, but got it much cheaper through Amazon.  He is also under a physician&#x27;s care and uses cortizone, but cortizone is not good to use all the time. This way he keeps it under control naturally. When he has a really bad break out he only use the cortizone then.  Nancy Young Smithville Texas</li>
            <li> This soap brand is my favorite. I love its natural and not over powering. It does not have a perfuming type of smell. Its a great gift too. I put the extras in  my clothing drawers so my clothes smell great and also the linen closet. Very pleasant and relaxing.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely wonderful soap!!! I was getting for my local health food supermarket.  But it is cheaper here!  It smells wonderful!  It lasts a long time!  It has a wonderful lather!  Your skin will love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift and i think it;s going to be a hit/ It smells real good</li>
            <li> I gave some of the bars to friends and family. When I went to reorder the Lavender bars, I discovered a substantial increase in price, I am not sure when I can buy again. I am disappointed though in the price hike of over $10 above the price I paid a few months ago when I originally purchased the lavender soap bars.  But I did like them.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for your skin.  I love these.</li>
            <li> Dead sea salt is good for the body.  This soap smells really good, and does seem to give a massaged feeling to the body after it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> love, love, love this soap!  I use it daily.  It soothes my psoriasis and never burns or hurts cracked rough skin.  It also makes my face feel soft, smooth, and moisturized.</li>
            <li> These soap bars are huge! They feel like they are twice the size of most soap bars. They do not \\&quot;melt\\&quot; away, either.&lt;br /&gt;The lavendar fragrance is subtle and so far, this soap has not caused any problems to my extra sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;The soap was packed in conventional packing box, then in a white box that would be nice if you were to give the soap as a gift and all the bars were individually wrapped. Good value, nice product, fast delivery, good packaging, gentle on the skin. Deserves 5 stars.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine gave me a bar of this soap when I was in Afghanistan. I have sensitive skin and break out easily with perfumed soap. Plus my skin is very dry. This soap is the best I have ever used! There is a slight scent to it, which is very pleasing and not overbearing. It keeps my skin from getting too dry. Plus the bar itself is large and lasts for well over a month. Although this soap is a bit pricey, it is well worth it. It pays for itself by lasting such a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  I found it originally in a natural store near my house, but after I moved I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  I was so happy to get the bulk pack from Amazon!  It has a nice, strong lavender smell and feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for lavender soap for a while, I feel we have finally found a soap we can stick with.</li>
            <li> The soap is a good product. But, I went over to this soap because other triple milled soap was getting expensive. Well, this brand became expensive too. So, I probably will search for a cheaper version.</li>
            <li> Love the strong scent and my soft skin.  I have given this as gifts because I love it so much!</li>
