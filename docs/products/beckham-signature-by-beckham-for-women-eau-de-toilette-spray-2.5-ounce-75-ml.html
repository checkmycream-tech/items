            <li>Very strong flowery smell....</li>
            <li>Love the scent and love the price!</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this fragrance and loved it, so I ordered the full version.</li>
            <li>I really love this item.</li>
            <li>I can not find it in any stores but really love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>Initially I get a delicious blend of apple, anise, and patchouli - what a treat! -</li>
            <li>One of my favorite scents.  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this perfume and have gotten many compliments..</li>
            <li>I love it and the price is much better than what i originally paid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too sweet and not too floral, and it has some pretty good staying power without being overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Received order very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I like how they smell on paper and on others but on my skin they always seem to go from nice sweet to choking, cloying sweet</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to those who like strong fragrance.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;everything went fine.</li>
            <li>It is a perfect everyday scent.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fabulous and I recommend it,</li>
            <li>I especially enjoy the anise note because it reminds me of the German spice cookies that a family friend always used to share with my family when I was a kid on Christmas.</li>
            <li>Then I get to enjoy this sweet harmony for hours.</li>
            <li>She was so happy to get this hard to find scent she smiled for hours</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d pay top dollar for it in the department store, but for the price on Amazon, it&#x27;s a great purchase.  </li>
            <li>I bought one bottle; however, after I started using it and loved it, I went back and bought all the bottles they had.</li>
            <li>Beckham Signature has a quickly fading sweet floral followed by an old/faded musky smell.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not everyone&#x27;s favorite, but I love the combination of cool blue and floral scents.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on this that I came back to order more.  </li>
            <li>She has passed away now, but smelling anise always brings a smile and a sweet Christmas memory.</li>
            <li>The initial spray is so lovely!</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for the first time at Ulta beauty for $50 a couple of years ago</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and exactly as described</li>
            <li>at the right price.  </li>
            <li>right off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought two because the price was very reasonable</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t like sweet scents for myself.</li>
            <li>The sillage is really pretty low, but that doesn&#x27;t stop me from enjoying it.</li>
            <li>The perfume is exactly the way i remember it.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and a good, flowery fragrance for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t wear what I call cheap perfume, but this one actually smells really good and lasts a long while.id buy it again.</li>
            <li>Love this, it&#x27;s mature in a young lady way ..</li>
            <li>I would say this is pretty much a skin scent.</li>
            <li>It seems very strong at first, but mellows down in about an hour.</li>
            <li>this 1 would definitely cover up cigarette smoke but it was too strong for me</li>
            <li>When I found it on Amazon, the price was extremely reasonable, so I got one for myself too.  </li>
            <li>Very girly but not too florally.</li>
            <li>Hint of the following makes it a lovely mix but not a heavy scent:</li>
            <li>It has a flowery sweet scent and lasts, ive only worn it for about a week now</li>
            <li>I know it is an older product</li>
            <li>I had bought this one a few years back at a store and loved it, then they quit selling it...</li>
            <li>No alcohol or other strong chemical-like smell to deal with as seems to happen sometimes with perfumes.</li>
            <li>The perfume itself is very light, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>The last four bottles I&#x27;ve purchased have been from Amazon at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments for this perfume, it is not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li>I can still smell the last of it on my wrists about seven hours after the first spritz.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent to wear everyday!  </li>
            <li>I am completely hooked on it.</li>
            <li>The fruit &amp; florals goes very well for a daily wear</li>
            <li>I would say maybe another half hour before the base notes warm up and a lovely musk arrives and is an absolute delight with the vanilla and patchouli that are both still with me.</li>
            <li>I spray it on everyday just for a quick lift of spirit.</li>
            <li>Lasts for a long time, but it is hard to put too much on (although not impossible).</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I do love the scent, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t last long on me.</li>
            <li> (we really only smell something for about 30 minutes before our noses stop smelling that particular smell in preparation of smelling something new), it&#x27;s not surprising that people think it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It is very pleasing and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long, but everyone that smells it, likes it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t wait long to receive my order</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read other reviews here of people mentioning that they don&#x27;t think it lasts very long; but given the way that the olfactory system works</li>
            <li> For some reason my skin loves this vanilla because it stays with me from spraying through the dry down.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Just like 3 of the other perfumes I really like unfortunately.</li>
            <li> After a short while, about half hour, the orchid arrives, dancing delicately with the patchouli and vanilla.</li>
            <li> but i saw for cheaper at my store for less than you sold me</li>
            <li> Truly, I think I&#x27;ve stopped smelling it altogether unless I&#x27;ve not worn it for a few day; however, the compliments just keep coming, so I keep wearing it.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts a while, about 4-5 hours at least with three sprays.</li>
            <li> this is a subtle scent that appeals to both men and women.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item for my mother and she was unable to purchase in stores.</li>

            <li> I bought this for my sister who was searching on various websites and stores for this.  When I found it on Amazon, the price was extremely reasonable, so I got one for myself too.  I do love the scent, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t last long on me.</li>
            <li> I really love this item. I can not find it in any stores but really love the smell. I hope amazon will continue to sell it. This is my number one cologne.</li>
            <li> I found this perfume about three or four years ago at a close out sale. I bought one bottle; however, after I started using it and loved it, I went back and bought all the bottles they had. The last four bottles I&#x27;ve purchased have been from Amazon at a very reasonable price. The perfume itself is very light, not overwhelming. I always get compliments about smelling good. I&#x27;ve used it every day for the last three or four years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read other reviews here of people mentioning that they don&#x27;t think it lasts very long; but given the way that the olfactory system works (we really only smell something for about 30 minutes before our noses stop smelling that particular smell in preparation of smelling something new), it&#x27;s not surprising that people think it doesn&#x27;t last long. Truly, I think I&#x27;ve stopped smelling it altogether unless I&#x27;ve not worn it for a few day; however, the compliments just keep coming, so I keep wearing it. I love this perfume. It is a perfect everyday scent.</li>
            <li> I get many compliments for this perfume, it is not overwhelming at all. I know it is an older product but it is a good one.</li>
            <li> beautiful fragrance. lasts for hours and even lasts on clothing. it&#x27;s fabulous and I recommend it, the day it came my friend loved it and is ordering it!</li>
            <li> Very nice smelling perfume.</li>
            <li> Bought this after getting a sample from a local store... It is the perfect summer fragance because of its light odor. Very girly but not too florally. Hint of the following makes it a lovely mix but not a heavy scent: Candy apple, Patchouli, Musk, Vanilla, Heliotrope, Anise flower, Amber, Orchid. This is MY &#x27;signature scent&#x27; for the summer!</li>
            <li> Think I have to get used to the scents.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for perfumes I like. I had bought this one a few years back at a store and loved it, then they quit selling it... Just like 3 of the other perfumes I really like unfortunately. So happy to find this one, at a great price!</li>
            <li> What a yummy concoction! I normally don&#x27;t like sweet scents for myself. I like how they smell on paper and on others but on my skin they always seem to go from nice sweet to choking, cloying sweet and I end up scrubbing. I bought this without smelling it...I know that is risky, but I took a chance and...hooray for a very successful, happy buy! The initial spray is so lovely! No alcohol or other strong chemical-like smell to deal with as seems to happen sometimes with perfumes. Initially I get a delicious blend of apple, anise, and patchouli - what a treat! - but I also already smell the vanilla. For some reason my skin loves this vanilla because it stays with me from spraying through the dry down. (Hooray!) I especially enjoy the anise note because it reminds me of the German spice cookies that a family friend always used to share with my family when I was a kid on Christmas. She has passed away now, but smelling anise always brings a smile and a sweet Christmas memory. After a short while, about half hour, the orchid arrives, dancing delicately with the patchouli and vanilla. I would say maybe another half hour before the base notes warm up and a lovely musk arrives and is an absolute delight with the vanilla and patchouli that are both still with me. Then I get to enjoy this sweet harmony for hours. Bliss! I would say this is pretty much a skin scent. The sillage is really pretty low, but that doesn&#x27;t stop me from enjoying it. For me it is actually a plus since my husband hates vanilla. I can still smell the last of it on my wrists about seven hours after the first spritz. For my skin, that is lasting a looong time.  Cheers!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent to wear everyday!  Everyone asks what I&#x27;m wearing for fragrance!  It used to pay for this in the big department stores but now I find it here and it has always shipped perfectly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received so many compliments on this that I came back to order more.  It&#x27;s not too sweet and not too floral, and it has some pretty good staying power without being overwhelming.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d pay top dollar for it in the department store, but for the price on Amazon, it&#x27;s a great purchase.  Recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter because she loves the smell&lt;br /&gt;and had run out.&lt;br /&gt;everything went fine. Ran into no problems.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents.  The price was great and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> My sister wanted this perfume.I looked everywhere and never found it.I tried my chance on Amazone and I found it.I bought two because the price was very reasonable</li>
            <li> I have used versace bright crystal for years and decided to try Beckham Signature because of the great reviews.  Beckham Signature has a quickly fading sweet floral followed by an old/faded musky smell.  I ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> Very good price and smells great on my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to women who want to smell good, or ???</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. I am completely hooked on it. A little bit goes a long way!</li>

            <li> Inexpensive and a good, flowery fragrance for everyday use. The scent lasts a while, about 4-5 hours at least with three sprays. It seems very strong at first, but mellows down in about an hour.</li>
            <li> its nice perfume but i saw for cheaper at my store for less than you sold me but anyways i bought because of gift cards</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for the first time at Ulta beauty for $50 a couple of years ago and i absolutely loved it!&lt;br /&gt;Then when i went back to buy it again when i ran out they discontinued it in the store. So i went searching online and found it on overstock.com and here on amazon, and amazon was cheaper so here i am. The perfume is exactly the way i remember it. It has a flowery sweet scent and lasts, ive only worn it for about a week now and i get compliments on my perfume all of the time. I love it and the price is much better than what i originally paid. Thank you amazon!</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume! Love the scent and love the price! I am starting my third bottle.</li>
            <li> this is a subtle scent that appeals to both men and women.  great value for the price, one of my favorite budget scents.</li>
            <li> Received order very quickly.  Excellent product  at the right price.  Good experience.  Would recommend Amazon to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> This perfume was given to me as a gift. My boyfriend loves to smell it on me. When I ran out and started using something else he noticed right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never run out again!!!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this and it smells great on my skin. Lasts for a long time, but it is hard to put too much on (although not impossible). It&#x27;s not everyone&#x27;s favorite, but I love the combination of cool blue and floral scents.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and exactly as described</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t wear what I call cheap perfume, but this one actually smells really good and lasts a long while.id buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love the scent. Didn&#x27;t wait long to receive my order</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! it smells amazing i cant wait to order my next bottle</li>
            <li> Very strong flowery smell.... I would recommend it to those who like strong fragrance.  this 1 would definitely cover up cigarette smoke but it was too strong for me</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume and have gotten many compliments.. I hope the price remains the same...</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my mother and she was unable to purchase in stores. She was so happy to get this hard to find scent she smiled for hours</li>
            <li> Love this, it&#x27;s mature in a young lady way .. The fruit &amp; florals goes very well for a daily wear</li>
