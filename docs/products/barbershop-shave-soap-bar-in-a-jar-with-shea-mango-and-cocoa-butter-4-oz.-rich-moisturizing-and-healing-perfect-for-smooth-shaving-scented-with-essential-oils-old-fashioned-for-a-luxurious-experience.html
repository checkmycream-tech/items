            <li>Need more of the Orange and mango.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m more of a mug guy.</li>

            <li>has become my favorite thing to use</li>

            <li>I will be sure and order more when the time comes</li>
            <li>One of the better shave soaps I have tried.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the brush or this soap, but shaving is a much better experience now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving my head and most of my beard for about a decade now.</li>
            <li>I received this product free in exchange for an honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of my favorite shave soaps.</li>
            <li>expect that I didn&#x27;t buy more.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the results from using the Barbershop Shave Soap in a Jar.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I should have known better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not suggesting it is toxic, just that you won&#x27;t find it in the quality shaving soaps (which of course, are more costly).&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Works very well and smells great.  </li>
            <li>It  has a nice lather and provides a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Also its easier to use it more sparingly.</li>
            <li>I am not complaining here - I say it&#x27;s a good 4 star, and worth a try.</li>
            <li>It gave a smooth and clean shave with good lubrication.  </li>
            <li>This gives the soap a soft mint hue and a beautiful hand poured froth on the top, ensuring each soap is one of a kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The orange is definitely more pronounced than the bay rum, which is fine for someone like me who likes orange a lot.</li>
            <li>I was able to get a smooth shave with using the shave soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this shave soap as it is smooth and creamy and moisturizing for the shave.</li>
            <li>More importantly it didn&#x27;t give me the glide and smoothness</li>
            <li>The smoothest and most comfortable shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li>Wonderful scent, great lather , long lasting puck.</li>
            <li>The shave soap bar in a jar spreads easily onto the skin.</li>
            <li>Having a shaving product that leaves my legs feeling smooth, moisturized and smelling good, makes the whole shaving process tolerable.</li>
            <li>Clove scent way too strong.  </li>
            <li>If you like fine French-style shave soap that you work up a lather and apply with a brush, the BebeLush is for you.</li>
            <li>I used a &#x27;Stirling Soap Co.&#x27; Best badger which is a little stiffer than a silver tip.</li>
            <li>He really like the scent and said it lathered nicely.</li>
            <li>Gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>This shave soap is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is a bit manly smelling, however I quite enjoy it and the scent does not bother me one bit.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic shaving soap.</li>
            <li>Lathers nice and protects very well.</li>
            <li>So why wait on having smooth skin go order your Barbershop Shave Soap in a Jar TODAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li>May your humble servant suggest that these 3 are the best in alphabetical order: Art of Shaving cream in a tube, Kiss My Face (lime) and Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat soap.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and not offensive.</li>
            <li>It has a sweet smell, so I think it would easily work with both men and women.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong scent (Bay Rum, sweet orange, and clove), which I like a lot.</li>
            <li>A great shaving soap nonetheless, just know the minor caveats.</li>
            <li>Most importantly the lather gives a soft and smooth shave!</li>
            <li>I chose BebeLush shaving soap for my re-entry into the world of brush-and-soap shaving, the old fashioned way, and I am very glad I did.  </li>
            <li>This soap has a clean ingredient list and it lathers beautifully with the slickness, density, and cushion wet shavers prize.  </li>
            <li>The bay rum, orange and clove essential oils make a wonderful, natural scent.</li>
            <li>The soap lathered up easily on the puck and in a bowl and made a nice moderate lather that rinsed of the razors easily but didn&#x27;t fall of the blade.  </li>
            <li>I love bay rum scents, and I love sweet orange scents, so this was a natural to try.</li>
            <li>It gives a rich lather with a mild scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too crazy about the scent - the best way I could describe it would be &amp;#34;spicy orange peel&amp;#34; and I&#x27;d prefer something a little more manly - but it lathers nice and helps you get a great shave, even with a cartridge razor.</li>
            <li>Some are great in giving substantial lather, slickness and smooth shave while others are not worth the money paid for them.  </li>
            <li>but I recommend using enough to get a good lather, to lubricate.</li>
            <li>I am sure it would make the shave soap bar much easier to</li>
            <li>I will only recommend products that I think are truly good</li>
            <li>I will only recommend products that I think are truly good</li>
            <li>I used a straight razor and a safety razor with equally satisfying results.</li>
            <li>that translate to is a nice lather that leaves your skin feeling soft without chemicals or an over powering scent.</li>
            <li>Then I loaded the brush for almost a full minute.</li>
            <li>Its not bad.</li>
            <li>The soap lathers nicely, stays wet and lubricates without drying out during the entire shaving process, gives a truly smooth, clean shave, and smells great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try to finish this up, but will most likely not be ordering any more.</li>
            <li>The smell is of orange and mild clove.</li>
            <li>Got it quickly.</li>
            <li>the natural ingredients, super moisturizing natural butters for soft, kissable skin and the compact packaging, perfect for the medicine cabinet or your man&#x27;s travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shave soap to anyone looking for a smooth and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin which is always a good thing.</li>
            <li>The chemicals and most womens shaving creams leave my legs more dry, so I was hoping this one would be as moisturizing as it claims to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is worth every cent paid I paid for it.</li>
            <li>So, if you are a man or woman and you use shaving gels or creams, I guarantee you’ll enjoy the BebeLush Shave Soap Bar in a Jar much better than what you currently use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I guarantee you’ll enjoy the BebeLush Shave Soap Bar in a Jar much better than what you currently use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives a nice lather and it doesn&#x27;t dry out that quickly once applied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just started using this shave soap in place of normal shaving cream and am loving it so far.</li>
            <li>Nice creamy lather, but a little too strong smell to my taste</li>
            <li>I tried this shave soap because of the near perfect customer reviews, but I am reminded of how personal, personal care products can be.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li>The third pass was just as smooth and comfortable as the first pass.  </li>
            <li>The scent was quite sweet and not overbearing, strong notes of cloves and oranges mixed with the Bay Rum as soon as I opened the tin.</li>
            <li>If you want sexy smooth skin without the irritation from those other products; Barbershop Shave Soap in a Jar is the way to go.</li>
            <li>What I do like better about this brand is that it more &amp;#34;solid&amp;#34; and less &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; out of the jar and doesn&#x27;t absorb water as readily.</li>
            <li>straight to the trash !</li>
            <li>I popped open the can when I first received the soap and &amp;#34;Wow!&amp;#34; I love the scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shaved with it this morning.</li>
            <li>I have even tried this with a shaving oil, putting on the oil first and then whipping up a lather with this and my brush</li>
            <li>When you see a lather start to form, continue rubbing for 15-20 seconds to make sure the brush has enough soap on it.</li>
            <li>is definitely a product that I love.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Lathers pretty well even in the semi-hard well water I have.</li>
            <li>Nice scent but not really Bay Rum.</li>
            <li>This is the first time my husband has used a shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>My first clue should have been the predominance of propylene Glycol in the ingredient list.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re used to the commercial canned products, and want to experiment playing with a shaving brush, this will be OK for you.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It also seems to lather really well for shaving!</li>
            <li>It has shea, cocoa and mango butters which leaves my skin soft and smooth and allows for a moisturizing lather.  </li>
            <li>well, smells good - without heavy lingering odors.</li>
            <li>a little mild, lathers well and provides nice glide</li>
            <li>They scent their soap with an amazing combination of essential oils, and colored it with natural cocoa powder.</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients, moisturizing and clean scent...</li>
            <li>After trying several shave soaps I finally found the good stuff.</li>
            <li>A major plus is that is smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>First, I really dislike the fragrance.</li>
            <li>The soap is scented with pure essential oils for a scent that is fresh and clean scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Overall a great choice for those who enjoy a traditional wet shave.</li>
            <li>Product itself is very good, but tin  makes waste of product, especially when new.</li>
            <li>I used a EJ DE86 with Feather blade, 2 passes: WTG &amp; ATG, and followed up with Alum and Mr. Fine&#x27;s American Blend Aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to say it is far better than any other shaving soap I&#x27;ve previously tried, giving a fantastic lather, and it has a pleasant scent that&#x27;s just right--strong enough to smell it, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Runs out a bit more quickly than competing brands due to its soft composition, and does not work with shaving mugs, so those are the downsides.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as thick as I wanted, but actually it does a very good job and provides a smooth, low nick shave.</li>
            <li>Plus, it doesn&#x27;t seem to lubricate as much either.</li>
            <li>Left me with a close comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>touch of water made it really sudsy  </li>
            <li>I really like the scent of this shave soap.  </li>
            <li>sent of the  soap is gentle, but distinctive in it&#x27;s presents.</li>
            <li>If you have a shaving soap bar brush, wet it and then shake it out before briskly rubbing it over the top of the shaving soap.</li>
            <li>Dries too fast for me.</li>
            <li>At this reasonable price, I would recommend buying this soap.</li>
            <li>This soap really lathered up fast.  </li>
            <li>I was also pleasantly surprised to see that it&#x27;s made in the US with all-natural ingredients - something increasingly rare in this day and age.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend you give this a try!</li>
            <li>Personally, I do not have a shaving brush, so I used another product that I got to review and that did not work in its original form.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different creams, gels and lotions over the years and not a single one comes close to this.</li>
            <li>Takes a few times to get the ratio of water right, but after you get it down, it whips up a pretty good lather.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has amazing lather, slick and holds up while on your face.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I was not sure what it was going to smell like</li>
            <li>The lather building process was rather quick; it took a minute or so with the Omega 2012 brush and there was enough lather for a 3 pass shave.</li>
            <li>My legs were so smooth and soft after using the shave soap even the next day after I shaved with it.</li>
            <li>Gr8 mild  smell.long lasting soap</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone who shaves in the morning and gets a 5 o clock shadow by night..</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Smells great, but it&#x27;s a lousy shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I had zero nicks or cuts using this, and it did in fact leave my legs smooth (without oiling up my bathtub and making it a slipping hazard).</li>
            <li>Provides me a smooth shave with minimal suds.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very outdoorsy and masculine smelling.</li>
            <li>It gets its natural color from cocoa powder versus synthetic dyes which I really appreciate.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried more than a few brands.</li>
            <li>I normally get razor burn on my neck, but have had zero problems since using this shave soap.</li>
            <li>Porasso I normally use.</li>
            <li>Live the smell.</li>
            <li>so I bought another set for the shower but always liking to try new things I tried the Bebelush eucalyptus soap here.</li>
            <li>Despite numerous face-offs against each other and all challengers I have still not been able to narrow it down to one single best product.</li>
            <li>Smells ok but has a different smell than expected.</li>
            <li>Not as smooth a shave as Dreadnaught or Wool Fat but for regular daily use</li>
            <li>It lathered up quite easily and produced a large amount of lather with just a small amount of soap needed.  </li>
            <li>Will buy again as it keeps my skin smooth enough to use my straight razor with minimal cuts.</li>
            <li>First off, I am a big fan of the bay rum scent and even my wife noticed and complimented me on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After testing this for about a week in my usual face-off against my top tier champions pitting one side of my face against the other and alternating sides and order of use I would have to place this in my next to the top tier.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I was a little surprised at how easy my razor glided over my legs.</li>
            <li>Scented with pure essential oils of cedar wood, cassia and clove for a woodsy and spicy natural</li>
            <li>Free of all synthetic fragrances, dyes and preservatives, you never have to worry about what chemicals will do to your delicate skin.&lt;br /&gt;Artisan handmade soap are colored with natural cocoa powder which leaves a little froth on top.</li>
            <li>Although this was roughly twice as much as the Proraso, I don&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li>This is my second product by BeBe Lush, their products are high quality!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the scent as much as I thought I would (totally subjective opinion - YMMV).</li>
            <li>Again, this type of experience is very subjective as every person&#x27;s opinions (and skin) is different.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that my legs remained soft and moisturized even after toweling off, without putting any lotion on.</li>
            <li>Smell reminds me of old style barbershops.  </li>
            <li>SKin is soft.</li>
            <li>have been using the Old Fashioned Barbershop Shave Soap from BebeLush.  </li>
            <li>I found it very soothing to shave with and left no irritation at all.</li>
            <li>I had been using Taylor of Old bond shave soap almost exclusively since I started using a safety razor a couple of years ago.</li>
            <li>Plus after only a few uses he was raving about how much better his skin felt.</li>
            <li>I feel it&#x27;s pricey, but the flip side to this is it takes very little for a nice lather, and leaves your skin soft without the dry pulling feel.</li>
            <li>Lathers up easily even in hard water.  </li>
            <li>Easy to build a thick luxurious lather.</li>
            <li>Had expected product to come in an actual jar which would have lent it better portability since it would have been water tight.</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all, and doesn&#x27;t even really smell like bay rum once it lathers.  </li>
            <li>However, I think I will be investing in a shaving soap brush in the near future.</li>
            <li>Recently I bought a brush and Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood soap sold on amazon.</li>
            <li>Second, if you get it near your eyes it burns like hell.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no drag either.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have is I do break out after using it, compared to the sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It is a little sweet smelling, but it isn&#x27;t long lasting.</li>
            <li>The only other one i can really do it with is Proraso.  </li>
            <li>The lather was thick, rich, slick and very cushiony, comparable to TOBS &amp; Barrister &amp; Mann (of what I&#x27;ve used before).</li>

            <li> One of my favorite shave soaps.</li>
            <li> expect that I didn&#x27;t buy more.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the results from using the Barbershop Shave Soap in a Jar.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> I should have known better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not suggesting it is toxic, just that you won&#x27;t find it in the quality shaving soaps (which of course, are more costly).&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Works very well and smells great.  </li>
            <li> It  has a nice lather and provides a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Also its easier to use it more sparingly.</li>
            <li> I am not complaining here - I say it&#x27;s a good 4 star, and worth a try.</li>
            <li> It gave a smooth and clean shave with good lubrication.  </li>
            <li> This gives the soap a soft mint hue and a beautiful hand poured froth on the top, ensuring each soap is one of a kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The orange is definitely more pronounced than the bay rum, which is fine for someone like me who likes orange a lot.</li>
            <li> I was able to get a smooth shave with using the shave soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this shave soap as it is smooth and creamy and moisturizing for the shave.</li>
            <li> More importantly it didn&#x27;t give me the glide and smoothness</li>
            <li> The smoothest and most comfortable shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent, great lather , long lasting puck.</li>
            <li> The shave soap bar in a jar spreads easily onto the skin.</li>
            <li> Having a shaving product that leaves my legs feeling smooth, moisturized and smelling good, makes the whole shaving process tolerable.</li>
            <li> Clove scent way too strong.  </li>
            <li> If you like fine French-style shave soap that you work up a lather and apply with a brush, the BebeLush is for you.</li>
            <li> I used a &#x27;Stirling Soap Co.&#x27; Best badger which is a little stiffer than a silver tip.</li>
            <li> He really like the scent and said it lathered nicely.</li>
            <li> Gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This shave soap is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is a bit manly smelling, however I quite enjoy it and the scent does not bother me one bit.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Lathers nice and protects very well.</li>
            <li> So why wait on having smooth skin go order your Barbershop Shave Soap in a Jar TODAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li> May your humble servant suggest that these 3 are the best in alphabetical order: Art of Shaving cream in a tube, Kiss My Face (lime) and Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat soap.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and not offensive.</li>
            <li> It has a sweet smell, so I think it would easily work with both men and women.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong scent (Bay Rum, sweet orange, and clove), which I like a lot.</li>
            <li> A great shaving soap nonetheless, just know the minor caveats.</li>
            <li> Most importantly the lather gives a soft and smooth shave!</li>
            <li> I chose BebeLush shaving soap for my re-entry into the world of brush-and-soap shaving, the old fashioned way, and I am very glad I did.  </li>
            <li> This soap has a clean ingredient list and it lathers beautifully with the slickness, density, and cushion wet shavers prize.  </li>
            <li> The bay rum, orange and clove essential oils make a wonderful, natural scent.</li>
            <li> The soap lathered up easily on the puck and in a bowl and made a nice moderate lather that rinsed of the razors easily but didn&#x27;t fall of the blade.  </li>
            <li> I love bay rum scents, and I love sweet orange scents, so this was a natural to try.</li>
            <li> It gives a rich lather with a mild scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too crazy about the scent - the best way I could describe it would be &amp;#34;spicy orange peel&amp;#34; and I&#x27;d prefer something a little more manly - but it lathers nice and helps you get a great shave, even with a cartridge razor.</li>
            <li> Some are great in giving substantial lather, slickness and smooth shave while others are not worth the money paid for them.  </li>
            <li> but I recommend using enough to get a good lather, to lubricate.</li>
            <li> I am sure it would make the shave soap bar much easier to</li>
            <li> I will only recommend products that I think are truly good</li>
            <li> I will only recommend products that I think are truly good</li>
            <li> I used a straight razor and a safety razor with equally satisfying results.</li>
            <li> that translate to is a nice lather that leaves your skin feeling soft without chemicals or an over powering scent.</li>
            <li> Then I loaded the brush for almost a full minute.</li>
            <li> Its not bad.</li>
            <li> The soap lathers nicely, stays wet and lubricates without drying out during the entire shaving process, gives a truly smooth, clean shave, and smells great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to finish this up, but will most likely not be ordering any more.</li>
            <li> The smell is of orange and mild clove.</li>
            <li> Got it quickly.</li>
            <li> the natural ingredients, super moisturizing natural butters for soft, kissable skin and the compact packaging, perfect for the medicine cabinet or your man&#x27;s travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shave soap to anyone looking for a smooth and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin which is always a good thing.</li>
            <li> The chemicals and most womens shaving creams leave my legs more dry, so I was hoping this one would be as moisturizing as it claims to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is worth every cent paid I paid for it.</li>
            <li> So, if you are a man or woman and you use shaving gels or creams, I guarantee you’ll enjoy the BebeLush Shave Soap Bar in a Jar much better than what you currently use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It gives a nice lather and it doesn&#x27;t dry out that quickly once applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this shave soap in place of normal shaving cream and am loving it so far.</li>
            <li> Nice creamy lather, but a little too strong smell to my taste</li>
            <li> I tried this shave soap because of the near perfect customer reviews, but I am reminded of how personal, personal care products can be.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> The third pass was just as smooth and comfortable as the first pass.  </li>
            <li> The scent was quite sweet and not overbearing, strong notes of cloves and oranges mixed with the Bay Rum as soon as I opened the tin.</li>
            <li> If you want sexy smooth skin without the irritation from those other products; Barbershop Shave Soap in a Jar is the way to go.</li>
            <li> What I do like better about this brand is that it more &amp;#34;solid&amp;#34; and less &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; out of the jar and doesn&#x27;t absorb water as readily.</li>
            <li> straight to the trash !</li>
            <li> I popped open the can when I first received the soap and &amp;#34;Wow!&amp;#34; I love the scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shaved with it this morning.</li>
            <li> I have even tried this with a shaving oil, putting on the oil first and then whipping up a lather with this and my brush</li>
            <li> When you see a lather start to form, continue rubbing for 15-20 seconds to make sure the brush has enough soap on it.</li>
            <li> is definitely a product that I love.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Lathers pretty well even in the semi-hard well water I have.</li>
            <li> Nice scent but not really Bay Rum.</li>
            <li> This is the first time my husband has used a shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> My first clue should have been the predominance of propylene Glycol in the ingredient list.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to the commercial canned products, and want to experiment playing with a shaving brush, this will be OK for you.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It also seems to lather really well for shaving!</li>
            <li> It has shea, cocoa and mango butters which leaves my skin soft and smooth and allows for a moisturizing lather.  </li>
            <li> well, smells good - without heavy lingering odors.</li>
            <li> a little mild, lathers well and provides nice glide</li>
            <li> They scent their soap with an amazing combination of essential oils, and colored it with natural cocoa powder.</li>
            <li> Natural ingredients, moisturizing and clean scent...</li>
            <li> After trying several shave soaps I finally found the good stuff.</li>
            <li> A major plus is that is smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> First, I really dislike the fragrance.</li>
            <li> The soap is scented with pure essential oils for a scent that is fresh and clean scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Overall a great choice for those who enjoy a traditional wet shave.</li>
            <li> Product itself is very good, but tin  makes waste of product, especially when new.</li>
            <li> I used a EJ DE86 with Feather blade, 2 passes: WTG &amp; ATG, and followed up with Alum and Mr. Fine&#x27;s American Blend Aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to say it is far better than any other shaving soap I&#x27;ve previously tried, giving a fantastic lather, and it has a pleasant scent that&#x27;s just right--strong enough to smell it, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Runs out a bit more quickly than competing brands due to its soft composition, and does not work with shaving mugs, so those are the downsides.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as thick as I wanted, but actually it does a very good job and provides a smooth, low nick shave.</li>
            <li> Plus, it doesn&#x27;t seem to lubricate as much either.</li>
            <li> Left me with a close comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> touch of water made it really sudsy  </li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this shave soap.  </li>
            <li> sent of the  soap is gentle, but distinctive in it&#x27;s presents.</li>
            <li> If you have a shaving soap bar brush, wet it and then shake it out before briskly rubbing it over the top of the shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Dries too fast for me.</li>
            <li> At this reasonable price, I would recommend buying this soap.</li>
            <li> This soap really lathered up fast.  </li>
            <li> I was also pleasantly surprised to see that it&#x27;s made in the US with all-natural ingredients - something increasingly rare in this day and age.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend you give this a try!</li>
            <li> Personally, I do not have a shaving brush, so I used another product that I got to review and that did not work in its original form.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different creams, gels and lotions over the years and not a single one comes close to this.</li>
            <li> Takes a few times to get the ratio of water right, but after you get it down, it whips up a pretty good lather.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has amazing lather, slick and holds up while on your face.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I was not sure what it was going to smell like</li>
            <li> The lather building process was rather quick; it took a minute or so with the Omega 2012 brush and there was enough lather for a 3 pass shave.</li>
            <li> My legs were so smooth and soft after using the shave soap even the next day after I shaved with it.</li>
            <li> Gr8 mild  smell.long lasting soap</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for anyone who shaves in the morning and gets a 5 o clock shadow by night..</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but it&#x27;s a lousy shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I had zero nicks or cuts using this, and it did in fact leave my legs smooth (without oiling up my bathtub and making it a slipping hazard).</li>
            <li> Provides me a smooth shave with minimal suds.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very outdoorsy and masculine smelling.</li>
            <li> It gets its natural color from cocoa powder versus synthetic dyes which I really appreciate.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried more than a few brands.</li>
            <li> I normally get razor burn on my neck, but have had zero problems since using this shave soap.</li>
            <li> Porasso I normally use.</li>
            <li> Live the smell.</li>
            <li> so I bought another set for the shower but always liking to try new things I tried the Bebelush eucalyptus soap here.</li>
            <li> Despite numerous face-offs against each other and all challengers I have still not been able to narrow it down to one single best product.</li>
            <li> Smells ok but has a different smell than expected.</li>
            <li> Not as smooth a shave as Dreadnaught or Wool Fat but for regular daily use</li>
            <li> It lathered up quite easily and produced a large amount of lather with just a small amount of soap needed.  </li>
            <li> Will buy again as it keeps my skin smooth enough to use my straight razor with minimal cuts.</li>
            <li> First off, I am a big fan of the bay rum scent and even my wife noticed and complimented me on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After testing this for about a week in my usual face-off against my top tier champions pitting one side of my face against the other and alternating sides and order of use I would have to place this in my next to the top tier.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I was a little surprised at how easy my razor glided over my legs.</li>
            <li> Scented with pure essential oils of cedar wood, cassia and clove for a woodsy and spicy natural</li>
            <li> Free of all synthetic fragrances, dyes and preservatives, you never have to worry about what chemicals will do to your delicate skin.&lt;br /&gt;Artisan handmade soap are colored with natural cocoa powder which leaves a little froth on top.</li>
            <li> Although this was roughly twice as much as the Proraso, I don&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li> This is my second product by BeBe Lush, their products are high quality!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the scent as much as I thought I would (totally subjective opinion - YMMV).</li>
            <li> Again, this type of experience is very subjective as every person&#x27;s opinions (and skin) is different.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that my legs remained soft and moisturized even after toweling off, without putting any lotion on.</li>
            <li> Smell reminds me of old style barbershops.  </li>
            <li> SKin is soft.</li>
            <li> have been using the Old Fashioned Barbershop Shave Soap from BebeLush.  </li>
            <li> I found it very soothing to shave with and left no irritation at all.</li>
            <li> I had been using Taylor of Old bond shave soap almost exclusively since I started using a safety razor a couple of years ago.</li>
            <li> Plus after only a few uses he was raving about how much better his skin felt.</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s pricey, but the flip side to this is it takes very little for a nice lather, and leaves your skin soft without the dry pulling feel.</li>
            <li> Lathers up easily even in hard water.  </li>
            <li> Easy to build a thick luxurious lather.</li>
            <li> Had expected product to come in an actual jar which would have lent it better portability since it would have been water tight.</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all, and doesn&#x27;t even really smell like bay rum once it lathers.  </li>
            <li> However, I think I will be investing in a shaving soap brush in the near future.</li>
            <li> Recently I bought a brush and Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood soap sold on amazon.</li>
            <li> Second, if you get it near your eyes it burns like hell.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no drag either.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is I do break out after using it, compared to the sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It is a little sweet smelling, but it isn&#x27;t long lasting.</li>
            <li> The only other one i can really do it with is Proraso.  </li>
            <li> The lather was thick, rich, slick and very cushiony, comparable to TOBS &amp; Barrister &amp; Mann (of what I&#x27;ve used before).</li>
            <li> but it still does not last as long or lubricate as well as others.</li>
            <li> Each soap is a little different, as these are hand-poured and hand-finished with the finest natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> But if you want to step up your game, you&#x27;ll have to dig deeper and opt for a European brand (Art of Shaving is now made in U.S.A., and is certainly worth consideration as well).</li>
            <li> of course the key test is how well does the shave soap hold up -  and on that front this soap outperformed my previous shave soap by holding up on multiple passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but at this rate it might be a long long time before this soap wears out!</li>
            <li> This thick, rich and slick lather smells divine.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering other scents in the future.</li>
            <li> Both of these factors help this last a lot longer than other shave soaps I have used.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin dry.</li>
            <li> no itchy or dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different shaving soaps in the past.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and have been doing everything possible to make shaving less painful.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try something a little different as I&#x27;ve been using the Proraso Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol shaving soap.</li>
            <li> But then I tried a little differently on making a lather.</li>
            <li> I have tried about a dozen shave soaps, both hard soaps and soft soaps.  </li>
            <li> It takes a lot of time and effort to get a tiny bit of foam going and even then it lasts just a few seconds.</li>
            <li> The soap is much harder than the Proraso</li>
            <li> Not much smell and a harder soap than I anticipated</li>
            <li> Label peels when wet, but not docking any stars for that.</li>
            <li> I got the cloth wet, rubbed it on the shave soap and put it on my legs.</li>
            <li> It whipped up decent lather even with my very hard water.</li>
            <li> Also, a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> My face felt moisturized even after applying alum; did not get that dry, tight feeling.</li>
            <li> This one is a keeper in my shaving rotation, and I hope that BebeLush comes out with some other scents and products soon.</li>
            <li> Might also try the other scent too.</li>
            <li> not exactly the scent I desired.</li>
            <li> Above is just a small portion of my thoughts.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a lousy soap.</li>
            <li> only negative is the labels are paper and if they get wet like to peel</li>
            <li> I did pick up a slight &#x27;soapy&#x27; smell similar to Dove soap after each pass, but it was faint and didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> One can lasted about two and half months.</li>
            <li> I equate Barbershop Shave Soap to Van Der Hagen or Colonel Conk, (both high in propylene glycol); mediocre in quality, at a \\&quot;popular\\&quot; price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t usually happen with my other shave gel.</li>
            <li> so I cut out a few chunks and pressed them into my mug.</li>
            <li> Not drying out, or loosing it foaminess after being on your face for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I waited for a few weeks of using the soap before writing a review.</li>
            <li> After 24 hours from a pervious shave I grow a medium heavy beard</li>
            <li> Okay...first, there is very little foamy soap formed unlike the sandalwood.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s going to be hard to resist using it for everyday shaving.</li>
            <li> totally wasted money !</li>
            <li> He has only used it once and it addicted!</li>
            <li> but if that&#x27;s the only issue with this how in the world can you go wrong ?</li>
            <li> I used my usual razor so I could compare from my usual shave gel and the Barbershop Shave Soap.</li>
            <li> Also lather buildup is not very good</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this was a hard shaving soap -</li>
            <li> Recommended to try at least once to see if you like it.</li>
            <li> at least my wife likes the scent....</li>
            <li> It is a subtle but complex combination.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the lubrication is not a good as other cream based shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> Has a subtle scent.</li>
            <li> usually makes me hate shaving due to the fact that I HAVE to do it everyday..</li>
            <li> hard as a rock !</li>
            <li> so you have to work to get a lather, unfortunately losing quite a bit over the sides of the can.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this shave soap.</li>
            <li> You will NOT be disappointed in your using this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. He really like the scent and said it lathered nicely.</li>
            <li> Dissatisfied after reading all the reviews. Smells ok but has a different smell than expected. Also lather buildup is not very good</li>
            <li> It makes your skin dry.</li>
            <li> Overall very happy with the purchase. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> hard as a rock ! totally wasted money ! straight to the trash ! water would NOT soften it at all ! maybe it needs microwaved !!</li>
            <li> Clove scent way too strong.  Need more of the Orange and mango.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but it&#x27;s a lousy shaving cream. It takes a lot of time and effort to get a tiny bit of foam going and even then it lasts just a few seconds. Lesson learned- nothing beats Taylor-of-Old-Bond-Street/</li>
            <li> Nice creamy lather, but a little too strong smell to my taste</li>
            <li> I love bay rum scents, and I love sweet orange scents, so this was a natural to try. The orange is definitely more pronounced than the bay rum, which is fine for someone like me who likes orange a lot. I popped open the can when I first received the soap and &amp;#34;Wow!&amp;#34; I love the scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shaved with it this morning. I used a single-edge razor. I have to say that the lather was great (did I say it smelled amazing?), and had great cushioning and glide. I got a nice close shave. This one is a keeper in my shaving rotation, and I hope that BebeLush comes out with some other scents and products soon.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try something a little different as I&#x27;ve been using the Proraso Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol shaving soap. Although this was roughly twice as much as the Proraso, I don&#x27;t like it as much. I don&#x27;t like the scent as much as I thought I would (totally subjective opinion - YMMV). The soap is much harder than the Proraso so you have to work to get a lather, unfortunately losing quite a bit over the sides of the can. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t seem to lubricate as much either. Then today, It started to sting my skin a bit, and not in the good, bracing way you would wish. Again, this type of experience is very subjective as every person&#x27;s opinions (and skin) is different. I&#x27;ll try to finish this up, but will most likely not be ordering any more.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this soap!  Left me with a close comfortable shave.  Will definately buy again when this tub runs out.</li>
            <li> I tried this with a boar brush and a badger. It whipped up decent lather even with my very hard water. The scent is not overpowering and it held up for three passes.</li>
            <li> After trying several shave soaps I finally found the good stuff. Glides well and reasonably priced plus the best part is its easy to get here on Amazon. I highly suggest this product. Happy shaving!</li>
            <li> Live the smell. Also feels really nice after the shave. Will definitely get this product again. Might also try the other scent too.</li>
            <li> Nice lather and smell good too</li>
            <li> Proudly made in the USA, BebeLush Shave Soap is colored with chlorophyll. This gives the soap a soft mint hue and a beautiful hand poured froth on the top, ensuring each soap is one of a kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the natural ingredients, super moisturizing natural butters for soft, kissable skin and the compact packaging, perfect for the medicine cabinet or your man&#x27;s travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shave soap goes on the skin like butter and moisturizes without that greasy feeling. The soap is scented with pure essential oils for a scent that is fresh and clean scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is awesome soap, great lather, smells good, leaves your face feeling good...will buy more once I have gone through this.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great shaving soap. I&#x27;m more of a mug guy. The tin is not for me so I cut out a few chunks and pressed them into my mug. I was able to get a very rich lather and the shave was excellent. When this is gone, I will try the cedar. Very good for the price and I recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> Nice scent and the best shave soap I&#x27;ve used.  Allows for a smooth, silky shave; lathers well and face feels great afterward.</li>
            <li> I got the shave soap for my husband. He has only used it once and it addicted! It smells wonderful. Want your skin to feel great? Use this shave soap! This is my second product by BeBe Lush, their products are high quality!</li>
            <li> Bebelush is excellent shave soap, it builts a good lather easily and the bay rum scent is wonderful. I&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Used it the last 2 days.. no reactions.. no itchy or dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;A touch of water made it really sudsy  so you know this will last.  I highly recommend it for anyone who shaves in the morning and gets a 5 o clock shadow by night.. usually makes me hate shaving due to the fact that I HAVE to do it everyday.. so this kind of helps make the process easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy buyer!</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this shave soap.  Unfortunately the lubrication is not a good as other cream based shaving cream.  I have even tried this with a shaving oil, putting on the oil first and then whipping up a lather with this and my brush but it still does not last as long or lubricate as well as others.</li>
            <li> About 6 months ago I moved back to &amp;#34;Wet Shaving&amp;#34;, and have been using some high-end shaving soap. I read the ingredant list of BebeLush shaving soap and thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;It has amazing lather, slick and holds up while on your face. Not drying out, or loosing it foaminess after being on your face for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The sent of the  soap is gentle, but distinctive in it&#x27;s presents. I wish I would have tried this earlier in my adventures in &amp;#34;Wet Shaving&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would re-purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using shaving soap for the last 5years and I&#x27;ve tried more than a few brands. Have to say the barbershop shave soap bar in a jar is one of the best. Great scent, good lather, and good price.</li>
            <li> Natural ingredients, moisturizing and clean scent...a wonderful surprise to see it is a Virginia company...very happy with this shave soap!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Great scent. Takes a few times to get the ratio of water right, but after you get it down, it whips up a pretty good lather. Will definately buy again.</li>
            <li> nice fragrance but a little mild, lathers well and provides nice glide</li>
            <li> Smells great, goes on easy, works well. Gives a smooth shave. Runs out a bit more quickly than competing brands due to its soft composition, and does not work with shaving mugs, so those are the downsides. A great shaving soap nonetheless, just know the minor caveats. Recommended to try at least once to see if you like it.</li>
            <li> Lather very nice helps give me a very clean-shave,like it and a good fragrance...I would definitely buy this product again .thank u</li>
            <li> great seller but try out before you buy to ensure these will do what you expect.</li>
            <li> I tried the Bay Rum, Orange and Clove for my super-dry legs. The chemicals and most womens shaving creams leave my legs more dry, so I was hoping this one would be as moisturizing as it claims to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell was great, first off. Also, a little bit goes a long way but I recommend using enough to get a good lather, to lubricate. I had zero nicks or cuts using this, and it did in fact leave my legs smooth (without oiling up my bathtub and making it a slipping hazard). I was surprised that my legs remained soft and moisturized even after toweling off, without putting any lotion on. Yay! I&#x27;m definitely using this from now on.</li>
            <li> This shave soap is fantastic. I have super sensitive skin and have been doing everything possible to make shaving less painful. I started using a double edged safety razor with regular shaving cream. This change wasnt enough the shaving cream was not lubricating my face well enough and was not protecting my skin at all. After a recommendation from a friend I found this shave soap on amazon and promptly ordered this as well as a brush. Having both in hand I can say this shave soap is amazing. It gives a nice lather and it doesn&#x27;t dry out that quickly once applied. A major plus is that is smells fantastic. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good shave soap that smells great !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is the labels are paper and if they get wet like to peel but if that&#x27;s the only issue with this how in the world can you go wrong ?</li>
            <li> Received it in a timely manner, and i immediately tried it the following monday after a three day vacation.  The scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all, and doesn&#x27;t even really smell like bay rum once it lathers.  However, i have always had issues doing a two pass shave with any shave soap or creams.  The only other one i can really do it with is Proraso.  This one is great and i might even try a three pass shave with it.  I use feather blades, and an omega pro brush.</li>
            <li> I have tried about a dozen shave soaps, both hard soaps and soft soaps.  Some are great in giving substantial lather, slickness and smooth shave while others are not worth the money paid for them.  I can honestly say that this is the best shave soap I have tried so far.  Even without a pre-shave oil, this soap gives a better shave than others I have had to use a pre-shave oil with.  It lathered up quite easily and produced a large amount of lather with just a small amount of soap needed.  The third pass was just as smooth and comfortable as the first pass.  There was even enough lather for a 4th pass.  There is a noticeable difference with the way my face feels after the shave.  I have not had any nicks or cuts even when shaving with a well worn blade.  I highly recommend this shave soap to anyone looking for a smooth and comfortable shave.  It is worth every cent paid I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Technically, the BebeLush Shave Soap Bar in a Jar is for men. However, I figured because it is shave soap, why couldn’t it work for women as well? Guess what? It works just as well for women. Truthfully, it has become my favorite shaving soap. I was use to using shaving cream or gel, but now the BebeLush Shave Soap Bar in a Jar has become my favorite thing to use when I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is simple to use. If you have a shaving soap bar brush, wet it and then shake it out before briskly rubbing it over the top of the shaving soap. When you see a lather start to form, continue rubbing for 15-20 seconds to make sure the brush has enough soap on it. Rub the brush with the soap over the area that you want to shave, brushing vigorously and making sure to coat the area with soap. Shave, rinse it off and then as BebeLush puts it, “feel wonderful”! Personally, I do not have a shaving brush, so I used another product that I got to review and that did not work in its original form. However, I think I will be investing in a shaving soap brush in the near future. I am sure it would make the shave soap bar much easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent that I received was Bay Rum. To be honest, I was not sure what it was going to smell like or if I was even going to like it. However, I took a chance with it. I am so glad that I took the chance because the scent is AMAZING! It is a bit manly smelling, however I quite enjoy it and the scent does not bother me one bit. It has a sweet smell, so I think it would easily work with both men and women. The shave soap bar in a jar spreads easily onto the skin. I was able to get a smooth shave with using the shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BebeLush Shave Soap Bar in a Jar is definitely a product that I love. Having a shaving product that leaves my legs feeling smooth, moisturized and smelling good, makes the whole shaving process tolerable. I would recommend the shave soap because it truly does work. So, if you are a man or woman and you use shaving gels or creams, I guarantee you’ll enjoy the BebeLush Shave Soap Bar in a Jar much better than what you currently use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**BebeLush provided me with the Shave Soap Bar in a Jar in Bayrum scent, in exchange for my HONEST opinion.

            <li> This is the best shaving soap you can buy. Wonderful scent, great lather , long lasting puck. Get some!!</li>
            <li> This has been the best shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used. I will be sure and order more when the time comes</li>
            <li> Lathers up easily even in hard water.  Provides a great smooth shave.  Will determinately be buying this again.  Has a subtle scent.</li>
            <li> I waited for a few weeks of using the soap before writing a review. I am impressed that I haven&#x27;t even put a dent in the soap. Yet it produces good lather. Smells great. I can&#x27;t wait to try the cedarwood - but at this rate it might be a long long time before this soap wears out!</li>
            <li> While I tend to prefer shaving creams to soaps, I gave this a try when it was on sale with a coupon.  I have to say it is far better than any other shaving soap I&#x27;ve previously tried, giving a fantastic lather, and it has a pleasant scent that&#x27;s just right--strong enough to smell it, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Provides me a smooth shave with minimal suds. Scent is great, though light and doesn&#x27;t linger. One of the better shave soaps I have tried. Recommend</li>
            <li> Lush layering with the shave soap and the badger brush; feels and smells like wonderful angels on my face. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Light scent, good lather.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great shave soap, smells good and moisturises to</li>
            <li> Dries too fast for me.</li>
            <li> Just switched from gel to a brush and soap.  Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the brush or this soap, but shaving is a much better experience now.</li>
            <li> Not as smooth a shave as Dreadnaught or Wool Fat but for regular daily use it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> If &amp;#34;no stars&amp;#34; were an option I would choose it. I&#x27;ve been shaving my head and most of my beard for about a decade now. I&#x27;ve relied on canned foam and gels. Recently I bought a brush and Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood soap sold on amazon. The results are amazing.well....at least my wife likes the scent....so I bought another set for the shower but always liking to try new things I tried the Bebelush eucalyptus soap here. Okay...first, there is very little foamy soap formed unlike the sandalwood. Second, if you get it near your eyes it burns like hell. Thirdly, it smells like burnt rubber...not exactly the scent I desired. I threw it away.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic shaving soap. The lather is creamy and applies nicely to your face. The smell is of orange and mild clove. I wish they made an aftershave that smelled like the soap. This is one of the best shaving soaps I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> The scent was quite sweet and not overbearing, strong notes of cloves and oranges mixed with the Bay Rum as soon as I opened the tin. It seems the citrus is stronger than the cloves and bay rum, but not overpowering. It is a subtle but complex combination. The scent did not fade after applying to my face and was still noticeable even after rinsing. I did pick up a slight &#x27;soapy&#x27; smell similar to Dove soap after each pass, but it was faint and didn&#x27;t last. The lather building process was rather quick; it took a minute or so with the Omega 2012 brush and there was enough lather for a 3 pass shave. The lather was thick, rich, slick and very cushiony, comparable to TOBS &amp; Barrister &amp; Mann (of what I&#x27;ve used before). My face felt moisturized even after applying alum; did not get that dry, tight feeling. I used a EJ DE86 with Feather blade, 2 passes: WTG &amp; ATG, and followed up with Alum and Mr. Fine&#x27;s American Blend Aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall today&#x27;s shave was excellent. I achieved a BBS shave with almost no touch up. At this reasonable price, I would recommend buying this soap. Well done. This soap is now in my regular rotation.</li>
            <li> Not much smell and a harder soap than I anticipated</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s pricey, but the flip side to this is it takes very little for a nice lather, and leaves your skin soft without the dry pulling feel.</li>
            <li> Works well.  I use it in my travel kit.</li>
            <li> Great shave soap. Got it quickly.</li>
            <li> Had expected product to come in an actual jar which would have lent it better portability since it would have been water tight. Instead, product came in a tin. Product itself is very good, but tin  makes waste of product, especially when new. Will I buy again? yes. Will I repackage into a shaving soup dish or an actual jar for travel? Yes and yes.</li>
            <li> Lathers very nicely, smells like heaven. Will buy again as it keeps my skin smooth enough to use my straight razor with minimal cuts. This soap also comes in a container that is sturdy enough that I don&#x27;t need to use my ceramic bowl.</li>
            <li> I tried the Bay Rum Orange and Clove and loved the scent.  It reminded me of the mulled cider we used to make when I was a kid.  The soap lathered up easily on the puck and in a bowl and made a nice moderate lather that rinsed of the razors easily but didn&#x27;t fall of the blade.  I used a straight razor and a safety razor with equally satisfying results.</li>
            <li> Easy to get a great lather. Wonderful scent--fruit and spice. Label peels when wet, but not docking any stars for that.</li>
            <li> Great lather! The bay rum, orange and clove essential oils make a wonderful, natural scent. Feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is a nice soap for DE shaving.  It generates a good lather and makes the blade glide smoothly.  Smell reminds me of old style barbershops.  Good value for the money too.</li>
            <li> Great soap. Great scent. Lathers pretty well even in the semi-hard well water I have. I would be happy if the scent stuck around longer but it is very good nonetheless. Looking forward to another purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different shaving soaps in the past. This one is an excellent choice. The scent is great and it really produces a good lather. There&#x27;s no drag either. Will be ordering other scents in the future.</li>
            <li> Ive been using the soap and its a nice lather and great barber shop smell on your face.&lt;br /&gt;The soap is excellent quality. This soap will not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I received this product free in exchange for an honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I Love the scent! It smells amazing! I can not say that enough! After I opened the tin I had to find a good way to get the soap out of the tin and on to my legs. I ended up using a disposable cotton facial cloth. I got the cloth wet, rubbed it on the shave soap and put it on my legs. I have to say that I was a little surprised at how easy my razor glided over my legs. Very impressed with it! This shave soap gave me the closest shave on my legs that I have ever had! I used my usual razor so I could compare from my usual shave gel and the Barbershop Shave Soap. My legs were so smooth and soft after using the shave soap even the next day after I shaved with it. That doesn&#x27;t usually happen with my other shave gel.</li>
            <li> Good shave soap. After 24 hours from a pervious shave I grow a medium heavy beard so this soap lathers up nicely. This Soap also smells great.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite shave soaps. Nice scent but not really Bay Rum. Lathers nice and protects very well. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this shave soap.</li>
            <li> This is the first time my husband has used a shaving soap.  I have had no complaints from him when I help him shave, if there was an issue with the soap he would let me know.</li>
            <li> This soap really lathered up fast.  It gave a smooth and clean shave with good lubrication.  I bought it for traveling but it&#x27;s going to be hard to resist using it for everyday shaving.</li>
            <li> Barbershop shave soap is made of  luxurious shea, cocoa and mango butters for extra goodness. This thick, rich and slick lather smells divine. They scent their soap with an amazing combination of essential oils, and colored it with natural cocoa powder. Free of all synthetic fragrances, dyes and preservatives, you never have to worry about what chemicals will do to your delicate skin.&lt;br /&gt;Artisan handmade soap are colored with natural cocoa powder which leaves a little froth on top. Each soap is a little different, as these are hand-poured and hand-finished with the finest natural ingredients. Scented with pure essential oils of cedar wood, cassia and clove for a woodsy and spicy natural fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;what that translate to is a nice lather that leaves your skin feeling soft without chemicals or an over powering scent. I chose to go with the bay rum, orange and clove. Hubby was really impressed with the smell and lather. Plus after only a few uses he was raving about how much better his skin felt. I do believe we have a winner here as hubby couldn&#x27;t find anything to complain about expect that I didn&#x27;t buy more.</li>
            <li> The soap was received as described within specified delivery time. I have been using the soap for more than a week and am very satisfied wit the soap and am planning on re-ordering</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the results from using the Barbershop Shave Soap in a Jar. If you want sexy smooth skin without the irritation from those other products; Barbershop Shave Soap in a Jar is the way to go. You will NOT be disappointed in your using this product. So why wait on having smooth skin go order your Barbershop Shave Soap in a Jar TODAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a sample product to review in exchange for my honest opinion. To read the rest of my review, please visit the blog (Krazy Coupon Club)! Above is just a small portion of my thoughts.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a lousy soap. But then I tried a little differently on making a lather. I used a &#x27;Stirling Soap Co.&#x27; Best badger which is a little stiffer than a silver tip. I didn&#x27;t shake out the excess brush water except for one shake of the brush. Not two or three. Then I loaded the brush for almost a full minute. I got a great lather that helped with a great shave. I think this was a good buy.</li>
            <li> Love this shave soap as it is smooth and creamy and moisturizing for the shave. Creates excellent lather for a close shave, and the hint of mango makes me love this product.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful shave soap. Nice lather, no irritation. Hopefully will make a amber scent. Love the product.SKin is soft.</li>
            <li> First off, I am a big fan of the bay rum scent and even my wife noticed and complimented me on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course the key test is how well does the shave soap hold up -  and on that front this soap outperformed my previous shave soap by holding up on multiple passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great soap for an smooth, silky shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this shave soap in place of normal shaving cream and am loving it so far. I&#x27;m not too crazy about the scent - the best way I could describe it would be &amp;#34;spicy orange peel&amp;#34; and I&#x27;d prefer something a little more manly - but it lathers nice and helps you get a great shave, even with a cartridge razor. I was also pleasantly surprised to see that it&#x27;s made in the US with all-natural ingredients - something increasingly rare in this day and age.</li>
            <li> Not as foamy as I thought...but still gets the job done</li>
            <li> I should have known better. I tried this shave soap because of the near perfect customer reviews, but I am reminded of how personal, personal care products can be.&lt;br /&gt;  My first clue should have been the predominance of propylene Glycol in the ingredient list. I&#x27;m not suggesting it is toxic, just that you won&#x27;t find it in the quality shaving soaps (which of course, are more costly).&lt;br /&gt;  I equate Barbershop Shave Soap to Van Der Hagen or Colonel Conk, (both high in propylene glycol); mediocre in quality, at a \\&quot;popular\\&quot; price.&lt;br /&gt;  If you&#x27;re used to the commercial canned products, and want to experiment playing with a shaving brush, this will be OK for you.&lt;br /&gt;  But if you want to step up your game, you&#x27;ll have to dig deeper and opt for a European brand (Art of Shaving is now made in U.S.A., and is certainly worth consideration as well).</li>
            <li> If you like fine French-style shave soap that you work up a lather and apply with a brush, the BebeLush is for you. It does have a strong scent (Bay Rum, sweet orange, and clove), which I like a lot. Most importantly the lather gives a soft and smooth shave!</li>
            <li> I liked this product. Its not bad. After testing this for about a week in my usual face-off against my top tier champions pitting one side of my face against the other and alternating sides and order of use I would have to place this in my next to the top tier. First, I really dislike the fragrance. I don&#x27;t like cloves and that is the predominant element with a soupcon of orange. I didn&#x27;t detect any bay rum. But that&#x27;s an individual preference and some may like it. More importantly it didn&#x27;t give me the glide and smoothness I get with my co-champions. Also, I didn&#x27;t feel that it cut as close. I would have no problems using this one in a pinch but it is no threat to move up.&lt;br /&gt;I must have tried about 50 different soaps, creams, sticks and oils, from the most expensive English, Italian and German brands to the outright fakes. This still leaves me with the dilemma of choosing amongst my co-champions and they are 3 in number. Despite numerous face-offs against each other and all challengers I have still not been able to narrow it down to one single best product. May your humble servant suggest that these 3 are the best in alphabetical order: Art of Shaving cream in a tube, Kiss My Face (lime) and Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat soap. Everything else is just that everything else.</li>
            <li> Need a guy gift? I love the smell of this shave soap! It&#x27;s very outdoorsy and masculine smelling. It also seems to lather really well for shaving!</li>
            <li> Wonder scent!  Easy to build a thick luxurious lather.</li>
            <li> Excellence product, I am working on my second can. One can lasted about two and half months.</li>
            <li> Works very well and smells great.  The metal container makes it great for travel.</li>
            <li> Smells great!  Not as moisturizing as I thought it would be, but the fragrance makes up for it.</li>
            <li> The shaving soap has a great smell, bay rum, orange and clover. It  has a nice lather and provides a smooth shave. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Product provided for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Old Fashioned Barbershop Shave Soap from BebeLush.  It gives a rich lather with a mild scent. It has shea, cocoa and mango butters which leaves my skin soft and smooth and allows for a moisturizing lather.  It gets its natural color from cocoa powder versus synthetic dyes which I really appreciate. I found it very soothing to shave with and left no irritation at all.</li>
            <li> Gr8 lather. Gr8 shave. Gr8 mild  smell.long lasting soap</li>
            <li> I had been using Taylor of Old bond shave soap almost exclusively since I started using a safety razor a couple of years ago. The fragrances and texture of that brand seems to be a cut above this one. What I do like better about this brand is that it more &amp;#34;solid&amp;#34; and less &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; out of the jar and doesn&#x27;t absorb water as readily. Also its easier to use it more sparingly. Both of these factors help this last a lot longer than other shave soaps I have used. Oh yeah, it smells nice too!</li>
            <li> This soap is great, the lather is very fine and will not dissipate quickly and it leaves my bathroom smelling like citrus! It also doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin which is always a good thing.</li>
            <li> The smoothest and most comfortable shave I have ever had. I shave my head as well as my face up to three times a week. I normally get razor burn on my neck, but have had zero problems since using this shave soap. I have tried many different creams, gels and lotions over the years and not a single one comes close to this. The scent is light and not offensive. It is a little sweet smelling, but it isn&#x27;t long lasting. Highly recommend you give this a try! Seller was prompt, no problems there at all.</li>
            <li> This smells great! The only issue I have is I do break out after using it, compared to the sensitive skin Porasso I normally use. SO...Maybe I need to toughen my skin up a bit.</li>
            <li> This soap has a clean ingredient list and it lathers beautifully with the slickness, density, and cushion wet shavers prize.  The scent is pleasant and interesting without being overwhelming.  The tin is convenient for both home and travel.  Overall a great choice for those who enjoy a traditional wet shave.</li>
            <li> Happy with product and prompt service.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this was a hard shaving soap - I had a cream that I loved.. but this one works well. It isn&#x27;t as thick as I wanted, but actually it does a very good job and provides a smooth, low nick shave. I am not complaining here - I say it&#x27;s a good 4 star, and worth a try. I am using it daily and as noted, it does the job well, smells good - without heavy lingering odors.</li>
            <li> An absolutely splendid product.  I chose BebeLush shaving soap for my re-entry into the world of brush-and-soap shaving, the old fashioned way, and I am very glad I did.  The soap lathers nicely, stays wet and lubricates without drying out during the entire shaving process, gives a truly smooth, clean shave, and smells great.  I will buy this again.</li>
