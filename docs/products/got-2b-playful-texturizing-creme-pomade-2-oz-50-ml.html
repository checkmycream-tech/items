            <li>also if its windy out lol, good luck with</li>

            <li>It provides good shine, nice texture and medium hold.</li>
            <li>This pomade&#x27;s scent is very light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>It also smells really nice (kind of vanilla-y).  </li>
            <li>It has a nice scent and repels oders from clinging to your hair.</li>
            <li>It goes away on its own.</li>
            <li>I like got2b playful because it is lightly scented and a consistently good product for medium hold.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m smilin&#x27; &amp; bouncin&#x27; and happy with my purchase ~ and thanks to Dannielle, it feels like Christmas!</li>
            <li>Nice smell, not too strong.</li>
            <li>I guess if you were to ask my what type of hair I have, its more of a \\&quot;James Dean\\&quot; length/waviness.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years (7-8).</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Later, I couldn&#x27;t stop checking out how totally awesome my hair looked.</li>
            <li>OK, now onto why it gets a star off.</li>
            <li>It may work better for longer hair, idk.</li>
            <li>It blends on the fingers ok</li>
            <li>Nice, light product that gives bounce without weight or sticking; and Danielle-on-2nd sent me 3 ozs for the price of 2 :)</li>
            <li>and i have more volume.</li>
            <li>Light but does the job!  </li>
            <li>but it worked better than I thought it would...</li>
            <li>It gave me that piece-y texturized style that I love and</li>
            <li>and I am good to go for the whole day!</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find it still available online.</li>
            <li>I hope it&#x27;s going to be available for a long time - this is the greatest stuff!</li>
            <li>It is available in specialty stores around town (including BBand B) but costs SO much more there.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Clean and stylish.</li>
            <li>Also, easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>And, most importantly, it makes my hair look fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of baby fine hair</li>
            <li>the texture is really smooth for easy application.</li>
            <li>works fine but for some reason looks like cottage cheese.</li>
            <li>My order was filled with Got2b Magnetik, which is nothing like this product.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
            <li>its not heavy which is good, but the amount you put in is a lot just for it to work.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it is a very good product for its price.</li>
            <li>It holds shorter hair nicely but naturally.  </li>
            <li>Pros: smells good, smells like a cross between marshmellows and vanilla.</li>
            <li>I can put it in for a semi chunky texture look to a full bam bed hair messed up look!&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li>the hold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall not a bad product just not for my hair style (comb over).</li>
            <li>so freaking useful too like..</li>
            <li>playful creates a wonderful chunky look for short hair without the weighted down greasy look.</li>
            <li>its more for a natural side comb look also good to tame fuzzy hair.</li>
            <li>It provides a nice flexible hold that lets hair look natural and feel soft.  </li>
            <li>I was first in make-up, last on camera, and I couldn&#x27;t take it one more minute.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m playing with various cremes/creams, gels, pastes, clay and waxes these days as I&#x27;ve chopped off most of my locks.</li>
            <li>is a non-greasy texture/hold product for which I only wish I had more hair.</li>
            <li>light hold for a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Just works gently with the hair to achieve the style you want!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different pomades, and this one is definitely the best.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more of this product once I run out.</li>
            <li>I can have dry hair and just put it in for more texture and to show layers.</li>
            <li>Really like this for texturizing.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really give me much in the vain of texture either.</li>
            <li>I really adore this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I notice a difference in how it affects my hair as well, it leaves more residue and doesn&#x27;t provide as much lift or volume......very poor decision to change the formula in my opinion, won&#x27;t be using any more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy, it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy, but it adds just the right amount of bounce and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better than the more expensive one I tried from the \\&quot;blow\\&quot; salon line.  </li>
            <li>Or maybe I just need to use more than little daps.</li>
            <li>Not sure who this would be suitable for, but it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li>but it leaves white streaks if u dont put it on right.</li>
            <li>Although it does provide good medium hold and the wet, shiny look, it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Too bad - price is right and it smells great.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and the past 6 months I have bought it both at ulta and through amazon and</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this if you&#x27;re looking for something that provides a really strong, stiff hold.  </li>
            <li>Its like pastey enough to get a certain look</li>
            <li>Compared to the performance of the other akin products I&#x27;ve been using, this just doesn&#x27;t hold up - as I want something that will give me texture, help maintain some kind of shape, and not weigh down my locks.</li>
            <li>and then it will look naturally wavy.    </li>
            <li>I think it was too old.</li>
            <li>I just gently stroke a small amount of it over my hair (when my hair is completely dry) and it adds a lovely bit of shine and definition.  </li>
            <li>This is the ONLY cream pomade of this particular consistency I have ever found.  </li>
            <li>I applied it while my hair was still pretty wet.  </li>
            <li>Unlike some other pomade and hairstyling products which tend to give me a headache due to their strong and offensive smell.</li>
            <li>I have just discovered Schwarzkopf products,,I usually get Salon products, but in a pinch, bought this at the pharmacy, I have very curly hair and the whole line is great,,,hairspray</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine, otherwise lifeless oily hair (though the oily is becoming less &amp; less of an issue the older I get).</li>
            <li>Not heavy or sticky, but holds short styles all day.</li>
            <li>: does not last the whole day, i feel like my hair starts to loose its style within 5hrs.</li>
            <li>am very weary about any hair products like it makes my hair extreme greasy, that there obviously is product in it or even the lovely residue like dandruff stuff it leaves behind.</li>

            <li> High quality, which is typical of this manufacturer, Schwarzkopf.  </li>
            <li> I took off one star because its effects don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> I have long, curly hair, and I use Got 2b Playful on days when my curls are looking fuzzy or ill-defined.  </li>
            <li> Wait until your hair is ALMOST dry.  </li>
            <li> If you apply when your hair is completely dry, it doesn&#x27;t work so well.  </li>
            <li> I can dry my hair and rub some of this in it</li>
            <li> I can have my damp hair and just put some in around my roots and than hair dry</li>
            <li> I have bought this from the grocery store before, but this time it was very dry, almost like cottage cheese.</li>
            <li> but once it&#x27;s in my hair it does little to shape and mold my style - or create a lasting hold.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Too bad they stopped making it, will try to use my remaining stock sparingly :)</li>
            <li> If you put it on while your hair is wet it just droops your hair</li>
            <li> (Indy film shoot...never finished, sadly, but playing a zombie was fun.)</li>
            <li> It smells and feels like marshmallow fluff.</li>
            <li> Scooping it out of the container is tricky because it&#x27;s like spongy fluff.</li>
            <li> the texture has definitely been changed, it is hard and clumpy not soft and creamy like it used to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using it, even though my hair is probably a little too long for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with that stiff feeling you usually get with mousse or hairspray, it just looks natural.  </li>
            <li> The other places carry the other stiffer Got2B products but not this creamy stuff for some reason.      </li>
            <li> all I had to do was tousel it a little bit with my fingers after applying and then let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work with my thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely not sticky or stiff.  </li>
            <li> I usually wait until my hair is almost dry, then rub a dab on my hands, bow my head and run the product through my hair for about 10 seconds or so.  </li>
            <li> It has the consistency of a thick frosting and actually smells a little like frosting.  </li>
            <li> Nope, everything goes away within half of an hour.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty sticky feeling on your fingers like a lot of other styling products, in fact it kind of feels like you applied lotion to your hands after you put this in your hair.  </li>
            <li> It feels a little greasy, that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> and I think this product was just to heavy for me.</li>
            <li> No sticky and stiff hair.  </li>
            <li> I mean you don&#x27;t even have to wash it off.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product, oddly enough, after washing dish soap, baby powder and fake blood out of my hair in a utility sink in a creepy machinist shop.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I have to refrain myself from tasting it.</li>
            <li> Also a little expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been disappointed because no stores local to me carry \\&quot;got2b</li>

            <li> Been using this for years. Not heavy or sticky, but holds short styles all day.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, and this pomade is great for it -- nothing I&#x27;ve tried from John Frieda controls my frizzies as well. Nice smell, not too strong.</li>
            <li> Been using this for about 10 years.  It used to be all over--Walmart, my local grocery store, etc.  But for some reason in my local stores the only place that carries it anymore is KMart so I buy them out every time I&#x27;m running low or else I come to Amazon and buy it.  The other places carry the other stiffer Got2B products but not this creamy stuff for some reason.      Consistency  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  It has the consistency of a thick frosting and actually smells a little like frosting.  It holds shorter hair nicely but naturally.  It adds to my wavy type of hair, it adds shine as well.  It is absolutely not sticky or stiff.  I&#x27;ve had women stroke my hair wondering how I get my hair to behave without it feeling at all sticky.      Perfect for my type of Hair:  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  If you are a guy with medium to short length hair and want to accentuate the wave in your hair this is good stuff.  I guess if you were to ask my what type of hair I have, its more of a \\&quot;James Dean\\&quot; length/waviness.  And this stuff is perfect for that.      Tips on applying:  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  Wait until your hair is ALMOST dry.  If you put it on while your hair is wet it just droops your hair but it will still add shininess to it.  If you apply when your hair is completely dry, it doesn&#x27;t work so well.  You get hair sticking up etc.  I usually wait until my hair is almost dry, then rub a dab on my hands, bow my head and run the product through my hair for about 10 seconds or so.  Then I lift my head up and style my hair with my fingers.  Then let it \\&quot;dry\\&quot; for about 15 minutes and you can run your fingers through your hair to get any \\&quot;stiffness\\&quot; out and then it will look naturally wavy.    This is the ONLY cream pomade of this particular consistency I have ever found.  I don&#x27;t know if there are others but this one is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I have long, curly hair, and I use Got 2b Playful on days when my curls are looking fuzzy or ill-defined.  I just gently stroke a small amount of it over my hair (when my hair is completely dry) and it adds a lovely bit of shine and definition.  It also smells really nice (kind of vanilla-y).  I took off one star because its effects don&#x27;t last very long.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to count on this to keep my hair shiny all day, but it&#x27;s perfect for reviving my hair if I&#x27;m going out for the evening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been disappointed because no stores local to me carry \\&quot;got2b playful\\&quot; anymore. I was so glad to find it still available online. I hope it&#x27;s going to be available for a long time - this is the greatest stuff! It&#x27;s not heavy, it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy, but it adds just the right amount of bounce and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short story: I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years (7-8). I love it. I&#x27;m still using it, even though my hair is probably a little too long for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story: I discovered this product, oddly enough, after washing dish soap, baby powder and fake blood out of my hair in a utility sink in a creepy machinist shop. (Indy film shoot...never finished, sadly, but playing a zombie was fun.) I was first in make-up, last on camera, and I couldn&#x27;t take it one more minute. Anyway, after I used my shirt as a towel, I despaired - I&#x27;d brought nothing to deal with my hair. I didn&#x27;t even have a comb. There was a jar of this pomade on the edge of the sink and I swiped a dab and finger-combed it through my hair. Later, I couldn&#x27;t stop checking out how totally awesome my hair looked. I still can&#x27;t believe I remembered the name. I searched local drugstores until I found it and the rest is history.</li>
            <li> High quality, which is typical of this manufacturer, Schwarzkopf.  Vendor delivered promptly.  Product type as ordered.  Price is competitive to that at retail stores locally.</li>
            <li> playful creates a wonderful chunky look for short hair without the weighted down greasy look. It has a nice scent and repels oders from clinging to your hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product. I have a lot of baby fine hair and I think this product was just to heavy for me.</li>
            <li> I have just discovered Schwarzkopf products,,I usually get Salon products, but in a pinch, bought this at the pharmacy, I have very curly hair and the whole line is great,,,hairspray and gel shine, this pomade is lightweight, smells good, and inexpensive. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It provides good shine, nice texture and medium hold. Unlike some other pomade and hairstyling products which tend to give me a headache due to their strong and offensive smell. This pomade&#x27;s scent is very light and pleasant. It smells like cream. Seriously, I have to refrain myself from tasting it. I like the container&#x27;s design, too. It has this minimalistic feel too it. Clean and stylish. OK, now onto why it gets a star off. Although it does provide good medium hold and the wet, shiny look, it doesn&#x27;t last long. After about 2 hour or so, it just dissipates.  Or maybe I just need to use more than little daps. But it could be an upside, I mean you don&#x27;t even have to wash it off. It goes away on its own. Other than that, it is a very good product for its price.</li>
            <li> Really like this for texturizing.  Lets you play with the styling. Moisturizing to the hair too.  I use this a lot</li>
            <li> It seems great at the beginning when you put it between your hands and run it through your hair. Tons of texture and stickiness. You think your pixie is going to look great and it&#x27;s going to stay how it is. Nope, everything goes away within half of an hour. Just feel your hair, I don&#x27;t know where everything went. It feels a little greasy, that&#x27;s about it. It may work better for longer hair, idk. It doesn&#x27;t work well if you want some sort of hold.</li>
            <li> Awesome sauce!  I can dry my hair and rub some of this in it and I am good to go for the whole day!</li>
            <li> I purchased this locally after reading several glowing reviews. I&#x27;m playing with various cremes/creams, gels, pastes, clay and waxes these days as I&#x27;ve chopped off most of my locks. I have thin, fine, otherwise lifeless oily hair (though the oily is becoming less &amp; less of an issue the older I get). Compared to the performance of the other akin products I&#x27;ve been using, this just doesn&#x27;t hold up - as I want something that will give me texture, help maintain some kind of shape, and not weigh down my locks. It smells and feels like marshmallow fluff. Scooping it out of the container is tricky because it&#x27;s like spongy fluff. It blends on the fingers ok but once it&#x27;s in my hair it does little to shape and mold my style - or create a lasting hold. It doesn&#x27;t really give me much in the vain of texture either. Not sure who this would be suitable for, but it&#x27;s just not for me. Too bad - price is right and it smells great.</li>
            <li> Nice, light product that gives bounce without weight or sticking; and Danielle-on-2nd sent me 3 ozs for the price of 2 :) I&#x27;m smilin&#x27; &amp; bouncin&#x27; and happy with my purchase ~ and thanks to Dannielle, it feels like Christmas!</li>
            <li> I like got2b playful because it is lightly scented and a consistently good product for medium hold.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work with my thick coarse hair. Not helpful for styling but does provide some moisturizing conditioning. Also, easy to wash out.</li>
            <li> It is available in specialty stores around town (including BBand B) but costs SO much more there.&lt;br /&gt;This is a non-greasy texture/hold product for which I only wish I had more hair.</li>
            <li> Pros: smells good, smells like a cross between marshmellows and vanilla. the texture is really smooth for easy application. light hold for a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: does not last the whole day, i feel like my hair starts to loose its style within 5hrs. also if its windy out lol, good luck with the hold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall not a bad product just not for my hair style (comb over). its more for a natural side comb look also good to tame fuzzy hair. plus you can get this at walmart for about $4.xx ........</li>
            <li> works fine but for some reason looks like cottage cheese.</li>
            <li> As the title says, beware buying this from closeouts&amp;discontinueds.  My order was filled with Got2b Magnetik, which is nothing like this product.  Too bad they stopped making it, will try to use my remaining stock sparingly :)</li>
            <li> I really adore this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am very weary about any hair products like it makes my hair extreme greasy, that there obviously is product in it or even the lovely residue like dandruff stuff it leaves behind. i havent had a issue with this product of that sort AT ALL!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Its so freaking useful too like..I can have my damp hair and just put some in around my roots and than hair dry and i have more volume. I can have dry hair and just put it in for more texture and to show layers. I can put it in for a semi chunky texture look to a full bam bed hair messed up look!&lt;br /&gt;its white and it feels like putting your hand in whip cream and it smells so good!!! Its like pastey enough to get a certain look but it also is flexible that you can just make it do all kinds of things. the name of it describes it perfect, it&#x27;s Playful!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and the past 6 months I have bought it both at ulta and through amazon and the texture has definitely been changed, it is hard and clumpy not soft and creamy like it used to be. I notice a difference in how it affects my hair as well, it leaves more residue and doesn&#x27;t provide as much lift or volume......very poor decision to change the formula in my opinion, won&#x27;t be using any more.</li>
            <li> Light but does the job!  No sticky and stiff hair.  Just works gently with the hair to achieve the style you want!</li>
            <li> It does the job for the price but it leaves white streaks if u dont put it on right. its not heavy which is good, but the amount you put in is a lot just for it to work.</li>
            <li> I was shocked but it worked better than I thought it would...no gummy like build up like you get w/ the different gel products.</li>
            <li> I have bought this from the grocery store before, but this time it was very dry, almost like cottage cheese. I think it was too old. Also a little expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different pomades, and this one is definitely the best.  It&#x27;s even better than the more expensive one I tried from the \\&quot;blow\\&quot; salon line.  It smells wonderful and it&#x27;s cheap.  You get a good amount of product, and the container is practical.  And, most importantly, it makes my hair look fabulous.  I applied it while my hair was still pretty wet.  You only need to use a little bit.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty sticky feeling on your fingers like a lot of other styling products, in fact it kind of feels like you applied lotion to your hands after you put this in your hair.  It gave me that piece-y texturized style that I love and all I had to do was tousel it a little bit with my fingers after applying and then let it air dry.  Also, my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like it has any product in it, which is miraculous.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with that stiff feeling you usually get with mousse or hairspray, it just looks natural.  Don&#x27;t buy this if you&#x27;re looking for something that provides a really strong, stiff hold.  It provides a nice flexible hold that lets hair look natural and feel soft.  I will definitely buy more of this product once I run out.</li>
