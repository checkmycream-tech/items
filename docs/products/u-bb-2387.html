            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>LOVE it as a shampoo though.</li>
            <li>I love the Philosophy product line.</li>
            <li>but the cookie smell is overwhelming in the shower.</li>
            <li>I love this body wash.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t lather really well, but smells great.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really get where the animal cracker part comes from lol</li>
            <li>and she flipped :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorite bubble baths and smells just like what you would expect from the description.</li>
            <li>I have to say, this is one thing that I LOVE about their products.  </li>
            <li>Many people</li>
            <li>love how novel yet comforting</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It does lather up nice and leaves my skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I got this as a Christmas gift, and loved it the first time I tried it.  </li>
            <li>This pink animal cracker smells awesome!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light, sweet, girly scent.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel really smooth too.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>Smells exactly like a frosted sweet sugary cookie!!</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t use it for a bubble bath (which is what I originally bought it for).</li>
            <li>but there should be some body friendly additive to increase the time the scent last--it would be a plus</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, healthy and lustrous!</li>
            <li>B002EDIJX6 Mother&#x27;s Circus Animal Cookies, 14-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)]] with the sweet frosting, the almost lemony scent of the cookie, and the vanilla that rounds it</li>
            <li>smells way too super sweet.</li>
            <li>Bubbles up just right and rinses off cleanly.</li>
            <li>Overall I love it tho!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, and I would recommend it, but not to be used as a shampoo as it left my hair greasy and feeling unclean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really creamy and smooth when you lather it up.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product so much that I have changed my monthly subscription delivery of Philosophy Coconut Frosting to this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I love shaving with it because it leaves my skin so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I own 5 different scents at any given time.</li>
            <li>Lots of fun at bath time...</li>
            <li>and I am certain it would significantly increase business.  </li>
            <li>Just a little makes a rich, creamy lather and the scent is amazing.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t be around fragrance and, unlike with cheaper body washes and even some shampoos, this is fine to use before going to work in a sensitive environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased products that sound really yummy only to be overwhelmed with a strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>&amp; wow it handles fantastic...</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like animal crackers.</li>
            <li>I personally like it more as a body bath than a shampoo, however.  </li>
            <li>this body wash smells exactly like the name of it.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this purchase, I have numerous other scents I want to try</li>
            <li>I expected a very light, sugary smell, but instead it&#x27;s very acrid strawberry.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does smell very good.</li>
            <li>Very bubbly.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product unless you would enjoy bathing in such a cloy body wash.</li>
            <li>I really did not like the scent on this one.</li>
            <li>It suds up so much</li>
            <li>It reminds me a lot of pink frosted layer cake, which I also love.</li>
            <li>and it lathers very well and does not cause skin irritations.</li>
            <li>Philosophy shampoo/shower gel &amp; bubble bath can be a real hit or miss in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I may have been really excited when I finally got to use it</li>
            <li>I always use Philosophy body wash because, unlike many other brands, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>It smells yummy--but nothing extra special.</li>
            <li>I wish there was a full line of items and also smaller bottles that could be given a gifts.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was decent.</li>
            <li>It smells just like you think it would and leaves your skin feeling very soft!</li>
            <li>What a nice way to brighten a dull day.  </li>
            <li>It might be a good idea for them to seal these shower gels in a plastic bag in the future, especially if the customer is purchasing other items.</li>
            <li>Product arrived brand new and on time.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to use as a shampoo, but it is clearly a body wash or bubble bath.</li>
            <li>It is by far my least favorite of the Philosophy line.</li>
            <li>Wow the scent is yummy..</li>
            <li>It left it feeling very silky.</li>
            <li>It smells completely edible and just like the cookies.</li>
            <li>it makes your skin soft &amp; silky.</li>
            <li>but I was really surprised to find a product that smelled like what it was touted to smell like.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>The most frequent complaint I hear is that \\&quot;the scent doesn&#x27;t last\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey, but worth it.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I originally bought french vanilla bean by philosophy and really disliked it, and upon returning it I saw this scent and decided to open the little seal to smell it before buying.</li>
            <li> Smell does not last after shower, but is very heavy when first out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> and I like the long lasting smells).</li>
            <li> Luckily the smell isn&#x27;t long lasting (also unfortunate.. because it makes me think the rest of their products are that way</li>
            <li> It cleans and lathers well without leaving your skin dry like a lot of body washes do.</li>
            <li> but since this is limited edition I will try to get a couple before it is retired!</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected, delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that is doesn&#x27;t really smell like pink frosted animal crackers, at least to me.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t smell like what I expected.</li>
            <li> I can smell the basics of an animal cracker...flour sugar and the sweetness of pink frosting.</li>
            <li> The Pink Frosted Animal Cracker 3-in-1 smells just like what you would imagine the cookies to smell like the vanilla is there, the sugar soaked marshallow like pink frosting is there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;One of the other reviewers said that the one thing she doesn&#x27;t like about Philosophy is that the scent doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to trying out their other scents.</li>
            <li> I must say the only complaint that I have with Philosophy is that the scent does not last past the shower or bath.</li>
            <li> the little pink frosted animal crackers.</li>
            <li> I agree with the previous reviewer&#x27;s comments about the scent.</li>
            <li> The replacement came (in 2 days) tightly sealed and in a plastic bag this time.</li>
            <li> I have heavily frosted hair, so I need to use &amp;#34;color friendly&amp;#34; products.  </li>
            <li> Thick shower gel, smells heavy and buttery-lemony.</li>

            <li> Wow the scent is yummy..I&#x27;m impressed..never tried philosophy before...sure will again now...</li>
            <li> The product and scent are wonderful but it doesn&#x27;t smell much like animal crackers to me.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected, delivered on time. Thick shower gel, smells heavy and buttery-lemony. Smell does not last after shower, but is very heavy when first out of the bottle. I used it as a shampoo and it was okay, but I love shaving with it because it leaves my skin so soft and moisturized. First tried hazelnut biscotti(also excellent). Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter who loves circus cookies.  She loves it, just wishes the smell lasted a bit longer.</li>
            <li> Very bubbly. Lathers well. Scent doesn&#x27;t stay on you.</li>
            <li> I received a fake product. This is NOT quality and is a knock off.</li>
            <li> Love the smell &amp; as always you cannot beat These products from this company!&lt;br /&gt;Yes wash you hair-years ago I saw in Europe soap offered when I traveled for bath &amp; shampoo &amp; thought they were crazy.&lt;br /&gt;Well -I accidentally did my hair one day &amp; wow it handles fantastic...even my hairdresser-I gave her some for Christmas &amp; all her family use this &amp; love it too!&lt;br /&gt;May you try &amp; enjoy as we have!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this. It smells exactly like animal crackers. I love that I can use it as shampoo and on your body. Makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I got this on Christmas and I&#x27;ve been using it since then. The formula is great. It cleans and lathers well without leaving your skin dry like a lot of body washes do. I was wary about using this as a shampoo (even tho it says you can), but it actually works just as well on my hair. It left it feeling very silky. Only complaint is that is doesn&#x27;t really smell like pink frosted animal crackers, at least to me. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does smell very good. It&#x27;s a very light, sweet, girly scent. It just doesn&#x27;t smell like what I expected. Overall I love it tho!</li>
            <li> Smells like chemicals and creates no bubbles in bath.</li>
            <li> L O V E  Philosophy! Smells great!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> smells lovely and lasts, great for bubble baths!</li>
            <li> All my life looking for a shampoo like this. Cleans deeply without damaging your scalp or hair. My hair is soft, healthy and lustrous!</li>
            <li> The packaging was decent. I may have been really excited when I finally got to use it but the scent is too nauseating! It reminded me of the scent of lemon girl scout cookies (Which I don&#x27;t like). I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product unless you would enjoy bathing in such a cloy body wash.</li>
            <li> I love Philosophy body wash. I own 5 different scents at any given time. This scent, however, smells nothing like animal cracker. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smells so good.. Love all Philosophy products!:)</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use as a shampoo, but it is clearly a body wash or bubble bath. It smells amazing, and I would recommend it, but not to be used as a shampoo as it left my hair greasy and feeling unclean.</li>
            <li> great price and shared with girlfriends who all loved it and the scent of it.</li>
            <li> I really did not like the scent on this one. I expected a very light, sugary smell, but instead it&#x27;s very acrid strawberry. I give it two stars since it&#x27;s still Philosophy shower gel, but I will never buy this product again. It is by far my least favorite of the Philosophy line.</li>
            <li> Love any philosophy products. Good price offered by this company.</li>
            <li> I love this. The smell is absolutely amazing. It&#x27;s really creamy and smooth when you lather it up. The scent doesn&#x27;t last on your skin or hair, which I was disappointed about. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but worth it. I&#x27;ll definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use it for a bubble bath (which is what I originally bought it for). LOVE it as a shampoo though. I was shocked how it made my hair feel. Will buy again when I run out!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It smells completely edible and just like the cookies. I love the Philosophy product line.</li>
            <li> This is like dessert in the shower! It suds up so much its like the marshmallow man from the ghostbusters blew up in the shower! Brings back the childhood memories of the frosted animal crackers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how Philosophy captures the scent, but this gel smells just like animal crackers. I can actually smell the butter and vanilla. It reminds me a lot of pink frosted layer cake, which I also love. I have used it as both a shower gel and bubble bath and it lathers very well and does not cause skin irritations. I have not used it on my hair, so I cannot vouch for how it works as a shampoo. I would imagine that it would be too drying for my hair. I want to mention one thing: the cap/neck of the bottle was broken and spilled shower gel all over the box. I called Amazon and they were wonderful about a replacement. The replacement came (in 2 days) tightly sealed and in a plastic bag this time. It might be a good idea for them to seal these shower gels in a plastic bag in the future, especially if the customer is purchasing other items. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift, and loved it the first time I tried it.  I actually asked my aunt where she bought it and went and bought another bottle for myself the next week!  The scent is just like the animal crackers and lingers for quite awhile after you bathe.  I personally like it more as a body bath than a shampoo, however.  It does lather up nice and leaves my skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with this stuff.. but the cookie smell is overwhelming in the shower. So thinking I might just put this in my hand soap dispenser until it runs out. Luckily the smell isn&#x27;t long lasting (also unfortunate.. because it makes me think the rest of their products are that way and I like the long lasting smells).</li>
            <li> It was only because I was out of shampoo that I had defaulted to using my Philosophy Animal Cracker shower/shampoo.  I loved it as my shower gel, but I really love it as my shampoo.  I have heavily frosted hair, so I need to use &amp;#34;color friendly&amp;#34; products.  Ironically this works beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it, whether you were to use it as a shower gel or shampoo - you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash.  Just a little makes a rich, creamy lather and the scent is amazing.  It makes my skin feel really smooth too.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t lather really well, but smells great.</li>
            <li> This animal cracker multi wash is so delightful.  Smells just like frosted animal crackers.  What a nice way to brighten a dull day.  Leaves your skin feeling silky smooth.  I love Philosophy products!</li>
            <li> It smells yummy--but nothing extra special. Just a run-of-the-mill frosting scent. Don&#x27;t really get where the animal cracker part comes from lol</li>
            <li> This pink animal cracker smells awesome!! Absolutely love it! It smells just like you think it would and leaves your skin feeling very soft! Also makes a great gift! Got this for my niece and she flipped :)</li>
            <li> This smells so good! It&#x27;s one of my favorite bubble baths and smells just like what you would expect from the description.</li>
            <li> this body wash smells exactly like the name of it. the little pink frosted animal crackers. i will definitely be buying this again. it makes your skin soft &amp; silky.</li>
            <li> I originally bought french vanilla bean by philosophy and really disliked it, and upon returning it I saw this scent and decided to open the little seal to smell it before buying. OMG! So good, it&#x27;s like sweet shortbread cookies with a butter cream frosting and a touch of lemony notes. If you like cupcake/cake/sugary scented products go for this one. Can&#x27;t wait for my bath time tonight!</li>
            <li> Outrageous.  We love the scent - use it as a body wash and a shampoo!  Great product!</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like a frosted sweet sugary cookie!! Lots of fun at bath time...I just wish the aroma lasted longer!!!</li>
            <li> I always use Philosophy body wash because, unlike many other brands, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  This one smells just like those [[ASIN:B002EDIJX6 Mother&#x27;s Circus Animal Cookies, 14-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)]] with the sweet frosting, the almost lemony scent of the cookie, and the vanilla that rounds it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the other reviewers said that the one thing she doesn&#x27;t like about Philosophy is that the scent doesn&#x27;t linger.  I have to say, this is one thing that I LOVE about their products.  You get an incredible sensory experience when you use the product but, when you get out of the shower, you&#x27;re good to go because you have confidence that the product isn&#x27;t leaving a chemical residue on your skin.  Many people I work with can&#x27;t be around fragrance and, unlike with cheaper body washes and even some shampoos, this is fine to use before going to work in a sensitive environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how novel yet comforting so many of their scents are!</li>
            <li> Not much is better than smelling like the yummiest cookie ever!  I&#x27;m looking forward to trying out their other scents.</li>
            <li> This scent is amazing.  I wish there was a full line of items and also smaller bottles that could be given a gifts.  Definitely a favorite!!!</li>
            <li> Philosophy shampoo/shower gel &amp; bubble bath can be a real hit or miss in my opinion. I&#x27;ve purchased products that sound really yummy only to be overwhelmed with a strong chemical smell. This wasn&#x27;t the case in this product. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but I was really surprised to find a product that smelled like what it was touted to smell like.&lt;br /&gt;When I close my eyes I can smell the basics of an animal cracker...flour sugar and the sweetness of pink frosting. I enjoy this product so much that I have changed my monthly subscription delivery of Philosophy Coconut Frosting to this product!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased many Philosophy products over the years and this is so my best discovery.</li>
            <li> smells way too super sweet.</li>
            <li> A great purchase. Smells wonderful. I love it. Best one yet. I would buy this again. A gift would be great with this item.</li>
            <li> Product arrived brand new and on time.</li>
            <li> I agree with the previous reviewer&#x27;s comments about the scent. The Pink Frosted Animal Cracker 3-in-1 smells just like what you would imagine the cookies to smell like the vanilla is there, the sugar soaked marshallow like pink frosting is there. In the mix is a definite lemon scent. I use these products as strictly body washes so they leave my skin fairly moist. I must say the only complaint that I have with Philosophy is that the scent does not last past the shower or bath. I wear a wardrobe of perfumes so I get a fragrance beside what I wash with but there should be some body friendly additive to increase the time the scent last--it would be a plus and I am certain it would significantly increase business.  I imagine this would increase the price but if consumers knew that the scent last longer, I do not think they would mind a price increase. The most frequent complaint I hear is that \\&quot;the scent doesn&#x27;t last\\&quot;. I am happy with this purchase, I have numerous other scents I want to try but since this is limited edition I will try to get a couple before it is retired!</li>
            <li> Pretty color, delicious scent. Bubbles up just right and rinses off cleanly. I  almost always love Philosophy shower soaps and miss them when I run out!</li>
