            <li> I like the shape and what it does blending-wise, but then I have to go in and pick up the bristles it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> I like it for what it is, a REALLY fluffy blending brush, but it sheds on me like crazy!</li>
            <li> It makes blending a breeze,  witch can sometimes be a tedious job depending on the look your going for.</li>
            <li> I have yet to be disappointed with any of my Bdellium brushes.</li>

            <li> I was earlier skeptical of buying this one because i use very high quality brushes but this one proved to be very good. On my recommendation,my sis also bought it.</li>
            <li> I love these brush and the prize &amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> Very well made blending brush. Excellent quality and very affordable. Comparable to Mac 224 and sigma e40 but cheaper. I recommend bdellium to a friend and continue to purchase them</li>
            <li> I like it! It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to! Nothing special! It&#x27;s worth the money! Don&#x27;t buy a cheap E.L.F brush! This one is well made and will last for a long time!</li>

            <li> In my opinion you can never have enough blending brushes and the Bdellium tapered blending brush is one of my favorites.  It has nice soft bristles and doesn&#x27;t shed. This specific brush is use as my clean blending brush to blend all the hard lines out of my eyeshadow looks. It makes blending a breeze,  witch can sometimes be a tedious job depending on the look your going for. I have yet to be disappointed with any of my Bdellium brushes.</li>
            <li> I like it for what it is, a REALLY fluffy blending brush, but it sheds on me like crazy! I&#x27;ve washed it now at least 10 times (about every 3 weeks) since I first bought it back in January and it still sheds! I like the shape and what it does blending-wise, but then I have to go in and pick up the bristles it leaves behind. I bought it as a sigma e40 dupe/more affordable option, I should have spent the extra money and gotten the sigma one.</li>
            <li> love this brush. its fluffy and blends beautifully.</li>
            <li> Thicker then I expected, but I really like it. I have a ton of crease brushes but this ones different. I blends well and isn&#x27;t scratchy. It did not shed either.  I have other Bdellium brushes and this one did not disappoint. I have no complaints. Although if you don&#x27;t have as much space on your eye as I do, you might want a smaller blending brush for focused blending.</li>
            <li> Like this blending brush a lot.  Soft bristles and makes my makeup application well blended.  Easy to clean (I mainly use water and soap).  Recommend this anytime!</li>
            <li> This is actually a very good brush and I&#x27;m always harsh on my reviews. lol.  I&#x27;ve had this for a year and a half and havent bought another blending brush.</li>
            <li> Better than I ever expected.!! Blends like magic, I had to purchase more than one because of the quality. Go to brush for creative and flawless looks</li>
            <li> scratchy and shadding a lot. The shape is uneven, So can&#x27;t brend smoothly. not good at all.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it is so soft on the lid and does a great blending job. Will order a few more of these.</li>
            <li> I like this brush. It does a good job, but it does feel scratchy on my eyes so I am giving it four stars instead of five</li>
