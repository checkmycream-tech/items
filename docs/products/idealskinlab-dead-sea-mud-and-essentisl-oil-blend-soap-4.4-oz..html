            <li>Great product works very well</li>
            <li>Over the years I have bought and tried MANY brands and types of soap.</li>
            <li>I would have missed trying the most favorite soap I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li>If you bathe with the soap you&#x27;ll also notice it pulls dirt out of your skin and cleans you better compared to brand soaps.</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>I LOVE the way this makes my skin feel after washing my face.  </li>
            <li>Yes I am enjoying my purchase</li>
            <li>I eat healthy</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>and Im excited for what my skin will look like after a couple of weeks!</li>
            <li>feels soft and looks great.</li>
            <li>It does wash skin very well so good to use a moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li>But overall a good product!</li>
            <li>The soap is just fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is my second order, I also ordered another Mud soap from another vendor but liked the Best Dead Sea Soap better.  </li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t feel clean after using it.</li>
            <li>it foams quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Good soap if you have dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I rarely give reviews, however, if I hadn&#x27;t noticed this soap being on sale</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and is exactly what I want.</li>
            <li>It barely has a scent which I love.  </li>
            <li>First time to try it and like it very much</li>
            <li>It was my first time trying it.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It is far superior to other mud soaps I&#x27;ve tested.</li>
            <li>It was refreshing and did not leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li>very satisfied so far....only been a few days but if your thinking about this one give it a try!   </li>
            <li>Has helped my skin so much</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I like how it cleanses the skin, yet it feels gentle.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t break out much anymore.</li>
            <li>but the other smells better.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, so finding something that I can actually use is a very rare occurrence.</li>
            <li>High sensitivity to fragrance in soap</li>
            <li>I have been looking for something natural, without harsh chemicals, and I think this soap is a great alternative to regular store products full of parabens and other synthetic stuff..</li>
            <li>I use it in combination with Dead Sea mud mask and together they work even better...</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and prone to redness, this helps.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised with this mud soap!</li>
            <li>Dead sea mud or clay can dry out the skin do to its salt content, but after washing i just moisturize with pure organic coconut oil and by the morning my skin looks even better than it already did.  </li>
            <li>it has purified and settle things down instantly and all with being very gentle and mild.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t dry at all anymore and right after using it you can feel how soft your skin is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it to clear my acne and even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and has improved it&#x27;s texture.</li>
            <li>It really gets in and cleans deep into your pores and tightens them.  </li>
            <li>Makes the effected area like new,and soft.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels and look so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been surprised at the immediate results I&#x27;ve gotten so far</li>
            <li>I have older, wrinkled, slightly sagging skin and was planning on using this as a body soap to sort of strip my skin clean prior to applying moisture but grabbed it in a hurry one morning to wash my face.  </li>
            <li>This soap brought my complexion back to normal.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and subtle after my shower, my teenage children even love this soap.</li>
            <li>I believe it has had a lasting effect on their young skin, it has helped them with their acne problems.</li>
            <li>It left my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>It is natural no harsh chemicals, it does not  irritate my skin,will last long.</li>
            <li>It also cleans terrifically, even the heaviest foundation, but it does not dry the skin.</li>
            <li>My facial complexion is normal to dry.</li>
            <li>Order arrived before expected, makes skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li>I have only used it a short time, but my skin seems less red and much softer.</li>

            <li> I have only used it a short time, but my skin seems less red and much softer.</li>
            <li> On my second day works really good on my sensitive skin but first day of using I got some in my eye and thought I was going to go blind burned so bad.</li>
            <li> Since using this, which hasn&#x27;t been for long, my breakouts are gone...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my eczema, dry, acne prone skin since using this.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this soap a 4 star instead of a 5 is because after washing my face with it my skin felt tight and dry.</li>
            <li> I expected it to leave my skin feeling dry and flaky</li>
            <li> Feels different than anything I&#x27;ve used previously.</li>
            <li> I tried this brand of dead sea soap after trying one from Vienna that a friend brought back for me.</li>
            <li> I usually require antibiotics to control my acne but this soap has made a big difference.  </li>
            <li> It has cleared out the dark spots on my chest</li>
            <li> My skin was a mess.</li>
            <li> and it is not as expensive and will last long.</li>
            <li> but I am beginning to see my face firm up ever so slightly.  </li>
            <li> I use this Dead Sea Mud Soap on my face as well as my body.  </li>
            <li> I actually thought it was making my skin worse</li>
            <li> I have tried dead sea mud soaps in the past.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a sucker for Dead Sea products.  </li>
            <li> The condition of your skin depends on if your stressed and your diet usually.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always afraid i would run out of it before my next order arrives.</li>
            <li> My skin was broken out and looked dull.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to locate in my area, when I found this soap on Amazon</li>
            <li> I use this soap everyday!!!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I have continued to use this soap for my face every morning and evening and will need to purchase another for my body.</li>
            <li> I hate I payed $10 for something that didn&#x27;t help me.</li>
            <li> This product has a nasty smell when using it.</li>

            <li> Good soap if you have dry skin.  It works for me...no obnoxious smell either.</li>
            <li> Soap was very good... Liked the results..</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this soap a 4 star instead of a 5 is because after washing my face with it my skin felt tight and dry. My facial complexion is normal to dry. I&#x27;m using it to clear my acne and even out my skin tone. It does wash skin very well so good to use a moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> I just started using the soap and I like that it foams quickly.  I expected it to leave my skin feeling dry and flaky but instead it feels refreshing.  I like it already and may buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay i have been using this soap now for more than 6 months and i had to come and up the ante on my review because i couldn&#x27;t help it. Aside the fact that it leaves my skin feeling refreshed, i haven&#x27;t had a breakout since i started using it. even during my period when i have big pimples on my face, nothing. It has cleared out the dark spots on my chest and i have been wearing sleeveless dresses a lot more than before. The soap is just fantastic. I wish i could get a carton of it. I&#x27;m always afraid i would run out of it before my next order arrives.</li>
            <li> Excellent product&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I have tried dead sea mud soaps in the past.  It is very hard to locate in my area, when I found this soap on Amazon I immediately had to try it.  It was just as good or better then the soaps I use to use, and the price was much more affordable.  I use this Dead Sea Mud Soap on my face as well as my body.  My skin feels soft and subtle after my shower, my teenage children even love this soap. I believe it has had a lasting effect on their young skin, it has helped them with their acne problems. Amazing Stuff!</li>
            <li> This product has a nasty smell when using it.</li>
            <li> I use this for my acne &amp; love it</li>
            <li> Mud bath in a bar....that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m saying. I use this soap everyday!!!</li>
            <li> I received no benefits from this soap. I&#x27;m not going to bash the soap. I hate I payed $10 for something that didn&#x27;t help me.</li>
            <li> Great results yet, gentle to my face! Happy I tried this one...very satisfied so far....only been a few days but if your thinking about this one give it a try!   ******** Update have been using it faithfully and results are very good...it has purified and settle things down instantly and all with being very gentle and mild.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Will always buy this brand.  It is far superior to other mud soaps I&#x27;ve tested.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my eczema, dry, acne prone skin since using this. I don&#x27;t even use it anymore. It actually made my face break out. Also, I don&#x27;t feel clean after using it.</li>
            <li> Love it a lot.  Feels so good on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product. High sensitivity to fragrance in soap and this is perfect</li>
            <li> Great product, great price delivered right on time and was well packaged.  The only problem is that my husband can&#x27;t stop using the product! He loves it.</li>
            <li> Great product ! Has helped my skin so much</li>
            <li> My skin has improved in texture, appearance, oiliness, and health. My acne, even the monthly hormonal acne, has drastically improved.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li> I am loving to use this on my face, It fills great .</li>
            <li> First time to try it and like it very much</li>
            <li> Love this soap! I have extremely sensitive skin, so finding something that I can actually use is a very rare occurrence. Since using this, which hasn&#x27;t been for long, my breakouts are gone...my combination skin has calmed....the redness has faded...my face actually looks brighter! Hope you continue to make this!</li>
            <li> Excellent soap. Feels different than anything I&#x27;ve used previously. My skin is very sensitive and prone to redness, this helps. Would buy again</li>
            <li> Everything arrive well.</li>
            <li> I have a skin disease called Hidradenitis suppurativa (hi-drad-uh-NIE-tis sup-yoo-ruh-TIE-vuh). I usually require antibiotics to control my acne but this soap has made a big difference.  It took about a week to see a difference.  I actually thought it was making my skin worse but now my face is clearing up and looking refreshed.  I love this product.  I wish I would have tried it years ago.</li>
            <li> Great product works very well cleans out any impurities on my body and it leaves my skin feeling great</li>
            <li> Over the years I have bought and tried MANY brands and types of soap. Some I&#x27;ve liked and others I would never buy again. I rarely give reviews, however, if I hadn&#x27;t noticed this soap being on sale I would have missed trying the most favorite soap I have ever used. I love how it makes my skin look and feel. It gets five stars from me and I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> Great product, leaves skiing felling smooth!</li>
            <li> A bit pricey for the quality</li>
            <li> Order arrived before expected, makes skin feel very soft. So far I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li> I love this soap! It leaves my skin feeling soft and has improved it&#x27;s texture.I use it on my face and in the shower.</li>
            <li> I really liked this soap!  This is my second order, I also ordered another Mud soap from another vendor but liked the Best Dead Sea Soap better.  This is a good product and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!! My skin was a mess. My skin was broken out and looked dull. I started using this product and with in two weeks I saw a big difference. I just ordered my second bar, and i haven&#x27;t had a break out since I started using it. &#x27;</li>
            <li> Now i don&#x27;t necessarily have any skin problems. Never really had to worry about blemishes,oily skin,none of it, but i do still like to take care of my skin with natural products. This soap was great. It really gets in and cleans deep into your pores and tightens them.  Dead sea mud or clay can dry out the skin do to its salt content, but after washing i just moisturize with pure organic coconut oil and by the morning my skin looks even better than it already did.  It also helps with dry,dead skin. Makes the effected area like new,and soft. With continual care it can stay that way. If you bathe with the soap you&#x27;ll also notice it pulls dirt out of your skin and cleans you better compared to brand soaps.</li>
            <li> On my second day works really good on my sensitive skin but first day of using I got some in my eye and thought I was going to go blind burned so bad. Beauty is pain.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Product actually seem to tighten skin.</li>
            <li> GREAT AS A SCRUB AND EXFOLIATOR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my face and body as a scrub because it has &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34; texture. I like how it cleanses the skin, yet it feels gentle. I use it in combination with Dead Sea mud mask and together they work even better...good product</li>
            <li> This soap brought my complexion back to normal. It also cleans terrifically, even the heaviest foundation, but it does not dry the skin. I have been looking for something natural, without harsh chemicals, and I think this soap is a great alternative to regular store products full of parabens and other synthetic stuff.. and it is not as expensive and will last long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know  yet  I just  started  using it</li>
            <li> Most excellent..&lt;br /&gt;I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful..&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised with this mud soap! I have older, wrinkled, slightly sagging skin and was planning on using this as a body soap to sort of strip my skin clean prior to applying moisture but grabbed it in a hurry one morning to wash my face.  Wow.  This soap did an excellent job of cleaning my face and has since cleared up some acne on my chin and jaw area but the best part is it seems to tighten my skin! I&#x27;ve only used this for a week but I am beginning to see my face firm up ever so slightly.  Needless to say, I have continued to use this soap for my face every morning and evening and will need to purchase another for my body.</li>
            <li> I love this soap the best I had before.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and look so soft. Great soap!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product. It was my first time trying it. It was refreshing and did not leave my skin dry. I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> The best soap ever,I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and had a great result it tightens the skin and it works just like anti aging, sanitizes and cleans deeply leaving the skin feels soft and looks great.I bought it for my face but started using it for my body as well.It is natural no harsh chemicals, it does not  irritate my skin,will last long.I would buy it again and again and definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a sucker for Dead Sea products.  I LOVE the way this makes my skin feel after washing my face.  And not just my face.. my hands and FINGERS were feeling good!</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing. It left my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Yes I am enjoying my purchase the product is very good thank you.</li>
            <li> I tried this brand of dead sea soap after trying one from Vienna that a friend brought back for me. It&#x27;s nice..it works almost as well but the other smells better. But overall a good product!</li>
            <li> Best soap I&#x27;ve ever used! The condition of your skin depends on if your stressed and your diet usually. I eat healthy so I don&#x27;t break out much anymore. however this soap is keeping those breakout under control and giving me a glow :) must buy!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Shipped quickly and is exactly what I want.</li>
            <li> Ordered this soap for my Rosacea.  I have only used it a short time, but my skin seems less red and much softer.</li>
            <li> I wish the bar was bigger but that&#x27;s okay. It barely has a scent which I love.  I&#x27;ve been using this for two days now, day and night, and definitely feel a difference. My skin isn&#x27;t dry at all anymore and right after using it you can feel how soft your skin is. I even noticed my skin was brighter. &amp; clearer. I&#x27;ll be ordering again immediately! I&#x27;ve been surprised at the immediate results I&#x27;ve gotten so far and Im excited for what my skin will look like after a couple of weeks! Thanks!</li>
