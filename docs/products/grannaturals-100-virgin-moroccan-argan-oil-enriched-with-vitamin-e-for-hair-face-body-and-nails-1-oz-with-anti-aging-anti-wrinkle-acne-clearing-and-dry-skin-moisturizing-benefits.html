            <li>I love this argan oil, and here&#x27;s why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t  give the shine and healthy looking feel.</li>
            <li>Nice, light oil for my hair.</li>

            <li>(love winter</li>
            <li>Argan oil is interesting.</li>
            <li>I was worried that the oil would make my skin more oily</li>
            <li>And if you haven&#x27;t tried Argan oil for beards and moustaches, I do recommend trying it.  :)</li>
            <li>buy .i will buy again on this seller,it works all skin problem and nails problem.super love</li>
            <li>and i love this Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>I truly enjoyed this Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li>but of course, I need to condition using the Moroccan oil to keep my hair looking better.</li>
            <li>enjoyed reviewing this product at a discounted price (free) in exchange for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that works wonderfully well as a moisturizer, plus has the added benefit of helping speed healing of cracked skin on fingertips.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I will update my review after I have used it for a bit longer but so far so good!</li>
            <li>So many products have chemicals in them, so this was a great alternative to use with my normal cleansing routine on my face and body.</li>
            <li>It was a great price as well compared to getting it from high end cosmetics stores.  </li>
            <li>It feels conditioned, it feels soft and my hair looks shiny and beautiful.</li>
            <li>It is a great quality oil that is safe to use on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Argan oil is wonderful for dry hands.</li>
            <li>Great product, makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I was very lucky to receive a sample of this product for review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was 115 with the heat index here yesterday, and my hair was easy to style.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this oil for anyone who needs good moisturizer with healing touch.</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that it was pure argan oil...</li>
            <li>I was given this GranNaturals 100% Virgin Moroccan Argan Oil free for reviewing.</li>
            <li>Just one drop smoothed through my hair makes it manageable, shiny and free of frizz!&lt;br /&gt;-After</li>
            <li>a must have for anyone who has frizzies.feel so much comfortable with this argan oil.</li>
            <li>I received this bottle free as part of a promotion for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience using this.</li>
            <li>I received this bottle free as part of a promotion for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience using this.</li>
            <li>would be great to customized with some essential oils...</li>
            <li>(62-yr-old male)&lt;br /&gt;I received this Argan Oil as a *free* promotional add-on to a Boar Bristle hairbrush I ordered.</li>
            <li>Argan Oil is light</li>
            <li>I received this bottle for free as a part of the promotion for testing and evaluating their products, but my review is based on my experience in using this product.</li>
            <li>I read about the benefits of the oil for both hair and skin, and I have experienced both in my short time using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAIR&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s securely packaged (has a shrink-wrapped seal on the bottle) and the fact that it is glass means there&#x27;s zero chance of any type of leaching, which can happen with some plastics.  </li>
            <li>I do love the versatility of Argan Oil, and the extra addition of Vitamin E is a great addition over pure, &amp;#34;nothing else&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>According to their website, in order to get a &amp;#34;Natrual Organic Cosmetics&amp;#34; certification, as this product has, the products has to have a &amp;#34;minimum of 95% of all plant-based ingredients in the formula and a minimum of 10% of all ingredients by weight must come from organic farming.&amp;#34; Furthermore, it has to be made from renewable resources and processed in an environmentally friendly way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received this item for free in return of my true opinion</li>
            <li>It is also great when mixing a nice amount of it in my shampoo which gives my natural hair extra moisture and protection.</li>
            <li>There is no oily residue like you might think you&#x27;d get from using an oil because it&#x27;s light and absorbs really quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have tried jojoba oil and castor oil so far, and I love them!</li>
            <li>Works well and, more importantly, the shipper was very fast and very helpful!</li>
            <li>It worked great on rough patches ( like elbows and knees) and did wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li>Love the product, very versatile.</li>
            <li>I even applied some on my skin right after the shower and it absorbed very quickly and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue on my skin.</li>
            <li>it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling</li>
            <li>If this helps/solves my problem, I will double my rating to &amp;#34;10 Stars,&amp;#34; and gladly buy more @ $13/bottle, but won&#x27;t know &#x27;til coming winter months.</li>
            <li>Order arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Likewise, they check in order to make sure that it is free from &amp;#34;GMO, parabens, phenoxyethanol, nanoparticles, silicon, PEG, synthetic perfumes and dyes, animal-derived ingredients (unless naturally produced by them: milk, honey, etc.).&amp;#34; While not my main concern, the fact that this product meets these standards speaks very well of the product itself, the company, and the ability to use this product safely on the face and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I am really happy with the results, I am noticing that my skin blemishes becomes lighter and lighter each day, it somehow reduces the appearance of the scars from just the few days i have been using it.</li>
            <li>While I did receive this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I would definitely recommend this product.n to that</li>
            <li>While I did receive this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>As for greasiness, the oil was quickly absorbed into the skin when I used it on my hands, cuticles &amp; feet.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice blend of argan oil and vitamin E, which further aids in healing damaged skin.</li>
            <li>Well worth considering if you&#x27;re looking for some argan oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>in combination with my own DIY facial toners, masks, and exfoliators, this adds just the right touch of moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The dropper lets me apply just the right amount.  </li>
            <li>GranNaturals 100% Virgin Moroccan Argan Oil arrived super fast and so far I am really pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It has a very good natural smell and it isn&#x27;t overly heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li>That being said, it was still effective at moisturizing my dry hands.</li>
            <li>Ive Been looking for an oil that suites to my messy hair, finally Argan  Oil gives a wonderful result, it moisturizes and make your hair shine</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying Argan Oil of any brand.</li>
            <li>This is a great oil for curly or natural hair as it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li>is pure and straight from Morocco!</li>
            <li>right before I blow-dry, and it creates a nice shine, that wasn&#x27;t too heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>oz is not a large bottle; however, it is about as big as most eye/face serums and a fraction of the cost for the better ones.</li>
            <li>oz is not a large bottle; however, it is about as big as most eye/face serums and a fraction of the cost for the better ones.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin super soft and moisturized immediately and makes a WORLD of difference in the darkness of my scars and stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Have to say that after using it for a few days, I love it!  </li>
            <li>However, this only adds to the benefits as Vitamin E helps to reduce roughness, wrinkles, and fine lines.</li>
            <li>Additionally, this meets standards many of the more expensive cosmetics do not meet and you are able to use it on your entire body (although it should not be consumed).</li>
            <li>Additionally, this meets standards many of the more expensive cosmetics do not meet and you are able to use it on your entire body (although it should not be consumed).</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I have very oily skin, and this doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.</li>
            <li>Have heard so much about the benefits of Argan Oil that I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>It mixes very well with Shea Butter &amp; Coconut Oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very versatile item to have on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>really like how this is packaged.</li>
            <li>Anti Aging, Anti Wrinkle, Acne Clearing, and Dry Skin Moisturizing Benefits----There is not much of a scent at all and is pleasant.</li>
            <li>Can be used for many other things</li>
            <li>Ecocert was the first to develop standards for natural organic cosmetic products.</li>
            <li>I typically have to use more product when using a straightening iron to keep my hair from frizzing, but it was perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a light earthy smell that is characteristic of Argan oil.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>, I guess it&#x27;s just gentle because it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I decided to substitute my normal conditioner for 2-3 drops of Argan Oil after washing my hair.</li>
            <li>i have too much dry skin specially in my scalp this product helps me treat it</li>
            <li>Argan Oil naturally penetrates the hair to help moisturize each layer of the hair strand for long-term hair repair so your hair actually looks and feels healthier, silkier, and extraordinarily shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different moisturizers in all different price ranges with mixed results.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well for facial hair maintenance without leaving an overly &amp;#34;glazed donut&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it will work with 2-3 drops of oil, so the first time I tried several drops.</li>
            <li>The product has a very mild nutty smell, and even though the fluid seems thin, the oil spreads easily on the skin.</li>
            <li>Also, included in the box is an instruction sheet on different ways this oil can be used, which I appreciated as a new user.</li>
            <li>I have dry hair in the winter time and this takes the frizz right out.</li>
            <li>Pure Argan oil used internally has been shown to fight cancer, cardiovascular disease, and inflammatory disorders.</li>
            <li>Additionally, this product is Natural Organic Cosmetics Certified by Ecocert Greenlife.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make them go away completely (or hasn&#x27;t Yet)</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that it had a neutral smell...</li>
            <li>but it actually worked well under my makeup even on a very humid day.</li>
            <li>I use this oil for my natural hair and skin.</li>
            <li>I cant thank you enough how this products works on me, it really amazed me</li>
            <li>I like that it is natural and won’t hurt my skin or my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I use this mostly for skin moisturizing, argan oil can be used for a lot of other purposes such as hair conditioner, nail strengthener, cuticle repair, and similar tasks.</li>
            <li>argan oil is easily absorbed and it regulates the PH balance of the skin which in return protects against sun exposure and other damage.</li>
            <li>My normally dry hair was very greasy.</li>
            <li>I got this multiple insect bite scars in my arm and a pimple mark on my face recently and I am really bothered by this skin blemishes</li>
            <li>This is an oil but it DOESN&#x27;T break me out, it actually helps clear me up</li>
            <li>I have seen a drastic improvement in my hair in the last 2 weeks, it&#x27;s easier to detangle and it has a natural luster.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Argan oil over any lotion and for your hair, especially if you&#x27;re skin is sensitive to other products.</li>
            <li>it actually noticed the difference the following day, it completely heals up.</li>
            <li>I wanted something that was pure argan oil without all the artificial silicone byproducts (dimethicone/ cyclomethicone) that most commercial applications tend to have.  </li>
            <li>I also have used only one drop as a total facial moisturizer, which left my skin feeling soft and not at all greasy.</li>
            <li>There are no harsh ingredients or man made chemicals to irritate my skin or dry me out.</li>
            <li>I have really become a fan of using natural oils to moisturize my hair, skin and nails as of late.</li>

            <li> dishes, gardening, crafts, etc... plus the summer weather has not been kind to my hair, skin or feet (flip flops are the norm for me).  </li>

            <li> enjoyed reviewing this product at a discounted price (free) in exchange for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that works wonderfully well as a moisturizer, plus has the added benefit of helping speed healing of cracked skin on fingertips.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I will update my review after I have used it for a bit longer but so far so good!</li>
            <li> So many products have chemicals in them, so this was a great alternative to use with my normal cleansing routine on my face and body.</li>
            <li> It was a great price as well compared to getting it from high end cosmetics stores.  </li>
            <li> It feels conditioned, it feels soft and my hair looks shiny and beautiful.</li>
            <li> It is a great quality oil that is safe to use on sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> Great product, makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I was very lucky to receive a sample of this product for review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was 115 with the heat index here yesterday, and my hair was easy to style.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this oil for anyone who needs good moisturizer with healing touch.</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that it was pure argan oil...</li>
            <li> I was given this GranNaturals 100% Virgin Moroccan Argan Oil free for reviewing.</li>
            <li> Just one drop smoothed through my hair makes it manageable, shiny and free of frizz!&lt;br /&gt;-After</li>
            <li> a must have for anyone who has frizzies.feel so much comfortable with this argan oil.</li>
            <li> I received this bottle free as part of a promotion for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience using this.</li>
            <li> I received this bottle free as part of a promotion for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience using this.</li>
            <li> would be great to customized with some essential oils...</li>
            <li> (62-yr-old male)&lt;br /&gt;I received this Argan Oil as a *free* promotional add-on to a Boar Bristle hairbrush I ordered.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is light</li>
            <li> I received this bottle for free as a part of the promotion for testing and evaluating their products, but my review is based on my experience in using this product.</li>
            <li> I read about the benefits of the oil for both hair and skin, and I have experienced both in my short time using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAIR&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s securely packaged (has a shrink-wrapped seal on the bottle) and the fact that it is glass means there&#x27;s zero chance of any type of leaching, which can happen with some plastics.  </li>
            <li> I do love the versatility of Argan Oil, and the extra addition of Vitamin E is a great addition over pure, &amp;#34;nothing else&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> According to their website, in order to get a &amp;#34;Natrual Organic Cosmetics&amp;#34; certification, as this product has, the products has to have a &amp;#34;minimum of 95% of all plant-based ingredients in the formula and a minimum of 10% of all ingredients by weight must come from organic farming.&amp;#34; Furthermore, it has to be made from renewable resources and processed in an environmentally friendly way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received this item for free in return of my true opinion</li>
            <li> It is also great when mixing a nice amount of it in my shampoo which gives my natural hair extra moisture and protection.</li>
            <li> There is no oily residue like you might think you&#x27;d get from using an oil because it&#x27;s light and absorbs really quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have tried jojoba oil and castor oil so far, and I love them!</li>
            <li> Works well and, more importantly, the shipper was very fast and very helpful!</li>
            <li> It worked great on rough patches ( like elbows and knees) and did wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> Love the product, very versatile.</li>
            <li> I even applied some on my skin right after the shower and it absorbed very quickly and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue on my skin.</li>
            <li> it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling</li>
            <li> If this helps/solves my problem, I will double my rating to &amp;#34;10 Stars,&amp;#34; and gladly buy more @ $13/bottle, but won&#x27;t know &#x27;til coming winter months.</li>
            <li> Order arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Likewise, they check in order to make sure that it is free from &amp;#34;GMO, parabens, phenoxyethanol, nanoparticles, silicon, PEG, synthetic perfumes and dyes, animal-derived ingredients (unless naturally produced by them: milk, honey, etc.).&amp;#34; While not my main concern, the fact that this product meets these standards speaks very well of the product itself, the company, and the ability to use this product safely on the face and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I am really happy with the results, I am noticing that my skin blemishes becomes lighter and lighter each day, it somehow reduces the appearance of the scars from just the few days i have been using it.</li>
            <li> While I did receive this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I would definitely recommend this product.n to that</li>
            <li> While I did receive this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> As for greasiness, the oil was quickly absorbed into the skin when I used it on my hands, cuticles &amp; feet.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice blend of argan oil and vitamin E, which further aids in healing damaged skin.</li>
            <li> Well worth considering if you&#x27;re looking for some argan oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> in combination with my own DIY facial toners, masks, and exfoliators, this adds just the right touch of moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The dropper lets me apply just the right amount.  </li>
            <li> GranNaturals 100% Virgin Moroccan Argan Oil arrived super fast and so far I am really pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It has a very good natural smell and it isn&#x27;t overly heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> That being said, it was still effective at moisturizing my dry hands.</li>
            <li> Ive Been looking for an oil that suites to my messy hair, finally Argan  Oil gives a wonderful result, it moisturizes and make your hair shine</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying Argan Oil of any brand.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil for curly or natural hair as it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li> is pure and straight from Morocco!</li>
            <li> right before I blow-dry, and it creates a nice shine, that wasn&#x27;t too heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> oz is not a large bottle; however, it is about as big as most eye/face serums and a fraction of the cost for the better ones.</li>
            <li> oz is not a large bottle; however, it is about as big as most eye/face serums and a fraction of the cost for the better ones.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin super soft and moisturized immediately and makes a WORLD of difference in the darkness of my scars and stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Have to say that after using it for a few days, I love it!  </li>
            <li> However, this only adds to the benefits as Vitamin E helps to reduce roughness, wrinkles, and fine lines.</li>
            <li> Additionally, this meets standards many of the more expensive cosmetics do not meet and you are able to use it on your entire body (although it should not be consumed).</li>
            <li> Additionally, this meets standards many of the more expensive cosmetics do not meet and you are able to use it on your entire body (although it should not be consumed).</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I have very oily skin, and this doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> Have heard so much about the benefits of Argan Oil that I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> It mixes very well with Shea Butter &amp; Coconut Oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very versatile item to have on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> really like how this is packaged.</li>
            <li> Anti Aging, Anti Wrinkle, Acne Clearing, and Dry Skin Moisturizing Benefits----There is not much of a scent at all and is pleasant.</li>
            <li> Can be used for many other things</li>
            <li> Ecocert was the first to develop standards for natural organic cosmetic products.</li>
            <li> I typically have to use more product when using a straightening iron to keep my hair from frizzing, but it was perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a light earthy smell that is characteristic of Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> , I guess it&#x27;s just gentle because it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I decided to substitute my normal conditioner for 2-3 drops of Argan Oil after washing my hair.</li>
            <li> i have too much dry skin specially in my scalp this product helps me treat it</li>
            <li> Argan Oil naturally penetrates the hair to help moisturize each layer of the hair strand for long-term hair repair so your hair actually looks and feels healthier, silkier, and extraordinarily shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different moisturizers in all different price ranges with mixed results.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty well for facial hair maintenance without leaving an overly &amp;#34;glazed donut&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t feel like it will work with 2-3 drops of oil, so the first time I tried several drops.</li>
            <li> The product has a very mild nutty smell, and even though the fluid seems thin, the oil spreads easily on the skin.</li>
            <li> Also, included in the box is an instruction sheet on different ways this oil can be used, which I appreciated as a new user.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair in the winter time and this takes the frizz right out.</li>
            <li> Pure Argan oil used internally has been shown to fight cancer, cardiovascular disease, and inflammatory disorders.</li>
            <li> Additionally, this product is Natural Organic Cosmetics Certified by Ecocert Greenlife.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make them go away completely (or hasn&#x27;t Yet)</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that it had a neutral smell...</li>
            <li> but it actually worked well under my makeup even on a very humid day.</li>
            <li> I use this oil for my natural hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I cant thank you enough how this products works on me, it really amazed me</li>
            <li> I like that it is natural and won’t hurt my skin or my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I use this mostly for skin moisturizing, argan oil can be used for a lot of other purposes such as hair conditioner, nail strengthener, cuticle repair, and similar tasks.</li>
            <li> argan oil is easily absorbed and it regulates the PH balance of the skin which in return protects against sun exposure and other damage.</li>
            <li> My normally dry hair was very greasy.</li>
            <li> I got this multiple insect bite scars in my arm and a pimple mark on my face recently and I am really bothered by this skin blemishes</li>
            <li> This is an oil but it DOESN&#x27;T break me out, it actually helps clear me up</li>
            <li> I have seen a drastic improvement in my hair in the last 2 weeks, it&#x27;s easier to detangle and it has a natural luster.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Argan oil over any lotion and for your hair, especially if you&#x27;re skin is sensitive to other products.</li>
            <li> it actually noticed the difference the following day, it completely heals up.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that was pure argan oil without all the artificial silicone byproducts (dimethicone/ cyclomethicone) that most commercial applications tend to have.  </li>
            <li> I also have used only one drop as a total facial moisturizer, which left my skin feeling soft and not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> There are no harsh ingredients or man made chemicals to irritate my skin or dry me out.</li>
            <li> I have really become a fan of using natural oils to moisturize my hair, skin and nails as of late.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-A few drops really does go a long way; just this bottle of oil can last you several months.&lt;br /&gt;-Used</li>
            <li> A little really does go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SKIN</li>
            <li> Only using one drop, I rub it in my palms and through my hair (medium length, wavy, thick) and it adds a healthy shine and helps tame frizz!</li>
            <li> a one drop of this oil solve my problem especially if you like to use scented shampoos and conditioner and leave your scalp really dry and itchy after you use hairdryer and flat iron .i</li>
            <li> Feels oily initially bit soon loses that feel, yet very soothing.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was a bit surprised how thinner, less viscous this oil is, even with the Vitamin E, compared to others I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> , I dont even spend another money to buy my conditioner,i like this product because there was no harm ingredients that make you harsh, because its all natural and</li>
            <li> If you put a few drops into wet hair and wrap it for a while it  leaves your hair soft and frizz-free like a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> Normally, I must condition my hair, or it is difficult to manage and frizzy, particularly in humid weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In order to make this last, I would suggest mixing it with moisturizers and/or other oils.</li>
            <li> In order to make this last, I would suggest mixing it with moisturizers and/or other oils.</li>
            <li> Before I went to bed that night after removing all traces of makeup I applied some of the Argan Oil on my face and the next morning I felt as if my skin was dewy and that doesn&#x27;t happen to me with all the other products out there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as ornate as other argan oils I&#x27;ve tried which is a plus -- while I like the visual appeal of ornate packaging and bottles, I don&#x27;t like how it jacks up the cost.</li>
            <li> Subtly scented with geranium and bergamot fruit oils, the ultralight, never-greasy, alcohol-free formula helps to seal split ends and deliver intense moisture to each layer of the hair strand.</li>
            <li> Before, I would dry off my hair</li>
            <li> It looked dry and not condition.</li>
            <li> I truly recommend this to people who want that volume and shine in their hair but can’t because of dry spots, poof balls and oily hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You only use a few drops per treatment and if you rinse it well it won&#x27;t leave your hair greasy or gross.</li>
            <li> I have used this oil on both wet and dry hair and it helps maintain and lock in moisture and shine.</li>
            <li> only negative I have is that, while the box has a spot to list the expiration date and the batch number, both were blank.</li>
            <li> This came packaged inside a box, and it was carefully wrapped in bubblewrap inside an envelope.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t gritty or heavy at all.</li>
            <li> I received the GranNaturals 100% Virgin Moroccan Argan Oil a few days ago and used it the same evening.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m now a lifelong user.</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly hair and use a chemical relaxer.</li>
            <li> I see less dry spots</li>
            <li> With this oil and little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> 34;a little goes a long way.&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This may be the reason that it is thinner than other argan oil products that I have used.</li>
            <li> As I stated before, this product is thinner than other argan oil products that I have used.</li>
            <li> (Wikipedia it) I cannot attest to its effectiveness, since I just received it, but am hoping it helps me defeat my chronically cracked fingertips during our harsh, dry winters.</li>
            <li> Argan oil actually helps to reduce sebum levels!&lt;br /&gt;-Helps to tame the frizziness in my hair and moisturize my dead ends.</li>
            <li> It comes in a 1oz dark glass bottle.</li>
            <li> The glass is also a dark amber color to protect the oil from UV</li>
            <li> whatever other junk you may have sitting in your bathroom!</li>
            <li> since I&#x27;ve come across other oils that had a rancid smell or had been scented too heavily.  </li>
            <li> My hair was shinier, had less split ends, and was easier to manage.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to improve my acne, the product was delivered in less than a week and the product looked like the item on the site.</li>
            <li> I hate spending $10 on one bottle of conditioner that &amp;#34;kind of&amp;#34; makes an improvement when I can spend the same amount on a bottle of argan oil that will last a few months and completely fix the issues I&#x27;m having.</li>
            <li> After washing my hair I used a little Argan oil</li>
            <li> I have used the product 3 days in a row and my skin does look a little clearer.</li>
            <li> I used a drop on some acne on my face and noticed a little diminishing.</li>
            <li> Just putting one small, little drop in my finger and applying it to my acne spots in my face, I’ve seen less acne spots and less inflammation as well.</li>
            <li> Typically I use a mixture of raw shea butter and organic coconut oil on my hair.</li>
            <li> but I can see a noticeable difference after just a few months.</li>
            <li> I started seeing results within a few weeks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a huge problem, but I like to see that info on these types of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pure oil is very expensive</li>
            <li> The added vitamin E also thins the oil a small amount, which is a plus since it makes it easier to spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Made my hair hard.</li>
            <li> I Have to use argan oil on my legs and bikini area after shaving because anything else causes me really ugly red bumps and burning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is seriously a must-have!</li>
            <li> Get rid of your expensive creams and cuticle oils and</li>

            <li> This oil has been awesome. It comes in a 1oz dark glass bottle. With this oil and little goes a long way. Pure Argan oil used internally has been shown to fight cancer, cardiovascular disease, and inflammatory disorders. When applied externally, it cures everything from scars to infections to split ends to stretch marks. Pure oil is very expensive and I&#x27;m glad I was able to try this oil in exchange to give my honest thoughts on the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure argan oil is easily absorbed and it regulates the PH balance of the skin which in return protects against sun exposure and other damage.

            <li> GranNaturals 100% Virgin Moroccan Argan Oil arrived super fast and so far I am really pleased with it. I have used it on my hair and hands . I will update my review after I have used it for a bit longer but so far so good! I was given this GranNaturals 100% Virgin Moroccan Argan Oil free for reviewing.</li>
            <li> I had received this product for a review and it did not disappoint. It worked great on rough patches ( like elbows and knees) and did wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product, makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> very nice feel for my nails and hair...</li>
            <li> GranNaturals 100% Virgin Moroccan Argan Oil is a really nice product. It comes in a glass bottle with a glass dropper. The argan oil is mixed with Vitamin E. This may be the reason that it is thinner than other argan oil products that I have used. However, this only adds to the benefits as Vitamin E helps to reduce roughness, wrinkles, and fine lines. That makes this the perfect product to add to a daily face regimen. Additionally, this product is Natural Organic Cosmetics Certified by Ecocert Greenlife. Ecocert was the first to develop standards for natural organic cosmetic products. According to their website, in order to get a &amp;#34;Natrual Organic Cosmetics&amp;#34; certification, as this product has, the products has to have a &amp;#34;minimum of 95% of all plant-based ingredients in the formula and a minimum of 10% of all ingredients by weight must come from organic farming.&amp;#34; Furthermore, it has to be made from renewable resources and processed in an environmentally friendly way. Likewise, they check in order to make sure that it is free from &amp;#34;GMO, parabens, phenoxyethanol, nanoparticles, silicon, PEG, synthetic perfumes and dyes, animal-derived ingredients (unless naturally produced by them: milk, honey, etc.).&amp;#34; While not my main concern, the fact that this product meets these standards speaks very well of the product itself, the company, and the ability to use this product safely on the face and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving it, I immediately used it on my hands. As I stated before, this product is thinner than other argan oil products that I have used. That being said, it was still effective at moisturizing my dry hands. It didn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling oily. However, I did find that I prefer to add a couple of drops to my moisturizer for my skin and face. I also add this to my hair. I have thick, naturally curly hair and use a chemical relaxer. Typically I use a mixture of raw shea butter and organic coconut oil on my hair. This is the perfect addition to that mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 fl. oz is not a large bottle; however, it is about as big as most eye/face serums and a fraction of the cost for the better ones. Additionally, this meets standards many of the more expensive cosmetics do not meet and you are able to use it on your entire body (although it should not be consumed). In order to make this last, I would suggest mixing it with moisturizers and/or other oils. While I did receive this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I would definitely recommend this product.n to that mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 fl. oz is not a large bottle; however, it is about as big as most eye/face serums and a fraction of the cost for the better ones.

            <li> I have really become a fan of using natural oils to moisturize my hair, skin and nails as of late. I have tried jojoba oil and castor oil so far, and I love them! Argan oil is now another favorite of mine. I wish I had known about this when I was younger. I had terrible cystic acne as a teenager, and as a result, my face has ice pick and boxcar scars. I love this argan oil, and here&#x27;s why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-It is a great nighttime moisturizer. It does not leave my skin feeling greasy, sticky, or suffocated. My skin can breathe through this oil, even with the recently humid weather we have been having here in California.&lt;br /&gt;-A few drops really does go a long way; just this bottle of oil can last you several months.&lt;br /&gt;-Used in combination with my own DIY facial toners, masks, and exfoliators, this adds just the right touch of moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;-I have very oily skin, and this doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out. Argan oil actually helps to reduce sebum levels!&lt;br /&gt;-Helps to tame the frizziness in my hair and moisturize my dead ends. Just one drop smoothed through my hair makes it manageable, shiny and free of frizz!&lt;br /&gt;-After I apply the oil over my face, I use the leftover on my lips. My lips have never been softer.&lt;br /&gt;-I use this oil to apply to my cuticles before I apply nail polish. My polish never looked this good before when I would do it myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is seriously a must-have! Get rid of your expensive creams and cuticle oils and whatever other junk you may have sitting in your bathroom! This oil, just one bottle, can replace all of that for you.</li>
            <li> Works well and, more importantly, the shipper was very fast and very helpful!</li>
            <li> I used the arogon oil on my hair it didn&#x27;t  give the shine and healthy looking feel. Made my hair hard.</li>
            <li> I got this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. This product is personally not for me.</li>
            <li> Nice, light oil for my hair. I put it on right before I blow-dry, and it creates a nice shine, that wasn&#x27;t too heavy or greasy. I used about a dime size and that was the perfect amount.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Great deal and great service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this GranNaturals Argan oil for several days now and I am quite pleased with it. I got this multiple insect bite scars in my arm and a pimple mark on my face recently and I am really bothered by this skin blemishes, it just doesn&#x27;t look really nice with all those skin discolorations. So when i received this Argan oil i started using it and I applied the oil to the affected areas twice a day. And I am really happy with the results, I am noticing that my skin blemishes becomes lighter and lighter each day, it somehow reduces the appearance of the scars from just the few days i have been using it. I just think this oil is amazing and really effective. :) So I&#x27;m just gonna continue using this wonderful product. I have gotten this product for testing and review purposes, all opinions are of my own and were not swayed by anyone.</li>

            <li> I received the GranNaturals 100% Virgin Moroccan Argan Oil a few days ago and used it the same evening. After washing my hair I used a little Argan oil and I really love the way it moisturized my hair. My hair was shinier, had less split ends, and was easier to manage. I also soaked my cuticles in the Argan Oil. It softened my cuticles so it was easier to push back. Before I went to bed that night after removing all traces of makeup I applied some of the Argan Oil on my face and the next morning I felt as if my skin was dewy and that doesn&#x27;t happen to me with all the other products out there. This GranNaturals 100% Virgin Moroccan Argan Oil can be used by everyone and also would make a great gift.</li>
            <li> Excellent choice! Love the product, very versatile. Great service and quick shipping.</li>

            <li> Argan oil is a staple in my haircare and skincare product collection. I&#x27;m acne prone, or Was, before I started using oils on my skin.I realized I was just having a reaction to regular body washes and shampoos, basically everything that comes in contact with my skin. This is an oil but it DOESN&#x27;T break me out, it actually helps clear me up, I guess it&#x27;s just gentle because it&#x27;s natural.There are no harsh ingredients or man made chemicals to irritate my skin or dry me out.If you put a few drops into wet hair and wrap it for a while it  leaves your hair soft and frizz-free like a deep conditioner. I hate spending $10 on one bottle of conditioner that &amp;#34;kind of&amp;#34; makes an improvement when I can spend the same amount on a bottle of argan oil that will last a few months and completely fix the issues I&#x27;m having. You only use a few drops per treatment and if you rinse it well it won&#x27;t leave your hair greasy or gross. I actually prefer using this brand on my skin because of the added vitamin e and the benefits that gives. I use it on acne scars I have and stretch marks on my breasts, stomach, and hips from having babies. It leaves my skin super soft and moisturized immediately and makes a WORLD of difference in the darkness of my scars and stretch marks. It doesn&#x27;t make them go away completely (or hasn&#x27;t Yet) but I can see a noticeable difference after just a few months. I started seeing results within a few weeks and I&#x27;m now a lifelong user. There is no oily residue like you might think you&#x27;d get from using an oil because it&#x27;s light and absorbs really quickly.  Nothing works this well for me in comparison. I Have to use argan oil on my legs and bikini area after shaving because anything else causes me really ugly red bumps and burning. I couldn&#x27;t moisturize the area at all for over a day after shaving without breaking out with those. I highly recommend Argan oil over any lotion and for your hair, especially if you&#x27;re skin is sensitive to other products. If you&#x27;ve never tried it you&#x27;ll be amazed at the difference it makes.I received this bottle free as part of a promotion for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience using this. I can&#x27;t stress enough how well it works.r tried it you&#x27;ll be amazed at the difference it makes.I received this bottle free as part of a promotion for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience using this.

            <li> I work a lot with my hands...dishes, gardening, crafts, etc... plus the summer weather has not been kind to my hair, skin or feet (flip flops are the norm for me).  I&#x27;ve tried many different moisturizers in all different price ranges with mixed results.  Have heard so much about the benefits of Argan Oil that I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  I wanted something that was pure argan oil without all the artificial silicone byproducts (dimethicone/ cyclomethicone) that most commercial applications tend to have.  Came across GranNaturals 100% Virgin Moroccan Argan Oil on Amazon.  I liked the fact that it was pure argan oil...no fillers nor artificial ingredients.  It was a great price as well compared to getting it from high end cosmetics stores.  Decided to buy it to try despite reservations about greasiness &amp; smell.  Have to say that after using it for a few days, I love it!  The oil came in a bottle with a handy dropper as shown.  The dropper lets me apply just the right amount.  My hands &amp; feet are definitely softer and my hair shinier.  I was pleasantly surprised that it had a neutral smell...would be great to customized with some essential oils...since I&#x27;ve come across other oils that had a rancid smell or had been scented too heavily.  As for greasiness, the oil was quickly absorbed into the skin when I used it on my hands, cuticles &amp; feet.  Am very pleased with this discovery...This is definitely a keeper in my skin care/ beauty routine!</li>
            <li> (62-yr-old male)&lt;br /&gt;I received this Argan Oil as a *free* promotional add-on to a Boar Bristle hairbrush I ordered. I had never heard of &amp;#34;Argan Oil&amp;#34; - had no idea what it is. I now know it is exclusively a product of Morocco (and &amp;#34;important&amp;#34; to their agri-economy), and that it has Vitamin E, several Omegas, and can be used for numerous topical purposes such as hair, skin, nails/cuticles, etc., and that &amp;#34;a little goes a long way.&amp;#34;. (Wikipedia it) I cannot attest to its effectiveness, since I just received it, but am hoping it helps me defeat my chronically cracked fingertips during our harsh, dry winters. I also know that some vendors charge exorbitant prices for the same-size dropper bottle, containing what appears to be an identical, or similar &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34; Argan-Oil product. (I&#x27;m not a &amp;#34;Greenie&amp;#34;- just emphasizing how this product is promoted). If this helps/solves my problem, I will double my rating to &amp;#34;10 Stars,&amp;#34; and gladly buy more @ $13/bottle, but won&#x27;t know &#x27;til coming winter months. (love winter - *hate* cracked fingers)</li>
            <li> Order arrived quickly. Argan oil is interesting. Seems to be a superior choice for my hair, scalp and skin. Feels oily initially bit soon loses that feel, yet very soothing. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to improve my acne, the product was delivered in less than a week and the product looked like the item on the site. I was worried that the oil would make my skin more oily but it actually worked well under my makeup even on a very humid day. I have used the product 3 days in a row and my skin does look a little clearer. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent Argan Oil with Vitamin E. It comes in a glass bottle with glass dropper and instructional paper. Works wonderful with the hair. Highly recommend this oil for anyone who needs good moisturizer with healing touch.</li>
            <li> This is a great product it helps my hair look and feel healthier. It helps to keep my hair from getting as frizzy. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> This oil is great for your hair! I have used this oil on both wet and dry hair and it helps maintain and lock in moisture and shine. It has a very good natural smell and it isn&#x27;t overly heavy or sticky. This is a great oil for curly or natural hair as it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down. I even applied some on my skin right after the shower and it absorbed very quickly and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue on my skin. I have seen a drastic improvement in my hair in the last 2 weeks, it&#x27;s easier to detangle and it has a natural luster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER : I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW. MY OPINIONS OF THIS PRODUCT ARE BASED ON MY OWN HONEST AND UNBIASED EXPERIENCE USING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Great product. Makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is light and I loved that it was unscented.It mixes very well with Shea Butter &amp; Coconut Oil.I use this oil for my natural hair and skin.It is also great when mixing a nice amount of it in my shampoo which gives my natural hair extra moisture and protection.I will purchase a larger bottle of this Argan Oil for longer use.It is a great quality oil that is safe to use on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product for its many benefits!</li>
            <li> I do love the versatility of Argan Oil, and the extra addition of Vitamin E is a great addition over pure, &amp;#34;nothing else&amp;#34; Argan oil.  I have to say I was a bit surprised how thinner, less viscous this oil is, even with the Vitamin E, compared to others I&#x27;ve used.  Works pretty well for facial hair maintenance without leaving an overly &amp;#34;glazed donut&amp;#34; look others compound Argan oils have.  And if you haven&#x27;t tried Argan oil for beards and moustaches, I do recommend trying it.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I did receive this as an offered discounted product for reviewing purposes, yet my thinking here reflects all my personal purchasing decision processes and hopefully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations.</li>
            <li> i have too much dry skin specially in my scalp this product helps me treat it a one drop of this oil solve my problem especially if you like to use scented shampoos and conditioner and leave your scalp really dry and itchy after you use hairdryer and flat iron .i love this and its effective on me .Great buy .i will buy again on this seller,it works all skin problem and nails problem.super love it i got this as exchange for my very honest unbiaed reviews...I recommend to all its</li>
            <li> This is my first time using argan oil, and I am so impressed! Only using one drop, I rub it in my palms and through my hair (medium length, wavy, thick) and it adds a healthy shine and helps tame frizz! I use my hands to work it through all of my hair, then I use my boar&#x27;s hair brush from this company to finish distributing the argan oil. I also have used only one drop as a total facial moisturizer, which left my skin feeling soft and not at all greasy. As I continue to use this product, I will report on how it helps my skin&#x27;s health and the effects on my acne and acne scars. Also, included in the box is an instruction sheet on different ways this oil can be used, which I appreciated as a new user. I&#x27;m going to use it on my nails and cuticles soon! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and look forward to using this product!</li>
            <li> Great product for your hair. I have dry hair in the winter time and this takes the frizz right out. Can be used for many other things but I just use in as a hair product. I received this at discount as part of a review A+</li>
            <li> Ive Been looking for an oil that suites to my messy hair, finally Argan  Oil gives a wonderful result, it moisturizes and make your hair shine, I dont even spend another money to buy my conditioner,i like this product because there was no harm ingredients that make you harsh, because its all natural and it also contains with Vitamin E.When you use argan oil before taking a bath just put 4-5 drops in your hair for 15 minutes and you can see the result after you bath its really amazing.And i actually using a Brand soap for may face to prevent pimples,but i tried this product like just a drop it actually noticed the difference the following day, it completely heals up.I received this bottle for free as a part of the promotion for testing and evaluating their products, but my review is based on my experience in using this product. I cant thank you enough how this products works on me, it really amazed me and i love this Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle to my poofy and frizzy hair plus my skin as well! Where has this been all my life? I truly enjoyed this Moroccan oil. It has been one of the best purchases I have ever done. I used this on my hair because having curly hair can have up and downs. Having curly hair means you have to deal with frizz and tons of pouf plus the fact that your hair can get tangled as well. My mom gave me advice on conditioning your hair with Moroccan oil. She told me to put a bowl of both warming water and adding some drop of Moroccan oil. Then added it to my hair for about 10 minutes with a shower cap on. I can tell you, I’ve seen a great difference on my hair after using my mom’s advice every day for a couple of days. Before, I would dry off my hair and I can see the poof ball. It looked dry and not condition. Now, my hair looks great but of course, I need to condition using the Moroccan oil to keep my hair looking better. I see less dry spots and it’s not oily. It feels conditioned, it feels soft and my hair looks shiny and beautiful. Supposedly, Moroccan oil is used for anti-aging effects that come with age and acne. So I’ve started using a couple of drops in my face but of course, the effect won’t come overnight. I will have to continue using the product to see lasting results. I can vouch that the Moroccan oil has helped my acne a bit. Just putting one small, little drop in my finger and applying it to my acne spots in my face, I’ve seen less acne spots and less inflammation as well. Nobody likes to have pimples looking as red as Rudolph’s nose. I like that it is natural and won’t hurt my skin or my hair. I truly recommend this to people who want that volume and shine in their hair but can’t because of dry spots, poof balls and oily hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed reviewing this product at a discounted price (free) in exchange for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying Argan Oil of any brand. I read about the benefits of the oil for both hair and skin, and I have experienced both in my short time using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAIR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I decided to substitute my normal conditioner for 2-3 drops of Argan Oil after washing my hair. Normally, I must condition my hair, or it is difficult to manage and frizzy, particularly in humid weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was 115 with the heat index here yesterday, and my hair was easy to style. I typically have to use more product when using a straightening iron to keep my hair from frizzing, but it was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caution, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it will work with 2-3 drops of oil, so the first time I tried several drops. My normally dry hair was very greasy. A little really does go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SKIN&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works well as a toner or moisturizer for your skin. So many products have chemicals in them, so this was a great alternative to use with my normal cleansing routine on my face and body. I used a drop on some acne on my face and noticed a little diminishing. Hopefully, continued use will strengthen the effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for a review. My opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is wonderful for dry hands. It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that works wonderfully well as a moisturizer, plus has the added benefit of helping speed healing of cracked skin on fingertips. This is a nice blend of argan oil and vitamin E, which further aids in healing damaged skin. The added vitamin E also thins the oil a small amount, which is a plus since it makes it easier to spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I use this mostly for skin moisturizing, argan oil can be used for a lot of other purposes such as hair conditioner, nail strengthener, cuticle repair, and similar tasks. It&#x27;s a very versatile item to have on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like how this is packaged. It&#x27;s not as ornate as other argan oils I&#x27;ve tried which is a plus -- while I like the visual appeal of ornate packaging and bottles, I don&#x27;t like how it jacks up the cost. This is a simple 30ml glass dropper bottle that comes in a cardboard container. It&#x27;s securely packaged (has a shrink-wrapped seal on the bottle) and the fact that it is glass means there&#x27;s zero chance of any type of leaching, which can happen with some plastics.  The glass is also a dark amber color to protect the oil from UV degradation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a light earthy smell that is characteristic of Argan oil. The bottle states it was made in Morocco, and is certified organic virgin cold-pressed argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I have is that, while the box has a spot to list the expiration date and the batch number, both were blank. It&#x27;s not a huge problem, but I like to see that info on these types of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That issue aside, zero complaints. It feels and performs like a good quality argan oil, comes packaged in a nice glass bottle, is easy to dispense with the included dropper, and adds vitamin E for added benefits. Well worth considering if you&#x27;re looking for some argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;[Sample provided for review]</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and I am so glad I did.  It&#x27;s a great product.  I use it on my hair before I go to sleep.  After shampooing in the morning, my hair is silky.  I also massage it onto my feet.  My feet feel and look great afterwards!</li>
