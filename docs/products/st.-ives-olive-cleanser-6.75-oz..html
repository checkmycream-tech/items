            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t smell very good--kind of a sour smell; it&#x27;s not totally offensive, but not pleasing.  </li>

            <li> The humidity is terrible where I am right now and all my other face washes make my face feel greasy pretty quickly after.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I ALSO NOTICED A DRY PATCH UNDER MY EYE.  </li>
            <li> AFTER 4 DAYS, I STARTED TO GET VERY DRY AND FLAKY,</li>
            <li> It has an unpleasant scent and does not remove makeup easily.</li>
            <li> WITH NO SUCCESS.  </li>
            <li> I use St Ives Apricot Scrub and find it has a soothing smell and texture, but I have to give a thumbs down to the Olive Oil Cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I had hoped this would be an oil cleanser, but it it a typical face wash that one could buy anywhere.</li>
            <li> NEVER EXPERIENCED SUCH A REACTION WITH ANY OTHER PRODUCT I&#x27;VE TRIED.  </li>
            <li> Have already written a few words about St Ives.</li>
            <li> ALMOST RAW AROUND THE CORNERS OF MY NOSE.  </li>
            <li> I use this cleanser from time to time to give my skin a break from the exfoliants I usually use.</li>
            <li> If you want a cleanser that feels like olive oil and dissolves makeup and cleanses, try DHC; St Ives is just soapy and ordinary.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would replace the very expensive DHC deep cleansing oil.  </li>
            <li> It will save on the DHC oil in that way at least!</li>
            <li> Too bad they don&#x27;t sell it in stores.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product makes your face so soft after using it.  Removes make-up completely.  I would recommend this product and I plan on buying it again.</li>
            <li> I love St Ives olive cleanser. It is non-drying, and smells amazing! It has some great natural ingredients in it, and I love that there are no parabens! And how can you beat the price!?!!? St Ives performs just as well as brands that are 5x the price. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser, but of course as soon as I like something, you can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore. It leaves a clean feeling without drying out your skin too much.</li>
            <li> This is great face wash.  The humidity is terrible where I am right now and all my other face washes make my face feel greasy pretty quickly after. This is just fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Too bad they don&#x27;t sell it in stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I heard it was discontinued, so it was a pleasant surprise to find it again!</li>
            <li> I discovered this product 3 months ago at Rite Aid, and felt in love with it since then. I have sensitive combination skin, and tend to be alergic to products with too much chemical.    This product does what it says.  My skin felt really clean, but not dry with this cleanser, and it did not break me out.  I&#x27;m really happy to find this product online because I could not find at the store anymore.  I hope they will continue to sell in online because I will continue purchase.</li>
            <li> I saw this in the store and tried it, I was hooked right away. When I went to buy it again I could not find it in the stores near me. Now I order it here regularly.</li>
            <li> this cleanser is the best ever for dry skin. it smells good too.  i absolutely love it. hope they don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product. It has an unpleasant scent and does not remove makeup easily. I purchased it in hopes of a replacement for the discontinued St. Ives cream cleanser and make up remover. I tried to return it, but iSpotBeauty refused to take it back. I would not repurchase this product or ever buy anything from iSpotBeauty again.</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser from time to time to give my skin a break from the exfoliants I usually use. It leaves my skin feeling clean, soft, and not at all dry. I have oily skin, and this does not exacerbate the problem. Works fabulously for cleaning makeup brushes as well.</li>
            <li> Have already written a few words about St Ives. I use all of their products and do recommend this one as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this on line once before from a company - but for some reason they stopped carrying it.  I went on line once more and found it.  I like it - it cleans really well without drying your skin out.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, so I purchased this with the intention of using this product to clean my make up brushes.  I figured because this product has olive oil in it, it would do a good job of not drying out and would condition the brush hairs as I cleanse them.  It works like a charm.  I think the olive oil also helps dissolve the make up even faster.  It also rinses very clean.  I&#x27;m highly satisfied with this product.  So for those of you who have this product already and aren&#x27;t happy with it, maybe you should try using it on your make up brushes.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on the skin and it leaves your face feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I had hoped this would be an oil cleanser, but it it a typical face wash that one could buy anywhere. It is very gentle and does a good job of removing makeup without drying the skin however. I do think it is overpriced.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I have dry skin and this is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my face. I am so grateful that Amazon carries this because I can&#x27;t find it in any stores. St. Ives products are the best! I love that they are natural and gentle.</li>
            <li> Finally, my face feels clean. I tend to have dry skin and other products seem to leave a film on my face so that it never feels clean. This product is gentle, free of harsh fragrances, and leaves my skin feeling great! A definite winner. I will be a repeat customer for sure.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful facial cleanser.  It always leaves me skin feeling clean and fresh.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t like the pump.  But, the cleanser itself deserves 5.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling very clean.  I am not sure what more to say about  this product except that it is a good value.</li>
            <li> I like this product as it cleanses without drying the skin.  Wish I could buy it locally, but no one carries it anymore, not even the major drugstore and discount chains.</li>
            <li> This is great for my sensitive skin. It removes all of my makeup (including my water resistant mascara)&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this is the only place I can find it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in hopes that it would be similar to DHC Olive Oil Cleanser, but it&#x27;s nothing like it and it doesn&#x27;t smell very good--kind of a sour smell; it&#x27;s not totally offensive, but not pleasing.  I use St Ives Apricot Scrub and find it has a soothing smell and texture, but I have to give a thumbs down to the Olive Oil Cleanser.  If you want a cleanser that feels like olive oil and dissolves makeup and cleanses, try DHC; St Ives is just soapy and ordinary.</li>
            <li> I USE THE OLIVE OIL SCRUB AND LOVE IT.  I&#x27;VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THE OLIVE OIL CLEANSER AT THE LOCAL DRUG STORES FOR SOME TIME WITH NO SUCCESS.  I FINALLY DECIDED TO LOOK ONLINE AND ORDERED FROM AMAZON.  AFTER 4 DAYS, I STARTED TO GET VERY DRY AND FLAKY, ALMOST RAW AROUND THE CORNERS OF MY NOSE.  I ALSO NOTICED A DRY PATCH UNDER MY EYE.  I THOUGHT MAYBE MY SKIN JUST NEEDED TO GET USED TO IT, SO I DECIDED TO ONLY USE IT AT NIGHT INSTEAD OF TWICE A DAY.  MY NOSE GOT BETTER, BUT THEN I STARTED TO GET DRY FLAKY PATCHES NEAR MY TEMPLES.  THAT IS WHEN I DECIDED TO STOP USING IT.  I&#x27;VE NEVER EXPERIENCED SUCH A REACTION WITH ANY OTHER PRODUCT I&#x27;VE TRIED.  I WILL STILL USE THE SCRUB, BUT DECIDED TO GIVE AWAY MY CLEANSER.  MAYBE IT WILL WORK FOR A COUPLE OF MY CO-WORKERS.  JUST WASN&#x27;T FOR ME.</li>
            <li> This is a great makeup remover.  Cleans my face and leaves my skin smooth and not dry.  Especially great in the winter!</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would replace the very expensive DHC deep cleansing oil.  No such luck.  It dries my face out.  But.....it is GREAT for cleaning my makeup brushes, especially the foundation brush.  It will save on the DHC oil in that way at least!</li>
