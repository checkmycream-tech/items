            <li>does moisturize fairly well!</li>
            <li>Which is great if you want to reduce wrinkles.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Intended for men, but great for women -my</li>

            <li>good vendor</li>
            <li>Good job</li>
            <li>This is a certified organic product that your face will love, and it&#x27;s a pleasant change from all the \\&quot;chemically infused\\&quot; products out there created in a \\&quot;lab.\\</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t as effective as this scrub has been for my skin.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and cleans well.  </li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>It contains honey and other naturals that will leave your skin feeling great, and it smells awesome</li>
            <li>Great right before you shave.</li>
            <li>Worth it though love the smell of oranges and honey and leaves my face feeling great.</li>
            <li>Felt more like a soap than a face scrub.</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>This face scrub does not make his already oily skin more oily.  </li>
            <li>I could use a bit more &amp;#34;Grit.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>It does an ok job</li>
            <li>so it may add more oil to people with oily faces.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It is lightly exfoliating, not terribly grainy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it is a great product for daily use, but I&#x27;d like something with a bit more scrub power to it for weekly cleanses.</li>
            <li>But, I a more than willing to put up with the minor inconvenience for the benefits of this great product.</li>
            <li>My mother originally bought me a bottle of this years ago</li>
            <li>This stuff is really wonderful - not too much scrub, nice subtle scent (citrus-y to me).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the among the very best face washes I&#x27;ve ever used including Lancome, Estee Lauder, Clinque, Biotherm, &amp; other high end products.  </li>
            <li>Just wish I had known about Lucky Tiger years ago.  </li>
            <li>lucky tiger</li>
            <li>I like that it has a mild fragrance and results in a mild scrub.</li>
            <li>personal favorite mild scrub with refreshing orange fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used pretty much every face wash you can buy in the drug stores, including the \\&quot;famous</li>
            <li>It is gentle yet removes all traces of makeup easily.  </li>
            <li>Lucky Tiger cleans and refreshes the face, especially before shaving, and its natural ingredients are good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>The first thing that hits you is a powerful smell of orange sherbet.</li>
            <li>The jar is a good size and is barely half gone after two months of use.</li>
            <li>and i always saved the empty bottle because my girlfriend and i loved it so much.</li>
            <li>&quot; but the crystals are very gentle and exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product and the entire lucky tiger line.</li>
            <li>Work it up to a good lather and let it sit on your face for a few seconds before rinsing it off.</li>
            <li>This face scrub is gentle enough to lightly exfoliate but also strong enough to clean and renew any mans face.</li>
            <li>This product is made for the man who wants light facial exfoliation every day, without exacting a toll on their skin.  </li>
            <li>I did not like it that much.</li>
            <li>and this stuff is just too gentle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing</li>
            <li>My \\&quot;ex\\&quot; used to work at a high-end cosmetics counter at a major department store, and one day she brought home some Lucky Tiger products for me.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Lucky Tiger Scrub for several years now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the regular Lucky Tiger Face \\&quot;wash,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot, a pea to penny-size amount will clean your whole face - one bottle usually lasts me months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to a little more gritty felling on my face....</li>
            <li>Originally bought this product for my husband a few years ago &amp; tried it myself.  </li>
            <li>This product is a bit more expensive than others, but a little goes a long way, and as an everyday facial treatment, it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li>Such a high quality product though</li>
            <li>Let me say this, honestly, I&#x27;ve never had a real breakout on my face since using Lucky Tiger face scrub -</li>
            <li>Either way, Lucky Tiger has been around for a long, long time, they know their stuff.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s a natural honey and tea smell, definitely not \\&quot;purfume-y\\&quot;.     </li>
            <li>All natural ingredients listed both on Amazon and on the back of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fine choice if you&#x27;re looking for a face wash that offers a very subtle scrub, as well.</li>

            <li> I did not like it that much. Felt more like a soap than a face scrub. Not sure if i am doing something wrong, or i got a bad batch. The beads are just not there. Not sure how it works. No. 7 is still the best for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Lucky Tiger Scrub for several years now. My \\&quot;ex\\&quot; used to work at a high-end cosmetics counter at a major department store, and one day she brought home some Lucky Tiger products for me.    Before, I had moderate acne on my cheeks. Usually, I had monthly breakouts in my \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone with generally oily skin that even resulted in blackheads on my nose. I&#x27;ve used pretty much every face wash you can buy in the drug stores, including the \\&quot;famous one\\&quot; from t.v. commercials. Let me say this, honestly, I&#x27;ve never had a real breakout on my face since using Lucky Tiger face scrub - I still get the occasional pimple, but nothing like it used to be.     This is a certified organic product that your face will love, and it&#x27;s a pleasant change from all the \\&quot;chemically infused\\&quot; products out there created in a \\&quot;lab.\\&quot; It&#x27;s called a \\&quot;scrub,\\&quot; but the crystals are very gentle and exfoliating. They will not scratch your skin, but they will reduce your pore size, including removing black heads. It contains honey and other naturals that will leave your skin feeling great, and it smells awesome - it&#x27;s a natural honey and tea smell, definitely not \\&quot;purfume-y\\&quot;.     My advice is to try this product! You won&#x27;t be disappointed, remember, you get what you pay for. I&#x27;ve tried the regular Lucky Tiger Face \\&quot;wash,\\&quot; but it wasn&#x27;t as effective as this scrub has been for my skin. Either way, Lucky Tiger has been around for a long, long time, they know their stuff. It&#x27;s so good, I often catch my \\&quot;new\\&quot; girl using it for her face in the shower. You don&#x27;t need a lot, a pea to penny-size amount will clean your whole face - one bottle usually lasts me months. Work it up to a good lather and let it sit on your face for a few seconds before rinsing it off. Good luck!</li>
            <li> This product is made for the man who wants light facial exfoliation every day, without exacting a toll on their skin.  Lucky Tiger cleans and refreshes the face, especially before shaving, and its natural ingredients are good for your skin.  This product is a bit more expensive than others, but a little goes a long way, and as an everyday facial treatment, it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  It smells nice and cleans well.  Just wish I had known about Lucky Tiger years ago.  The bottle is sort of old-school.  It would be more convenient to use in the shower if it had a different top (the small threaded cap can be a little difficult to open\close with wet hands (and when I am still half asleep).  But, I a more than willing to put up with the minor inconvenience for the benefits of this great product.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this before he shaves in the shower about twice a week and loves it.  This face scrub does not make his already oily skin more oily.  The jar is a good size and is barely half gone after two months of use.</li>
            <li> It is lightly exfoliating, not terribly grainy. It does help remove some dead skin cells and such, but not aggressive enough for me. I could use a bit more &amp;#34;Grit.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;This does moisturize fairly well! It seems as if to &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; my skin tighter too. Which is great if you want to reduce wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a great product for daily use, but I&#x27;d like something with a bit more scrub power to it for weekly cleanses.</li>
            <li> Originally bought this product for my husband a few years ago &amp; tried it myself.

            <li> I&#x27;m used to a little more gritty felling on my face....but it smells great and feels like it gets the job done......a little goes a long way....</li>
            <li> Nice product. Tried it and noticed small changes in pore size after first use. I will continue to use this as it does everything it claims to.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product and the entire lucky tiger line. This face scrub is gentle enough to lightly exfoliate but also strong enough to clean and renew any mans face. Great right before you shave.</li>
            <li> Great product. good vendor</li>
            <li> The first thing that hits you is a powerful smell of orange sherbet. It does an ok job but this isn&#x27;t the cleaner for my face. I have normal/oily skin and this stuff is just too gentle. Almost zero lather. Basically it works like a facial cleanser that costs about $3 not $10. Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling, feeling, not too abrasive face scrub I have used yet to this day.  This stuff smells like fresh air mixed with sweetened cold green tea in a cup.  All natural ingredients listed both on Amazon and on the back of the bottle.  The only thing I am concerned about it actually how moisturizing this bugger is!!  It&#x27;s very moisturizing so it may add more oil to people with oily faces.  Such a high quality product though and this stuff lasts FOREVER.  you only need a less than a dime size amount.  Good job lucky tiger I will definitely buy from you again.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I use it everyday.  I like that it has a mild fragrance and results in a mild scrub.</li>
            <li> My mother originally bought me a bottle of this years ago and i always saved the empty bottle because my girlfriend and i loved it so much. Couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere so finally went online and bought it. A little expensive at least compared to what i&#x27;m used to paying for face wash which is like 4.00. Worth it though love the smell of oranges and honey and leaves my face feeling great.</li>
            <li> Intended for men, but great for women -my personal favorite mild scrub with refreshing orange fragrance.</li>
            <li> Only thing special about this is the nostalgic style packaging. Overpriced, mediocre function, and off putting fragrance.</li>
