    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for what I needed.</li>
            <li>The best thing about it is its size and shape.</li>
            <li>I find it particularly perfect for keeping on my bedside table.</li>
            <li>I think its great for that use but not for what I need so great product</li>
            <li>I would have otherwise been happy with the product.</li>
            <li>(also I will give a shout out for Dragon Software that allows me to type this review LOL).  </li>
            <li>If it was stronger it would be great.</li>
            <li>Might be good for folks who take vitamins.</li>
            <li>I still have 10 pills more to go!</li>
            <li>this is nice to always have with me in my purse and keep track of days I may have forgotten.  </li>
            <li>I like the color and shape is nice...</li>
            <li>This is a nice pill container, if one of the flips didn&#x27;t break off before I used it.  </li>
            <li>Handy pillbox for my daughter.......</li>
            <li>Exactly what i was looking for and is a great product.</li>
            <li>This is very cheaply made</li>
            <li>I wanted it for vitamins and it won&#x27;t hold more than a couple per day of those.  </li>
            <li>If you need to take a lot of pills daily, I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend this one, but for just a couple a day - its perfect!  </li>
            <li>A LOT more than 3 times...</li>
            <li>The perfect size for my daily meds.</li>
            <li>I would like to see the labels (days of the week) more.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just that I did not read into the size more.  </li>
            <li>but I should have read more ont he size.</li>
            <li>Wish it was more sturdy</li>
            <li>I would recommend carrying it in a separate inside pocket of a bag to keep it even more protected.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s kind of cheaply made.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll get twice the mileage out of yours! :)</li>
            <li>I love the look of this pill case.  </li>
            <li>With this in mind I have too many pills, too many doses to use the mainstream seven-day dispenser.  </li>
            <li>Plus, that means I am able to throw it in a suitcase when I travel without having to worry about it opening up and spilling.</li>
            <li>Top pops off for easy filling.</li>
            <li>Honestly when I purchased this I didn&#x27;t pay close attention to the size and thought it was cute and would work since it had the right number of slots.  </li>
            <li>My AM and PM doses do contain more pills than my other med times and pills so that was perfect.</li>
            <li>and it snapped right off!!  </li>
            <li>This item is easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>It fits in a bag or briefcase quite easily and does not take up a lot of space.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can fit a good number of them in the \\&quot;extras\\&quot; container, which I find very</li>
            <li>Perfect for travel  and everyday use.</li>
            <li>I bought this for the compact shape, and my pills do fit, but not all of the compartments close snugly.</li>
            <li>Nice looking but does not hold much.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean</li>
            <li>I have no idea how you could fit anything else in this</li>
            <li>I wish quality was a little higher because the design of this case is perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li>- I love my turtle so much, I just ordered</li>
            <li>and then the room is full and</li>
            <li>This item arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>However, the first time I opened it to use it, two of the flaps broke clean off.  </li>
            <li>The compartments hold a good number of pills, but if you take a lot of large size pills you will need something bigger.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want an old grandma looking one, so I was happy to find a cute little purse sized pill case.  </li>
            <li>But at this price, it&#x27;s well worth the couple dollars</li>
            <li>I have absolutely no trouble fitting my pills in the compartments</li>
            <li>(the lid piece can pop off all together if you open all eight of the tabs), easy to see if she&#x27;s taken her pills at a glance through the lid, and easy for travel.  </li>
            <li>Broke right out of the package.</li>
            <li>Nice but some of the sections are small and can&#x27;t hold many pills.</li>
            <li>It is a great size for someone who only takes a couple of pill daily and the extra storage compartment is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>3 of the lids snapped off the first time I opened them to put my vitamins in it.  </li>
            <li>Only two pills barely fit!</li>
            <li>one of them broke the first time I opened it.</li>
            <li>They should not only emboss the days but also mark them better</li>
            <li>The weekly pill turtle was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>Holds up pretty well in the bag I carry it in every day.</li>
            <li>One of the compartment doors broke off on this the first day I used it.</li>
            <li>broke first time i opend it</li>
            <li>just the right size and so much more convenient than the long pill holders.  </li>
            <li>It seems well made with positive latching on the covers.</li>
            <li>Seems like a good idea, but you can&#x27;t actually get all of the tabs open at the same time (and to open more than one at a time, they don&#x27;t open very far), making it kind of a pain to fill.</li>
            <li>My wife and I were in a car accident a year ago, from which I&#x27;ve largely recovered, and she hasn&#x27;t quite yet.  </li>
            <li>a new one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just the right size to use in the home, and when you&#x27;re traveling, it travels well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I was looking for another, but the actual pill container is fine</li>
            <li>I am not quite ready to carry around a large rectangular tackle box with the days of the week laid out on it, so I tried the Turtle.</li>
            <li>She expected it would hold MORE pills than what she was using.    </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I can set up everything for the whole week.  </li>
            <li>I hoped for purple, but the green kind of looks like a turtle</li>
            <li>I love that the days of the week are labelled, but not in such an obvious way.  </li>
            <li>I like this pill planner mainly for it&#x27;s shape.</li>
            <li>only reason I cannot give it more stars is because one of the closures snapped off after only 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>this is an OK little pill container.  </li>
            <li>purchased the item and when it arrived I was able to use a sharpie marker to label each little lid per med/dose.  </li>
            <li>I am having a hard time remembering whether I took my prenatal vitamins or not, so I decided to get a handy pill box to help me keep track.  </li>
            <li>so if you take more, might not fit in all slots.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a younger person that has to take important medications daily</li>
            <li>So if you are taking pills larger than a Bayer baby aspirin, expect to only be able to put about five pills in each of the smaller compartments.</li>
            <li>the material (plastic) had degraded and both of the pill cases had flaps that broke off the first or second time I tried to get my pills.</li>
            <li>and I wish there were more negative reviews about it to help weigh the actual worth of purchasing.</li>
            <li>and I begin that night with that first PM bin (there is a second bin for meds</li>
            <li>I am sure someone else can use this, as its not worth sending back, but its not meeting my need.</li>
            <li>I only take 1 large pill a day</li>
            <li>She was very upset to discover that while the end compartments and the middle side compartments held all her pills,</li>
            <li>This product completely meets my need for size and portability.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We load up the dispenser early evening at the end of each day</li>
            <li>my vitamins don&#x27;t fit in the slot for everyday.  </li>
            <li>Well, as I most likely will be forced to give out a little more personal info about myself than I would like...</li>
            <li>Her memory is pretty touch-and-go, so getting this pill holder really helps since she often worried she was either skipping or double dosing due to the traumatic brain injury&#x27;s affect on her memory.  </li>
            <li>The lid does stay on when closed due to the way it was designed but every time I open it I need to be sure to not drop the piece.  </li>
            <li>A positive point is it is smaller then the long weekly med holder, which makes taking it on the go easier.</li>
            <li>The photo makes it look like it has lots of space inside, but the space for pills is actually quite small--only enough room for a couple of medium sized pills or only 1 large fish oil capsule.</li>
            <li>Overall I like it well enough to give it a fair trial, and hopefully I am wrong about the hinges.</li>
            <li>and when I wake we begin at the first AM bin and work our way down until we do it</li>
            <li>So you can either slip in your pills through the little opening you can get, or try to open it further and risk breaking the tab right off.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to carry a large heavy purse</li>
            <li>Also, the little lids are very flimsy...</li>

            <li> Also, the little lids are very flimsy...</li>
            <li> It maybe like that brand new pair of sneakers--to firm at first but after quite a few wears its smoother.  </li>
            <li> each slot is big enough for my giant horse pills, and there&#x27;s an extra container for storage that I can use for some tylenol, tums, or other things I may want to keep in there.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t open all the little compartments at once to see the whole week at a glance like I can with other 7 compartment pill boxes.</li>
            <li> But the compartments are too small for even fairly normal sized capsules; I don&#x27;t feel like it holds enough, so I will be filling it a lot.</li>
            <li> you can use this product and the single bins for daily doses of meds</li>
            <li> That would concern me if I had it filled with expensive prescriptions.</li>
            <li> Every once and a while, some of the tops will open, but not very often.</li>
            <li> It came in blue, and has held up extremely well.</li>
            <li> When you lift one of the tabs, it will only open up a little bit for you.</li>
            <li> When I saw this pill dispenser that had 8 bins and the two on the ends were larger bins than the other</li>
            <li> First, Saturday&#x27;s lid broke upon opening and second, you can only open one at a time which makes it difficult to load it up for the week!</li>
            <li> I need something that holds about 5 big pills per day and this will hold numerous SMALL pills.  </li>

            <li> Holds all my pills for the day and stays securely closed while being tossed around in my purse.</li>
            <li> Also, there are no real hinges on the compartments, so you are just repeatedly bending the plastic</li>
            <li> It is not very pliable.</li>
            <li> I suppose that&#x27;s to be expected with something that&#x27;s plastic</li>

            <li> for everyday... nah.</li>
            <li> It may not fit everyone&#x27;s needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Overall, the case is durable and well made. Fits the purpose I wanted it for. Perfect for travel  and everyday use.</li>
            <li> I can not believe what a piece of junk this item is! First, Saturday&#x27;s lid broke upon opening and second, you can only open one at a time which makes it difficult to load it up for the week!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a younger person that has to take important medications daily this is nice to always have with me in my purse and keep track of days I may have forgotten.  It&#x27;s small enough to be somewhat discreet and seals well.  I have no fear of it spilling all over the inside of my bag.</li>
            <li> Honestly when I purchased this I didn&#x27;t pay close attention to the size and thought it was cute and would work since it had the right number of slots.  It was way to small to hold all the vitamins I take each day and half the slots the Omega 3 barley fits in.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the compact shape, and my pills do fit, but not all of the compartments close snugly. One of the larger end compartments (Th), won&#x27;t latch shut. Some of the other latches seem a bit questionable, too. Just doesn&#x27;t seem well made.</li>
            <li> 3 of the lids snapped off the first time I opened them to put my vitamins in it.  Garbage.  Don&#x27;t bother buying this one.</li>
            <li> I could just kick myself for not believing the other reviews. This is SO small. All I needed it for was a multivitamin, calcium and omega 3. Only two pills barely fit! Ridiculous and useless. Put your money into another product that will actually hold pills.</li>
            <li> This is very small.  I wanted it for vitamins and it won&#x27;t hold more than a couple per day of those.  Also, the little lids are very flimsy... one of them broke the first time I opened it.</li>
            <li> I am having a hard time remembering whether I took my prenatal vitamins or not, so I decided to get a handy pill box to help me keep track.  I didn&#x27;t want an old grandma looking one, so I was happy to find a cute little purse sized pill case.  I love that the days of the week are labelled, but not in such an obvious way.  each slot is big enough for my giant horse pills, and there&#x27;s an extra container for storage that I can use for some tylenol, tums, or other things I may want to keep in there.  If you need to take a lot of pills daily, I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend this one, but for just a couple a day - its perfect!  I haven&#x27;t missed a vitamin this week!</li>
            <li> Broke right out of the package. And lids don&#x27;t stay closed in the ones that weren&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> Nice looking but does not hold much.</li>
            <li> I like the color and shape is nice...however, I went to open one of the compartments - it MAY have been like the 3rd time I opened and shut it and it snapped right off!!  My other pill container has a little zipper case around it which is worn so I was looking for another, but the actual pill container is fine and I&#x27;ve had it for almost 2 Years!  I can guarantee that I&#x27;ve opened and closed each divider A LOT more than 3 times...this was ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase. It came in blue, and has held up extremely well. The perfect size for my daily meds.</li>
            <li> i have quite a few different pill boxes and this is VERY tough to use...maybe I need to break it in; it&#x27;s very tough to use!!  It maybe like that brand new pair of sneakers--to firm at first but after quite a few wears its smoother.  I have tried to reach in to pull the pills out and sliced (like a paper cut) my fingers, so my suggestion DONT put your fingers in; dump the pills instead!  I am a purple lover and this was why I went for this, however eh it&#x27;s not really being used because of the roughness.</li>
            <li> After using a standard 7 day pill container with the days all in a row, I prefer this one for it&#x27;s compact shape.  The Turtle fits my palm while I access a compartment with the other.  The two end compartments are larger than standard and the side ones only slightly smaller than standard ones. It seems well made with positive latching on the covers.</li>
            <li> I would like to see the labels (days of the week) more. They should not only emboss the days but also mark them better</li>
            <li> My wife takes 8 pills a day - 2 large (horse-pills) and 6 small to very small. She&#x27;s been looking for a new, round pill minder for about 3 months!!    She was very upset to discover that while the end compartments and the middle side compartments held all her pills, the \\&quot;around-the-edges\\&quot; compartments do not! And since these are for Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday, she was very disappointed with this product. She expected it would hold MORE pills than what she was using.    So if you are taking pills larger than a Bayer baby aspirin, expect to only be able to put about five pills in each of the smaller compartments.</li>
            <li> The weekly pill turtle was exactly what I wanted so I order two but the material (plastic) had degraded and both of the pill cases had flaps that broke off the first or second time I tried to get my pills. Very disappointing since the one I was trying to replace had lasted for years before one of the flaps broke!</li>
            <li> It is much smaller than it appears in photo.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with this product it&#x27;s just that I did not read into the size more.  I need something that holds about 5 big pills per day and this will hold numerous SMALL pills.  I think its great for that use but not for what I need so great product but I should have read more ont he size.</li>
            <li> One flap broke off in less than a week. Not a very good quality product. Wish it was more sturdy</li>
            <li> This product completely meets my need for size and portability.  However, the first time I opened it to use it, two of the flaps broke clean off.  This is very cheaply made and I wish there were more negative reviews about it to help weigh the actual worth of purchasing.</li>
            <li> Holds all my pills for the day and stays securely closed while being tossed around in my purse.</li>
            <li> Holds up pretty well in the bag I carry it in every day. Every once and a while, some of the tops will open, but not very often. I would recommend carrying it in a separate inside pocket of a bag to keep it even more protected. I still recommend; it helps me keep track of my medication and it takes up less space than a linear pill case.</li>
            <li> The picture shows multiple pills, but in reality the container hold 3-4 pills. Might be good for folks who take vitamins.</li>
            <li> I am not quite ready to carry around a large rectangular tackle box with the days of the week laid out on it, so I tried the Turtle. I like the overall size; it can be carried around discretely and allows you to separate pills. But the compartments are too small for even fairly normal sized capsules; I don&#x27;t feel like it holds enough, so I will be filling it a lot. Also, there are no real hinges on the compartments, so you are just repeatedly bending the plastic and we all know what is going to happen. That would concern me if I had it filled with expensive prescriptions. Overall I like it well enough to give it a fair trial, and hopefully I am wrong about the hinges.</li>
            <li> Returned this item.  The photo makes it look like it has lots of space inside, but the space for pills is actually quite small--only enough room for a couple of medium sized pills or only 1 large fish oil capsule. The underside is hollow--so upside down, it looks like a donut.</li>
            <li> One of the compartment doors broke off on this the first day I used it.</li>
            <li> this is an OK little pill container.  however it is hard to fill.  the openings do not open well when you are refilling it and need them all open at the same time.</li>
            <li> broke first time i opend it buyer beware</li>
            <li> I like this pill planner mainly for it&#x27;s shape. It&#x27;s small enough that I can just stick it in my purse. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s kind of cheaply made. When you lift one of the tabs, it will only open up a little bit for you. You can&#x27;t force it open any further because the tab will just break off, which is what happened to me. The plastic \\&quot;hinge\\&quot; of the tab is just a stiff piece of plastic. It is not very pliable. So you can either slip in your pills through the little opening you can get, or try to open it further and risk breaking the tab right off. I would have otherwise been happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This item arrived quickly. This item is easy to travel with. Exactly what i was looking for and is a great product.</li>
            <li> My wife and I were in a car accident a year ago, from which I&#x27;ve largely recovered, and she hasn&#x27;t quite yet.  Her memory is pretty touch-and-go, so getting this pill holder really helps since she often worried she was either skipping or double dosing due to the traumatic brain injury&#x27;s affect on her memory.  Easy to clean (the lid piece can pop off all together if you open all eight of the tabs), easy to see if she&#x27;s taken her pills at a glance through the lid, and easy for travel.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item on 12/03/2011. Today, one of the tabs broke off. I suppose that&#x27;s to be expected with something that&#x27;s plastic you keep bending back-and-forth as a hinge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But - I love my turtle so much, I just ordered a new one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just the right size to use in the home, and when you&#x27;re traveling, it travels well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product. I&#x27;d probably recommend it if it only lasted one year! But it did last a year and a half for me. And I could keep using it by taping Tuesday (the labeled day that broke). But at this price, it&#x27;s well worth the couple dollars a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use mine twice daily. Every labeled day is opened twice a day, with an extra opening every Sunday when I refill the wells. So if you only use every labeled day once a day, (scratches head) you&#x27;ll get twice the mileage out of yours! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it interests you, get it. There&#x27;s no way you could be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like this pill box, I like that it is not as long as your typical box.  I only take 1 large pill a day so if you take more, might not fit in all slots.</li>
            <li> I love the look of this pill case.  It is a great size for someone who only takes a couple of pill daily and the extra storage compartment is a nice feature.  It fits in a bag or briefcase quite easily and does not take up a lot of space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I cannot give it more stars is because one of the closures snapped off after only 2 weeks.  Now my Tuesday section is not secure.  The lid does stay on when closed due to the way it was designed but every time I open it I need to be sure to not drop the piece.  I wish quality was a little higher because the design of this case is perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> A little difficult to load with meds. A positive point is it is smaller then the long weekly med holder, which makes taking it on the go easier. Fits into one of my smaller purses so I don&#x27;t have to carry a large heavy purse</li>
            <li> just the right size and so much more convenient than the long pill holders.  The compartments hold a good number of pills, but if you take a lot of large size pills you will need something bigger.  Top pops off for easy filling.</li>
            <li> Does the job. I hoped for purple, but the green kind of looks like a turtle so I don&#x27;t hate it.</li>
            <li> Lost my Apothecary 7-sided pill organizers on vacation.  Bought this turtle thing as a replacement.  Very disappointed.  Difficult to open &amp; close.  Can&#x27;t open all the little compartments at once to see the whole week at a glance like I can with other 7 compartment pill boxes. Also this one will not stand on end in the medicine cabinet like the Apothecary 7 sided pill box. The turtle can&#x27;t compare to the 7 sided Apothecary pill organizers for quality, convenience &amp; ease of use.</li>
            <li> Seems like a good idea, but you can&#x27;t actually get all of the tabs open at the same time (and to open more than one at a time, they don&#x27;t open very far), making it kind of a pain to fill. They are also are hard to close tightly.</li>
            <li> Well, as I most likely will be forced to give out a little more personal info about myself than I would like... please note it will be in order to explain my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fully disabled: hospital bed or electric wheelchair only (also I will give a shout out for Dragon Software that allows me to type this review LOL).  With this in mind I have too many pills, too many doses to use the mainstream seven-day dispenser.  When I saw this pill dispenser that had 8 bins and the two on the ends were larger bins than the other, I knew I had finally found something I could use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the item and when it arrived I was able to use a sharpie marker to label each little lid per med/dose.  My AM and PM doses do contain more pills than my other med times and pills so that was perfect. Then I have meds that are PRN. Meds I take through-out the day, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure- you can use this product and the single bins for daily doses of meds but if you are someone (like me) that has to maintain a larger number of pill count and multiple times for doses PER day this is also perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We load up the dispenser early evening at the end of each day and I begin that night with that first PM bin (there is a second bin for meds I take just before sleep) and when I wake we begin at the first AM bin and work our way down until we do it all over again that evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review?  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The sections are different sizes. It&#x27;s difficult to close and open sections and they don&#x27;t stay well open for refilling. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a nice pill container, if one of the flips didn&#x27;t break off before I used it.  If it was stronger it would be great.</li>
            <li> If you take big pills (ie... Fish oil) this is not for you. I have taken prenatal pills, on several occasions (I have three children, lost three others) I have no idea how you could fit anything else in this if those are what you are taking! The two end compartments are bigger, but still not enough to hold my pills... 2 fish oil, two multi vit, 1 B complex and then the room is full and that is only the two end sections that are bigger. I still have 10 pills more to go! It will work for keeping some of my kids vitamins and perhaps a few pills to throw in my bag for work in case a shift goes long and I won&#x27;t be home (that happens a lot with me) but for everyday... nah. At least I didn&#x27;t blow a lot of $$$ on it.</li>
            <li> So I chose this pill box because it was purple.  I received a blue one.  Upon further inspection, it states assorted colors.&lt;br /&gt;Every weekly day compartment is a different size, so my vitamins don&#x27;t fit in the slot for everyday.  There is an additional compartment labeled storage, so until I order something else, I will use that to hold additional pills.  summary:  I am sure someone else can use this, as its not worth sending back, but its not meeting my need.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for what I needed. It may not fit everyone&#x27;s needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted something that could help me keep track of whether I had taken my pills or not each morning. I take three pills, two of which are small and one is medium sized. I have absolutely no trouble fitting my pills in the compartments and I can fit a good number of them in the \\&quot;extras\\&quot; container, which I find very handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The doors are not the easiest to open and close, but I haven&#x27;t had any break off yet (been using it for a few months) and I don&#x27;t find it to be a problem. Plus, that means I am able to throw it in a suitcase when I travel without having to worry about it opening up and spilling. The best thing about it is its size and shape. I find it particularly perfect for keeping on my bedside table.</li>
            <li> Handy pillbox for my daughter.......I can set up everything for the whole week.  Recommend this to anyone looking for a weekly-type pillbox</li>
            <li> Nice but some of the sections are small and can&#x27;t hold many pills.</li>
