            <li>They look okay.</li>
            <li>the pic shows they are more of a blunt rounded cut..</li>
            <li>i love this eyelashes</li>
            <li>you would think that at a cheap price you would get a cheap product but these are actually really good for being synthetic, theyre not shiny</li>

            <li>The lashes were ok for the price.</li>

            <li>And it&#x27;s almost like the more</li>
            <li>you use them, the better they bend and form to your eye (probably from all the glue, haha).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these eyelashes</li>
            <li>youre completely satisfied with</li>
            <li>When I got them on I fell in love</li>
            <li>so it isn&#x27;t a big shock that they aren&#x27;t the best quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered many \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; falsies available on Amazon and these are my favorites!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>But might be ok if your just practicing.</li>
            <li>i love these eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>but if you like that look then these would be great specially with the price and quick service.</li>
            <li>They were exactly as they were represented to be!!!</li>
            <li>I bought these for photoshoots and special events, but they&#x27;re so nice</li>
            <li>Only took a week to get here, price is cheap and these are just really great!</li>
            <li>These are very nice looking and the hairs are very soft.  </li>
            <li>these lashes are great so far.</li>
            <li>THEY ARE REAL LOOK GOOD</li>
            <li>They need to be trimmed down a bit, but that is perfect so it can fit any eye!</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and brightened up my face.</li>
            <li>And they don&#x27;t easily stay on.</li>
            <li>They were easy to put on</li>
            <li>could easily wear these to a party, or going out with your friends..</li>
            <li>I was satisfied 100 percent with the description and item, also the shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>If something is cheap cheap cheap theire is a reason..</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap but get the job done.</li>
            <li>it was cheap...</li>
            <li>Cheap material .&lt;br</li>
            <li>the eyelashes are extremely cheap quality.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t curve to fit ur eye. ....</li>
            <li>plus they were really really cheap.</li>
            <li>I gave these to a 14 year old who loved them..</li>
            <li>, THESE ARE NOT THIN AND WISPY!!!</li>
            <li>At first I thought I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use them.</li>
            <li>These eyelashes are really good for the price, especially if your like me who wears eyelashes daily, it&#x27;s a great dupe.</li>
            <li>They accentuate my eyes, and they are fun!</li>
            <li>Very unnatural, glad they were so cheap bc</li>
            <li>and so they stand our very well with my eyes, they dont look halloweenish at all on me because they fit my eyes well!</li>
            <li>The only thing these will be good for is if you need practice applying eyelashes</li>
            <li>I think you kind of need to have naturally long eye lashes to make the transition smooth though.</li>
            <li>Way too long for me, I can&#x27;t use them simply not the best.</li>
            <li>They are easy to apply and the shippment came fast.</li>
            <li>say if you know how to put on lashes then you won&#x27;t have any problem there not for the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; girls I bought bundles of lashes why because they&#x27;re cheap good for everyday and durable for cleaning ...</li>
            <li>not even worth trying..</li>
            <li>like for my lashes to look more natural</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>These are fun.</li>
            <li>No these lashes dont look right on everyone but that doesnt make them halloween lashes</li>
            <li>they stayed on for 2 days on me because of the way i applied them they never came undone from the corners because i applied them right</li>
            <li>They blame on shipment if they pack it the right way it won&#x27;t be damage</li>
            <li>These lashes were great for them to be my first try lashes, not cheap feeling at all...</li>
            <li>Only reason i gave it 4 stars was because it would of been better if it came with an eyelash glue but other than that i love these:)</li>
            <li>Shipping time was surprisingly fast as well, being that they are coming the whole way from Hong Kong!!</li>
            <li>These eye lashes looked great in the box but were hard to put on</li>
            <li>Bulky, longer in the middle that reaches the top of eyebrow.</li>
            <li>will definitely order more...</li>
            <li>i got them the next day i love how they look</li>
            <li>Advertised better than they actually look.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that they are a lot of them and you do not have to reuse them over and over again, but they are not human lashes</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll definitely buy more</li>
            <li>When I first bought these lashes</li>
            <li>Did not received as exact picture requested.</li>
            <li>First I had to wait weeks which is understandable because of the location</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an actress/model and I love these I have worn the same pair for 3 days now!</li>
            <li>Also, the shape of the lashes that I received is not the same as in the picture (they are shorter on both sides and longer in the middle), but they look gorgeous, so I did not mind.</li>
            <li>The eylelashes don&#x27;t look very realistic.</li>
            <li>Although, this lash is beautiful for a everyday elegant, subtle look.</li>
            <li>You can even wear them more then once if you are careful with each pair.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t really like the lashes.</li>
            <li>I really like the lashes...</li>
            <li>a whole star just doesn&#x27;t cut it for the company...</li>
            <li>they came fast</li>
            <li>stick on very well</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>they didn&#x27;t stay on very well</li>
            <li>I really like using these lashes.  </li>
            <li>I really like the produt , but some lashes come with manufacturing defects.</li>
            <li>it just was straight.</li>
            <li>When I first received them I did think wow</li>
            <li>creating  a new order as we speak!</li>
            <li>These are definitely fake eyelashes and are NOT for daily, daytime wear---they will be great for going out at night!</li>
            <li>If the had several different styles it may have been better</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only downer, but other than that I love them and the price they cost!</li>
            <li>The package was damaged when I received it, a little long for my eyelids, easy to adjust, have to be very careful if I want to clean and reuse them because they fall apart very easily</li>
            <li>Be sure long and thick lashes compliment you before ordering them though and ladies please make sure</li>
            <li>Highly recommened.  </li>
            <li>Spend a little more and be happier.</li>
            <li>So... Spend a little more and b happier...</li>
            <li>so they were kind of hard to put on</li>
            <li>They are super long and they feel like plastic.</li>
            <li>The picture I believe is decieving and the actual lashes are a lot fuller and a lot thicker and longer and feel heavy, making them more appropriate for drag queens.</li>
            <li>I live in montclair ca</li>
            <li>The shipping time wasn&#x27;t too bad, if anything you&#x27;ll forget you ordered them and then find a nice surprise in your mailbox one day :)</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good for make up artists who are looking for dramatic look.</li>
            <li>But falsies shouldn&#x27;t look natural in my opinion!</li>
            <li>I know my eyeliner will hide them, but I do not understand why the band is white in the first place.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re long but give such a bold but sultry look all in one!</li>
            <li>I use black eyeliner when I use it so it all blends together!! :)</li>
            <li>These are just fabulous and last a long time.</li>
            <li>I have ordered these several times now, like a previous poster said, they dont compliment everyone though so if you want more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; looking eyelashes then these probably arent for you.</li>
            <li>If u want natural looking lashes..</li>
            <li>However, theyvr on a string that can be stuff and doesnt bend naturally...</li>
            <li>and I just now read all reviews and was wondering when people got them near me?</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t natural looking at all if that&#x27;s what youre going for</li>
            <li>If they wanted natural eyelashes</li>
            <li>The lashes reminded me of the eyelashes on the dolls I had when I was a young girl.</li>
            <li>I tried them on and they did not look natural at all.</li>
            <li>Are they natural looking?</li>
            <li>I would have never wasted my time.</li>
            <li>I do like them, but they&#x27;re a bit too loud for me to wear to a place like work or a meeting.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>However, if thick dramatic eyelashes are what your looking for, these are great!</li>
            <li>saves me from buying every other week and guess what it did you can reuse these things and people who say these suck its cuz people your not applying them right</li>
            <li>I got these thinking that they would be a little fuller than the lashes I currently wear as a daily favorite.</li>
            <li>Although they looked very nice from afar they were extremely uncomfortable to use!</li>
            <li>They did not really look exactly like the picture of the lashes provided.</li>
            <li>To achieve a more natural look, go for the individual lashes that you can place as thickly as you please.</li>
            <li>These will be nice for a silly, unexpected gift at Christmas.</li>
            <li>If you are going for a gorgeous fake eyelashes look, then you simply can&#x27;t beat the value of these.</li>
            <li>They are attached to a thick band, but I think that is what helped them stay on all night and made it easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I had to trim them as I do with any other lashes I buy anyway &amp; in order for these to work you really have to know how to apply lashes!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy false eyelashes, and purchased these mainly because of the number of pairs and the dollar amount.</li>
            <li>ok, for one, the shipping was VERY slow...</li>
            <li>like this lashes because they are as long as my natural lashes and look natural on me.</li>
            <li>you have to cut them to fit your own eye, the band in which the lashes are attached is really thick and heavy and hard to wear on ur eyes.</li>
            <li>These Eyelashes are very dense, hard to move to the shape you want and the band is very thick.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>If you want something that is dramatic, sure I suppose.</li>
            <li>Not even worth the trouble sending it back!</li>
            <li>the lash line is really really thin and its in a straight line ... its kind of hard for me since im a begginer</li>
            <li>I did not have high expectations for the product quality due to the price but what I received did not resembel the picture at all.</li>
            <li>they are super thick and they dont stick on correctly</li>
            <li>I was curious about things from Hong Kong, China but decided to take a chance, I was very surprised...</li>

            <li> youre completely satisfied with</li>
            <li> When I got them on I fell in love</li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t a big shock that they aren&#x27;t the best quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered many \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; falsies available on Amazon and these are my favorites!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> But might be ok if your just practicing.</li>
            <li> i love these eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> but if you like that look then these would be great specially with the price and quick service.</li>
            <li> They were exactly as they were represented to be!!!</li>
            <li> I bought these for photoshoots and special events, but they&#x27;re so nice</li>
            <li> Only took a week to get here, price is cheap and these are just really great!</li>
            <li> These are very nice looking and the hairs are very soft.  </li>
            <li> these lashes are great so far.</li>
            <li> THEY ARE REAL LOOK GOOD</li>
            <li> They need to be trimmed down a bit, but that is perfect so it can fit any eye!</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and brightened up my face.</li>
            <li> And they don&#x27;t easily stay on.</li>
            <li> They were easy to put on</li>
            <li> could easily wear these to a party, or going out with your friends..</li>
            <li> I was satisfied 100 percent with the description and item, also the shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> If something is cheap cheap cheap theire is a reason..</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheap but get the job done.</li>
            <li> it was cheap...</li>
            <li> Cheap material .&lt;br</li>
            <li> the eyelashes are extremely cheap quality.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t curve to fit ur eye. ....</li>
            <li> plus they were really really cheap.</li>
            <li> I gave these to a 14 year old who loved them..</li>
            <li> , THESE ARE NOT THIN AND WISPY!!!</li>
            <li> At first I thought I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use them.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are really good for the price, especially if your like me who wears eyelashes daily, it&#x27;s a great dupe.</li>
            <li> They accentuate my eyes, and they are fun!</li>
            <li> Very unnatural, glad they were so cheap bc</li>
            <li> and so they stand our very well with my eyes, they dont look halloweenish at all on me because they fit my eyes well!</li>
            <li> The only thing these will be good for is if you need practice applying eyelashes</li>
            <li> I think you kind of need to have naturally long eye lashes to make the transition smooth though.</li>
            <li> Way too long for me, I can&#x27;t use them simply not the best.</li>
            <li> They are easy to apply and the shippment came fast.</li>
            <li> say if you know how to put on lashes then you won&#x27;t have any problem there not for the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; girls I bought bundles of lashes why because they&#x27;re cheap good for everyday and durable for cleaning ...</li>
            <li> not even worth trying..</li>
            <li> like for my lashes to look more natural</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> These are fun.</li>
            <li> No these lashes dont look right on everyone but that doesnt make them halloween lashes</li>
            <li> they stayed on for 2 days on me because of the way i applied them they never came undone from the corners because i applied them right</li>
            <li> They blame on shipment if they pack it the right way it won&#x27;t be damage</li>
            <li> These lashes were great for them to be my first try lashes, not cheap feeling at all...</li>
            <li> Only reason i gave it 4 stars was because it would of been better if it came with an eyelash glue but other than that i love these:)</li>
            <li> Shipping time was surprisingly fast as well, being that they are coming the whole way from Hong Kong!!</li>
            <li> These eye lashes looked great in the box but were hard to put on</li>
            <li> Bulky, longer in the middle that reaches the top of eyebrow.</li>
            <li> will definitely order more...</li>
            <li> i got them the next day i love how they look</li>
            <li> Advertised better than they actually look.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that they are a lot of them and you do not have to reuse them over and over again, but they are not human lashes</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll definitely buy more</li>
            <li> When I first bought these lashes</li>
            <li> Did not received as exact picture requested.</li>
            <li> First I had to wait weeks which is understandable because of the location</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an actress/model and I love these I have worn the same pair for 3 days now!</li>
            <li> Also, the shape of the lashes that I received is not the same as in the picture (they are shorter on both sides and longer in the middle), but they look gorgeous, so I did not mind.</li>
            <li> The eylelashes don&#x27;t look very realistic.</li>
            <li> Although, this lash is beautiful for a everyday elegant, subtle look.</li>
            <li> You can even wear them more then once if you are careful with each pair.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t really like the lashes.</li>
            <li> I really like the lashes...</li>
            <li> a whole star just doesn&#x27;t cut it for the company...</li>
            <li> they came fast</li>
            <li> stick on very well</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> they didn&#x27;t stay on very well</li>
            <li> I really like using these lashes.  </li>
            <li> I really like the produt , but some lashes come with manufacturing defects.</li>
            <li> it just was straight.</li>
            <li> When I first received them I did think wow</li>
            <li> creating  a new order as we speak!</li>
            <li> These are definitely fake eyelashes and are NOT for daily, daytime wear---they will be great for going out at night!</li>
            <li> If the had several different styles it may have been better</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only downer, but other than that I love them and the price they cost!</li>
            <li> The package was damaged when I received it, a little long for my eyelids, easy to adjust, have to be very careful if I want to clean and reuse them because they fall apart very easily</li>
            <li> Be sure long and thick lashes compliment you before ordering them though and ladies please make sure</li>
            <li> Highly recommened.  </li>
            <li> Spend a little more and be happier.</li>
            <li> So... Spend a little more and b happier...</li>
            <li> so they were kind of hard to put on</li>
            <li> They are super long and they feel like plastic.</li>
            <li> The picture I believe is decieving and the actual lashes are a lot fuller and a lot thicker and longer and feel heavy, making them more appropriate for drag queens.</li>
            <li> I live in montclair ca</li>
            <li> The shipping time wasn&#x27;t too bad, if anything you&#x27;ll forget you ordered them and then find a nice surprise in your mailbox one day :)</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s good for make up artists who are looking for dramatic look.</li>
            <li> But falsies shouldn&#x27;t look natural in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I know my eyeliner will hide them, but I do not understand why the band is white in the first place.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re long but give such a bold but sultry look all in one!</li>
            <li> I use black eyeliner when I use it so it all blends together!! :)</li>
            <li> These are just fabulous and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have ordered these several times now, like a previous poster said, they dont compliment everyone though so if you want more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; looking eyelashes then these probably arent for you.</li>
            <li> If u want natural looking lashes..</li>
            <li> However, theyvr on a string that can be stuff and doesnt bend naturally...</li>
            <li> and I just now read all reviews and was wondering when people got them near me?</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t natural looking at all if that&#x27;s what youre going for</li>
            <li> If they wanted natural eyelashes</li>
            <li> The lashes reminded me of the eyelashes on the dolls I had when I was a young girl.</li>
            <li> I tried them on and they did not look natural at all.</li>
            <li> Are they natural looking?</li>
            <li> I would have never wasted my time.</li>
            <li> I do like them, but they&#x27;re a bit too loud for me to wear to a place like work or a meeting.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> However, if thick dramatic eyelashes are what your looking for, these are great!</li>
            <li> saves me from buying every other week and guess what it did you can reuse these things and people who say these suck its cuz people your not applying them right</li>
            <li> I got these thinking that they would be a little fuller than the lashes I currently wear as a daily favorite.</li>
            <li> Although they looked very nice from afar they were extremely uncomfortable to use!</li>
            <li> They did not really look exactly like the picture of the lashes provided.</li>
            <li> To achieve a more natural look, go for the individual lashes that you can place as thickly as you please.</li>
            <li> These will be nice for a silly, unexpected gift at Christmas.</li>
            <li> If you are going for a gorgeous fake eyelashes look, then you simply can&#x27;t beat the value of these.</li>
            <li> They are attached to a thick band, but I think that is what helped them stay on all night and made it easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I had to trim them as I do with any other lashes I buy anyway &amp; in order for these to work you really have to know how to apply lashes!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy false eyelashes, and purchased these mainly because of the number of pairs and the dollar amount.</li>
            <li> ok, for one, the shipping was VERY slow...</li>
            <li> like this lashes because they are as long as my natural lashes and look natural on me.</li>
            <li> you have to cut them to fit your own eye, the band in which the lashes are attached is really thick and heavy and hard to wear on ur eyes.</li>
            <li> These Eyelashes are very dense, hard to move to the shape you want and the band is very thick.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> If you want something that is dramatic, sure I suppose.</li>
            <li> Not even worth the trouble sending it back!</li>
            <li> the lash line is really really thin and its in a straight line ... its kind of hard for me since im a begginer</li>
            <li> I did not have high expectations for the product quality due to the price but what I received did not resembel the picture at all.</li>
            <li> they are super thick and they dont stick on correctly</li>
            <li> I was curious about things from Hong Kong, China but decided to take a chance, I was very surprised...</li>
            <li> But like i said, some people look better with thinner less dramatic.</li>
            <li> these are long and where you put the glue was pretty thick</li>
            <li> I was not really used to wearing them, so I had a hard time at first, but now, it&#x27;s no big</li>
            <li> They are long, not too thick, and the part that attaches to the eye is nice and thin.  </li>
            <li> really flimsy band makes them hard to apply so just be warned these are in no way for beginners</li>
            <li> They look cheap and obviously fake.</li>
            <li> after I realized cutting them into 3 pieces was better for me.</li>
            <li> These Lashes look so fake, cheap and bulky.</li>
            <li> They are not really natural looking.</li>
            <li> yes they are too long</li>
            <li> they come from a long ways</li>
            <li> but some came  earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I waited so long to get my eyelash onces I received</li>
            <li> Eyelashes are too long.</li>
            <li> Only get them if you want a drag queen type look.</li>
            <li> I look like a drag queen when I wear them even though I&#x27;m already a female.</li>
            <li> The lashes also are too long</li>
            <li> As for the band, if they are too long, cut them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Length wasnt as long as I thought but they will do!</li>
            <li> These lashes shipped earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> I am really bad about not being able to reuse any lashes once I put them on, so the multiple pairs seemed the way to go for me.</li>
            <li> Far from professional, thin and wispy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bands MUST be wide because the length of the eye varies from person to person, therefor unless your eyes happen to be rather long, you must trim the sides.</li>
            <li> When you apply these lashes, it is evident that they are false.</li>
            <li> I have smaller eyes, so I have to cut them down</li>
            <li> but then when it gets here its package is flimsy and then open the box half of the lashes are smashed and unusable</li>
            <li> You have to cut off the little ends that keep the lashes attached to the box, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> and I find that these are a little more difficult to apply (they are less flexible) than other brands that can be purchased in stores.  </li>
            <li> you know what eyelashes you can and cant wear before giving bad reviews :)</li>
            <li> Just dont do it its a waste of money and they refuse to give me my money back and</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no real difference from the ones here in the states and for the price of one you pay here for one</li>
            <li> lol...but other than that</li>
            <li> but they might work for other people.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> but usually we who wear them don&#x27;t want it to stand out above all..</li>
            <li> And they came faster than expected!</li>
            <li> I have purchased similar lashes from ebay (they usually come from China)</li>
            <li> I actually thought I made a bad purchase at first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;SMH, those pix need to be taken down..</li>
            <li> However, I cut them in half and trim the ends.</li>
            <li> they look fake, and even worse, cheap.</li>
            <li> I cut these in half</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s black.</li>
            <li> I like that the waterline part is black and not plastic.</li>
            <li> They are so stiff the corners wont stay glued down.</li>
            <li> You have to cut them a little</li>
            <li> so have a little patience with the shipment</li>
            <li> They are held on to the board with a little... almost like a string.  </li>
            <li> They do take a little while to receive</li>
            <li> however the thick band makes these almost impossible to apply, and when they are applied after much frustration they tend to straighten out and poke the inner and outer corners of your eye,this leads to eyes watering and</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste money on shipping either..</li>
            <li> I wear lashes everyday and can work with almost anything</li>
            <li> and the band is made of heavy material-</li>
            <li> I wear lashes almost everyday and</li>
            <li> I had trouble using them and they were not like the sticky lashes I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> They do look fake, so if you are going for a natural look then this is not it.</li>
            <li> They also stayed on all night and never gave me any trouble.</li>
            <li> Too much and thick it looks fake</li>
            <li> but they are a bit stiff.</li>
            <li> They were stiff and did not bend to suit the shape of the eye.</li>
            <li> My personal satisfaction would have to be a 80 because I had never tried these lashes and was hoping that they would give the eye a dramatic look, which they did not.</li>
            <li> THESE(they say Professional thin and wispy, but it is really cheap thick over dramatic and impossible to wear)</li>
            <li> so it was a waste of time and money!....</li>
            <li> so it extends past your eye about 2 cm.</li>
            <li> the only problem with them is that the strip is kinda thick making them look kinda fake...</li>
            <li> The lining that you glue was thick so you can definitely tell they were fake.</li>
            <li> These are FALSE lashes, so of course they look fake, it is all in your skill and how well you blend them with your natural lashes.</li>
            <li> they are so stiff!</li>
            <li> I hate these lashes I wish I would have never bought them in the first place</li>
            <li> Hard to stay on, I under stang why they were so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> as a Makeup Artist its always hard to find Lashes</li>
            <li> they are not the least bit flattering..even for $1.00.</li>
            <li> They are THICK</li>
            <li> unless u like the thick oversized lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> there are some reviews below that wrote because the eyelashes were too thick or that the band was too wide.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;eyelashes being thick...</li>
            <li> well...look at the picture, they DO look thick.</li>
            <li> They look thick in the picture..</li>
            <li> A little too dramatic for everday.</li>
            <li> first couple of times I hated them , they always seemed to come off at corner of eye or at the end...and glue</li>
            <li> These were a tad bit thicker than I am used to and they&#x27;re a tough plastic that&#x27;s hard to bend/shape.</li>
            <li> Very stiff!</li>
            <li> These lashes are impossible to put on due to the &#x27;thick&#x27; band.</li>
            <li> some person that emailed me was very rude</li>
            <li> It looks too fake and too thick for me.</li>
            <li> False advertisement</li>
            <li> Sorry to say these are not good looking at all</li>
            <li> they are a little stiff at the strip but anyone who wears lashes will tell you that they arent that terrible.</li>
            <li> wtf</li>
            <li> They fake lashes will make your eye lashes fuller.</li>
            <li> but they are fake...</li>
            <li> ,I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> well yea.. they ARE fake.</li>
            <li> so you can tell theyre fake</li>
            <li> However, they r really fake lookin..</li>
            <li> Yes they r fake</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product is not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I thought they look really fake.</li>
            <li> They look so fake.</li>
            <li> These false eyelashes were made of plastic!</li>
            <li> When they arrived there were very very very thin.</li>
            <li> Just wish they were a little longer, but I&#x27;m not gunna complain or give a bad review for these dolly lashes!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t describe them as obnoxiously fake, just very dramatic.</li>
            <li> So if you like dramatic lashes, then these are for you!</li>
            <li> I cant stand when people give false eyelashes bad reviews because they \\&quot;look fake\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Very fake looking lashes..</li>
            <li> these lashes arent that bad.</li>
            <li> so people giving bad reviews please take some classes i got complimented every time i wore them</li>
            <li> These are so bad.</li>
            <li> They are very dramatic!  </li>
            <li> and they look like crap too.</li>
            <li> These lashes were not at all like the picture; very disappointed.</li>

            <li> These are just fabulous and last a long time. You can wear them multiple times!</li>
            <li> the &#x27;eyelashes&#x27; are attached to a string instead of a band.. wtf... how do you put that on your eyeslids??.. BIG NO-NO that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re only a dollar... don&#x27;t waste money on shipping either.. not even worth trying.. horrible!!!</li>
            <li> I was satisfied 100 percent with the description and item, also the shipping was quick. My personal satisfaction would have to be a 80 because I had never tried these lashes and was hoping that they would give the eye a dramatic look, which they did not. Although, this lash is beautiful for a everyday elegant, subtle look.</li>
            <li> I have ordered these several times now, like a previous poster said, they dont compliment everyone though so if you want more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; looking eyelashes then these probably arent for you. I have really big blue eyes and so they stand our very well with my eyes, they dont look halloweenish at all on me because they fit my eyes well! But like i said, some people look better with thinner less dramatic. However, if thick dramatic eyelashes are what your looking for, these are great! You can even wear them more then once if you are careful with each pair.</li>
            <li> These are the worst eyelashes ever!!!! I would not bye them again. They are so stiff the corners wont stay glued down. CHEAP!! CHEAP!! CHEAP!! I guess thats what you get when you try and get a good deal.</li>
            <li> the lash line is really really thin and its in a straight line ... its kind of hard for me since im a begginer</li>
            <li> Far from professional, thin and wispy. They are not really natural looking. If you want something that is dramatic, sure I suppose. It doesn&#x27;t look good on me. It looks too fake and too thick for me. They are definitely cheap and come in a nice box. But I don&#x27;t really like the lashes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get this lashes. I never got them. It&#x27;s been almost three months now. Save your money and try something else.</li>
            <li> They did not really look exactly like the picture of the lashes provided. It was easy to apply and brightened up my face.</li>
            <li> I use lashes a lot for photoshoots etc. these lashes are great so far. They stay on for a while. They&#x27;re cheap but get the job done.</li>
            <li> They look cheap and obviously fake. At first I thought I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use them. However, I cut them in half and trim the ends. They look okay. I think you kind of need to have naturally long eye lashes to make the transition smooth though. They fake lashes will make your eye lashes fuller.</li>
            <li> these looked so nice in the photo however the thick band makes these almost impossible to apply, and when they are applied after much frustration they tend to straighten out and poke the inner and outer corners of your eye,this leads to eyes watering and eyeliner/mascara EVERYWHERE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have tried these with multiple adhesives, tried curving the band they just suck in my opinion. the price is low but so is the quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THESE(they say Professional thin and wispy, but it is really cheap thick over dramatic and impossible to wear)</li>
            <li> Very fake looking lashes.. Bulky, longer in the middle that reaches the top of eyebrow. Does not look wispy like the pic shows they are more of a blunt rounded cut.. Very unnatural, glad they were so cheap bc I can only wear them at Halloween</li>
            <li> These were a tad bit thicker than I am used to and they&#x27;re a tough plastic that&#x27;s hard to bend/shape. Took awhile but they do look great when put on. So if you like dramatic lashes, then these are for you!</li>
            <li> i bought these because i wanted to save on money they are like doll lashes not for humans!!!!! no never again.</li>
            <li> I really like the lashes...the only problem with them is that the strip is kinda thick making them look kinda fake...but they are fake...lol...but other than that I like the way they look...and the price was wonderful...will definitely order more...</li>
            <li> Was not even close to what manufacture said,it&#x27;s didn&#x27;t even look or come close to what I had order just had to dump it,this picture and manufacture are both misleading  ,I&#x27;m sorry a whole star just doesn&#x27;t cut it for the company...</li>
            <li> these lashes arent that bad. they are a little stiff at the strip but anyone who wears lashes will tell you that they arent that terrible. yes they are too long but they can be adjusted, you cant fix lashes when they are too short. ps...it was cheap...what did you expect the perfect lash??</li>
            <li> I cant stand when people give false eyelashes bad reviews because they \\&quot;look fake\\&quot; well yea.. they ARE fake. Do not say \\&quot;these are awful cuz theyre too thick,\\&quot; say \\&quot;these dont compliment my eyes but they might work for other people.\\&quot; Im a makeup artist in training and some people (like myself) NEED obnoxious eyelashes to even tell we&#x27;re wearing any. No these lashes dont look right on everyone but that doesnt make them halloween lashes, i happen to look amazing with them. And for the price, oh yea i will definitely order again. You have to cut them a little but thats no big deal at all. Be sure long and thick lashes compliment you before ordering them though and ladies please make sure you know what eyelashes you can and cant wear before giving bad reviews :)</li>
            <li> These lashes were not at all like the picture; very disappointed. I did not have high expectations for the product quality due to the price but what I received did not resembel the picture at all. I wear lashes everyday and can work with almost anything but these will never be used. Sorry to say these are not good looking at all and I&#x27;d advise all to shop around for others.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I was hesitant to order these lashes..  I was expecting some coarse horse hair lashes when I opened the box.  These are very nice looking and the hairs are very soft.  I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but I look forward to it.  They are very dramatic!  They are long, not too thick, and the part that attaches to the eye is nice and thin.  These are definitely fake eyelashes and are NOT for daily, daytime wear---they will be great for going out at night!</li>
            <li> NOT AT ALL AS ADVERTISED... BIG mistake buying this Asian product... NEVER again!!! Not even worth the trouble sending it back!</li>
            <li> Love the value of 20 lashes! easy to put on and take off at night! Highly recommened.  Length wasnt as long as I thought but they will do!</li>
            <li> Terrible. they are so stiff! and the band is made of heavy material- they look fake, and even worse, cheap. I will never buy these again...and now I have all these crappy eyelashes laying all over my friggen vanity.</li>
            <li> really flimsy band makes them hard to apply so just be warned these are in no way for beginners</li>
            <li> These Eyelashes are very dense, hard to move to the shape you want and the band is very thick.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t Recommend</li>
            <li> i love this eyelashes they came fast i got them the next day i love how they look and they dont feel like wired lol but</li>
            <li> I bought these last year for a wedding and i figured this is a good deal saves me from buying every other week and guess what it did you can reuse these things and people who say these suck its cuz people your not applying them right they stayed on for 2 days on me because of the way i applied them they never came undone from the corners because i applied them right so people giving bad reviews please take some classes i got complimented every time i wore them these are really good and for a great deal also :)</li>
            <li> you would think that at a cheap price you would get a cheap product but these are actually really good for being synthetic, theyre not shiny so you can tell theyre fake</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are really good for the price, especially if your like me who wears eyelashes daily, it&#x27;s a great dupe.</li>
            <li> For the price these work jus fine! I like to have this on hand when I&#x27;m out of my normals or don&#x27;t have time to get individual lashes done! For this price yup will purchase again. Only neg tubing took a while to arrive I had totally forgot I ordered</li>
            <li> + Very cheap .&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap material .&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t stick on very well&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for .</li>
            <li> ok, for one, the shipping was VERY slow...They took almost a month to come! I ordered some from the same location and they came within a couple weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, THESE ARE NOT THIN AND WISPY!!! I ordered four packs thinking they were gonna look like the pic...WRONG! They are THICK AND FULL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for every day lashes, these aren&#x27;t it...unless u like the thick oversized lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SMH, those pix need to be taken down..False advertisement</li>
            <li> love the lashes I don&#x27;t care with others say if you know how to put on lashes then you won&#x27;t have any problem there not for the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; girls I bought bundles of lashes why because they&#x27;re cheap good for everyday and durable for cleaning ...they come from a long ways so have a little patience with the shipment but some came  earlier than expected. Thanks</li>
            <li> If u want natural looking lashes.. Don&#x27;t get these.. Yes they look good in the box... However, theyvr on a string that can be stuff and doesnt bend naturally...However, they r really fake lookin.. Yes they r fake but usually we who wear them don&#x27;t want it to stand out above all.. If something is cheap cheap cheap theire is a reason.. Spend a little more and be happier. I gave these to a 14 year old who loved them.. But they want to stand out... So... Spend a little more and b happier...</li>
            <li> The material feels like turf! They have a plastic shine to them. Don&#x27;t bother spending your $. The only thing these will be good for is if you need practice applying eyelashes</li>
            <li> I cut these in half and I use them as demi lashes &amp; I use them alot for my clients and they are perfect!! The band isn&#x27;t too big but it&#x27;s black. I use black eyeliner when I use it so it all blends together!! :)</li>
            <li> Very stiff! Hard to stay on, I under stang why they were so inexpensive. If the had several different styles it may have been better</li>
            <li> These false eyelashes were made of plastic! Although they looked very nice from afar they were extremely uncomfortable to use!</li>
            <li> Just dont do it its a waste of money and they refuse to give me my money back and some person that emailed me was very rude</li>
            <li> These eye lashes looked great in the box but were hard to put on they didn&#x27;t stay on very well but they were a great price quick service so it could of been me I wear lashes almost everyday and like for my lashes to look more natural but if you like that look then these would be great specially with the price and quick service.</li>
            <li> defective during the transportation. I waited so long to get my eyelash onces I received it come damage the worst experience in my life . Stay away from this product please. They blame on shipment if they pack it the right way it won&#x27;t be damage</li>
            <li> Advertised better than they actually look. A little too dramatic for everday. I like that the waterline part is black and not plastic. Blends in well with eyeliner</li>
            <li> These are so bad. The cannot be used</li>
            <li> For the price there great....first couple of times I hated them , they always seemed to come off at corner of eye or at the end...and glue I use is good.but after I realized cutting them into 3 pieces was better for me. They stay on through out the day,and I never have to wonder if there still in place...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product is not what I was looking for. These Lashes look so fake, cheap and bulky. Not glamourous at all!</li>
            <li> Great lashes great price! Just takes a month to arrive that&#x27;s all. That&#x27;s the only downer, but other than that I love them and the price they cost!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that they are a lot of them and you do not have to reuse them over and over again, but they are not human lashes so they were kind of hard to put on but once you get the hand of it , you ae good to go</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite what I was looking for. Way too long for me, I can&#x27;t use them simply not the best.</li>
            <li> These lashes were great for them to be my first try lashes, not cheap feeling at all... so I&#x27;ll definitely buy more</li>
            <li> When I first bought these lashes I thought they look really fake. But since Im a makeup artist I know how to make things look good. The lashes were ok for the price. Not mink of course but you get what you pay for. I used them on one of my brides &amp; she looked beautiful with them on.</li>
            <li> I had trouble using them and they were not like the sticky lashes I&#x27;m used to. They may look nice if I could put them on.</li>
            <li> Did not received as exact picture requested. Eyelashes are too long.</li>
            <li> I ordered these  last week and I just now read all reviews and was wondering when people got them near me? I live in montclair ca</li>
            <li> WHY are these eyelashes on a stringggg ?!?! Horrible just horrible and they look like crap too. Do not buy</li>
            <li> Shipped within a timely manner and it&#x27;s good for the price.  They aren&#x27;t natural looking at all if that&#x27;s what youre going for but it&#x27;s good for make up artists who are looking for dramatic look.</li>
            <li> there are some reviews below that wrote because the eyelashes were too thick or that the band was too wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bands MUST be wide because the length of the eye varies from person to person, therefor unless your eyes happen to be rather long, you must trim the sides. That&#x27;s eyelash 101. you tend to have to trim all your lashes for length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;eyelashes being thick...well...look at the picture, they DO look thick. If they wanted natural eyelashes they&#x27;d not buy lashes at all. To achieve a more natural look, go for the individual lashes that you can place as thickly as you please.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting the best for the price I paid but not the worst either. The lashes reminded me of the eyelashes on the dolls I had when I was a young girl. So if you like the baby doll look then this is for you.</li>
            <li> LOVE MY LASH I BUY ALOT THEM ALL DIFFRENT SIZES LOOK GOOD ON AND LOOK LIKE THEY ARE REAL LOOK GOOD</li>
            <li> The eylelashes don&#x27;t look very realistic. The price was really good, but sometimes you get what you pay for. I wouldn&#x27;t order these again.</li>
            <li> I really like using these lashes.  I was not really used to wearing them, so I had a hard time at first, but now, it&#x27;s no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to cut them.  They are held on to the board with a little... almost like a string.  I have smaller eyes, so I have to cut them down anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have reused them several times before tossing them.  And it&#x27;s almost like the more you use them, the better they bend and form to your eye (probably from all the glue, haha).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying these again.  Shipping time was surprisingly fast as well, being that they are coming the whole way from Hong Kong!!</li>
            <li> These suck, they&#x27;re sooooo phony looking. But for the price I can use them on Halloween.</li>
            <li> These lashes look like they were made for a halloween. They are super long and they feel like plastic. Only get them if you want a drag queen type look.</li>
            <li> Worst eyelashes ever. you have to cut them to fit your own eye, the band in which the lashes are attached is really thick and heavy and hard to wear on ur eyes. to make these manageable i had to trim the band and the sides. waste of time and money. try ardells those are nice</li>
            <li> I really like the produt , but some lashes come with manufacturing defects. but thatÂ´s ok , i m happy bacause just in 2 pairs i could see those defects</li>
            <li> Too much and thick it looks fake</li>
            <li> They were the worng ones.. They look thick in the picture.. When they arrived there were very very very thin.</li>
            <li> i did not like these eyelashes they are super thick and they dont stick on correctly they were not what i expectedi was very disappointed</li>
            <li> These lashes are impossible to put on due to the &#x27;thick&#x27; band. These are the worst lashes I ever bought. If I could return them I would send it back without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I will never purchase from this provider again.....First I had to wait weeks which is understandable because of the location but then when it gets here its package is flimsy and then open the box half of the lashes are smashed and unusable so it was a waste of time and money!....So Never Again!</li>
            <li> It thought this product was going to be a great investment. It was not. They look so fake. And they don&#x27;t easily stay on. I had a lot of problems with this product.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful and very easy to apply. You have to cut off the little ends that keep the lashes attached to the box, but it&#x27;s not a big deal. They do look fake, so if you are going for a natural look then this is not it. If you are going for a gorgeous fake eyelashes look, then you simply can&#x27;t beat the value of these. They also stayed on all night and never gave me any trouble. They are attached to a thick band, but I think that is what helped them stay on all night and made it easy to apply. Also, the shape of the lashes that I received is not the same as in the picture (they are shorter on both sides and longer in the middle), but they look gorgeous, so I did not mind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an actress/model and I love these I have worn the same pair for 3 days now! You need to learn to put on eye lashes! They were easy to put on I recommend to get the glue with the brush applicator to make it easier for u! And they came faster than expected!</li>
            <li> I love these eyelashes they are just perfect! Especially if you like the gal look from japan. They do take a little while to receive but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> These are flawless and amazing quality! I will be buying over and over and over! I bought these for photoshoots and special events, but they&#x27;re so nice I may start wearing them every day!</li>
            <li> All i can say about these Lashes are FAB!! Juat perfect! they&#x27;re long but give such a bold but sultry look all in one! as a Makeup Artist its always hard to find Lashes youre completely satisfied with but These Lashes are IT!! delivery time Perfect, product Perfect! Price paid for Fab lashes.... PERFECT! creating  a new order as we speak!</li>
            <li> I hate these lashes I wish I would have never bought them in the first place I tried them on and they did not look natural at all.</li>
            <li> I have purchased similar lashes from ebay (they usually come from China) and I find that these are a little more difficult to apply (they are less flexible) than other brands that can be purchased in stores.  I thought I was saving money by purchasing a pack like these, but i have only ended up buying different ones in stores.  These appear to be flared out from inner to outer corner of the eyes, but they are not.  Save your money and purchase the $1.00 to $3.00 E.L.F. pair at Target.</li>
            <li> they are okay and good for the price but I wouldn&#x27;t wear them all the time or for a night out, just around the house or for errands ect....</li>
            <li> Only took a week to get here, price is cheap and these are just really great! Love them! Just wish they were a little longer, but I&#x27;m not gunna complain or give a bad review for these dolly lashes!</li>
            <li> They need to be trimmed down a bit, but that is perfect so it can fit any eye! Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> These do the job. Are they natural looking? No... But falsies shouldn&#x27;t look natural in my opinion! These are fun.</li>
            <li> I wish i didn&#x27;t buy these</li>
            <li> I would never purchase these again...they are not the least bit flattering..even for $1.00. Had I known that they would have looked so terrible I would have never wasted my time.</li>
            <li> Only reason i gave it 4 stars was because it would of been better if it came with an eyelash glue but other than that i love these:)</li>
            <li> wayyyyy too big. I look like a drag queen when I wear them even though I&#x27;m already a female. The lashes also are too long so it extends past your eye about 2 cm. Also took ages to ship because it came from China.</li>
            <li> I was curious about things from Hong Kong, China but decided to take a chance, I was very surprised...there&#x27;s no real difference from the ones here in the states and for the price of one you pay here for one you get an extra nine for about the same price, so the choice is yours, either buy in bulk and save or pay for one instead of 10...the only draw back is the time it takes to arrive.....so that&#x27;s why if you get it in bulk you&#x27;ll not only save but have enough to last you for....how ever you use them.....and yes, they are reusable (after proper cleaning)...</li>
            <li> I love the eyelashes and they fit great on my lash line and I will purchase again They are Great Product</li>
            <li> The package was damaged when I received it, a little long for my eyelids, easy to adjust, have to be very careful if I want to clean and reuse them because they fall apart very easily</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t very good. Didnt want to glue to my eyeshape it just was straight. The lining that you glue was thick so you can definitely tell they were fake. Wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
            <li> I wear eyelashes daily Im filipino &amp; guamanian so I have an almond eye shape/cat eye so these look BOMB on me. When I first received them I did think wow these are long and where you put the glue was pretty thick I actually thought I made a bad purchase at first. I had to trim them as I do with any other lashes I buy anyway &amp; in order for these to work you really have to know how to apply lashes! When I got them on I fell in love I ordered two packs the next time and this is my third time ordering. It beats paying 3.99-5.99 @ Walmart, Sallys or Target or 1.99 plus tax (@ the cheapest),  for 1 pair of eyelashes at my nearest beauty supply!</li>
            <li> My Daughter LOVED THEM! They were exactly as they were represented to be!!!</li>
            <li> duraderas, solo que muy duras, si fueran mas flexibles serian geniales, para asi poder adherirlas mejor al palpado.. y la cajita deberia ser mas fuerte</li>
            <li> the eyelashes are extremely cheap quality. However you get what you pay for so it isn&#x27;t a big shock that they aren&#x27;t the best quality.</li>
            <li> These will be nice for a silly, unexpected gift at Christmas. Would be nice if they included a tube of glue. However, they&#x27;re just as described.</li>
            <li> I got these thinking that they would be a little fuller than the lashes I currently wear as a daily favorite. The picture I believe is decieving and the actual lashes are a lot fuller and a lot thicker and longer and feel heavy, making them more appropriate for drag queens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered many \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; falsies available on Amazon and these are my favorites! I wouldn&#x27;t describe them as obnoxiously fake, just very dramatic. They&#x27;re not plastic but they are a bit stiff. However, like with all falsies, you have to mold them or sometimes cut them in multiple strips in order for them to conform to your eye shape. These are great, easily worth 10x more than what&#x27;s being asked. The shipping time wasn&#x27;t too bad, if anything you&#x27;ll forget you ordered them and then find a nice surprise in your mailbox one day :)</li>
            <li> These lashes were the best deal ever.  I absolutely love them. They are easy to apply and the shippment came fast. I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t curve to fit ur eye. ....</li>
            <li> 2 words....JUST YES! For the price...</li>
            <li> Almost like a plastic fiber. Did not like them because they weren&#x27;t as flexible. But might be ok if your just practicing.</li>
            <li> These lashes shipped earlier than expected! When you apply these lashes, it is evident that they are false. I do like them, but they&#x27;re a bit too loud for me to wear to a place like work or a meeting.&lt;br /&gt;You could easily wear these to a party, or going out with your friends.. and that is why I like them. They accentuate my eyes, and they are fun!</li>
            <li> For those who say these are &amp;#34;too fake&amp;#34; or the band is &amp;#34;to long&amp;#34; then, you no nothing about applying lashes. These are FALSE lashes, so of course they look fake, it is all in your skill and how well you blend them with your natural lashes. As for the band, if they are too long, cut them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this lashes because they are as long as my natural lashes and look natural on me. I took away one star because the band on my lashes are white! I know my eyeliner will hide them, but I do not understand why the band is white in the first place. Aside from taking FOREVER to receive them, everything else was great.</li>
            <li> i love these eyelashes.  they&#x27;re easy to put on, they look great on me and they&#x27;re durable. plus they were really really cheap.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy false eyelashes, and purchased these mainly because of the number of pairs and the dollar amount. I am really bad about not being able to reuse any lashes once I put them on, so the multiple pairs seemed the way to go for me. I could not make these adhere with any glue...I tried two kinds. They were stiff and did not bend to suit the shape of the eye. Hopefully others will not have this same problem.</li>
