            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a water down product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste the few extra dollars of savings with other vendors (unless they accept returns).</li>

            <li> I have used Incanto Bloom by Ferragamo for years now and LOVE it. I know the scent like the back of my hand, and when I received this in the mail, the tip smelled like the correct scent but when sprayed, it smelled like it had been diluted with rubbing alcohol!! Horrible! Not sure if this was a immitation, fake or just something that went wrong with the perfume itself (maybe it was just very very old), but definitely not what I wanted. Unfortunately it was non-refundable, so I had to go through my cc company to try to get my money back. Unfortunate. I re-ordered through Fragrance.net on Amazon (had a good experience with them recently) and when it arrived it was my beloved perfume at it&#x27;s best! If you want the real deal, I recommend looking for this provided from fragrance.net, NOT any other provider. Don&#x27;t waste the few extra dollars of savings with other vendors (unless they accept returns).</li>
            <li> As I was looking at purchasing some perfumes for the wife I realized one flaw of trying to shop for these online.  Perhaps someday they will make the screens scratch and sniff....but the technology isn&#x27;t here yet.  I went to a store specializing in perfumes/colognes at the mall and after smelling perhaps ten or so decided on this one for her.  I picked it based on what I thought would smell most \\&quot;yummy\\&quot; on her.  This won out and I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Great scent!  Long lasting and not too overpowering.  Smells great all day but doesn&#x27;t leave the people around you lightheaded.</li>
            <li> You have to spray at least 10 times before you&#x27;ll notice the scent. It&#x27;s definitely a water down product. But it does smell very pleasant.</li>
            <li> great price for Ferragomo fragrance</li>
            <li> Nice perfume. As the gift for my mum, she likes so much.</li>
            <li> I simply love this perfume, it&#x27;s really great, and it shipped fast and without any damage. Its sweet fragrance is fabulous.</li>
            <li> The Ferragamo perfume is my favorite.</li>
            <li> It smells great, a light fresh scent like you just stepped out of the shower. Great price for a perfume this size.</li>
            <li> I recommend this seller. We have some misunderstanding at first, but they solved the problem fast. The perfume smells exactly like my old ones and I love it</li>
            <li> buena calidad de productos que recomiendo puedas obtener en este lugar, desesperado mi cliente y consegui justo lo que necesitaba</li>
            <li> My favorite scent from the Salvatore Incanto perfumes.  It smells so delicate and subtle, perfect for any season.  I always buy this scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother as a replacement for the one she had. This is a great price compared to what it is sold for in stores. It does not help that they no longer sell this in most stores as well. I could not find it anywhere until I looked online.</li>
            <li> Love it, and great price!!</li>
            <li> Tried it, it is really good. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This perfume is quite cool and comfortable. I love how it looks. The bottle design is very nice and has a great presentation. Can be used by women 20 to 35 years.</li>
            <li> I am a Salvatore Ferragamo&#x27;s fan since forever but it was the first time I got a perfume of his collection.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy w/ my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I am not good on describing fragrances, I just can say that I have used it everyday and it fits this warm days in Florida very well.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle itself is a masterpiece. What beauty!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pleasant aroma / Delicious / very good parfum. Lasts for hours. I love it!!! I bought the big perfume super cheap in amazon.</li>
            <li> ppl says never buy the perfume from online.  The scent is not the quite same as the one from the store.  it&#x27;s probably older version or stored in wrong way that it effected on quality.  whatever it is, it smells wrong and nasty.  I can compare exactly because i bought the owned the one that i got it from macy&#x27;s which smells perfectly fine and floral fresh.  plus, this time, I got the one with broken spray part.  now I gotta figure out what to do with this perfume that I don&#x27;t want to wear..</li>
            <li> This perfume is by far my favorite woman&#x27;s perfume out there. It smells like an island of flowers in the middle of the ocean. Buy this product, you won&#x27;t regret it! I buy this for every woman in my family for every occasion. Awesom!</li>
            <li> My fav! Deff a winner in my book! Can&#x27;t wait to try the other ferragamo!&lt;br /&gt;, smells just like a rose garden !</li>
            <li> My landlady uses this and I really like the smell so I got it for my mom. It smells delicious!!!</li>
            <li> It was on Prime so reached on time, NIce fragrance. The size is pretty good for the price. I would recommend it</li>
            <li> Authentic product, smells great.</li>
            <li> I love it! So cheap and nice</li>
            <li> not my favorite perfume.... But I love the bottle!</li>
            <li> This has a really nice floral scent.  Although I don&#x27;t smell it after an hour or so on me, others do.  I get lots of compliments when I wear this.  It&#x27;s especially nice right out of the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft...sweet but not too sweet to give you a headache, I just love it, I wanted to try and buy this because it has a touch of tea rose, wich I go crazy about it. Seller was fast shipping it and it arrived in perfect conditions.</li>
            <li> received it in time. but I am so dissapointed.it is not the perfume I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is so light,first you smell citrus and then tea-rose.&lt;br /&gt; I regret  buying it and it doesn&#x27;t even have much of a longevity.&lt;br /&gt;Lasting power is really poor :(( lasts only minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for this price it is expensive.&lt;br /&gt;sorry...</li>
