    <ol>
            <li>Awesome steamer for the price.</li>
            <li>Shipping was prompt and the unit itself works just great.  </li>
            <li>Looks good.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t good quality at all.</li>
            <li>I just purchased this machine and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>VERY GOOD PRODUCT, EXCELLENT QUALITY, IS TOTALLY WHAT I ASKED, 100% SATISFIED</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;steam&amp;#34; that is supposed to come out of the arm, does not come out in a nice, even flow.</li>
            <li>Very cheap in price, yes,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>It just fits on top, wish it screwed on.</li>
            <li>It spits water out from the cup itself, which is plastic, and from the top where you are supposed to pour the water in.</li>
            <li>I had another steamer that lasted for years and it cost more than this one.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend buying this steamer, I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Using in our spa business and works fine.</li>
            <li>Very basic, but great for the price.</li>
            <li>The product was a good price, just took too much back and forth on my part.</li>
            <li>, THE DELIVERY WAS QUICK AND SAFE ON YOUR ESTIMATED TIME FOR DELIVERY, THANKS FOR THE SERVICE</li>
            <li>While the other steamer lasted around 15 years, for the price this steamer is just as good, lighter and easier to use.  </li>
            <li>It was defective right out of the box.</li>
            <li>broke right away.  </li>
            <li>Called the company and they shipped out a new one which was fine.</li>
            <li>It was very shakey and didn&#x27;t produce adequate steam for my clients.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this unit several months before I was able to use it.  </li>
            <li>and I will make sure to read reviews prior to purchasing another steamer.</li>
            <li>It came with no instruction manual, but it is pretty self explanatory,  but a trouble shooting guide would be nice.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product on ebay same seller, very disatisfied with product, I agree with previous reviews same issues, with water leaking, unsafe i was burned with steam as it shot out forcefully good thing</li>
            <li>I am new to my field, (esthetician)</li>
            <li>Set up is pretty basic.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize that I had purchased this product directly from the manufacturer in China until I got the package from DHL stating that the shipping address was in China.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li>I did nt have a clients face near it.</li>
            <li>I bought this item as new but was obviously used.</li>
            <li>A friend bought this exact steamer &amp; worked less than a month.</li>

            <li> The first time i recived was broken then they changed  for new one and then the water spills</li>
            <li> Obviously not new either as stated.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get a single use out of it.</li>
            <li> I am a skin care professional and when shopping for a new steamer I opted for one with a smaller base.  </li>
            <li> Not as heavy duty as I expected, but for the amount paid it works.  </li>
            <li> I have used it less than 25 times and it stopped working.</li>
            <li> Was not worth the trouble to deal with for a return.</li>
            <li> I think the water jar should have a holder on the base for extra safety after all the water is boiling hot , should it fall off.</li>
            <li> A waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> so I wanted to purchase a few items to have in home for home services.</li>

            <li> waste my money .</li>
            <li> When i spoke to this merchant they were rude liars and abusive.</li>
            <li> I explained to seller several times what was wrong, including sending photos pointing to the problem areas, and they made it seem like I&#x27;m the idiot who does not know how to use a facial steamer.</li>
            <li> not good.  </li>
            <li> because it leaks real bad and its not made good at all am disappointed in this item of chose.</li>
            <li> It is made of POOR construction (plastic).</li>
            <li> The stand is the only thing that needed assembly, it contains a base and 2 poles.</li>
            <li> It came very poorly packed so therefore it was broken.</li>

            <li> This product is so bad is not good it doesn&#x27;t work correctly. The first time i recived was broken then they changed  for new one and then the water spills</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I think the water jar should have a holder on the base for extra safety after all the water is boiling hot , should it fall off.</li>
            <li> Awesome steamer for the price.</li>
            <li> Not as heavy duty as I expected, but for the amount paid it works.  Using in our spa business and works fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as new but was obviously used. I have owned salon/spa for 17 years and am qualifed to have an opinion on equiment. When i spoke to this merchant they were rude liars and abusive. I ended up throwing this out and taking a loss. Was not worth the trouble to deal with for a return. Note to self do not deal through amazon for spa equipment.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that I had purchased this product directly from the manufacturer in China until I got the package from DHL stating that the shipping address was in China. It is made of POOR construction (plastic). It NEVER worked. The plastic container that holds water never sealed properly around the edge, so the steam was coming out of everywhere except from where it needed to come out of. A waste of time and money. Very cheap in price, yes, but I ended up throwing it in the dumpster - LITERALLY.</li>
            <li> THIS STEAMER IS AWFUL!!!!</li>
            <li> I am a skin care professional and when shopping for a new steamer I opted for one with a smaller base.  This is worst steamer I have ever used!  The steam smells like a steam iron (even after being cleaned) and it leaks from every possible place it can!  I have to put towels over my clients and on the floor to catch the drips when using it!  I would never recommend this steamer...for anyone!</li>
            <li> Item came with NO instructions on how to install it. NO manual either. I turn it on but NO steam yet, may have to return product.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT, EXCELLENT QUALITY, IS TOTALLY WHAT I ASKED, 100% SATISFIED, THE DELIVERY WAS QUICK AND SAFE ON YOUR ESTIMATED TIME FOR DELIVERY, THANKS FOR THE SERVICE</li>
            <li> I was Leary about this product... Set up is pretty basic. Just look at the picture on-line. The stand is the only thing that needed assembly, it contains a base and 2 poles. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like, is the steamer doesn&#x27;t lock on to the stand. It just fits on top, wish it screwed on. Looks good. Very basic, but great for the price. It steams in 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li> Returned no quality at all.</li>
            <li> Had a problem. It came very poorly packed so therefore it was broken. Called the company and they shipped out a new one which was fine. The product was a good price, just took too much back and forth on my part.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit several months before I was able to use it.  I have used it less than 25 times and it stopped working. It heats up and then shuts off.  I contacted the seller and was told sorry, it is out of its warranty.  It came with no instruction manual, but it is pretty self explanatory,  but a trouble shooting guide would be nice.  This is going in the trash and I will make sure to read reviews prior to purchasing another steamer.</li>
            <li> I have used this about 8 times since I purchased it, and its leaking from the side already. For temporary use only</li>
            <li> Worst product ever! Do not waste your money on this. Didn&#x27;t get a single use out of it. It was defective right out of the box. A friend bought this exact steamer &amp; worked less than a month. Pay the extra &amp; get something else.</li>
            <li> I am new to my field, (esthetician) so I wanted to purchase a few items to have in home for home services. The product does not work properly. It spits water out from the cup itself, which is plastic, and from the top where you are supposed to pour the water in. The &amp;#34;steam&amp;#34; that is supposed to come out of the arm, does not come out in a nice, even flow. Instead, it steams out everywhere else. I could not get rid of the &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; smell after running it a few times. I tried to contact the seller for instructions, because it did not come with owners manual. I explained to seller several times what was wrong, including sending photos pointing to the problem areas, and they made it seem like I&#x27;m the idiot who does not know how to use a facial steamer. DO NOT BUY!! I will have to take this as a loss, and learn from buying items like this online!!</li>
            <li> because it leaks real bad and its not made good at all am disappointed in this item of chose. i will never buy this item again.</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy with this product.  It was very shakey and didn&#x27;t produce adequate steam for my clients.  It wasn&#x27;t good quality at all.</li>
            <li> waste my money . leak all the time . i don,t want pay shipping to return . i have to use for while then throw it away . not suggest to buy this item</li>
            <li> when i turn on the steamer it start to have rubber burning smell and the machine part start to smoking ,so i turn it off immediately, I need to return it, because it doest working correctly.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this machine and am very pleased.  Shipping was prompt and the unit itself works just great.  I had another steamer that lasted for years and it cost more than this one.  While the other steamer lasted around 15 years, for the price this steamer is just as good, lighter and easier to use.  I would recommend buying this steamer, I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on ebay same seller, very disatisfied with product, I agree with previous reviews same issues, with water leaking, unsafe i was burned with steam as it shot out forcefully good thing I did nt have a clients face near it. Obviously not new either as stated. This item should be banned!!</li>
            <li> not good.  broke right away.  I don&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
