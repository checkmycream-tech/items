            <li>I would highly recommend it to a fellow dude and even a couple dude friends said that it smelled really good and wanted to buy it for themselves</li>
            <li>very good, fast, high quality</li>
            <li>This fragrance has a sweet, erotic smell with the potential to hypnotize both wearer and innocent bystander!</li>
            <li>This quickly moved to the top of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>It smells so good on him, and is a very masculine smell.</li>
            <li>Sprayed this upon myself &amp; got layed the very first time....must buy!</li>
            <li>The product is as described and the bottle is huge for the price.  </li>
            <li>So guys stop buying those cheap Axe or Oldspice spray and get this one instead.</li>
            <li>My fault for buying a cheap cologne.</li>
            <li>The UPC code and packaging seems to be genuine.</li>
            <li>It was a lot larger than I was expecting, and the presentation was great.</li>
            <li>Smell cheap fragrance .</li>
            <li>Cheap as hell...</li>
            <li>Fantastic bottle.</li>
            <li>Cologne was genuine, but guys: DO NOT BUY &#x27;Guess Seductive Men Edt&#x27; from anyone.</li>
            <li>Dispite of being cheap</li>
            <li>Not to strong Nivce sweet Smell.</li>
            <li>Very mild perfume, very classic, very manly, very sophisticated.</li>
            <li>It was the rich advertising that got me to buy this.</li>
            <li>It makes me smell clean and trustworthy, and lends itself well to image management at work.</li>
            <li>The scent will last a good long while and it is a great buy.</li>
            <li>Buy nothing special about it.</li>
            <li>Sweet but not too feminine.</li>
            <li>Has some sweet tandems.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet smelling but not perfert.</li>
            <li>I find that girls really respond well to this refreshingly sophisticated scent.</li>
            <li>It is a super gift.  </li>
            <li>fragrance goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>and we are overall, very pleased.</li>
            <li>Lasts long and extremely good fragrance.</li>
            <li>Great cologne, attracts many compliments, and furthermore, finding it on amazon for less than half the price of any store made it that much better!</li>
            <li>It smells very nice on him, very manly and not soft or powdery.</li>
            <li>Amazing scent at about a third</li>
            <li>My wife loves this stuff on me, it&#x27;s great a everyday fragrance.</li>
            <li>its definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>the preducto arrive at the expected time and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Makes you smell nice and feel manly at the same time.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Warning ; if you&#x27;re looking for a cologne that&#x27;s strong and super super masculine, this probably isn&#x27;t the one for you.</li>
            <li>You definitely need to reapply, but it smells really nice.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice and it doesn&#x27;t has a huge hit you in your face fragrance like the other brand.</li>
            <li>it does not last too long but for the one who don´t smell too much will be perfect choice.</li>
            <li>I had to order another right away.</li>
            <li>The price was right.</li>
            <li>Other than by agreeing that this particular cologne by Guess smells great.</li>
            <li>Super great fragrance as always from Guess and for the price paid, i can&#x27;t complaint at all with this purchase..........</li>
            <li>It has been smelling great for the past 6 hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s vibrant and fresh on application, but after drying, it softens into a soapy-lavender/floral smell that has tremendous staying power and projection.  </li>
            <li>Gross, overly sweet and strong.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for that special someone in your life.</li>
            <li>the samples seemed better, its a light fresh smell but doesnt last long, Its a great for late night scent,I will enjoy it</li>
            <li>Good small for the first time buying cologne!</li>
            <li>Great smell and last a long time.</li>
            <li>I have got 2 complements the first day I put it on.</li>
            <li>Nelly&#x27;s out there ;)</li>
            <li>Worry it has been discontinued and might not be able to find it in the future.</li>
            <li>Many female friends had asked what cologne I use.</li>
            <li>It was my first try , i was expecting  </li>
            <li>it would appear to be at least as great as Guess for Men</li>
            <li>but I feel it takes a lot more volume sprayed on oneself to be noticeable enough, but at the price that&#x27;s not an issue.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time purchasing guess spray.</li>
            <li>First time I buy it on amazon and not in a store.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure all the one or two stars were generated from a younger market population.</li>
            <li>I got my first bottle when I was 18 and now I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly sweet but still masculine...</li>
            <li>It is way too loud, too sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit more feminine than you might expect, but maybe a better word is subtle.</li>
            <li>Smells good , kinda like skittles but doesn&#x27;t last long thats why it lost a star.</li>
            <li>I used this in the morning and then ran 3 miles after work and can no longer smell the scent, but it was still going strong in the office prior to my run.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells good, but I feel that the scent does not last long.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping highly recommend</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone!.</li>
            <li>They really like it.</li>
            <li>and yes it&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t really stick, and needs two or three sprays for a whole night out.</li>
            <li>smell very weel</li>
            <li>Reasonable staying power</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Very addicting.</li>
            <li>I paid 21.74 free S&amp;H Look like the original,smells almost like the original,BUT SCENT WON&#x27;T LAST!</li>
            <li>girls have almost always asked what cologne I&#x27;m wearing and they really like the smell.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>bottle contains about 3 times as much as the one I had.</li>
            <li>Has a very punget non quality smell.</li>
            <li>, they really like the smell of it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it specially for those who don&#x27;t like heavy strong fragrances.</li>
            <li>I have a large cologne collection and this scent gets the most compliments hands down.</li>
            <li>Spectacular essence, woody, long lasting on the skin, would buy again..!</li>
            <li>Excellent standard fragrance for the modern man, is the common use daily for work.</li>
            <li>It last for about 3-4 hours and it smells sweet.</li>
            <li>In the department stores, I normally see it priced about 3 times as much as from this buyer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent scent for me.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance is more the former than the latter, and it lasts 5-6 hours upon application.  </li>
            <li>So I wanted to take a quick second to point out the value that you are receiving when you purchase this cologne through amazon prime.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>In regards to everyone having their own preference over their fragrances it is hard to describe a smell.</li>
            <li>smells fruity and made for that special long term relationship.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells surprisingly amazing to say the least for the price you pay.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, it lasts for hours if not days (at least if you spray some on your clothing) my girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li>A great cologne for going out at night or a casual day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a strong scent for sure, but the box that came from Amazon was sealed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the average strong cologne.</li>
            <li>Very soft and strong at the same time and a scent that will last all day.</li>
            <li>It Smells Great but only last about an hour or so, probably its fake but can&#x27;t expect  much for the price!!!</li>
            <li>It smells so amazing it will last long so the bottle doesn&#x27;t finish quietly .</li>
            <li>Plus, because it&#x27;s a new scent, he smells like a new man:p...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll gift the bottle to an old man!</li>
            <li>and it is bigger and way much cheaper</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>It will turn you into a magnet for both the married and single women...</li>
            <li>Well worth the money spent!</li>
            <li>Decent fragrance for daily use...</li>
            <li>like usual .... smells amazing but wont last for long</li>
            <li>a vanilla + dried sweet fruit?  </li>
            <li>It smells pretty much the same but smell goes away in less than 1h.</li>
            <li>Other scents that work well for me are Givenchy&#x27;s &amp;#34;Play Intense&amp;#34; and the famous &amp;#34;Jovan Musk&amp;#34; (though the musk is a totally different scent than the other two).  </li>
            <li>I was recently at Target and found this exact same cologne for twice as much and HALF THE SIZE.</li>
            <li>Nice fragance, but does not last very long, and I mean like one hour or two</li>
            <li>At first sniff, it smelled a tiny tiny tiny (seriously really tiny) bit feminine.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really describe the contents of scents that make this up, but it&#x27;s definitely &amp;#34;seductive.&amp;#34; It always lures people in and makes them curious about the brand.</li>
            <li>To an average person it is pretty musky and standard.</li>
            <li>Sweet and fruity scent that isn&#x27;t as common.</li>
            <li>Do not buy this product as it has been diluted and fails to last more than the first few minutes after application.</li>
            <li>It smells good to bad</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Smell cheap fragrance .</li>
            <li> Cheap as hell...</li>
            <li> Fantastic bottle.</li>
            <li> Cologne was genuine, but guys: DO NOT BUY &#x27;Guess Seductive Men Edt&#x27; from anyone.</li>
            <li> Dispite of being cheap</li>
            <li> Not to strong Nivce sweet Smell.</li>
            <li> Very mild perfume, very classic, very manly, very sophisticated.</li>
            <li> It was the rich advertising that got me to buy this.</li>
            <li> It makes me smell clean and trustworthy, and lends itself well to image management at work.</li>
            <li> The scent will last a good long while and it is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Buy nothing special about it.</li>
            <li> Sweet but not too feminine.</li>
            <li> Has some sweet tandems.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet smelling but not perfert.</li>
            <li> I find that girls really respond well to this refreshingly sophisticated scent.</li>
            <li> It is a super gift.  </li>
            <li> fragrance goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> and we are overall, very pleased.</li>
            <li> Lasts long and extremely good fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great cologne, attracts many compliments, and furthermore, finding it on amazon for less than half the price of any store made it that much better!</li>
            <li> It smells very nice on him, very manly and not soft or powdery.</li>
            <li> Amazing scent at about a third</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff on me, it&#x27;s great a everyday fragrance.</li>
            <li> its definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> the preducto arrive at the expected time and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Makes you smell nice and feel manly at the same time.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Warning ; if you&#x27;re looking for a cologne that&#x27;s strong and super super masculine, this probably isn&#x27;t the one for you.</li>
            <li> You definitely need to reapply, but it smells really nice.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice and it doesn&#x27;t has a huge hit you in your face fragrance like the other brand.</li>
            <li> it does not last too long but for the one who don´t smell too much will be perfect choice.</li>
            <li> I had to order another right away.</li>
            <li> The price was right.</li>
            <li> Other than by agreeing that this particular cologne by Guess smells great.</li>
            <li> Super great fragrance as always from Guess and for the price paid, i can&#x27;t complaint at all with this purchase..........</li>
            <li> It has been smelling great for the past 6 hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s vibrant and fresh on application, but after drying, it softens into a soapy-lavender/floral smell that has tremendous staying power and projection.  </li>
            <li> Gross, overly sweet and strong.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it for that special someone in your life.</li>
            <li> the samples seemed better, its a light fresh smell but doesnt last long, Its a great for late night scent,I will enjoy it</li>
            <li> Good small for the first time buying cologne!</li>
            <li> Great smell and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have got 2 complements the first day I put it on.</li>
            <li> Nelly&#x27;s out there ;)</li>
            <li> Worry it has been discontinued and might not be able to find it in the future.</li>
            <li> Many female friends had asked what cologne I use.</li>
            <li> It was my first try , i was expecting  </li>
            <li> it would appear to be at least as great as Guess for Men</li>
            <li> but I feel it takes a lot more volume sprayed on oneself to be noticeable enough, but at the price that&#x27;s not an issue.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing guess spray.</li>
            <li> First time I buy it on amazon and not in a store.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure all the one or two stars were generated from a younger market population.</li>
            <li> I got my first bottle when I was 18 and now I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly sweet but still masculine...</li>
            <li> It is way too loud, too sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit more feminine than you might expect, but maybe a better word is subtle.</li>
            <li> Smells good , kinda like skittles but doesn&#x27;t last long thats why it lost a star.</li>
            <li> I used this in the morning and then ran 3 miles after work and can no longer smell the scent, but it was still going strong in the office prior to my run.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells good, but I feel that the scent does not last long.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping highly recommend</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone!.</li>
            <li> They really like it.</li>
            <li> and yes it&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t really stick, and needs two or three sprays for a whole night out.</li>
            <li> smell very weel</li>
            <li> Reasonable staying power</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very addicting.</li>
            <li> I paid 21.74 free S&amp;H Look like the original,smells almost like the original,BUT SCENT WON&#x27;T LAST!</li>
            <li> girls have almost always asked what cologne I&#x27;m wearing and they really like the smell.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> bottle contains about 3 times as much as the one I had.</li>
            <li> Has a very punget non quality smell.</li>
            <li> , they really like the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it specially for those who don&#x27;t like heavy strong fragrances.</li>
            <li> I have a large cologne collection and this scent gets the most compliments hands down.</li>
            <li> Spectacular essence, woody, long lasting on the skin, would buy again..!</li>
            <li> Excellent standard fragrance for the modern man, is the common use daily for work.</li>
            <li> It last for about 3-4 hours and it smells sweet.</li>
            <li> In the department stores, I normally see it priced about 3 times as much as from this buyer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent scent for me.  </li>
            <li> This fragrance is more the former than the latter, and it lasts 5-6 hours upon application.  </li>
            <li> So I wanted to take a quick second to point out the value that you are receiving when you purchase this cologne through amazon prime.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> In regards to everyone having their own preference over their fragrances it is hard to describe a smell.</li>
            <li> smells fruity and made for that special long term relationship.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells surprisingly amazing to say the least for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, it lasts for hours if not days (at least if you spray some on your clothing) my girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> A great cologne for going out at night or a casual day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a strong scent for sure, but the box that came from Amazon was sealed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the average strong cologne.</li>
            <li> Very soft and strong at the same time and a scent that will last all day.</li>
            <li> It Smells Great but only last about an hour or so, probably its fake but can&#x27;t expect  much for the price!!!</li>
            <li> It smells so amazing it will last long so the bottle doesn&#x27;t finish quietly .</li>
            <li> Plus, because it&#x27;s a new scent, he smells like a new man:p...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll gift the bottle to an old man!</li>
            <li> and it is bigger and way much cheaper</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> It will turn you into a magnet for both the married and single women...</li>
            <li> Well worth the money spent!</li>
            <li> Decent fragrance for daily use...</li>
            <li> like usual .... smells amazing but wont last for long</li>
            <li> a vanilla + dried sweet fruit?  </li>
            <li> It smells pretty much the same but smell goes away in less than 1h.</li>
            <li> Other scents that work well for me are Givenchy&#x27;s &amp;#34;Play Intense&amp;#34; and the famous &amp;#34;Jovan Musk&amp;#34; (though the musk is a totally different scent than the other two).  </li>
            <li> I was recently at Target and found this exact same cologne for twice as much and HALF THE SIZE.</li>
            <li> Nice fragance, but does not last very long, and I mean like one hour or two</li>
            <li> At first sniff, it smelled a tiny tiny tiny (seriously really tiny) bit feminine.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really describe the contents of scents that make this up, but it&#x27;s definitely &amp;#34;seductive.&amp;#34; It always lures people in and makes them curious about the brand.</li>
            <li> To an average person it is pretty musky and standard.</li>
            <li> Sweet and fruity scent that isn&#x27;t as common.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product as it has been diluted and fails to last more than the first few minutes after application.</li>
            <li> It smells good to bad</li>
            <li> long lasting</li>
            <li> Smell won&#x27;t even last that long  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like, though.  </li>
            <li> The lid takes some effort to remove and the metal part of the bottle is already starting to come loose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a no-brainer to just wait a few extra days to get the product online for half the price.</li>
            <li> He loves the smell but it doesn&#x27;t linger for long.</li>
            <li> I  had to put double sided tape to keep the lid on other than that I would recommend this to a friend</li>
            <li> I do like the smell however compared to other colognes of the similar price</li>
            <li> A very seductive yet subtle scent.  </li>
            <li> I find that once the scent starts to dry out, the skittles smell goes away and there is a lighter but fruitier scent that remains.</li>
            <li> Not to mention this thing lasts for a really really long time which is a totally plus for me since I use this almost everyday.</li>
            <li> and I still have a little left.</li>
            <li> The packaging was pristine, it shipped promptly, arrived sooner than expected</li>
            <li> Just as expected from Guess.  </li>
            <li> Had bought less than half the size at Walgreens for double the price</li>
            <li> The smell lasts for about 5-6 hrs  (sprayed like 3-4 small puffs around chest, mid section, and</li>
            <li> It will last not more than 5 hours.</li>
            <li> and I purchased this along with 2 other brands (Thalium and Pherx) to compare them all</li>
            <li> an worried about these other chicks</li>
            <li> It stays for a couple of hours and fades quickly after that, so a bit of a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I received the fake one.....went for this seeing the positive reviews ....</li>
            <li> A couple of sprays last for at least 4-5 hours.</li>
            <li> Picked it up here for nearly $15 less.</li>
            <li> My husband was a Ralph Lauren Polo Black wearer</li>
            <li> Still using it, not even half way gone.  </li>
            <li> Vanilla portion of this scent fades too soon (less than 3 hours) leaving the acrid base.&lt;br /&gt;Initial scent is a pleasent vanilla but lacks any overtones of a manly or musk type scent.  </li>
            <li> Expensive fragrances tend to have multiple layers or notes, whereas cheaper fragrances tend to smell one-dimensional and flat.  </li>
            <li> It might be a little &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; for my tastes</li>
            <li> but I wish it lasted a little bit longer...</li>
            <li> Cologne could have been a little stronger.</li>
            <li> Very dark.  </li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unnecessary and possibly harmful.</li>
            <li> I have been asked what I was wearing quite a few times.</li>
            <li> the smell lasts less than 1 hour !</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews for products I buy online</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is very wide but thin.</li>
            <li> I bought this from the seller FragranceNet, and while it doesn&#x27;t appear to be fake, the scent does not stay on for too long.</li>
            <li> I lost my hard earned money</li>
            <li> and this was the least seductive of the scents.</li>
            <li> This product is ridiculously under-priced (not that I&#x27;m complaining).  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this</li>
            <li> and I never loved it 100%.</li>
            <li> if you guys want something delicate but stong this is your product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy at all .</li>
            <li> This is not a pleasing smell and the musky base note will linger under your nose for a while; until you saturate your surroundings with a different cologne.</li>
            <li> The reports of this stuff being fake is ludicrous.</li>
            <li> Blind buy.</li>
            <li> You can go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> two qualms would be: 1) Stop using fake coloring in the cologne.</li>
            <li> and it was kinda expensive of course at the mall</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, this Cologne is not for me.</li>
            <li> Girls just go crazy about it...</li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>
            <li> Hate this smell!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> smells really good. Well the fragrance stayed for 6 hours. What else do you expect? its definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> A very seductive yet subtle scent.  JYEAH!!</li>
            <li> Realy good fragrance, I am loving it</li>
            <li> Great smelling cologne and the ladies love it as well.</li>
            <li> In regards to everyone having their own preference over their fragrances it is hard to describe a smell. Other than by agreeing that this particular cologne by Guess smells great. My suggestion is to visit a retailer such as Macy&#x27;s, Sears, or Penney&#x27;s where you can sample the cologne. Once you find what you like go on amazon or return to this seller and order the item. Seductive by Guess is $65 at Macy&#x27;s or $32 from this seller. It&#x27;s really a no-brainer to just wait a few extra days to get the product online for half the price.</li>
            <li> It was a good deal and the fragrance is nice. It might be a little &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; for my tastes but it was a great price.</li>
            <li> My son is a player and he said that girls were complimenting his cologne all day! XD</li>
            <li> Great smell and last a long time. Lots of compliments on it! Will order again!</li>
            <li> very good, fast, high quality</li>
            <li> Not so great! Didn&#x27;t like the smell. Realized its just a regular cologne, n thought it could make a good gift.</li>
            <li> It is a super gift.  Not over powering. Thank You.</li>
            <li> this was my boyfriends gift for xmas and he absolutely loved it!!!! amazon is the best I swear :)</li>
            <li> the preducto arrive at the expected time and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend&lt;br /&gt;excellent cologne smells good</li>
            <li> This is great smelling stuff. I have got 2 complements the first day I put it on. The reports of this stuff being fake is ludicrous. It has been smelling great for the past 6 hours. I hope this helps some of you nervous Nelly&#x27;s out there ;)</li>
            <li> Amazing scent at about a third you&#x27;d pay in the store.</li>
            <li> I bought this from the seller FragranceNet, and while it doesn&#x27;t appear to be fake, the scent does not stay on for too long. It stays for a couple of hours and fades quickly after that, so a bit of a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and we both love it! Smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Is a amazing fragance, and notes are very strong, from morning to night people can profite your fragance</li>
            <li> the samples seemed better, its a light fresh smell but doesnt last long, Its a great for late night scent,I will enjoy it but I will replace with others</li>
            <li> smells really good, good price love it</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on the mostly rave reviews. My husband and I neither one had ever actually smelled it before so I guess it was a calculated risk but it turned out well. It smells very nice on him, very manly and not soft or powdery. The packaging was pristine, it shipped promptly, arrived sooner than expected and we are overall, very pleased. If it is a knock off, we wouldn&#x27;t have any way of knowing since we didn&#x27;t have anything to compare it to (it doesn&#x27;t have the mostly alcohol smell in most knock offs) but we are happy with it and it is a BIG bottle for the price!</li>
            <li> Best cologne on the market the day I sprayed it on me I had to order another right away.</li>
            <li> I got this cologne for my brother and best guy friend they both love it a lot . I love the  scent of this cologne! It smells so amazing it will last long so the bottle doesn&#x27;t finish quietly .</li>
            <li> I love this men edt spray. It smells really nice and it doesn&#x27;t has a huge hit you in your face fragrance like the other brand. I never have any problems with GUESS before and all of their product are top notch. Not to mention this thing lasts for a really really long time which is a totally plus for me since I use this almost everyday. So guys stop buying those cheap Axe or Oldspice spray and get this one instead. Makes you smell nice and feel manly at the same time. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Super great fragrance as always from Guess and for the price paid, i can&#x27;t complaint at all with this purchase..........</li>
            <li> Not as expected.&lt;br /&gt;Too strong, fruity.&lt;br /&gt;Nautica Voyage &amp; Eau Sauvage from Dior is allot better.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this online!  I saved a ton of money compared to buying it at someplace in the mall.  it is the same stuff and there is a ton of it.  It smells great and my wife is still with me, so it must be working great.  My girlfriend likes it to (that is just a joke, I just have the wife).&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is solid, and well-built.  It is not a knock-off at all.  I have taken the container with me on road trips and it is sturdy, don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking glass.</li>
            <li> Love when my husband uses it!</li>
            <li> Blind buy. The price was right.</li>
            <li> Very good product, started using it 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> Softer than i thought But good</li>
            <li> Love it .. everyone else loves it too</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved it...what more could I want?</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and it smells fantastic on him!</li>
            <li> Nice scent for business occasions!</li>
            <li> It made me feel like the Pied Piper . Definetly a great buy .</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have a good smell like I thought It would</li>
            <li> Good item an fast shipping the lady in my office keep asking me about the name of the cologne an I tell them Guess good spring , summer cologne an good price .</li>
            <li> Smells good , kinda like skittles but doesn&#x27;t last long thats why it lost a star.</li>
            <li> The scent reminds me of the last funeral I was at.My fault for buying a cheap cologne.Wrapped it back up and gave it to a nephew who was graduating the eight grade.</li>
            <li> It arrived in perfect condition.Love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent cologne. I recommend it for everyone.</li>
            <li> People weren&#x27;t kidding when they say the initial scent resembles a bag of skittles. I find that once the scent starts to dry out, the skittles smell goes away and there is a lighter but fruitier scent that remains. It&#x27;s not a strong scent for sure, but the box that came from Amazon was sealed. The UPC code and packaging seems to be genuine. I used this in the morning and then ran 3 miles after work and can no longer smell the scent, but it was still going strong in the office prior to my run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is very wide but thin. The lid takes some effort to remove and the metal part of the bottle is already starting to come loose. The retail price of this is about twice that of Amazon&#x27;s price, but the bottle and lid aren&#x27;t as well made as Armani or Chanel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 5/5 stars, an inexpensive addition to your scent collection. Sweet and fruity scent that isn&#x27;t as common.</li>
            <li> The smell lasts for about 5-6 hrs  (sprayed like 3-4 small puffs around chest, mid section, and lower back).If you want to feel good and smell great I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Nice bottle but the scent last about 10 minutes</li>
            <li> Great cologne, attracts many compliments, and furthermore, finding it on amazon for less than half the price of any store made it that much better! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my honey on Father&#x27;s Day.  He loved the scent and so do I!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great cologne since I use it during the day. It last for about 3-4 hours and it smells sweet. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for going out at night, but it has a good strong, sweet scent for being out during the day.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping highly recommend</li>
            <li> Just as expected from Guess.  Sweet but not too feminine.</li>
            <li> Smells great, would buy again and recommend it</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift for my dad, and he loved it. It was a lot larger than I was expecting, and the presentation was great.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling colonge and seems to last for a good part of the day&lt;br /&gt;The lid doesn&#x27;t stay on so is it off a reject line? I  had to put double sided tape to keep the lid on other than that I would recommend this to a friend</li>
            <li> Awesome..! Spectacular essence, woody, long lasting on the skin, would buy again..!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Took forever to get though.  Should&#x27;ve just gone to the mall. Very sexy.  i love the way it smells on a man.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is good for the money you pay . Buy nothing special about it. The fragrance last for about 4 hours . Smell cheap fragrance . Ok for what you pay . I won&#x27;t buy again . On my undrestand you can use this fragrance and any type of weather .</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son but i don&#x27;t like the sent for him.</li>
            <li> I jst received this product I must say! This smells great!! I love it I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone!.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews for products I buy online but this time I have to.&lt;br /&gt;I love everything about this product, literally everything.</li>
            <li> if you guys want something delicate but stong this is your product! its chip and has a unique fragance ! only for machos!</li>
            <li> The smell is great and it makes for  great gift.  My father loved it. Fast delivery and great price for the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Saw this at Target, smells great.  Picked it up here for nearly $15 less.</li>
            <li> the smell lasts less than 1 hour !</li>
            <li> I had this before. I love walking by people and they catch the smell of me. They love it!</li>
            <li> one of my favorites. it smells very smooth and inticing</li>
            <li> You can go wrong with this one. It will turn you into a magnet for both the married and single women...yes, it&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li> Love Guess Seductive. Worry it has been discontinued and might not be able to find it in the future. Many female friends had asked what cologne I use. They really like it.</li>
            <li> It was my first try , i was expecting  it would appear to be at least as great as Guess for Men but i was wrong, its ok though but cant come even close to Guess for Men, its my number one cologne</li>
            <li> Best cologne I&#x27;ve ever used. At this price versus $60 at the mall, it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells surprisingly amazing to say the least for the price you pay. I was shocked. Has some sweet tandems. Good to wear on a date.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent scent for me.  Of course, each person&#x27;s body chemistry is what decides whether a scent is good or not.  Other scents that work well for me are Givenchy&#x27;s &amp;#34;Play Intense&amp;#34; and the famous &amp;#34;Jovan Musk&amp;#34; (though the musk is a totally different scent than the other two).  This one doesn&#x27;t smell seductive on me, but rather complementary to my attitude.  It makes me smell clean and trustworthy, and lends itself well to image management at work.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, it lasts for hours if not days (at least if you spray some on your clothing) my girlfriend loves it. Not to mention this bottle is huge!!! This is going to last me forever! Great buy!</li>
            <li> excellent fragrance recommend</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff on me, it&#x27;s great a everyday fragrance. It&#x27;s manly yet not too overpowering. I get many compliments from my clients on this cologne.</li>
            <li> Nice sent but the spray tip broke in couple uses. Therefore had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> Loved the smell. Had bought less than half the size at Walgreens for double the price so I returned it and saved a bundle. Thank you AMAZON</li>
            <li> My Dad Loves This Great Gift For A Father In My Opinion</li>
            <li> The delivery was timely but I don&#x27;t especially like the cologne.</li>
            <li> very happy with purchase,it was a quick and easy transaction. the product was just as described and i am very happy with it</li>
            <li> Smells so good.  Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Very good price and yes it&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li> long lasting and I constantly receive compliments about how I smell.</li>
            <li> Cologne smell&#x27;s awesome, good for young adults. Excellent value with super fast shipping. This would make a great gift.</li>
            <li> A great cologne for going out at night or a casual day. I&#x27;ve only worn it three times and I&#x27;ve received compliments on it. Its strong, but not too strong. All three times the smell has lasted 10+ hours</li>
            <li> Great scent! My guy loves it plus is smells wonderful on him. It&#x27;s slightly sweet but still masculine... Definitely yummy.</li>
            <li> Smell won&#x27;t even last that long  SMH ....  waste of money</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this but it smells great . I like this as an evening perfume. Very mild perfume, very classic, very manly, very sophisticated. Once applied the scent does not fade until washed.&lt;br /&gt;Summary - price and purchase both Just awesome.</li>
            <li> Great price, smells great, and super fast delivery.  This was a great stocking stuffer for my older boy.  Bought it without ever sampling in a department store.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect gift for that special someone.  Price was great and the quality was excellent.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> It smells good to bad it doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li> love it smells good and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Good smell for night use</li>
            <li> Appealing smell to ladies</li>
            <li> And I bought it. Cheap as hell... But my professor at school wears the $300 a bottle stuff... She smells pretty good, but... Idk. are boutique scents that much better?</li>
            <li> My husband was a Ralph Lauren Polo Black wearer and I never loved it 100%. Came across a sample of this in a magazine and I love it! Smells wonderful! Very nice, but not too overpowering. Plus, because it&#x27;s a new scent, he smells like a new man:p...Hubba hubba....</li>
            <li> Excellent product&lt;br /&gt;The perfume smell awesome, it&#x27;s the first time I use  Guess Seductive I love it!!!! My wife love it too</li>
            <li> Very good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Good  smell.. you  should  use  it at  night ..</li>
            <li> Great product and great service.</li>
            <li> Guess&#x27; Seductive for Men is an impressive cologne. The smell is a bit more feminine than you might expect, but maybe a better word is subtle. It smells fresh and is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My two qualms would be: 1) Stop using fake coloring in the cologne. It&#x27;s unnecessary and possibly harmful. 2) Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t really stick, and needs two or three sprays for a whole night out.</li>
            <li> The smell only lasts 10 minutes – no exaggeration. Do not buy this product as it has been diluted and fails to last more than the first few minutes after application. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> smell very weel i love it</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic!  Warm, sexy, kind of a vanilla + dried sweet fruit?  Very dark.  Reasonable staying power but I feel it takes a lot more volume sprayed on oneself to be noticeable enough, but at the price that&#x27;s not an issue.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This product is ridiculously under-priced (not that I&#x27;m complaining).  It&#x27;s vibrant and fresh on application, but after drying, it softens into a soapy-lavender/floral smell that has tremendous staying power and projection.  Expensive fragrances tend to have multiple layers or notes, whereas cheaper fragrances tend to smell one-dimensional and flat.  This fragrance is more the former than the latter, and it lasts 5-6 hours upon application.  I think this fragrance is equally suitable for the office or a night on the town.</li>
            <li> Nice spray for its price . smells fruity and made for that special long term relationship. This is my first time purchasing guess spray.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price</li>
            <li> Great Scent. Very addicting. Will buy again!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great fragance</li>
            <li> excellent product and one heck of a good price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet smelling but not perfert.</li>
            <li> So I wanted to take a quick second to point out the value that you are receiving when you purchase this cologne through amazon prime. I was recently at Target and found this exact same cologne for twice as much and HALF THE SIZE. I kid you not. This 3.4 ounce bottle will literally last forever unless you are a man whore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the smell is wonderful. It may not last for days but it will get you through the night. I find that girls really respond well to this refreshingly sophisticated scent. Smelling good has never... smelt so good? Good purchase!</li>
            <li> It smells good but after 20 minutes goes away . Something going on . I&#x27;m not happy at all .</li>
            <li> This fragrance has a sweet, erotic smell with the potential to hypnotize both wearer and innocent bystander!</li>
            <li> great product and great price. The smell is great as well and the ladies love it that is why they call it seduction.</li>
            <li> Excellent standard fragrance for the modern man, is the common use daily for work.</li>
            <li> Aweson, the best choice</li>
            <li> Well,You got what you paid, I tried to save money, &amp; I lost it, Well,the fragrance smells like 85% of the original,The scent won&#x27;t last! I paid 21.74 free S&amp;H Look like the original,smells almost like the original,BUT SCENT WON&#x27;T LAST! THAT&#x27;S MY OPINION!!</li>
            <li> loved it smell is awesome not to mention a great price</li>
            <li> This cologne smells so good! One of the best. Definitely worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> Great smell! I bought this for my husband. It smells so good on him, and is a very masculine smell.</li>
            <li> Perfect, came in on time and smells great!&lt;br /&gt;Many compliments</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my husband as a Christmas Present and He loves it, it smells really good</li>
            <li> This quickly moved to the top of my favorites.  Doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like, though.  I will be ordering more to stock up in case they discontinue, which seems to happen a lot in this business.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery...smells great...great value.. This cologne is just as good as my gucci...</li>
            <li> My girl friend likes it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has a great smell, not too strong.</li>
            <li> Hate this smell! Not recommended; keep distance from this!</li>
            <li> Sprayed this upon myself &amp; got layed the very first time....must buy!</li>
            <li> NICE NICE NICE.. I LOVE THIS OUT OF ALL COLOGNES I USE .......Smells GREAT !!!! Woman that Blow me Love it. Not to strong Nivce sweet Smell.Last 4 hours.</li>
            <li> Fantastic bottle. Amazing perfume</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s great. Not as good as Versace or Polo etc, but what do you expect for $20.</li>
            <li> It Smells Great but only last about an hour or so, probably its fake but can&#x27;t expect  much for the price!!!</li>
            <li> Very very very good smelling came fast</li>
            <li> Warning ; if you&#x27;re looking for a cologne that&#x27;s strong and super super masculine, this probably isn&#x27;t the one for you. At first sniff, it smelled a tiny tiny tiny (seriously really tiny) bit feminine. It&#x27;s not the average strong cologne. It&#x27;s something a bit different but girls have almost always asked what cologne I&#x27;m wearing and they really like the smell. I would highly recommend it to a fellow dude and even a couple dude friends said that it smelled really good and wanted to buy it for themselves haha.</li>
            <li> Smelled this one in a Target ,I just sprayed once on mu hand and I kept smelling it all day,and decided I must buy it.&lt;br /&gt;Found good price here and bought it. Smells good I get a lot of compliments ,and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it! The fragrance is light &amp; sexy!</li>
            <li> My hubby smells soooooo good!</li>
            <li> My husband gets a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> Good small for the first time buying cologne!</li>
            <li> It is very mild. It will last not more than 5 hours.</li>
            <li> fragrance goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> Bought one for my husband and one for my younger brother. They both love it!</li>
            <li> Smells good, but I feel that the scent does not last long.</li>
            <li> love it! smells good.</li>
            <li> Great smelling cologne. Girlfriend loves the smell too. I have been asked what I was wearing quite a few times.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money spent!</li>
            <li> First time I buy it on amazon and not in a store. It smells pretty much the same but smell goes away in less than 1h. Not to happy with this.</li>
            <li> Lasts long and extremely good fragrance.</li>
            <li> Good buy and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I got this cologne guess deductive  before and it was kinda expensive of course at the mall but now I got it at amazon and it is bigger and way much cheaper I love it...</li>
            <li> I have a large cologne collection and this scent gets the most compliments hands down. Girls and guys always ask what cologne I&#x27;m wearing. Ladies love to smell it and guys always want to buy for themselves. The longevity and projection is great. I can&#x27;t really describe the contents of scents that make this up, but it&#x27;s definitely &amp;#34;seductive.&amp;#34; It always lures people in and makes them curious about the brand. This is my signature scent and I wear it all the time. I love how it smells and makes me feel.</li>
            <li> Gross, overly sweet and strong.  Not at all what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> This is the best perfume ever!</li>
            <li> The product is as described and the bottle is huge for the price.  In the department stores, I normally see it priced about 3 times as much as from this buyer.</li>
            <li> Still using it, not even half way gone.  Good smell, girls love it :-D  Highly recommend it for that special someone in your life. ;-)</li>
            <li> Smell is amazing! Get lots of compliments with this smell. Very great price as well!</li>
            <li> Yuck!! Cologne was genuine, but guys: DO NOT BUY &#x27;Guess Seductive Men Edt&#x27; from anyone. Gosh, the repugnant, time-honoured, old-man rooted scent! This is not a pleasing smell and the musky base note will linger under your nose for a while; until you saturate your surroundings with a different cologne. I&#x27;m sure all the one or two stars were generated from a younger market population. I&#x27;ll gift the bottle to an old man! It was the rich advertising that got me to buy this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a smaller version of this and it&#x27;s lasted me about 2 years and I still have a little left. I bought this for fear I&#x27;d run out because it&#x27;s just that great. I use it on dates and girls that I actually give a rat&#x27;s ass about. I got my first bottle when I was 18 and now I&#x27;m 21.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle contains about 3 times as much as the one I had. It&#x27;ll last a decade.</li>
            <li> Nice fragance, but does not last very long, and I mean like one hour or two</li>
            <li> it replaces all my other sent, great stuff!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Actually, it is a very nice cologne, it is light attractive and people like it. Moreover it was delivered on time and with elegant status. I highly recommend it specially for those who don&#x27;t like heavy strong fragrances.</li>
            <li> Decent fragrance for daily use...</li>
            <li> Great smell, good price</li>
            <li> Nice product, and happy with it</li>
            <li> Great and rapid service!</li>
            <li> Love the scent of it. And my wife loves it also!!</li>
            <li> like usual .... smells amazing but wont last for long</li>
            <li> Smells Amazing. Brought it as a gift for my husband. Great smell.</li>
            <li> The women love it so I can&#x27;t complain...</li>
            <li> It smell deliciuos the only reason it was rated with 4 star is beacuse it does not last too long but for the one who don´t smell too much will be perfect choice.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very short . Had very good expectations to buy it. Why not recommend</li>
            <li> Cologne didn&#x27;t smell anything like the one in the stores. Has a very punget non quality smell.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daddy. He loves the smell but it doesn&#x27;t linger for long. You definitely need to reapply, but it smells really nice.</li>
            <li> smells really good not like the knock off brands,i would buy it again</li>
            <li> Girls just go crazy about it... besides the quality and the nice looking bottle I personally like the fragrance very happy with it! 100% recommended,</li>
            <li> Nice to use on special occasions. Nice smell and gives you great confidence. Try it and you will love it guys!!</li>
            <li> Great cologne.  Get a lot of compliments from ladies.</li>
            <li> smell great women love it thanks</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and I must have misread the descripton. I thought I was buying the one with the blue lid.  I am not a fan of this scent at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good smell. To an average person it is pretty musky and standard. I do like the smell however compared to other colognes of the similar price</li>
            <li> Woow that&#x27;s nice. I love it</li>
            <li> Great product, swift delivery!</li>
            <li> Awesome cologne. Smells great. Great price.</li>
            <li> Vanilla portion of this scent fades too soon (less than 3 hours) leaving the acrid base.&lt;br /&gt;Initial scent is a pleasent vanilla but lacks any overtones of a manly or musk type scent.  I mention this part as the product is called Seductive and I purchased this along with 2 other brands (Thalium and Pherx) to compare them all and this was the least seductive of the scents.</li>
            <li> Great smell... i like it. Dispite of being cheap the smell is good.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell strong but I wish it lasted a little bit longer... I like it.</li>
            <li> both  perfumes,they are not orginal, I use it once after 10 minutes I dont even feel it</li>
            <li> Smells so good.  Would buy again</li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s my favorite -- compliments galore when I wear it. A couple of sprays last for at least 4-5 hours.</li>
            <li> This perfume stay for 5 min max</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance.It was well received.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, this Cologne is not for me. It is way too loud, too sweet smelling. The scent will last a good long while and it is a great buy. Amazon is a great place to shop, on this purchase, I overlooked the reviews. Hope this helps. Good day</li>
            <li> Cologne could have been a little stronger.</li>
            <li> Everyone is always asking me what kind of cologne im wearing and where they can get it, they really like the smell of it.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and my boyfriend loves it!</li>
            <li> Man I took a chance in buying by not being able to smell it but got damn this some good smelling cologne best I have ever bought. the wife already saying I can&#x27;t wear it with out her around cause it smell to good an worried about these other chicks lol</li>
            <li> I received the fake one.....went for this seeing the positive reviews ....I lost my hard earned money</li>
            <li> Bought this cologne without knowing the scent of it. I was hoping it would be as good as the others, but let me tell you that it smells amazing. Very soft and strong at the same time and a scent that will last all day. Very fast delivery and super satisfactory!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very rich perfume, it stays on the skin for all day .... excellent product ....</li>
