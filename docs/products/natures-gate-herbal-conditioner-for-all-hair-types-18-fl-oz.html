            <li>An executive at a company I once worked for used to bury his face in my hair every day, because my hair smelled so good.</li>
            <li>this stuff smells so good, I&#x27;ve experimented and found another use for it:</li>
            <li>but I wanted to be fair and give it a try.</li>
            <li>Good for scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>I would recommend anyone give this product a fair shake.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>smells so nice, good ingredients.</li>

            <li>The men in my family really love this shampoo - it&#x27;s a keeper!  </li>
            <li>I have tried some of their other conditioners, but this seems to be the best, and best selling, one.</li>
            <li>It smells like amazing incense to me,</li>
            <li>Smells nice and helps combat the drying caused by the Natures Gate shampoo</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ve just gone nose-blind to it, but honestly?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll find myself stopping to smell my own hair on some days.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>Nice, earthy scent.</li>
            <li>The real product from Nature&#x27;s Gate is wonderful, I&#x27;ve used it for years.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>This seems to add a lot of body to my hair and a nice herbal scent stays with me.  </li>
            <li>I liked the texture and how it conditions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a nice product.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>The odor is VERY strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still VERY strong.</li>
            <li>(but there&#x27;s a LOT of it) and tangles very easily.  </li>
            <li>When it opened it the smell was very strong</li>
            <li>It has a great, herbal smell which I love - not a traditional \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; smell but a wonderful natural herbal smell - I love it!!!</li>
            <li>I have always loved Nature&#x27;s Gate&#x27;s original shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Someone on here referred to it as being like \\&quot;an amazing incense\\&quot;, and that&#x27;s very true.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to maintain a healthy head of hair.</li>
            <li>Just as I enjoyed 30 years ago.</li>
            <li>The smell wasn&#x27;t my favorite off the bat but it has grown on me.</li>
            <li>My kids said I smelled like a hippie shop, which I&#x27;m ok with.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my hair looks.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the smell of this stuff now.</li>
            <li>:)  Update--10/29/15:  </li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with its effectiveness and the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This used to be my favorite shampoo and conditioner for my family&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal Conditioner has been my favorite for years.</li>
            <li>i love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the smell, its just OK.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe someday I&#x27;ll get brave and do the whole baking soda and apple cider vinegar thing, but for now, I&#x27;ll be using this.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner is interesting.</li>
            <li>Knowing that it&#x27;s free of parabens, phthalates, and sodium lauryl sulfate is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>If you like herbal fragrances than this conditioner will be enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>I said sure</li>
            <li>but why did she need more.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Cr&amp;egrave;me De Coco conditioner that I love</li>
            <li>It might even be better than the Bumble and Bumble in regards to healthier</li>
            <li>my hair dries, it has more volume because of this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product since the 1970s, and I&#x27;ve never found a conditioner I like better.</li>
            <li>And I love its scent.</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I rinse, I can&#x27;t escape this conditioner&#x27;s overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>It worked just okay on my hair.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Love this conditioner and use it every day.</li>
            <li>I have been using this since before I had to color, and it is still my favorite.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s like getting a salon quality product for a cheaper price that is more organic.  </li>
            <li>One of my bottles arrived leaking from the lid, otherwise, satisfied.</li>
            <li>My kids love it, and it does get their hair decently clean all on its own, and without the fear of shampoo bubbles getting in their eyes.</li>
            <li>It has a medicinal smell instead of a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li>this is a good product for stressed hair at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>It is much more strong in the shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing though, for the fact it washes out so easily and always leaves my hair feeling super clean and amazingly repaired.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and hard to manage or get to look nice, and my hair seemed to respond best to this conditioner</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure she meant it in a nice way.)</li>
            <li>The conditioner leaves my hair soft, shiny and it smells great.  </li>
            <li>I love conditioners that are filled with natural ingredients, and have used Shea Moisture with great adoration.</li>
            <li>It can be strong, so it may not be what you&#x27;re seeking.</li>
            <li>The smell is overwhelmingly strong.  </li>
            <li>The smell is *really* strong, but I like the scent.</li>
            <li>Smell is way too strong</li>
            <li>The smell is quite strong.</li>
            <li>The way the conditioner works would get 4 stars except the bottles I received the herbal scent is way to strong and over powering.</li>
            <li>is so strong that it literally gives me a headache</li>
            <li>This conditioner is fine for my hair type, but the scent is too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>Buying online is cheaper than buying at Whole Foods, so I am pretty happy.</li>
            <li>Some might not like the brown color, but it&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful, light, daily conditioner that works great on my fine hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This conditioner smells so fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Vegan, cruelty free and smells</li>
            <li>Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal conditioner is so light and creamy like whipped cream but has an earthy herbal texture and scent.</li>
            <li>This is more of a YMMV, but worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>I purchased it because it is cruelty free</li>
            <li>They do claim that it&#x27;s phthalate free</li>
            <li>I like the light fragrance.</li>
            <li>Contains no crap.</li>
            <li>It also seems to do a good job of keeping my scalp in good shape during the harsh winter months.</li>
            <li>I feel good knowing that this conditioner contains primarily natural herbal ingredients.</li>
            <li>After some more research I discovered that the ingredients aren&#x27;t a whole lot better than the sauve I was using before.</li>
            <li>So today I returned all three bottles and will continue looking for products that are natural and smell good.</li>
            <li>The aroma is woodsy and very fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>Try it - clean, none of the &amp;#34;bad stuff&amp;#34; in the commercially available products on the shelves.</li>
            <li>First of all, I LOVE the smell.  </li>
            <li>(So okay, there was this one time where I went to a party and the first thing someone said on meeting me was &amp;#34;Oh</li>
            <li>/&gt;Makes my hair feel weightless, light, with full of shine and volume.</li>
            <li>It feels clean.  </li>
            <li>, it smells clean and not like perfume.</li>
            <li>I ordered this hoping it the conditioner that would be perfect, so central it was natural.</li>
            <li>I usually buy one of these at a time, but being able to buy three for this price was great.  </li>
            <li>I love herbal everything, this is just too much.</li>
            <li>I did use it once when I was a kid and loved it, but remember it smelling the same.  </li>
            <li>really wanted to love this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d dock a star because my husband hates the smell, but I love it so much that I just don&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very shiny and curlier than most conditioners with a lot of body.  </li>
            <li>My scalp is still sometimes itchy but not nearly as bad as it was.</li>
            <li>Some people may not like the strong patchouli scent, but I love all the natural flowers.  </li>
            <li>It also has a pretty strong smell.  </li>
            <li>I agree that it does smell pretty strong while you&#x27;re using it in the bathroom</li>
            <li>Great for fine hair, not too heavy.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair smell fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Feels fresh and clean all day.</li>
            <li>The smell is mild to me but my mother did not like it when she used it during a visit to my house.</li>
            <li>It works well, and this conditioner in particular is light and easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>as a mild hair cleanser.</li>
            <li>I actually have only been using the conditioner and it smells awesome 2 days after washing my hair!</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic-- exactly like the Zum Frankincense &amp; Myrrh product line.</li>
            <li>Great product, but we have GOT to tone down this smell guys.  </li>
            <li>I was at the store and wanted to try something new, and thought this smelled lovely.</li>
            <li>But even when you LOVE a smell, it can still be overwhelming to smell it all day long.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very heavy, so if your hair is super dry you probably want to include something more moisturizing in your regular regimen, but for the oily-haired like me, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>It is not to heavy for my head yet does a great job on the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t enjoy smelling like a forest</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product seeing as how its sulfate free and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>Also, she did not have to use the straightener to get rid of any frizz as it was already straight and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Def you should try it, it is worth the price imo</li>
            <li>It is worth your money.</li>
            <li>Healthy and natural.</li>
            <li>So for others with rosacia or acne problems, this might be worth a try.</li>
            <li>The conditioner smells nice but it doesn&#x27;t really make my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>I chose this because it went with the shampoo I thought sounded the most natural of the shampoos I researched.</li>
            <li>I bought this conditioner at a local health food store and have been loving it ever since.</li>
            <li>, more natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even amongst normal conditioners, I had to try many different kinds because my hair is very fine</li>
            <li>I first bought this several years ago because a friend had mentioned using it and how much she loved it for its scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not the right conditioner for me.</li>
            <li>Right away, I was hooked too.</li>
            <li>it really softens the hair and rinses clean.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good all natural conditioner and don&#x27;t need to look further.</li>
            <li>With the conditioner my hair is soft and easy to comb.</li>
            <li>However, it really leaves my hair frizz free, shiny and really manageable.</li>
            <li>but I do need to follow up with an effective conditioner for dry hair.</li>
            <li>Even if it&#x27;s natural, the level of aroma is too strong, and sort of nauseating.</li>
            <li>I can hardly tell it is in my hair after rinsing it out, except that it makes my hair feel thicker, softer and smell great.</li>
            <li>bought the shampoo alone first.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty good for that, but to use after shampooing, it&#x27;s not worth much for me.</li>
            <li>I have pretty oily hair</li>
            <li>More than beneficial for your hair, but the fragrance stays in your hair until the next shampoo.  </li>
            <li>She lives in an area of Louisiana where shopping is challenging with only a Walmart within an hour of where she lives.</li>
            <li>This conditioner looks exactly like diarrhea!\\&quot; But guess what?</li>
            <li>order from DreamUniverseOnline came in genuine containers but the contents of the bottle were clearly not the genuine</li>
            <li>Natural hair care a price comparable to the cheap brands.  </li>
            <li>and I love the nature&#x27;s gate shampoo, but the conditioner was a bit gross</li>
            <li>After the first wash, my daughter&#x27;s hair looked brighter and shinier.  </li>
            <li>Also, the smell can be a little overwhelming for some folks, as it&#x27;s pretty strong.</li>
            <li>I often get compliments from other women that my hair smells nice, an herbal scent.</li>
            <li>But lately I had been getting more and more concerned with all the chemicals being put in my conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s deliciously spicy and woodsy (I hate flowery and fruity scents, which covers a majority of conditioners) without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It is not a terrible scent, just strange.</li>
            <li>The product itself (if they could tone down the smell) is amazing.  </li>
            <li>No nasty chemicals to dry out or ruin our hair.</li>
            <li>My  husband couldn&#x27;t be in the same room as me for days after I used this conditioner because the smell was SO STRONG.</li>
            <li>My niece had a similar experience, her hair looked lighter and she experienced less oil build up throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a little over a month and to be honest?</li>
            <li>However, the conditioner works really well.</li>
            <li>like that it is all-natural and is very affordable.</li>
            <li>I found my lifelong shampoo and conditioner that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li>(I often get comments that it looks like a shampoo commercial because its so smooth).  </li>
            <li>Not so much when it&#x27;s on the scalp.</li>
            <li>The only conditioner I enjoy using.  </li>
            <li>Detangles and rinses out very well without oily residue.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need much moisture</li>
            <li>I really like the scent</li>
            <li>It untangles my hair after shampooing, but it doesn&#x27;t soften my hair so much that it looses its body.</li>
            <li>I thought this was another product in this line, but tried it and really like it.</li>
            <li>The smell lingered in my hair for a whole day.</li>
            <li>Also I had to use sooo much of this conditioner just to saturate my hair.</li>
            <li>It does not change the scent much though.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing.  </li>
            <li>I like this conditioner because it works really well for my hair type and texture.</li>
            <li>At least the herbal shampoo is still good.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t glide smoothly through my hair and instantly untangle it like most other conditioners do.</li>
            <li>So you can imagine that I really wasn&#x27;t excited to hear her to call to me last night from the bath, \\&quot;Mom, come here!</li>
            <li>It left it feeling clean</li>
            <li>Over the years, Fiona has too often compared dishes that I have lovingly prepared for our family to diarrhea: hummus, baba ghanoosh, gumbo, every single curry, jambalaya, red beans and rice, steel cut oatmeal, smoothies, chai.</li>
            <li>So, if you can get past the first week of using it, you&#x27;ll come to love the smell and there will even be days that you wish it were stronger.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this awesome conditioner, especially when it comes to the way it smells.</li>
            <li>I used this at the recommendation of a male clerk working at a natural grocery store who also used it, and it smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner does make my hair soft and smooth and detangles my long wavy and dense hair very well.</li>
            <li>The smell of this conditioner reminds me of the incense I use to burn in high school...</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend to anyone with dandruff or frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>The girls were a little put off by the smell, but tried it anyway and love the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say that there is no other conditioner for me and my family!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost greasy the second day, which I have hair on the more dry side.</li>
            <li>I want to smell it all the time, and luckily, the fragrance stays in my hair for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I do not know about the \\&quot;new and improved\\</li>
            <li>This is amazing for me since I have thin, straight hair.   </li>
            <li>There are thicker conditioners by the same company, so get this only if you want a light conditioner.</li>
            <li>I needed a conditioner that moisturized but didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make flyaways more apparent.</li>
            <li>My favorite for years for my long, colored hair which is oily at the scalp, dry at the ends.</li>
            <li>so it really takes a special conditioner to detangle my mess of hair and this was not it.</li>
            <li>This is not the same product that it used to be, but it&#x27;s still better than other conditioners.  </li>
            <li>And the first time I used it I was totally thrown off by the color…its brown!</li>
            <li>This product not only smells great (though it think you either LOVE the scent or HATE it)</li>
            <li>I wash my hair in the morning and after the first use my pillow that I sleep on had to washed to remove the smell the next day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a wuss, but wow, this is a lot!</li>
            <li>Too much shampoo will make fine hair dry and too little won&#x27;t clean enough.</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo since the first time I used it but the conditioner leaves my hair dry and not smooth.</li>
            <li>Unless you require little to no actual conditioning, think of this more as a shampoo substitute.</li>
            <li>Gently conditions my very oily hair without weighing it down, but I do have to say that you have to use a decent amount.</li>
            <li>I use both the herbal shampoo &amp; conditioner daily, and I really like the scent.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair really soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>All natural is a plus.</li>
            <li>I also have an extremely sensitive scalp</li>
            <li>I had to wash my hair over three times just to smell like me old self</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know about the old conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I also have to apply it twice to get anywhere near the results that I desire.</li>
            <li>I had been having a very itchy scalp (not dandruff related) and it was suggested I try a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Both the conditioner and the shampoo has a creamy soft consistency when massaging it into your hair.</li>
            <li>Yummy smell and conditions completely without greasy result.</li>
            <li>Natural herb and plant based.</li>
            <li>This might work really well for someone with a different hair type.</li>
            <li>And I have pretty dry hair</li>
            <li>used a little too much the first time, I believe.</li>
            <li>The shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell too bad - kind of spicy and sweet when it is in the bottle, but smells like herbs after it dries.  </li>
            <li>Several men have commented on it (one who is used to his wife buying high end conditioner).  </li>
            <li>I also noticed I didn&#x27;t have to reach for my leave-in conditioner when styling in the morning because a quick water/aloe spritz was enough to fluff the bed head.</li>
            <li>I also put a bit into a spray bottle of water (just a few drops) and use that to detangle and style my hair on days that I don&#x27;t do a full shampoo and conditioning.  </li>
            <li>Recently though, they came out with a bottle labelled \\&quot;New Improved\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>My hair is really dry and this works very well.</li>
            <li>Constantly scratching an irritated scalp with gross dandruff for years but even since I&#x27;ve started using this production my hair is much thicker and my dandruff is going away each passing day.</li>
            <li>However, there were 2 major issues that made me stop using this product and give away the leftover bottles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair, so I don&#x27;t usually like leave in conditioners because they tend to weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>NG Conditioner has really helped my hair in particular (3a) with being properly moisturized and still not weighed down or greasy looking.</li>
            <li>It is earthy and woodsy and generally comforting for me.</li>
            <li>I am upset  and wish they would go back to the old formula.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like the old formula back.</li>
            <li>I tried different natural conditioners, but none worked.  </li>
            <li>Second, it works well (as well, or just under my old conditioner).  </li>
            <li>I had been using normal conditioners for a long time.  </li>
            <li>If you are used to higly processed chemical conditioners, it will look odd at first.</li>
            <li>(I have normal to dry, medium length, wavy hair.)</li>
            <li>Additionally, I can stretch out an extra day of no washing without any negative buildup on my hair or scalp, so it&#x27;s an economical choice too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a young man who has always had incredibly dry and frizzy hair throughout my childhood.</li>
            <li>shampoo and conditioner- something that is free of chemicals, at least during the dry winter season.</li>
            <li>It smells very herby + perhaps with a little bit of pine smell?</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Smells so good.</li>
            <li> An executive at a company I once worked for used to bury his face in my hair every day, because my hair smelled so good.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells so good, I&#x27;ve experimented and found another use for it:</li>
            <li> but I wanted to be fair and give it a try.</li>
            <li> Good for scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend anyone give this product a fair shake.  </li>

            <li> I have tried some of their other conditioners, but this seems to be the best, and best selling, one.</li>
            <li> It smells like amazing incense to me,</li>
            <li> Smells nice and helps combat the drying caused by the Natures Gate shampoo</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ve just gone nose-blind to it, but honestly?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll find myself stopping to smell my own hair on some days.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> Nice, earthy scent.</li>
            <li> The real product from Nature&#x27;s Gate is wonderful, I&#x27;ve used it for years.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> This seems to add a lot of body to my hair and a nice herbal scent stays with me.  </li>
            <li> I liked the texture and how it conditions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a nice product.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> The odor is VERY strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still VERY strong.</li>
            <li> (but there&#x27;s a LOT of it) and tangles very easily.  </li>
            <li> When it opened it the smell was very strong</li>
            <li> It has a great, herbal smell which I love - not a traditional \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; smell but a wonderful natural herbal smell - I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I have always loved Nature&#x27;s Gate&#x27;s original shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Someone on here referred to it as being like \\&quot;an amazing incense\\&quot;, and that&#x27;s very true.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to maintain a healthy head of hair.</li>
            <li> Just as I enjoyed 30 years ago.</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t my favorite off the bat but it has grown on me.</li>
            <li> My kids said I smelled like a hippie shop, which I&#x27;m ok with.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my hair looks.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the smell of this stuff now.</li>
            <li> :)  Update--10/29/15:  </li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with its effectiveness and the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This used to be my favorite shampoo and conditioner for my family&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal Conditioner has been my favorite for years.</li>
            <li> i love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell, its just OK.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe someday I&#x27;ll get brave and do the whole baking soda and apple cider vinegar thing, but for now, I&#x27;ll be using this.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner is interesting.</li>
            <li> Knowing that it&#x27;s free of parabens, phthalates, and sodium lauryl sulfate is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> If you like herbal fragrances than this conditioner will be enjoyable.  </li>
            <li> I said sure</li>
            <li> but why did she need more.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Cr&amp;egrave;me De Coco conditioner that I love</li>
            <li> It might even be better than the Bumble and Bumble in regards to healthier</li>
            <li> my hair dries, it has more volume because of this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since the 1970s, and I&#x27;ve never found a conditioner I like better.</li>
            <li> And I love its scent.</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I rinse, I can&#x27;t escape this conditioner&#x27;s overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> It worked just okay on my hair.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Love this conditioner and use it every day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this since before I had to color, and it is still my favorite.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s like getting a salon quality product for a cheaper price that is more organic.  </li>
            <li> One of my bottles arrived leaking from the lid, otherwise, satisfied.</li>
            <li> My kids love it, and it does get their hair decently clean all on its own, and without the fear of shampoo bubbles getting in their eyes.</li>
            <li> It has a medicinal smell instead of a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> this is a good product for stressed hair at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> It is much more strong in the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing though, for the fact it washes out so easily and always leaves my hair feeling super clean and amazingly repaired.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and hard to manage or get to look nice, and my hair seemed to respond best to this conditioner</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty sure she meant it in a nice way.)</li>
            <li> The conditioner leaves my hair soft, shiny and it smells great.  </li>
            <li> I love conditioners that are filled with natural ingredients, and have used Shea Moisture with great adoration.</li>
            <li> It can be strong, so it may not be what you&#x27;re seeking.</li>
            <li> The smell is overwhelmingly strong.  </li>
            <li> The smell is *really* strong, but I like the scent.</li>
            <li> Smell is way too strong</li>
            <li> The smell is quite strong.</li>
            <li> The way the conditioner works would get 4 stars except the bottles I received the herbal scent is way to strong and over powering.</li>
            <li> is so strong that it literally gives me a headache</li>
            <li> This conditioner is fine for my hair type, but the scent is too strong for me.  </li>
            <li> Buying online is cheaper than buying at Whole Foods, so I am pretty happy.</li>
            <li> Some might not like the brown color, but it&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful, light, daily conditioner that works great on my fine hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells so fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Vegan, cruelty free and smells</li>
            <li> Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal conditioner is so light and creamy like whipped cream but has an earthy herbal texture and scent.</li>
            <li> This is more of a YMMV, but worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> I purchased it because it is cruelty free</li>
            <li> They do claim that it&#x27;s phthalate free</li>
            <li> I like the light fragrance.</li>
            <li> Contains no crap.</li>
            <li> It also seems to do a good job of keeping my scalp in good shape during the harsh winter months.</li>
            <li> I feel good knowing that this conditioner contains primarily natural herbal ingredients.</li>
            <li> After some more research I discovered that the ingredients aren&#x27;t a whole lot better than the sauve I was using before.</li>
            <li> So today I returned all three bottles and will continue looking for products that are natural and smell good.</li>
            <li> The aroma is woodsy and very fresh smelling.</li>
            <li> Try it - clean, none of the &amp;#34;bad stuff&amp;#34; in the commercially available products on the shelves.</li>
            <li> First of all, I LOVE the smell.  </li>
            <li> (So okay, there was this one time where I went to a party and the first thing someone said on meeting me was &amp;#34;Oh</li>
            <li> /&gt;Makes my hair feel weightless, light, with full of shine and volume.</li>
            <li> It feels clean.  </li>
            <li> , it smells clean and not like perfume.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hoping it the conditioner that would be perfect, so central it was natural.</li>
            <li> I usually buy one of these at a time, but being able to buy three for this price was great.  </li>
            <li> I love herbal everything, this is just too much.</li>
            <li> I did use it once when I was a kid and loved it, but remember it smelling the same.  </li>
            <li> really wanted to love this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d dock a star because my husband hates the smell, but I love it so much that I just don&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very shiny and curlier than most conditioners with a lot of body.  </li>
            <li> My scalp is still sometimes itchy but not nearly as bad as it was.</li>
            <li> Some people may not like the strong patchouli scent, but I love all the natural flowers.  </li>
            <li> It also has a pretty strong smell.  </li>
            <li> I agree that it does smell pretty strong while you&#x27;re using it in the bathroom</li>
            <li> Great for fine hair, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair smell fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> Feels fresh and clean all day.</li>
            <li> The smell is mild to me but my mother did not like it when she used it during a visit to my house.</li>
            <li> It works well, and this conditioner in particular is light and easy to wash out.</li>
            <li> as a mild hair cleanser.</li>
            <li> I actually have only been using the conditioner and it smells awesome 2 days after washing my hair!</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic-- exactly like the Zum Frankincense &amp; Myrrh product line.</li>
            <li> Great product, but we have GOT to tone down this smell guys.  </li>
            <li> I was at the store and wanted to try something new, and thought this smelled lovely.</li>
            <li> But even when you LOVE a smell, it can still be overwhelming to smell it all day long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very heavy, so if your hair is super dry you probably want to include something more moisturizing in your regular regimen, but for the oily-haired like me, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> It is not to heavy for my head yet does a great job on the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t enjoy smelling like a forest</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product seeing as how its sulfate free and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> Also, she did not have to use the straightener to get rid of any frizz as it was already straight and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Def you should try it, it is worth the price imo</li>
            <li> It is worth your money.</li>
            <li> Healthy and natural.</li>
            <li> So for others with rosacia or acne problems, this might be worth a try.</li>
            <li> The conditioner smells nice but it doesn&#x27;t really make my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> I chose this because it went with the shampoo I thought sounded the most natural of the shampoos I researched.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner at a local health food store and have been loving it ever since.</li>
            <li> , more natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even amongst normal conditioners, I had to try many different kinds because my hair is very fine</li>
            <li> I first bought this several years ago because a friend had mentioned using it and how much she loved it for its scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not the right conditioner for me.</li>
            <li> Right away, I was hooked too.</li>
            <li> it really softens the hair and rinses clean.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good all natural conditioner and don&#x27;t need to look further.</li>
            <li> With the conditioner my hair is soft and easy to comb.</li>
            <li> However, it really leaves my hair frizz free, shiny and really manageable.</li>
            <li> but I do need to follow up with an effective conditioner for dry hair.</li>
            <li> Even if it&#x27;s natural, the level of aroma is too strong, and sort of nauseating.</li>
            <li> I can hardly tell it is in my hair after rinsing it out, except that it makes my hair feel thicker, softer and smell great.</li>
            <li> bought the shampoo alone first.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty good for that, but to use after shampooing, it&#x27;s not worth much for me.</li>
            <li> I have pretty oily hair</li>
            <li> More than beneficial for your hair, but the fragrance stays in your hair until the next shampoo.  </li>
            <li> She lives in an area of Louisiana where shopping is challenging with only a Walmart within an hour of where she lives.</li>
            <li> This conditioner looks exactly like diarrhea!\\&quot; But guess what?</li>
            <li> order from DreamUniverseOnline came in genuine containers but the contents of the bottle were clearly not the genuine</li>
            <li> Natural hair care a price comparable to the cheap brands.  </li>
            <li> and I love the nature&#x27;s gate shampoo, but the conditioner was a bit gross</li>
            <li> After the first wash, my daughter&#x27;s hair looked brighter and shinier.  </li>
            <li> Also, the smell can be a little overwhelming for some folks, as it&#x27;s pretty strong.</li>
            <li> I often get compliments from other women that my hair smells nice, an herbal scent.</li>
            <li> But lately I had been getting more and more concerned with all the chemicals being put in my conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deliciously spicy and woodsy (I hate flowery and fruity scents, which covers a majority of conditioners) without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It is not a terrible scent, just strange.</li>
            <li> The product itself (if they could tone down the smell) is amazing.  </li>
            <li> No nasty chemicals to dry out or ruin our hair.</li>
            <li> My  husband couldn&#x27;t be in the same room as me for days after I used this conditioner because the smell was SO STRONG.</li>
            <li> My niece had a similar experience, her hair looked lighter and she experienced less oil build up throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a little over a month and to be honest?</li>
            <li> However, the conditioner works really well.</li>
            <li> like that it is all-natural and is very affordable.</li>
            <li> I found my lifelong shampoo and conditioner that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li> (I often get comments that it looks like a shampoo commercial because its so smooth).  </li>
            <li> Not so much when it&#x27;s on the scalp.</li>
            <li> The only conditioner I enjoy using.  </li>
            <li> Detangles and rinses out very well without oily residue.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need much moisture</li>
            <li> I really like the scent</li>
            <li> It untangles my hair after shampooing, but it doesn&#x27;t soften my hair so much that it looses its body.</li>
            <li> I thought this was another product in this line, but tried it and really like it.</li>
            <li> The smell lingered in my hair for a whole day.</li>
            <li> Also I had to use sooo much of this conditioner just to saturate my hair.</li>
            <li> It does not change the scent much though.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing.  </li>
            <li> I like this conditioner because it works really well for my hair type and texture.</li>
            <li> At least the herbal shampoo is still good.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t glide smoothly through my hair and instantly untangle it like most other conditioners do.</li>
            <li> So you can imagine that I really wasn&#x27;t excited to hear her to call to me last night from the bath, \\&quot;Mom, come here!</li>
            <li> It left it feeling clean</li>
            <li> Over the years, Fiona has too often compared dishes that I have lovingly prepared for our family to diarrhea: hummus, baba ghanoosh, gumbo, every single curry, jambalaya, red beans and rice, steel cut oatmeal, smoothies, chai.</li>
            <li> So, if you can get past the first week of using it, you&#x27;ll come to love the smell and there will even be days that you wish it were stronger.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this awesome conditioner, especially when it comes to the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I used this at the recommendation of a male clerk working at a natural grocery store who also used it, and it smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner does make my hair soft and smooth and detangles my long wavy and dense hair very well.</li>
            <li> The smell of this conditioner reminds me of the incense I use to burn in high school...</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend to anyone with dandruff or frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> The girls were a little put off by the smell, but tried it anyway and love the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say that there is no other conditioner for me and my family!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost greasy the second day, which I have hair on the more dry side.</li>
            <li> I want to smell it all the time, and luckily, the fragrance stays in my hair for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I do not know about the \\&quot;new and improved\\</li>
            <li> This is amazing for me since I have thin, straight hair.   </li>
            <li> There are thicker conditioners by the same company, so get this only if you want a light conditioner.</li>
            <li> I needed a conditioner that moisturized but didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make flyaways more apparent.</li>
            <li> My favorite for years for my long, colored hair which is oily at the scalp, dry at the ends.</li>
            <li> so it really takes a special conditioner to detangle my mess of hair and this was not it.</li>
            <li> This is not the same product that it used to be, but it&#x27;s still better than other conditioners.  </li>
            <li> And the first time I used it I was totally thrown off by the color…its brown!</li>
            <li> This product not only smells great (though it think you either LOVE the scent or HATE it)</li>
            <li> I wash my hair in the morning and after the first use my pillow that I sleep on had to washed to remove the smell the next day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a wuss, but wow, this is a lot!</li>
            <li> Too much shampoo will make fine hair dry and too little won&#x27;t clean enough.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo since the first time I used it but the conditioner leaves my hair dry and not smooth.</li>
            <li> Unless you require little to no actual conditioning, think of this more as a shampoo substitute.</li>
            <li> Gently conditions my very oily hair without weighing it down, but I do have to say that you have to use a decent amount.</li>
            <li> I use both the herbal shampoo &amp; conditioner daily, and I really like the scent.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair really soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> All natural is a plus.</li>
            <li> I also have an extremely sensitive scalp</li>
            <li> I had to wash my hair over three times just to smell like me old self</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know about the old conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I also have to apply it twice to get anywhere near the results that I desire.</li>
            <li> I had been having a very itchy scalp (not dandruff related) and it was suggested I try a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Both the conditioner and the shampoo has a creamy soft consistency when massaging it into your hair.</li>
            <li> Yummy smell and conditions completely without greasy result.</li>
            <li> Natural herb and plant based.</li>
            <li> This might work really well for someone with a different hair type.</li>
            <li> And I have pretty dry hair</li>
            <li> used a little too much the first time, I believe.</li>
            <li> The shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell too bad - kind of spicy and sweet when it is in the bottle, but smells like herbs after it dries.  </li>
            <li> Several men have commented on it (one who is used to his wife buying high end conditioner).  </li>
            <li> I also noticed I didn&#x27;t have to reach for my leave-in conditioner when styling in the morning because a quick water/aloe spritz was enough to fluff the bed head.</li>
            <li> I also put a bit into a spray bottle of water (just a few drops) and use that to detangle and style my hair on days that I don&#x27;t do a full shampoo and conditioning.  </li>
            <li> Recently though, they came out with a bottle labelled \\&quot;New Improved\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> My hair is really dry and this works very well.</li>
            <li> Constantly scratching an irritated scalp with gross dandruff for years but even since I&#x27;ve started using this production my hair is much thicker and my dandruff is going away each passing day.</li>
            <li> However, there were 2 major issues that made me stop using this product and give away the leftover bottles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fine straight hair, so I don&#x27;t usually like leave in conditioners because they tend to weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> NG Conditioner has really helped my hair in particular (3a) with being properly moisturized and still not weighed down or greasy looking.</li>
            <li> It is earthy and woodsy and generally comforting for me.</li>
            <li> I am upset  and wish they would go back to the old formula.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like the old formula back.</li>
            <li> I tried different natural conditioners, but none worked.  </li>
            <li> Second, it works well (as well, or just under my old conditioner).  </li>
            <li> I had been using normal conditioners for a long time.  </li>
            <li> If you are used to higly processed chemical conditioners, it will look odd at first.</li>
            <li> (I have normal to dry, medium length, wavy hair.)</li>
            <li> Additionally, I can stretch out an extra day of no washing without any negative buildup on my hair or scalp, so it&#x27;s an economical choice too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young man who has always had incredibly dry and frizzy hair throughout my childhood.</li>
            <li> shampoo and conditioner- something that is free of chemicals, at least during the dry winter season.</li>
            <li> It smells very herby + perhaps with a little bit of pine smell?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to put on my hair because it feels like it just falls right off.  </li>
            <li> This is also competitively priced compared to other natural hair care products.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and moderately thin and fine.</li>
            <li> daughter has fine, long, blonde hair and my niece has long, dark, thick, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> The bottle says it can be used daily, but I only wash once a week (using Terressentials mud wash) but I still noticed my hair was softer, moisturized and less likely to tangle throughout the week.</li>
            <li> I do not blow dry, flat iron or anything.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use tons of it, and I have really long hair.</li>
            <li> I got this on the advice from another long haired friend.</li>
            <li> I have a few chemically/scent sensitive friends and I have asked them if it is detectable in any way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Nature&#x27;s Gate Shampoo &amp; Conditions for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Even after letting my hair dry the smell was very strong and unpleasant which was to me unbearable.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this at a natural grocery store, until I found out that I can save some money on amazon!</li>
            <li> I just let it air dry.   </li>
            <li> I feel like its Christmas every time I use it, even after my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it smelled a little harsh, but I would try this product again in a different scent.</li>
            <li> (If my long, wavy hair wasn&#x27;t slightly damaged from recent hair coloring, this would probably be my go-to conditioner.)</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s unlike any other conditioner I&#x27;ve used, as it&#x27;s about the consistency of cold mud.</li>
            <li> Now it is watered down and has different ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an unpleasant smell, but quite unusual and very noticeable.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t leave it on long like I would other conditioners.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathered up just fine for me, albeit the conditioner felt a little weird.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle yet tough.</li>
            <li> I actually a few years back had to invent a cautionary tale about a little girl named Liona titled \\&quot;The Girl Who Cried Diarrhea,\\&quot; in which the hero actually contracts cholera</li>
            <li> Initially, I didn&#x27;t mind, but after a few hours, I couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore.  </li>
            <li> However, this stuff is useless as a conditioner unless your hair is so fine and/or oily that you require very little in the way of conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I used it after shampooing, I found that it left my (shoulder-length, thick, wavy) hair feeling unpleasantly dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> That is because of the rosemary, lavender, sage and other herbal extracts.</li>
            <li> It has a very spicy fragrance, which I thought was weird for conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally thick, slightly coarse and textured.</li>
            <li> It has volume, and isn&#x27;t weighed down.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t weighted down.  </li>
            <li> It does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I leave it in my hair for a little bit while I do other shower &#x27;tasks.</li>
            <li> I think half of it ends up going down the drain.</li>
            <li> Because of that, it looks a bit odd out of the container...</li>
            <li> She said that she had less of an issue with her Rosacia and her skin breaking out since she had been using it.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt less frizzy.</li>
            <li> and I live in the DC area where it is currently cold and dry (winter).</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few months now.   </li>
            <li> One of the bottles shipped in this package was broken open and the contents spilled everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I like to leave it in to let my hair soak it up for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a thin, slippery texture and actually foams up a bit on application.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money with this brand if you value non-toxicity.</li>
            <li> Once I am out and my hair is drying it imparts very little scent at all.</li>
            <li> I can usually go a couple of days in between washings, but when I use this product, I cannot STAND how my hair feels and looks.</li>
            <li> However,it made my hair petty dry and difficult to run my fingers through my hair sometimes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find one that doesn&#x27;t have the ubiquitous fruit scent.  </li>
            <li> I mix some up with a little vinegar to thin it, and I wipe it on the horses&#x27; bellies with a sponge and it keeps the horseflies away all day.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m going to order at least a case of Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal Conditioner.</li>
            <li> it is a medium brown and thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick brown color.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and rinse out well without any build up</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> (I have very thin hair, so not weighed down is a bonus).  </li>
            <li> Not good for my hair</li>
            <li> This is not a good conditioner at all.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is very thick too.</li>
            <li> Now, an hour after my shower, I cannot believe how ridiculously chemically scented my hair is!</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t get me wrong.  </li>
            <li> Number one, it&#x27;s a weird brown color.</li>
            <li> but it is too expensive ($25 for a 8 oz bottle vs. $7 for Nature&#x27;s Gate 18 oz).</li>
            <li> Some have complained of a &amp;#34;smell,&amp;#34; but I find the aroma quite fragrant and my family is quite the &amp;#34;aroma critic&amp;#34; when they hate the smell of something.</li>
            <li> If not, my hair feels \\&quot;rough\\&quot; and looks crazy frizzy.</li>
            <li> I did not give five stars because the herbal smell is unpleasant.</li>
            <li> : Cold water brings out the wonders!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the smell of the conditioner.</li>
            <li> They have changed it and it is very disappointing now.</li>
            <li> , I HATE the way it smells.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Thought I would try it and I did once.  Not good for my hair</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. I use both the herbal shampoo &amp; conditioner daily, and I really like the scent. Someone on here referred to it as being like \\&quot;an amazing incense\\&quot;, and that&#x27;s very true. It can be strong, so it may not be what you&#x27;re seeking. However, the conditioner works really well. I don&#x27;t have to use tons of it, and I have really long hair. It leaves my hair really soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> This is not the same product that it used to be, but it&#x27;s still better than other conditioners.  I like it well enough.</li>
            <li> The smell of this conditioner reminds me of the incense I use to burn in high school... but my BF says he loves the scent and tells me so whenever I come out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is all-natural and is very affordable. I would recommend this product to maintain a healthy head of hair. (If my long, wavy hair wasn&#x27;t slightly damaged from recent hair coloring, this would probably be my go-to conditioner.)</li>
            <li> Smells nice and helps combat the drying caused by the Natures Gate shampoo</li>
            <li> This conditioner is fine for my hair type, but the scent is too strong for me.  I was surprised that it smelled a little harsh, but I would try this product again in a different scent.</li>
            <li> Just as I enjoyed 30 years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a while. It works well and I like the safer ingredients. The smell wasn&#x27;t my favorite off the bat but it has grown on me.</li>
            <li> Works great, smells great too. All natural is a plus.</li>
            <li> but it starting making my scalp burn/itch with some hair loss.  But it smells so good, I use it on the end of my hair anyway.</li>
            <li> Gently conditions my very oily hair without weighing it down, but I do have to say that you have to use a decent amount. If not, my hair feels \\&quot;rough\\&quot; and looks crazy frizzy. Also, the smell can be a little overwhelming for some folks, as it&#x27;s pretty strong. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now, along with the shampoo, and am just getting used to it. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;Started making my hair fall out! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> The odor is VERY strong. A bit perfumey. I would not order again or give as a gift.</li>
            <li> I bought both the shampoo and conditioner for this product.  I only gave it three stars and here is why:  1. The smell is overwhelmingly strong.  I like the smell, don&#x27;t get me wrong.  But even when you LOVE a smell, it can still be overwhelming to smell it all day long.  My kids said I smelled like a hippie shop, which I&#x27;m ok with.  But there&#x27;s no need for perfume or anything when using this, the smell is still here and I showered at 6pm last night, it&#x27;s 3pm now.  It&#x27;s still VERY strong. 2.  The product itself (if they could tone down the smell) is amazing.  I love the way my hair looks.  It feels clean.  It has volume, and isn&#x27;t weighed down. (I have very thin hair, so not weighed down is a bonus).  The shampoo lathered up just fine for me, albeit the conditioner felt a little weird.  The color didn&#x27;t bother me at all (it&#x27;s brown).  6-3-15----I just had to post an update. Maybe I&#x27;ve just gone nose-blind to it, but honestly? I absolutely LOVE the smell of this stuff now. I&#x27;ve used it for a little over a month and to be honest? I&#x27;ll find myself stopping to smell my own hair on some days. It&#x27;s especially great after a workout to &amp;#34;not stink&amp;#34;. So, if you can get past the first week of using it, you&#x27;ll come to love the smell and there will even be days that you wish it were stronger. :)  Update--10/29/15:  I have used this product for a few months now.   Let me say this--I have no split ends at ALL anymore.   My hair isn&#x27;t weighted down.  It doesn&#x27;t look greasy and there is NO FRIZZ at all.  It still smells wonderful every time I use it.   This is amazing for me since I have thin, straight hair.   It looks and feels healthier.   I have had to since upgrade my rating to 5 stars!  I found my lifelong shampoo and conditioner that&#x27;s for sure.  My hair has never been healthier.  (I often get comments that it looks like a shampoo commercial because its so smooth).  I guess I should add that I do NOT use any heat on my hair.  I do not blow dry, flat iron or anything.I just let it air dry.   Great product, but we have GOT to tone down this smell guys.  Seriously.  I love herbal everything, this is just too much.</li>
            <li> I have used this conditioner with the matching shampoo for a year now. I am completely satisfied with its effectiveness and the texture of my hair. The smell is mild to me but my mother did not like it when she used it during a visit to my house.</li>
            <li> It has a very spicy fragrance, which I thought was weird for conditioner. And I have pretty dry hair so it really takes a special conditioner to detangle my mess of hair and this was not it.</li>
            <li> OMG!  This conditioner smells so fabulous.  It&#x27;s hard to find one that doesn&#x27;t have the ubiquitous fruit scent.  My husband even likes the smell.  (He uses the shampoo).  It makes my hair smell fresh and clean.  Rinses well and softens hair.  I hope they never change the formula.</li>
            <li> I have hair below my waist and finding a conditioner that works from root to tip is a challenge. I got this on the advice from another long haired friend. I love it. It is not to heavy for my head yet does a great job on the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the scent...I guess that is a very individual thing. The aroma is woodsy and very fresh smelling. It is much more strong in the shower. Once I am out and my hair is drying it imparts very little scent at all. I have a few chemically/scent sensitive friends and I have asked them if it is detectable in any way. They have all said no. I have to hold my hair to my nose to even get any scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is all natural and has minimal processing. Because of that, it looks a bit odd out of the container...it is a medium brown and thick. If you are used to higly processed chemical conditioners, it will look odd at first. I am very pleased with this product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This used to be my favorite shampoo and conditioner for my family&#x27;s hair.  Now it is watered down and has different ingredients.  I do not like it anymore.  I am upset  and wish they would go back to the old formula.  Now I have to find a different brand.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It is a wonderful, light, daily conditioner that works great on my fine hair without weighing it down.  I also have an extremely sensitive scalp and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal Conditioner.  It has a great, herbal smell which I love - not a traditional \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; smell but a wonderful natural herbal smell - I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and absolutely loved it. Recently though, they came out with a bottle labelled \\&quot;New Improved\\&quot;. In my book adding chemicals to a product that change the color, consistency, smell and texture do not add up to improved. I&#x27;d like the old formula back.</li>
            <li> it is the best smelling conditioner ever. been using it for 30 years.</li>
            <li> Over the years, this is the one conditioner I keep going back to. It is brown, earthy, herb infused and it works. Consider this conditioner if you like to incorporate herbs into your skin care, hair care, diet... life.</li>
            <li> I have super-fine hair and use this conditioner every day. It does not weigh my hair down. Buying online is cheaper than buying at Whole Foods, so I am pretty happy.</li>
            <li> I usually buy one of these at a time, but being able to buy three for this price was great.  Some people may not like the strong patchouli scent, but I love all the natural flowers.  Feels fresh and clean all day.</li>
            <li> Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal Conditioner has been my favorite for years. I love the fact that it&#x27;s unlike any other conditioner I&#x27;ve used, as it&#x27;s about the consistency of cold mud. It&#x27;s amazing though, for the fact it washes out so easily and always leaves my hair feeling super clean and amazingly repaired. It also seems to do a good job of keeping my scalp in good shape during the harsh winter months. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this awesome conditioner, especially when it comes to the way it smells.</li>
            <li> This product works well and smells good. Also, it is NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS!</li>
            <li> smells so nice, good ingredients. i love this conditioner. Def you should try it, it is worth the price imo</li>
            <li> It smells like incense. Feels great. Leaves me smelling great all day.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the shampoo alone first. Works great, no suds, cleans well.  Just got the conditioner and works great at well.  Hair feels good. Try it, you just like it too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell, its just OK. And the first time I used it I was totally thrown off by the color…its brown! Wasn&#x27;t expecting that! But my goodness it works SO well! My hair feels incredible after I use this conditioner.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells great and works great. I was looking for a good all natural conditioner and don&#x27;t need to look further.</li>
            <li> My  husband couldn&#x27;t be in the same room as me for days after I used this conditioner because the smell was SO STRONG. He joked that we needed a hazmat team on the premises to dispose of the unused contents of the bottle. I had to wash my hair over three times just to smell like me old self again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; HOWEVER, because I was chintzy I couldn&#x27;t throw it away .. . so I stuck it in my horse grooming tote, thinking I would use it on the horses&#x27;s manes and tails. Well, I used it on the horses, and guess what?  IT KEEPS HORSEFLIES OFF OF THEM.  So now that is what I use it for. I mix some up with a little vinegar to thin it, and I wipe it on the horses&#x27; bellies with a sponge and it keeps the horseflies away all day.</li>
            <li> One thing I have learned while growing out my hair is regular but not daily washes. I needed a conditioner that moisturized but didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make flyaways more apparent. Nature&#x27;s Gate is what it promises. Vegan, cruelty free and smells fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a little too much the first time, I believe. It does lather but while it&#x27;s still on my palms. Not so much when it&#x27;s on the scalp. Too much shampoo will make fine hair dry and too little won&#x27;t clean enough. Think of Nature&#x27;s Gate as your universal conditioner. It&#x27;s gentle yet tough. The shampoo is very thick too. Both, shampoo and conditioner compliment each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Cold water brings out the wonders!</li>
            <li> The only conditioner I enjoy using.  Detangles and rinses out very well without oily residue.  Nice, earthy scent. Some might not like the brown color, but it&#x27;s fine by me.</li>
            <li> best conditioner there is! have been using it for over40 years!!!</li>
            <li> I had been using normal conditioners for a long time.  Even amongst normal conditioners, I had to try many different kinds because my hair is very fine (but there&#x27;s a LOT of it) and tangles very easily.  I tried different natural conditioners, but none worked.  But lately I had been getting more and more concerned with all the chemicals being put in my conditioner.  So I tried this.  First of all, I LOVE the smell.  I want to smell it all the time, and luckily, the fragrance stays in my hair for a long time.  It smells like amazing incense to me, easily the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever smelled.  Second, it works well (as well, or just under my old conditioner).  I leave it in my hair for a little bit while I do other shower &#x27;tasks.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about the old conditioner.  I did use it once when I was a kid and loved it, but remember it smelling the same.  My mom remembers the same smell too (she loves it too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe someday I&#x27;ll get brave and do the whole baking soda and apple cider vinegar thing, but for now, I&#x27;ll be using this.  I&#x27;d miss the smell anyway.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner ever. Leaves it shiny without the chemicals. Smells so good.</li>
            <li> One of the bottles shipped in this package was broken open and the contents spilled everywhere.  Product is great however the delivery of the package was quite upsetting.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is interesting. The smell is *really* strong, but I like the scent. It is earthy and woodsy and generally comforting for me. The performance of the conditioner does leave something to be desired. It doesn&#x27;t glide smoothly through my hair and instantly untangle it like most other conditioners do. I have to work to get my fingers through my hair to distribute this stuff. I also have to apply it twice to get anywhere near the results that I desire. My hair is very long and moderately thin and fine. It&#x27;s just not the right conditioner for me. I have been using it to co-wash with and it&#x27;s pretty good for that, but to use after shampooing, it&#x27;s not worth much for me.</li>
            <li> I do not  like this conditioner at all.  I realize that it is &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; but it has no moisture feel to it.  It&#x27;s hard to put on my hair because it feels like it just falls right off.  It does not cling at all.  I think half of it ends up going down the drain. It also has a pretty strong smell.  I have pretty oily hair so I don&#x27;t need much moisture but this seems to be doing nothing.</li>
            <li> I first bought this several years ago because a friend had mentioned using it and how much she loved it for its scent. Right away, I was hooked too. It&#x27;s deliciously spicy and woodsy (I hate flowery and fruity scents, which covers a majority of conditioners) without being overwhelming. (So okay, there was this one time where I went to a party and the first thing someone said on meeting me was &amp;#34;Oh, you smell like a hippie!&amp;#34;, but I&#x27;m pretty sure she meant it in a nice way.) Knowing that it&#x27;s free of parabens, phthalates, and sodium lauryl sulfate is a nice bonus. It&#x27;s not very heavy, so if your hair is super dry you probably want to include something more moisturizing in your regular regimen, but for the oily-haired like me, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I can not find Production Date！！！</li>
            <li> I usually buy this at a natural grocery store, until I found out that I can save some money on amazon! Love this product! It is worth your money.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal Conditioner. Number one, it&#x27;s a weird brown color. I was not expecting this. But you figure, who cares about the color of the product, just that it does what it says it does. Number two, I did NOT like how this product leaves my hair. I can usually go a couple of days in between washings, but when I use this product, I cannot STAND how my hair feels and looks. It&#x27;s almost greasy the second day, which I have hair on the more dry side. Number three, I HATE the way it smells. It has a medicinal smell instead of a nice clean smell. Plus, I can smell it throughout the day, so it lingers. Argh! This product is NOT for me.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Nature&#x27;s Gate&#x27;s original shampoo and conditioner. No scent like it. It works well, and this conditioner in particular is light and easy to wash out. There are thicker conditioners by the same company, so get this only if you want a light conditioner.</li>
            <li> Have used Nature&#x27;s Gate products since the 1960s.  If you like herbal fragrances than this conditioner will be enjoyable.  More than beneficial for your hair, but the fragrance stays in your hair until the next shampoo.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT.  Healthy and natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Nature&#x27;s Gate Shampoo &amp; Conditions for a long time.  Last summer, I left a bottle of each at my daughter&#x27;s house after a 3 week visit.  She lives in an area of Louisiana where shopping is challenging with only a Walmart within an hour of where she lives. Walmart does not carry Nature&#x27;s Gate.  Anyway, after several weeks she called me wanting to know if I could get it through Amazon because she has used almost all of it.  I said sure but why did she need more.  She said that she had less of an issue with her Rosacia and her skin breaking out since she had been using it.  Seems that the lack of sulfites in the shampoo is helpful for her skin.  So for others with rosacia or acne problems, this might be worth a try.</li>
            <li> Over the years, Fiona has too often compared dishes that I have lovingly prepared for our family to diarrhea: hummus, baba ghanoosh, gumbo, every single curry, jambalaya, red beans and rice, steel cut oatmeal, smoothies, chai. The list goes on. I actually a few years back had to invent a cautionary tale about a little girl named Liona titled \\&quot;The Girl Who Cried Diarrhea,\\&quot; in which the hero actually contracts cholera but her mother doesn&#x27;t believe her, and she goes to school and soils herself, thus earning the nickname \\&quot;Mud Butt\\&quot; for the rest of her life. So you can imagine that I really wasn&#x27;t excited to hear her to call to me last night from the bath, \\&quot;Mom, come here! This conditioner looks exactly like diarrhea!\\&quot; But guess what? IT DOES! I bought the \\&quot;herbal\\&quot; instead of the \\&quot;hemp\\&quot; variety by accident. Now I&#x27;m going to order at least a case of Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal Conditioner.</li>
            <li> The conditioner smells nice but it doesn&#x27;t really make my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice now and I&#x27;m in love! I have kinky afro-textured hair and I live in the DC area where it is currently cold and dry (winter). I found this at a local Wegman&#x27;s. This product not only smells great (though it think you either LOVE the scent or HATE it) it really softens the hair and rinses clean. The bottle says it can be used daily, but I only wash once a week (using Terressentials mud wash) but I still noticed my hair was softer, moisturized and less likely to tangle throughout the week. I also noticed I didn&#x27;t have to reach for my leave-in conditioner when styling in the morning because a quick water/aloe spritz was enough to fluff the bed head. I&#x27;m using this over my Shea Moisture Manuka Honey/Mafura oil conditioner. This is also competitively priced compared to other natural hair care products.</li>
            <li> I have never used a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoo or conditioner before. I had been having a very itchy scalp (not dandruff related) and it was suggested I try a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner- something that is free of chemicals, at least during the dry winter season. I thought I would give it a try. I chose this because it went with the shampoo I thought sounded the most natural of the shampoos I researched. I have used the shampoo and conditioner for a few weeks and I am really liking it. I rub the conditioner into my scalp and then pull it through my hair to the ends.  My scalp is still sometimes itchy but not nearly as bad as it was. I really like the scent, it smells clean and not like perfume. My hair still has the scent the next day. This conditioner does look different from what I am used to.  It&#x27;s a thick brown color.  I have always used the paired shampoo so I can&#x27;t say how the conditioner is, stand alone. With the conditioner my hair is soft and easy to comb. My hair has bounce and doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy. (I have normal to dry, medium length, wavy hair.) I will buy the product again even if my itchy scalp clears up.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite leave in conditioner. I have fine straight hair, so I don&#x27;t usually like leave in conditioners because they tend to weigh my hair down. Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal conditioner is so light and creamy like whipped cream but has an earthy herbal texture and scent. I can hardly tell it is in my hair after rinsing it out, except that it makes my hair feel thicker, softer and smell great. It feels luxurious. I started buying this conditioner as a substitute for Bumble and Bumble Cr&amp;egrave;me De Coco conditioner that I love but it is too expensive ($25 for a 8 oz bottle vs. $7 for Nature&#x27;s Gate 18 oz). I bought this conditioner at a local health food store and have been loving it ever since. It might even be better than the Bumble and Bumble in regards to healthier, more natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my hair dries, it has more volume because of this conditioner. I also use it with the Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal shampoo. Both the conditioner and the shampoo has a creamy soft consistency when massaging it into your hair. I like to leave it in to let my hair soak it up for a few minutes. My scalp feels happier when I use this conditioner. I often get compliments from other women that my hair smells nice, an herbal scent. That is because of the rosemary, lavender, sage and other herbal extracts. I feel good knowing that this conditioner contains primarily natural herbal ingredients.</li>
            <li> USED to ADORE this product. They have changed it and it is very disappointing now. At least the herbal shampoo is still good.</li>
            <li> Yummy smell and conditions completely without greasy result.</li>
            <li> The real product from Nature&#x27;s Gate is wonderful, I&#x27;ve used it for years.&lt;br /&gt;My order from DreamUniverseOnline came in genuine containers but the contents of the bottle were clearly not the genuine product.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why any company would think they could sell a fake product and get away with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By all means use Nature&#x27;s Gate product, just don&#x27;t buy from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner on the planet. Smells amazing and perfect conditioning. Natural herb and plant based. No nasty chemicals to dry out or ruin our hair. My daughter and I use nothing else. We don&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say that there is no other conditioner for me and my family!!!! We all use it and it works wonderfully for each of us. Some have complained of a &amp;#34;smell,&amp;#34; but I find the aroma quite fragrant and my family is quite the &amp;#34;aroma critic&amp;#34; when they hate the smell of something. NG Conditioner has really helped my hair in particular (3a) with being properly moisturized and still not weighed down or greasy looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since the 1970s, and I&#x27;ve never found a conditioner I like better. It untangles my hair after shampooing, but it doesn&#x27;t soften my hair so much that it looses its body. And I love its scent. An executive at a company I once worked for used to bury his face in my hair every day, because my hair smelled so good. I didn&#x27;t object, so -- NO -- it wasn&#x27;t harassment!</li>
            <li> This seems to add a lot of body to my hair and a nice herbal scent stays with me.  I thought this was another product in this line, but tried it and really like it.</li>
            <li> Smell is way too strong</li>
            <li> I like Nature&#x27;s gate products. I was disappointed in the smell of the conditioner. I feel like its Christmas every time I use it, even after my hair is dry. However, it really leaves my hair frizz free, shiny and really manageable.</li>
            <li> The smell of this conditioner is just too overpowering.  Initially, I didn&#x27;t mind, but after a few hours, I couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore.  No matter how many times I rinse, I can&#x27;t escape this conditioner&#x27;s overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is fantastic!  Natural hair care a price comparable to the cheap brands.  Great smell and good detangling.</li>
            <li> I liked the texture and how it conditions. My hair felt less frizzy. However, there were 2 major issues that made me stop using this product and give away the leftover bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The smell is quite strong. It smells very herby + perhaps with a little bit of pine smell? The smell lingered in my hair for a whole day. It&#x27;s not an unpleasant smell, but quite unusual and very noticeable. I really didn&#x27;t enjoy smelling like a forest all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. This is more of a YMMV, but worth mentioning. I must be allergic to one of the herbs in this, as I started sneezing all day as soon as I took a shower and hours after. It took me a while to figure out the cause of it, but when I finally thought of the shampoo and the conditioner, I stopped them and stopped sneezing. How bizarre!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to love this. I guess the search must go on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d dock a star because my husband hates the smell, but I love it so much that I just don&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair feel weightless, light, with full of shine and volume. Additionally, I can stretch out an extra day of no washing without any negative buildup on my hair or scalp, so it&#x27;s an economical choice too!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product seeing as how its sulfate free and not tested on animals. It worked just okay on my hair. It left it feeling clean and I could definitely go a day or two without washing my hair if I had wanted to. However,it made my hair petty dry and difficult to run my fingers through my hair sometimes. My hair is naturally thick, slightly coarse and textured. This conditioner did nothing to help that. Also I had to use sooo much of this conditioner just to saturate my hair. After some more research I discovered that the ingredients aren&#x27;t a whole lot better than the sauve I was using before. This might work really well for someone with a different hair type. It&#x27;s still a nice product.</li>
            <li> I swim and sun 4-5 times a week.  this is a good product for stressed hair at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic-- exactly like the Zum Frankincense &amp; Myrrh product line. Earthy, spicy, cola-like and herbal. However, this stuff is useless as a conditioner unless your hair is so fine and/or oily that you require very little in the way of conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a thin, slippery texture and actually foams up a bit on application. When I used it after shampooing, I found that it left my (shoulder-length, thick, wavy) hair feeling unpleasantly dry and tangled. My hair looked like a haystack!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this stuff smells so good, I&#x27;ve experimented and found another use for it: as a mild hair cleanser. My kids love it, and it does get their hair decently clean all on its own, and without the fear of shampoo bubbles getting in their eyes. I use it this way as well, massaging into the roots well before rinsing-- but I do need to follow up with an effective conditioner for dry hair. I alternate between Dove Damage Control and Nexxus Humectin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... Unless you require little to no actual conditioning, think of this more as a shampoo substitute. And buy a separate conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is not a good conditioner at all.  It does not moisurize or smoothen my hair, and I wish there was a way to get a refund for this purchase.  I purchased it because it is cruelty free and I love the nature&#x27;s gate shampoo, but the conditioner was a bit gross and I will not use it again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hoping it the conditioner that would be perfect, so central it was natural. When it opened it the smell was very strong but I wanted to be fair and give it a try. Even after letting my hair dry the smell was very strong and unpleasant which was to me unbearable. So today I returned all three bottles and will continue looking for products that are natural and smell good.</li>
            <li> This conditioner does make my hair soft and smooth and detangles my long wavy and dense hair very well. I did not give five stars because the herbal smell is unpleasant. It is not a terrible scent, just strange. I like using tea tree oil so I have added it to the shampoo and conditioner for the benefits to the scalp. It does not change the scent much though.</li>
            <li> The way the conditioner works would get 4 stars except the bottles I received the herbal scent is way to strong and over powering. I wash my hair in the morning and after the first use my pillow that I sleep on had to washed to remove the smell the next day. If you like the scent of petrulli oil then you might like this conditioner.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair conditioner.  It just makes my hair manageable even in winter.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; product contains chemical fragrance and it&#x27;s a very strong smell!  They do claim that it&#x27;s phthalate free but it&#x27;s still chemical, and repulsive.  Don&#x27;t waste your money with this brand if you value non-toxicity.</li>
            <li> The men in my family really love this shampoo - it&#x27;s a keeper!  Try it - clean, none of the &amp;#34;bad stuff&amp;#34; in the commercially available products on the shelves.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner and use it every day. Great for fine hair, not too heavy. I like the light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo since the first time I used it but the conditioner leaves my hair dry and not smooth. I still have to apply another conditioner besides this one. Smell doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Good for scalp and hair. Contains no crap.Used to come in a larger size,but what can you do? Nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> My favorite for years for my long, colored hair which is oily at the scalp, dry at the ends. This moisturizes my ends without making my scalp greasy. I have been using this since before I had to color, and it is still my favorite.</li>
            <li> I agree that it does smell pretty strong while you&#x27;re using it in the bathroom but thats because your hair will still smell awesome two days after you&#x27;ve washed it with this shampoo and conditioner. I actually have only been using the conditioner and it smells awesome 2 days after washing my hair! It leaves my hair shiny and calms my frizz quite a bit. But please smell this at the store before you buy it online or anywhere. The \\&quot;herbal\\&quot; scent may not be for everyone. I totally understand. The texture is also very different from anything I had ever used. But remember THIS IS NOT PANTENE PRO V, DOVE, OR FINESSE. But it is a very good brand that makes awesome hair products.</li>
            <li> I would recommend anyone give this product a fair shake.  For me, once I tried it...I knew nothing else would do.  This is the BEST conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  I use it in combination with Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal Shampoo, which is also a great product.  The conditioner leaves my hair soft, shiny and it smells great.  I also put a bit into a spray bottle of water (just a few drops) and use that to detangle and style my hair on days that I don&#x27;t do a full shampoo and conditioning.  Even my mother-in-law has switched to this after noticing my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and niece as they use a lot of styling products and their hair was getting damaged.  After the first wash, my daughter&#x27;s hair looked brighter and shinier.  Also, she did not have to use the straightener to get rid of any frizz as it was already straight and smooth.  My niece had a similar experience, her hair looked lighter and she experienced less oil build up throughout the day.  The shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell too bad - kind of spicy and sweet when it is in the bottle, but smells like herbs after it dries.  The girls were a little put off by the smell, but tried it anyway and love the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has fine, long, blonde hair and my niece has long, dark, thick, coarse hair.  It worked great on both.</li>
            <li> I used this at the recommendation of a male clerk working at a natural grocery store who also used it, and it smells fantastic.  Several men have commented on it (one who is used to his wife buying high end conditioner).  Very relaxing.  My hair is very fine and hard to manage or get to look nice, and my hair seemed to respond best to this conditioner (I don&#x27;t use the shampoo).  It makes my hair very shiny and curlier than most conditioners with a lot of body.  For the price I get it at, it&#x27;s like getting a salon quality product for a cheaper price that is more organic.  I do not know about the \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; because I have never seen it advertised that way on the conditioner I purchase. I have tried some of their other conditioners, but this seems to be the best, and best selling, one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young man who has always had incredibly dry and frizzy hair throughout my childhood. Constantly scratching an irritated scalp with gross dandruff for years but even since I&#x27;ve started using this production my hair is much thicker and my dandruff is going away each passing day. I combined this with the shampoo and I highly recommend to anyone with dandruff or frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> One of my bottles arrived leaking from the lid, otherwise, satisfied.</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner because it works really well for my hair type and texture. My hair is really dry and this works very well. the only downfall about this product is the perfume in it is so strong that it literally gives me a headache so I can&#x27;t leave it on long like I would other conditioners. It is thick and rinse out well without any build up and I like the feeling that it gives my hair.</li>
            <li> I love conditioners that are filled with natural ingredients, and have used Shea Moisture with great adoration. I was at the store and wanted to try something new, and thought this smelled lovely. Now, an hour after my shower, I cannot believe how ridiculously chemically scented my hair is! Even if it&#x27;s natural, the level of aroma is too strong, and sort of nauseating. I&#x27;m not a wuss, but wow, this is a lot!</li>
