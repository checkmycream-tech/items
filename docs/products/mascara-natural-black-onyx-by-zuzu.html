    <ol>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>THE MASCARA IS REALLY AWESOME.</li>
            <li>THE  BEST THING  OF ALL IS THAT IT STAYS ON ALL DAY AND DOESN&#x27;T CLUMP!!!!</li>
            <li>Great mascara!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a win in my book!</li>
            <li>mascaras and like this one the best.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with this replacement.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product on yet another quest for great, cruelty-free mascara</li>
            <li>Very happy with ZuZu and thrilled that no animals were harmed in the making of my eye lashes.</li>
            <li>Really good mascara.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara!  </li>
            <li>The texture is smooth (not clumping) and elongates my lashes beautifully.</li>
            <li>IT STAYS ON NICELY</li>
            <li>So if I can find a mascara that lengthens nicely</li>
            <li>It is very easy to remove with my eye make up remover or even just water and soap.  </li>
            <li>Washes off very easily.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best natural mascaras that I have tried, I like this Zuzu Luxe mascara</li>
            <li>more than Suncoat or Earth&#x27;s Beauty.  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to wear mascara for over 10 years.</li>
            <li>So glad to have found it.</li>
            <li>I love how light this feels on!  </li>
            <li>This is a lovely product, just not what I am used to.  </li>
            <li>I love it,, still used it,</li>
            <li>Darkens lashes well but doesn&#x27;t make lashes look thicker or more defined.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>If I want a more lashy look</li>
            <li>I really love this mascara.</li>
            <li>how many x&#x27;s thicker.  </li>
            <li>Love this mascara</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably rate it at the top of the handful of &#x27;naturalish&#x27; mascaras</li>
            <li>THIS IS A GREAT NATURAL MASCARA!!</li>
            <li>My lashes look nice and full and I have no flaking throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Maybe too easily.</li>
            <li>It easily washes off at night.  </li>
            <li>It does not get all over my eyelids, and the marks that do go astray come off easily with a dampened cotton swab.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on easily, lasts well and looks gorgeous in a natural way.</li>
            <li>So happy to find this after trying over 15 different mascaras.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a cruelty free and vegan mascara ever since Tarte sold out to an animal testing company (still pissed about that one).</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and mess-free.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and does not clump, even with layering.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that is comes of easily when your eyes water or if you get tears when you laugh, it runs all over the place.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>Seldom do I wear mascara, but when I do this is the only kind I have or wear.</li>
            <li>If you just want to look like a more glamorous naturally radiant version of yourself, this&#x27;ll do it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but pretty sweet.</li>
            <li>was looking for a really good natural mascara and have tried a few that were okay.  </li>
            <li>One of the rare mascaras that doesn&#x27;t clump at the end of the lash and doesn&#x27;t smudge (much) when I rub my eyes.</li>
            <li>Was first try for organic.</li>
            <li>The brush is exactly as the picture shows.</li>
            <li>That being said, I&#x27;ve had my first tube for going on three years</li>
            <li>but the brand and product seem trustworthy and the mascara works pretty lovelyly</li>
            <li>For a natural look, I use one, quick layer and am ready to go.</li>
            <li>And I really appreciate how its not made with beeswax as I am allergic.  </li>
            <li>Yet, it is much safer for me and the animals that were not affected by the making of this product.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>It has a nice formula that is not sticky or heavy.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clump, run, or smear nearly as much as most other non-waterproof mascaras.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The color to me seems to be a intense black which I love .&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for high drama eyes, this probably won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li>I tried this because I&#x27;m gluten free, but I keep using it because it works better than even expensive drug store mascaras that I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li>quality is fine but it dried quickly and no much of volume.</li>
            <li>You can apply one coat for a natural look or three or four for a glam look.  </li>
            <li>I have worn it next to ecco bella and really couldn&#x27;t tell the difference by looks.  </li>
            <li>irritate my allergy-prone sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li>Does crumble/flake some at the end of a long day but less than many drug store brands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And when I curl my eyelashes , the mascara seems to stand out more, as I do use other mascaras with this one (ELF and WET</li>
            <li>Opened the mascara excited about other reviews and already the brush is like the standard walmart cheapo $1 mascara wand brushes.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, it is a bit more expensive than the average but worth the money.</li>
            <li>The first few I tried left me disappointed, however, I was really impressed by Zuzu&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The black is a true deep black and the coverage is buildable, from natural to intense.  </li>
            <li>I will stick with my Tarte Camera Lights Lashes and Bare Minerals Volumizer mascara.  </li>
            <li>I only noticed a tiny bit of flaking, about as much as my old mascara.  </li>
            <li>My lashes were long, separated and felt like it wasn&#x27;t a far shot from my Lanc√¥me Definicils, which I had used for years.</li>
            <li>After reading so many reviews and articles about the dangerous chemicals found in our cosmetics, I decided to try a natural product.</li>

            <li> I have long lashes to begin with</li>
            <li> AND IT DOESNT WASH DOWN YOUR FACE BY MID DAY</li>
            <li> It goes on thinly and very evenly and does not clump.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying a few different &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> That was my problm with other brands.</li>
            <li> it goes on smoothly, no clumps, flakes or smudges after a long day.  </li>
            <li> I put another layer on and add some dark, smokey liner.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh my lashes down and holds the curl well.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands and they pale in comparison to this brand.  </li>
            <li> This mascara does not go on heavy and dark for that &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; factor, but I do not mind.</li>
            <li> Would like a little water resistant.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of this mascara, which I wear every now and then, but realize I always feel little bits and prickles in my eyes when I wear it.</li>
            <li> but it could be richer and easier to apply, a little dry or thin I guess</li>
            <li> I am slowly changing over to non-toxic products and chose this to replace my Diorshow waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li> and it goes on thin.</li>
            <li> I am not a person who likes to wear false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> cuz they&#x27;re all guilty of it!</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to find mascara without either beeswax or cera alba (synthetic beeswax).</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is one of the best natural mascaras that I have tried, I like this Zuzu Luxe mascara more than Suncoat or Earth&#x27;s Beauty.  It has a nice formula that is not sticky or heavy.  It does not weigh my lashes down and holds the curl well.  It is not clumpy even after the second or third coat and does not smudge, thickens and lengthens well.  I am transitioning into using non-toxic/natural make up and this mascara is a must have for anyone trying to eliminate toxins from their cosmetics.  I wish that it is waterproof, however, this mascara is water resistant. It is very easy to remove with my eye make up remover or even just water and soap.  I highly recommend this product, it is a bit more expensive than the average but worth the money.</li>
            <li> One of the rare mascaras that doesn&#x27;t clump at the end of the lash and doesn&#x27;t smudge (much) when I rub my eyes.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT NATURAL MASCARA!! IT STAYS ON NICELY AND IT DOESNT WASH DOWN YOUR FACE BY MID DAY LIKE SOME OF THE OTHER NATURAL MASCARAS DO! GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I am slowly changing over to non-toxic products and chose this to replace my Diorshow waterproof mascara.  I received it about a week ago.  It goes on thinly and very evenly and does not clump.  You can apply one coat for a natural look or three or four for a glam look.  I only noticed a tiny bit of flaking, about as much as my old mascara.  It is not waterproof, but it stays on even at the gym and doesn&#x27;t give me racoon eyes.  I am happy with this replacement.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to wear mascara for over 10 years. I read about Zulu products, tried it and can now wear mascara. So glad to have found it.</li>
            <li> I love how light this feels on!  I forget its on!  And I really appreciate how its not made with beeswax as I am allergic.  It is very difficult to find mascara without either beeswax or cera alba (synthetic beeswax).</li>
            <li> I received this item in a timely manner.  After having to switch to vegan makeup, it is taking me a while to get used to it.  This is a lovely product, just not what I am used to.  Yet, it is much safer for me and the animals that were not affected by the making of this product.  Thank you, Gabriel Cosmetics!!</li>
            <li> THE MASCARA IS REALLY AWESOME. THE  BEST THING  OF ALL IS THAT IT STAYS ON ALL DAY AND DOESN&#x27;T CLUMP!!!!</li>
            <li> I love it,, still used it, No irritatation on my eyes! That was my problm with other brands.</li>
            <li> Great mascara!  And, not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> Really good mascara. Does crumble/flake some at the end of a long day but less than many drug store brands. Started using this after having irritation from all others. I tried and tossed Cover Girl, Loreal, Merle Norman, Clinique, and Maybelline. Was first try for organic. Washes off very easily. Maybe too easily. Would like a little water resistant. No prob with contacts. Doesn&#x27;t smear or clump.  Darkens lashes well but doesn&#x27;t make lashes look thicker or more defined. I&#x27;ll keep using.&lt;br /&gt;,</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!  I have tried other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands and they pale in comparison to this brand.  The texture is smooth (not clumping) and elongates my lashes beautifully.</li>
            <li> quality is fine but it dried quickly and no much of volume.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of this mascara, which I wear every now and then, but realize I always feel little bits and prickles in my eyes when I wear it. This became unbearable when I began wearing contact lenses,</li>
            <li> I tried this because I&#x27;m gluten free, but I keep using it because it works better than even expensive drug store mascaras that I&#x27;ve purchased.  I wear contacts and it doesn&#x27;t flake or irritate.  The black is a true deep black and the coverage is buildable, from natural to intense.  So happy to find this after trying over 15 different mascaras.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara. The brush is exactly as the picture shows. I like brushes like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color to me seems to be a intense black which I love .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when I curl my eyelashes , the mascara seems to stand out more, as I do use other mascaras with this one (ELF and WET AND WILD)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a cruelty free and vegan mascara ever since Tarte sold out to an animal testing company (still pissed about that one). I have only used it a couple times but with only one coat I get a lot of length and fullness! I really like it. I am not a person who likes to wear false eyelashes. So if I can find a mascara that lengthens nicely it&#x27;s a win in my book!</li>
            <li> I have been trying a few different &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; mascaras and like this one the best.  It is more expensive than some but holds up well.  My lashes look nice and full and I have no flaking throughout the day.  It easily washes off at night.  I have worn it next to ecco bella and really couldn&#x27;t tell the difference by looks.  It is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump, run, or smear nearly as much as most other non-waterproof mascaras. Goes on smooth and mess-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t irritate my allergy-prone sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I have this and just recently bought some for my mother. Seldom do I wear mascara, but when I do this is the only kind I have or wear. That being said, I&#x27;ve had my first tube for going on three years, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on easily, lasts well and looks gorgeous in a natural way. If you&#x27;re looking for high drama eyes, this probably won&#x27;t work for you. If you just want to look like a more glamorous naturally radiant version of yourself, this&#x27;ll do it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I doubt I&#x27;ll ever buy a different mascara or brand of mascara, unless they stop making this!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on yet another quest for great, cruelty-free mascara and I am so glad I did. It goes on smoothly and does not clump, even with layering. It does not get all over my eyelids, and the marks that do go astray come off easily with a dampened cotton swab. This mascara does not go on heavy and dark for that &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; factor, but I do not mind. If I want a more lashy look I put another layer on and add some dark, smokey liner. For a natural look, I use one, quick layer and am ready to go. Very happy with ZuZu and thrilled that no animals were harmed in the making of my eye lashes.</li>
            <li> I really love this mascara. After reading so many reviews and articles about the dangerous chemicals found in our cosmetics, I decided to try a natural product. The first few I tried left me disappointed, however, I was really impressed by Zuzu&#x27;s. My lashes were long, separated and felt like it wasn&#x27;t a far shot from my Lanc√¥me Definicils, which I had used for years.</li>
            <li> was looking for a really good natural mascara and have tried a few that were okay.  Then I tried the ZUZU mascara!  That was it...it goes on smoothly, no clumps, flakes or smudges after a long day.  Probably doesn&#x27;t do what a lot of \\&quot;fashion\\&quot; ideals of how many x&#x27;s thicker.  But color is deep and lashes show well.  Love this mascara</li>
            <li> not perfect mascara as there should be a giant class action lawsuit against all mascaras that claim clump flake free etc.. cuz they&#x27;re all guilty of it! but the brand and product seem trustworthy and the mascara works pretty lovelyly but it could be richer and easier to apply, a little dry or thin I guess but pretty sweet. I&#x27;d probably rate it at the top of the handful of &#x27;naturalish&#x27; mascaras I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li> Opened the mascara excited about other reviews and already the brush is like the standard walmart cheapo $1 mascara wand brushes.  So, i tried it anyway and it goes on thin. It does nothing for volume or length. I have long lashes to begin with and it didn&#x27;t do anything to make them stand out to begin with.  I also noticed that is comes of easily when your eyes water or if you get tears when you laugh, it runs all over the place.  I will stick with my Tarte Camera Lights Lashes and Bare Minerals Volumizer mascara.  Now, those create volume and length and help your lashes grow.</li>
