            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I think you may find it as unexpectedly effective as I have found it.</li>
            <li>Nice texture without drying</li>
            <li>Now that I found a way to use it that suits my own hair needs, I like it more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product, smells great, will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>This does not look or seem authentic to the sample bottle I already have which is not a metallic writing or top.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I love my Kenra Texture Spray, use it every day.  </li>
            <li>This product is what I wanted the famous Oribe texture spray to be.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, as a guy with the most unruly curly hair that I swear has an attitude of its own, one that refuses to conform to the very commands of Zeus (insert your god here)</li>
            <li>A couple of sprays and a little teasing and my hair is perfect</li>
            <li>I am a Davines girl with most products but this has been added to my routine and definitely one of my favorite all time hair products.</li>
            <li>(I really wish it was available through Prime.)</li>
            <li>and this gives my hair so much volume!</li>
            <li>First of all, though I am a Prime member, I did not purchase this product on Amazon, but the product works</li>
            <li>Since I have reordered several times, I wish you had a loyalty program to get a better price for doing so.</li>
            <li>and I was pretty wowed.</li>
            <li>Creates volume at the roots and makes styling much easier.</li>
            <li>This hairspray doesn&#x27;t hold very well.</li>
            <li>(not even kidding)--at a reasonable discount, of course.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to people with curly and/or thinning hair.</li>
            <li>It helps the hair to become a little more &amp;#34;grippy&amp;#34; for styling with bobby pins and whatnot.</li>
            <li>Was her hairdresser trying to get rid of old stock?!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I paid $42 for another high end brand....bought Kenra and its the same.</li>
            <li>Great substitute for the expensive Oribe Dry Texturizing Spray</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products to keep my hair tame, to keep it from looking frizzy or dried out, but until now, I&#x27;ve never come across a product that works as well as this one does.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair.</li>

            <li> I have fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> Product indicates it&#x27;s dry texture spray but the bottle that was received said dry shampoo which is not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Thought this was DRY shampoo (looks just like it too and even read the description).</li>
            <li> Spray at roots and let it dry, then style.</li>
            <li> a dry shampoo, it&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> I have really flat, thin, straight hair</li>
            <li> My hair is long, thin and flat\--this really thickens each strand for an over all &amp;#34;fuller&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Spray a little at the roots and rub gently- instant thickness, not sticky.</li>
            <li> And may your unruly hair be but a distant memory of days that once were.</li>
            <li> And slightly sticky and you can&#x27;t refix or readjust your hair.</li>
            <li> I tried and tried to like the Oribe but it always left my hair oily and definitely not good at keeping roots lifted.</li>
            <li> Save a few bucks with Kenra.</li>
            <li> It is not sticky and just holds hair in place without feeling stiff.</li>
            <li> So, if you&#x27;re hair is in need of some in-the-bud-nipping as mine usually is, then give this product a try.</li>
            <li> have used this product in the past and like it.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> I am addicted!!</li>
            <li> awful!</li>
            <li> What crap!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely base over apex with this stuff!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s the worst thing that could happen?</li>

    <ol>
            <li> In my opinion, its the best texture spray on the market.  I am addicted!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Spray a little at the roots and rub gently- instant thickness, not sticky. Creates volume at the roots and makes styling much easier. I don&#x27;t use on length of hair- just at roots. It&#x27;s perfect!!</li>
            <li> Turns hair white...residue.  awful!</li>
            <li> I have really flat, thin, straight hair and this gives my hair so much volume! A couple of sprays and a little teasing and my hair is perfect</li>
            <li> Product indicates it&#x27;s dry texture spray but the bottle that was received said dry shampoo which is not what I wanted. This does not look or seem authentic to the sample bottle I already have which is not a metallic writing or top.</li>
            <li> Thought this was DRY shampoo (looks just like it too and even read the description). Not happy.</li>
            <li> First of all, though I am a Prime member, I did not purchase this product on Amazon, but the product works so well I had to give it a review. (I really wish it was available through Prime.) My wife&#x27;s hairdresser gave this to her as a gift. I saw it sitting in the bathroom cupboard one day thinking it was hairspray, and so I sprayed it into my hair. I remember thinking, &amp;#34;BLIMEY! This hairspray doesn&#x27;t hold very well. What crap! Was her hairdresser trying to get rid of old stock?!&amp;#34; A bit later I noticed my hair seemed a bit thicker and easier to manage. Let me tell you, as a guy with the most unruly curly hair that I swear has an attitude of its own, one that refuses to conform to the very commands of Zeus (insert your god here) himself, this product works amazingly well! I&#x27;ve tried so many products to keep my hair tame, to keep it from looking frizzy or dried out, but until now, I&#x27;ve never come across a product that works as well as this one does. I&#x27;m absolutely base over apex with this stuff! And for you guys out there with thinning hair, not only does this product work for controlling hair, but it makes an obvious and noticeable difference in terms of hair thickness. I kid you not! I highly recommend it to people with curly and/or thinning hair. I think you may find it as unexpectedly effective as I have found it. So, if you&#x27;re hair is in need of some in-the-bud-nipping as mine usually is, then give this product a try. What&#x27;s the worst thing that could happen? You spend about 14 bucks or so and find out you don&#x27;t like the product? Well, return it, or message me and I&#x27;ll buy it from you (not even kidding)--at a reasonable discount, of course. Enjoy! And may your unruly hair be but a distant memory of days that once were.</li>
            <li> Nice texture without drying</li>
            <li> Great substitute for the expensive Oribe Dry Texturizing Spray</li>
            <li> Works great! Spray at roots and let it dry, then style. Not greasy. Gives me the volume I crave! I have fine thin hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> I paid $42 for another high end brand....bought Kenra and its the same. Save a few bucks with Kenra.</li>
            <li> PERFECT balance for styling and settingðŸ˜˜</li>
            <li> Great product, smells great, will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair frizzy!!! And slightly sticky and you can&#x27;t refix or readjust your hair. Try oribe.. That stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> have used this product in the past and like it.</li>
            <li> Since I have reordered several times, I wish you had a loyalty program to get a better price for doing so.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, it took me a while to like this product. Now that I found a way to use it that suits my own hair needs, I like it more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a dry shampoo, it&#x27;s... okay. As a texturizing, volumizing sort of deal, it&#x27;s wonderful. It helps the hair to become a little more &amp;#34;grippy&amp;#34; for styling with bobby pins and whatnot.</li>
            <li> Best there is!!! I love my Kenra Texture Spray, use it every day.  Does not leave hair sticky, and won&#x27;t leave build-up.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! This product is what I wanted the famous Oribe texture spray to be. I tried and tried to like the Oribe but it always left my hair oily and definitely not good at keeping roots lifted. But then comes along this product and I was pretty wowed. I spray on my roots and play with it a bit and gives great rootlift as well as a nice texture with hold to rest of hair. I am a Davines girl with most products but this has been added to my routine and definitely one of my favorite all time hair products. I have a short texturized bob haircut but think it would work well on any length.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product to get some texture into your hair for updo hair styles.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, thin and flat\--this really thickens each strand for an over all &amp;#34;fuller&amp;#34; look. Also great for styling. Hold curls and great for teasing.</li>
            <li> Ths product is very nice. It is not sticky and just holds hair in place without feeling stiff.</li>
