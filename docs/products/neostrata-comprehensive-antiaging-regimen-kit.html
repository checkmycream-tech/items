            <li> One trick is the face is still moist, not drenched after cleansing with wash and the other products will glide on easier with less amount.</li>
            <li> I found the product produced skin irritation and redness without any noticeable results for the dark eyes.  </li>
            <li> me wonder if they were heavily diluted.</li>
            <li> Neostrata uses an acid base to gently slough off the dead skin.  </li>
            <li> Even that they are small!</li>
            <li> I have never experienced this before.</li>
            <li> Sorry, used it for a year, and all of a sudden cancer made my face hate it.</li>
            <li> So sad, so allergic.</li>
            <li> and I havent heard any bad stuff and about it</li>
            <li> Going to after to find another way to get it at the correct price :-(</li>

            <li> Seems to work.  Nothing really evident yet.  Good way to try out a product.</li>
            <li> why don&#x27;t they tell you the size? sample sizes is what was sent. I think it is a rip off.</li>
            <li> Fabulous, my face is so smooth and soft!!</li>
            <li> The green colored containers from neostrata are for sensitive skin and neostrata is best skin product out there.</li>
            <li> I been using this product for a year, and it really work for me, my skin is clear and very soft. the eye cream is one of my favorite, I notice a change on my skin is smooth and also i notice change on dark spot are faded.</li>
            <li> have used these products foe the last 3 years, and have purchased this kit through amazon once before. found both lotions and the eye cream to be very runny and.makes me wonder if they were heavily diluted. I have never experienced this before. love the product but from now on will  buy the products through my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I have used Neostrata products for many years and they ever let me down.  This regimen takes it a step further and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Sorry, used it for a year, and all of a sudden cancer made my face hate it. So sad, so allergic.</li>
            <li> Great products.  My dermatologist recommends these products and her prices are much higher than what I can buy through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I got this for a friend and I havent heard any bad stuff and about it so go ahead i get one for yourself</li>
            <li> The result on my skin of my face so good after 5 days u can see the the result</li>
            <li> I think it really worth if you compare the price separately of each one! Even that they are small!</li>
            <li> The lather cleans the skin deeply and the Skin gets very smooth and toned. Skin looks healthier . I really liked the results.</li>
            <li> I found the product produced skin irritation and redness without any noticeable results for the dark eyes.  would suggest passing on this</li>
            <li> I have Been using these products for a few years, they are very wonderful for anti aging.  My derm sells them at her office as well</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this item. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. It&#x27;s a great product. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Neostrata is a medical grade skin care system.  I tried it when my esthetician recommended it in place of exfoliating type scrubbing systems.  Neostrata uses an acid base to gently slough off the dead skin.  My skin has NEVER felt softer.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but being what I received was travel size for this outrages price...... Very up set!  I use to purchase this product from my doctor directly, but moved away... Going to after to find another way to get it at the correct price :-(</li>
            <li> I use all of these products in full size and just keep this set on hand for travel. Since using it, I can tell a definite difference in my skin...have even received compliments on improvement of years of sun damage.</li>
            <li> Great anti aging system. Can see a difference in skin after several weeks of using. I have very sensitive skin and had no reaction. I&#x27;m allergic to most products I have tried...great line. Will be ordering full sizes now</li>
            <li> Nice product, don&#x27;t see improvement yet. using I daily since October 2014</li>
            <li> Love this product, or this kit. Have tried other Neostrata products and this one by far has worked best for me. Have enlarged pores and problem skin (along with wrinkles) and you will see a difference if used as directed within short period of time. Have reordered as this is maybe a months supply if used sparingly. One trick is the face is still moist, not drenched after cleansing with wash and the other products will glide on easier with less amount. Thank you.  PS works super for the &amp;#34;burrow&amp;#34; between the eyes. Fast shipping and cheaper than where I was getting this kit.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than last purchase</li>
            <li> Great comprehensive set. LOVE the eye cream and face wash in particular. Can feel night cream moisturizing over night. I highly recommend.</li>
