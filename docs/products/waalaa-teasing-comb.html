            <li>excellent and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and well made</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s the best backcombing comb and last one you&#x27;ll ever buy.</li>
            <li>Love, love it.  </li>
            <li>the top of the list is this WaaLaa Teasing Comb.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s baby fine.</li>
            <li>Liked it so much</li>
            <li>After reading the glowing reviews about this comb, I was so excited to have it come.</li>
            <li>When I first used it, I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I turned around and bought two more for my adult daughters!  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I really needed a teasing comb, but after trying it I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Once I ordered it it came pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>While this comb does work moderately well for teasing my fine hair, it&#x27;s not anywhere near as effective as the $1.99 Tool Structure  </li>
            <li>Have any of you found that it takes a special trick to get it to work well, especially if you have fine hair?</li>
            <li>Have never used a comb so exact with volumizing my hair.  </li>
            <li>The first time I have ever seen this much body in my hair except when I leave the salon!</li>
            <li>I saw a video about it and was hoping it would do as good a job on my fine thin hair and by gosh it did.  </li>
            <li>It must be so fine that it slips right between the teeth of the WaaLaa and lies just as flat as ever.</li>
            <li>This comb is made very well and it is sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Very heavy-duty...</li>
            <li>the comb really does the job.  </li>
            <li>It is the only one that actually adds height and volume to my very fine hair.</li>
            <li>So great for thin hair!  </li>
            <li>I can comb it through easily, and when I do a little teasing on top, it doesn&#x27;t make it a tangled mess.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t want to live without it</li>
            <li>I gave it two stars, one for the hope it gave me that I might finally have fuller-looking hair, and the second for how substantial it is; it justified the price, in my mind.</li>
            <li>A little pricey, thought it would do more than than the average teasing comb.</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned about spending this much on a comb.  </li>

            <li> Tangled up my hair/is a little too rough for me.. :(</li>
            <li> Not EZ to use.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the best Teasing comb ever !! Don&#x27;t use it for any other reason because it is only for TEASING and does it job 100 %</li>
            <li> Best comb ever to give volume to hair!</li>
            <li> Worth the price. It is the only one that actually adds height and volume to my very fine hair. Combine with Loreal hairspray and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and well made</li>
            <li> Yes this is a lot of money for a comb. But it&#x27;s the best backcombing comb and last one you&#x27;ll ever buy. Unless you loose it, like me. Then you&#x27;ll be back searching the web trying to remember it&#x27;s name. It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> While this comb does work moderately well for teasing my fine hair, it&#x27;s not anywhere near as effective as the $1.99 Tool Structure  teasing comb I bought at Sally Beauty to bring along on a trip. Skip the $24-30 WaaLaa comb and visit your local beauty supply instead. You&#x27;ll be happier and have saved a lot of money!</li>
            <li> This comb is made very well and it is sturdy.  It does a great job backcombing and creating good lift.</li>
            <li> Love, love it.  Works perfectly on my hair to give me just the fullness I like.  Liked it so much I ordered another in case I lose one</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I really needed a teasing comb, but after trying it I really like it.  It does work.</li>
            <li> Best teasing comb ever.  Have never used a comb so exact with volumizing my hair.  Don&#x27;t want to live without it</li>
            <li> Different from all others......excellent and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Very heavy-duty...great at teasing hair!</li>
            <li> After reading the glowing reviews about this comb, I was so excited to have it come. Five stars can&#x27;t be wrong, can they, and how often is anything rated that highly? Well. I&#x27;m sad to say that it sure didn&#x27;t work for me. I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s baby fine. It must be so fine that it slips right between the teeth of the WaaLaa and lies just as flat as ever. I&#x27;ve tried holding the comb at every angle I can think of, flipping the hair in every way I can think of, figuring it has to be an operator problem, but nothing&#x27;s worked. Have any of you found that it takes a special trick to get it to work well, especially if you have fine hair? I gave it two stars, one for the hope it gave me that I might finally have fuller-looking hair, and the second for how substantial it is; it justified the price, in my mind. But substantial alone just doesn&#x27;t do it. Puh-leeze, if anyone can think of some little trick that might work, please let me know. I wish I&#x27;d paid more attention to JLo&#x27;s review and headed for Sally&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> This teasing comb is great.  I like the way it teases my hair,but I also like when I blow dry my hair I use this comb and it gives me lots of volume before I even tease it.  Once I ordered it it came pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed. It isn&#x27;t horrible, but not any better than a regular comb for teasing.</li>
            <li> Great, works wonders, wish I had it in the sixties!</li>
            <li> So great for thin hair!  Teases so well.  I am very happy with it.  I turned around and bought two more for my adult daughters!  Yes, I like the product!</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this comb, I was not sure I would like it.  When I first used it, I fell in love with it.  It works great.</li>

            <li> There are three products new to my beauty routine everyday...the top of the list is this WaaLaa Teasing Comb.  It is easy to use and does a great job without damaging my hair.  Where was this when I needed it in the 60&#x27;s?</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about spending this much on a comb.  I saw a video about it and was hoping it would do as good a job on my fine thin hair and by gosh it did.  The first time I have ever seen this much body in my hair except when I leave the salon!</li>
            <li> This comb does what it says! Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised!  Love it.</li>
