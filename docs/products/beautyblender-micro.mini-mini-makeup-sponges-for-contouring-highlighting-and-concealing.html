            <li>Great for under the eyes, but I still prefer to just use the original size.</li>
            <li>They are soft lil squishies who work best damp.</li>
            <li>they are great and so easy to clean! :)</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so easy to use!</li>
            <li>Love Love Love these lil micro minis!</li>
            <li>cute!&lt;br /&gt;Its perfect for blending out your concealer, and great for using under your eyes to get into every little spot, since these&lt;br /&gt;beauty blenders are tiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tried to use it as concealer applicator but took more time to blend.</li>
            <li>I should have read more thoroughly about this product.</li>
            <li>I love it .</li>
            <li>LOVE these.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so cute.</li>
            <li>I love the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d find it appropriate for around the eye area which is what I&#x27;ll be using it for.  </li>
            <li>I just had to had these cute mini sponges.</li>
            <li>But, I love the Beauty Blender.  </li>
            <li>They work ok with concealer</li>
            <li>I LOVE this sponge...</li>
            <li>i love it&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>They are just ok.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this product and will never buy another brand again.</li>
            <li>With that being said I am excited to own them.</li>
            <li>I was surprised on how much I loved these mini blenders!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very handle and blend the concealer very smooth .. good job</li>
            <li>Original ones!</li>
            <li>Its a great product though and shipping super fast!  </li>
            <li>I like the original beauty blender more.</li>
            <li>Makes concealer easy to apply without looking cakey</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to get out foundation and concealer after a use.</li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>and so easy to travel with</li>
            <li>So cute specially the size</li>
            <li>Although some might not think they are necessary, which the probably aren&#x27;t for most, I have found them to be a very handy product.</li>
            <li>The pointed tip ensures accuracy for tight spaces (i.e., corners of eyes), whereas the rounded party blends concealer flawlessly on the rest of face.</li>
            <li>Best little mini-blenders for applying make-up under the eye.....</li>
            <li>I love the original beauty blender and I thought the mini would be perfect for concealing but it is just too small.</li>
            <li>After one week of use mines got a huge tear on the bottom...</li>
            <li>They are great just very tiny!</li>
            <li>If you are looking to save some space and travel light then these are for you.  </li>
            <li>Perfect size for concealing under eyes and trouble spots</li>
            <li>I have used the larger ones for years but these are really great for getting along the nose line and under the eyes as well as along the hairline.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought the larger beauty blender which works great too</li>
            <li>The BBs expand with water to almost twice the original size.</li>
            <li>These are awesome, but they are just to small for just about everything.</li>
            <li>I prefer the original Beauty Blender over the micro.</li>
            <li>These cute little baby blenders are great for the eye area, and for contouring.</li>
            <li>It does the job but nothing special.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great, but they are like pill size, you might as well just buy a normal sized beauty blender and not waste your time with these.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only good for looks, trust me please..</li>
            <li>Love this mini blender ,it blends very well</li>
            <li>Great product - same quality as the Original, but doesn&#x27;t really do anything the full size BB can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li>Ok I am a HUGE fan of the beauty blender&#x27;s but as far as these I am not a fan.</li>
            <li>I have both the authentic and the not so authentic and they both work the same.</li>
            <li>Great for under-eye use and to get into little areas and crevices which the original BB struggles with.</li>
            <li>These are great for applying concealer around the eyes and also great for contouring and getting in hard to reach areas like the inner corner of your eyes and the sides of your nose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful blender for smaller hard to reach spots for more percise areas of curves around the nose, eyes, upper lips and even good for highlighting, contouring areas.  </li>
            <li>These little sponges work great.</li>
            <li>Nevertheles, they give the same amazing flawless/airbrushed result.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;These have been part of my daily makeup routine, and Ive been loving the results!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
            <li>and also it comes right on time</li>
            <li>These small sponges are great for applying concealer around the eyes area.  </li>
            <li>They do not pull or tug the delicate skin and blend the product beautifully.  </li>
            <li>The mini beauty blender works much better for those smaller areas and they are much easier to clean.</li>
            <li>A lil sponge for little areas, as nice a sponge as the original.</li>
            <li>Now they claim that its great for blending in those hard to reach spaces and creases and even blending in cream products for contouring of the nose.</li>
            <li>I guess mini really means mini!</li>
            <li>I wish these came in a 1 pack, they could also be a tad larger and work better.  </li>
            <li>This was my first Beauty Blender product and I have always wanted to try them.  </li>
            <li>I already use the regular sized BeautyBlenders and love them.</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed is that it didn&#x27;t feel as bouncy and squishy.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off using a regular beauty blender to apply concealer and draw contours..</li>
            <li>this micro mini is just too micro :) If it were a tag bigger, I think I&#x27;d like it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>so cute and tiny!</li>
            <li>, this is not as dense and is more porous than my larger original.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it blends very well for highlighting and i do say it is worth the buy.</li>
            <li>They are super cute, not very functional.</li>
            <li>They are well worth the price and work better than any other brand I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Really too small to be of good use.</li>
            <li>Very upset</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is something that you would use for your whole face.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t read the description very well.  </li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>The product is the real.</li>
            <li>Tbh, ive yet to find a real reason for these</li>
            <li>The receipt of the request Thanks</li>
            <li>Yes they are really cute, but I don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re that essential to complete or even blend my makeup to perfection.</li>
            <li>but i dont like it and will just stick to the original bigger size.</li>
            <li>For my purposes, I could have used something about 50% smaller than the original, and this is probably about 70-80% smaller.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Same great quality but too small.</li>
            <li>n gives my highlight a vibrant look.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>recommend these little ones :)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving these, despite owning at least 65 high end makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>I had been using the large sized one for both my foundation as well as my concealer but these smaller sized ones make getting around the eyes so much easier.  </li>
            <li>These tiny beauty blenders are super tiny, yet helpful &amp; very</li>
            <li>They are pretty tiny.  </li>
            <li>A little small for my tastes, but could be great for someone else.</li>
            <li>They are very small, the big one is more worth your money</li>
            <li>I dont like the price and if used daily and cleaned daily these sponges seem to deteriorate quickly.</li>
            <li>Much easier for under eye area than traditional beauty blender</li>
            <li>I would go to Ulta and get the bigger Real Techniques one.</li>
            <li>Even cheaper than I could have purchased with my professional discount.</li>
            <li>, it is soooo soft...</li>
            <li>but i really could just use my finger or the actual beauty blender.</li>
            <li>Good for putting makeup on in small, tight areas</li>
            <li>I love beauty blender products and at first thought these would be a waste of money or gimmicky.</li>
            <li>in all, while it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected, I would still recommend.</li>
            <li>I almost purchased the large ones but decided the smaller version might be easier to use for around the eyes &amp; I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to using a brush for concealer.</li>
            <li>I got this mainly to apply undereye concealer, as my larger BB original is a little big for getting in and around the eye</li>
            <li>/&gt;They wash very easily &amp; dry fast too...</li>
            <li>With the Original BB&#x27;s pointed tip, you can get into all the small areas with ease.</li>
            <li>As for using the larger one to apply foundation, I haven&#x27;t tried it, but I&#x27;m very much loyal to my Sigma F80 brush for foundation, so for now I&#x27;ll stick with these little mini beauty blenders for concealer.</li>
            <li>I use these little blenders for applying concealer &amp; they are magical little wonders.</li>
            <li>Then when I wet it to see if that&#x27;d help it still felt different than my old one!</li>
            <li>But never the less, if you&#x27;re into just having a broad range of makeup tools, these are a cute little addition but not super necessary.</li>

            <li> Nevertheles, they give the same amazing flawless/airbrushed result.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;These have been part of my daily makeup routine, and Ive been loving the results!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
            <li> and also it comes right on time</li>
            <li> These small sponges are great for applying concealer around the eyes area.  </li>
            <li> They do not pull or tug the delicate skin and blend the product beautifully.  </li>
            <li> The mini beauty blender works much better for those smaller areas and they are much easier to clean.</li>
            <li> A lil sponge for little areas, as nice a sponge as the original.</li>
            <li> Now they claim that its great for blending in those hard to reach spaces and creases and even blending in cream products for contouring of the nose.</li>
            <li> I guess mini really means mini!</li>
            <li> I wish these came in a 1 pack, they could also be a tad larger and work better.  </li>
            <li> This was my first Beauty Blender product and I have always wanted to try them.  </li>
            <li> I already use the regular sized BeautyBlenders and love them.</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed is that it didn&#x27;t feel as bouncy and squishy.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off using a regular beauty blender to apply concealer and draw contours..</li>
            <li> this micro mini is just too micro :) If it were a tag bigger, I think I&#x27;d like it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> so cute and tiny!</li>
            <li> , this is not as dense and is more porous than my larger original.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it blends very well for highlighting and i do say it is worth the buy.</li>
            <li> They are super cute, not very functional.</li>
            <li> They are well worth the price and work better than any other brand I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Really too small to be of good use.</li>
            <li> Very upset</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is something that you would use for your whole face.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the description very well.  </li>
            <li> I really like these.</li>
            <li> The product is the real.</li>
            <li> Tbh, ive yet to find a real reason for these</li>
            <li> The receipt of the request Thanks</li>
            <li> Yes they are really cute, but I don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re that essential to complete or even blend my makeup to perfection.</li>
            <li> but i dont like it and will just stick to the original bigger size.</li>
            <li> For my purposes, I could have used something about 50% smaller than the original, and this is probably about 70-80% smaller.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Same great quality but too small.</li>
            <li> n gives my highlight a vibrant look.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> recommend these little ones :)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving these, despite owning at least 65 high end makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I had been using the large sized one for both my foundation as well as my concealer but these smaller sized ones make getting around the eyes so much easier.  </li>
            <li> These tiny beauty blenders are super tiny, yet helpful &amp; very</li>
            <li> They are pretty tiny.  </li>
            <li> A little small for my tastes, but could be great for someone else.</li>
            <li> They are very small, the big one is more worth your money</li>
            <li> I dont like the price and if used daily and cleaned daily these sponges seem to deteriorate quickly.</li>
            <li> Much easier for under eye area than traditional beauty blender</li>
            <li> I would go to Ulta and get the bigger Real Techniques one.</li>
            <li> Even cheaper than I could have purchased with my professional discount.</li>
            <li> , it is soooo soft...</li>
            <li> but i really could just use my finger or the actual beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Good for putting makeup on in small, tight areas</li>
            <li> I love beauty blender products and at first thought these would be a waste of money or gimmicky.</li>
            <li> in all, while it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected, I would still recommend.</li>
            <li> I almost purchased the large ones but decided the smaller version might be easier to use for around the eyes &amp; I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to using a brush for concealer.</li>
            <li> I got this mainly to apply undereye concealer, as my larger BB original is a little big for getting in and around the eye</li>
            <li> /&gt;They wash very easily &amp; dry fast too...</li>
            <li> With the Original BB&#x27;s pointed tip, you can get into all the small areas with ease.</li>
            <li> As for using the larger one to apply foundation, I haven&#x27;t tried it, but I&#x27;m very much loyal to my Sigma F80 brush for foundation, so for now I&#x27;ll stick with these little mini beauty blenders for concealer.</li>
            <li> I use these little blenders for applying concealer &amp; they are magical little wonders.</li>
            <li> Then when I wet it to see if that&#x27;d help it still felt different than my old one!</li>
            <li> But never the less, if you&#x27;re into just having a broad range of makeup tools, these are a cute little addition but not super necessary.</li>
            <li> took my conclear game to a whole new level!</li>
            <li> Not sure if you really need noth sizes</li>
            <li> Not meant for larger areas of the face, recommend the larger BB in pink.  </li>
            <li> They are the same size as a regular pink beauty blender!</li>
            <li> I actually thought these would be a little big larger than they were -</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> It was a lot smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Any how, it is the same as the other...</li>
            <li> Some makeup artists and beauty authorities online have said they&#x27;re a gimmick, and that you should just use the pointed end of the regular beauty blender to do the same thing, but when you want to use a rounded end, you can only do that with this mini size in small areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, as I see others have stated as well, I was surprised by just how small these are.  </li>
            <li> I thought, hey, it might be half the size of the regular one, but</li>
            <li> They get into my inner corners and small spaces around my eyes that a larger sponge couldn&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> Wish I could get a refund as they are really pointless as long as you have a standard beauty blender</li>
            <li> They are very very small, and hard to manipulate at first, they cannot be used dried as the big size beauty blender.</li>
            <li> These are not real!</li>
            <li> When I first saw these and was so obsessed</li>
            <li> it is tiny however it gets in the small areas</li>
            <li> If you have large fingers these may prove difficult to use with ease.</li>
            <li> the quality of the sponge is the same but its hard to hold.</li>
            <li> and it costs £10.00 ,not worth the money .</li>
            <li> Very small comparing to the regular beauty blender</li>
            <li> I expected them to be small to be used under the eyes and</li>
            <li> This little thing can get in places you never imagined.</li>
            <li> but it was a little bulky for the under eye area.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this case.</li>
            <li> I use these small beauty blenders to apply concealer and foundation over my dark circles.</li>
            <li> Was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I knew these were small</li>
            <li> but these are really small</li>
            <li> so you can have an idea of how truly small these are.</li>
            <li> Too small for applying makeup</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it was going to be so small</li>
            <li> but she hardly uses it.</li>
            <li> Returned; way too small!</li>
            <li> excuse my dirty beauty blender</li>
            <li> If I had known that, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it (seriously, put some freaking dimensions on it - though</li>
            <li> Why dirty up a big one for my foundation and these little ones for concealer and then have to wash them all when I could dirty just one and use it for everything.</li>
            <li> The packaging was even broken when I opened it.</li>
            <li> Not even small!!!</li>
            <li> WTF</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> Tried to use it as a travel kit but got frustrated.</li>
            <li> Was really disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i get the reason why for its smallness but i dont like it and will just stick to the original bigger size.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great, but they are like pill size, you might as well just buy a normal sized beauty blender and not waste your time with these.</li>
            <li> Returned; way too small!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only good for looks, trust me please.. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this case. Was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Same great quality but too small. Tried to use it as concealer applicator but took more time to blend. Tried to use it as a travel kit but got frustrated.</li>
            <li> I should have read more thoroughly about this product. They are great just very tiny! I almost threw them away because I didn&#x27;t even see them. I thought they were regular size when I ordered them but they are as big as a quarter. They work well around the eye area though! I guess mini really means mini!</li>
            <li> I love it . Will buy it again</li>
            <li> I wish these came in a 1 pack, they could also be a tad larger and work better.  I also think they are over priced.  Wish I could get a refund as they are really pointless as long as you have a standard beauty blender</li>
            <li> i love these minis! they get in great under and around your eye area!</li>
            <li> Item works great.  This was my first Beauty Blender product and I have always wanted to try them.  They are well worth the price and work better than any other brand I have tried.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use these little blenders for applying concealer &amp; they are magical little wonders. Where have they been all my life?! I almost purchased the large ones but decided the smaller version might be easier to use for around the eyes &amp; I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to using a brush for concealer. As for using the larger one to apply foundation, I haven&#x27;t tried it, but I&#x27;m very much loyal to my Sigma F80 brush for foundation, so for now I&#x27;ll stick with these little mini beauty blenders for concealer.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this</li>
            <li> It does the job but nothing special. I like the original beauty blender more.</li>
            <li> I knew these were small but I was not expecting them to be the size of a robin&#x27;s egg. If you have large fingers these may prove difficult to use with ease. With that being said I am excited to own them. I already use the regular sized BeautyBlenders and love them. These will be perfect for around the eyes, lips and nose.</li>
            <li> Original ones! loved it</li>
            <li> My package has been opened upon receipt!!!! Very upset</li>
            <li> LOVE these. For all those people that say you can just use the regular sized beauty blender tip for under eye concealer--you haven&#x27;t used the micro mini blender yet! This little thing can get in places you never imagined. Couldn&#x27;t do my makeup routine without it!</li>
            <li> These are great for applying concealer around the eyes and also great for contouring and getting in hard to reach areas like the inner corner of your eyes and the sides of your nose.</li>
            <li> Great timing,looks just as I hoped</li>
            <li> The product is about 3cm and it costs £10.00 ,not worth the money .</li>
            <li> Love it! Works greats with NYX HD Concealer! Makes concealer easy to apply without looking cakey</li>
            <li> Wife says it does what it says it&#x27;s supposed too.</li>
            <li> These are not real! They are the same size as a regular pink beauty blender! I expected them to be small to be used under the eyes and what not. The packaging was even broken when I opened it. Even the shape is different! First thing I noticed is that it didn&#x27;t feel as bouncy and squishy. Then when I wet it to see if that&#x27;d help it still felt different than my old one! Now I know not to trust Amazon with brand name beauty products! Not even small!!! excuse my dirty beauty blender but I wanted to insert a picture to compare. WTF</li>
            <li> Not sure if you really need noth sizes but it&#x27;s so cute. It works well I just wish it was also stain resistance.</li>
            <li> Amazing, Love it, Buy it, Get the best countor/highlight/concealer ever</li>
            <li> great product for make-up applications</li>
            <li> So cute specially the size</li>
            <li> Just great product. Very small comparing to the regular beauty blender but it&#x27;s so easy to use! Love it!</li>
            <li> Much easier for under eye area than traditional beauty blender and it&#x27;s easy to get out foundation and concealer after a use.</li>
            <li> I love the beauty blender. And I guess now I have 2 extra. The ones I received are not micro mini/as advertised. See photo.</li>
            <li> I love makeup, these are awesome for blending out concealer under your eyes, contour lines and highlights!!!</li>
            <li> These work great, and I knew they were minis but these are really small</li>
            <li> I was surprised on how much I loved these mini blenders! took my conclear game to a whole new level! wont go back now</li>
            <li> Best little mini-blenders for applying make-up under the eye.....they are great and so easy to clean! :)</li>
            <li> I love the original beauty blender and I thought the mini would be perfect for concealing but it is just too small. the quality of the sponge is the same but its hard to hold. if it were a bit bigger it would be a 5 star instead of 1.</li>
            <li> I love beauty blender products and at first thought these would be a waste of money or gimmicky. I am so glad I bought them because they are perfect for applying and blending out concealer and highlighters. I will repurchase these again.</li>
            <li> Perfect for undereye concealer!</li>
            <li> This is truly a micro blender.  I ordered this for travel purposes.  I&#x27;ve used the larger ones prior to trying these out.  If you are looking to save some space and travel light then these are for you.  I don&#x27;t think this is something that you would use for your whole face.  It&#x27;s something to be used in smaller spaces.  I&#x27;d find it appropriate for around the eye area which is what I&#x27;ll be using it for.  I&#x27;ve attached a photo so you can have an idea of how truly small these are.</li>
            <li> A lil sponge for little areas, as nice a sponge as the original. I dont like the price and if used daily and cleaned daily these sponges seem to deteriorate quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this and kept one for myself and gave one to my sister. After one week of use mines got a huge tear on the bottom...my sisters is still holding up but she hardly uses it. Bummed out!</li>
            <li> Very nice works great</li>
            <li> Mini is definitely MINI!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got the job done tho.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love these lil micro minis! Use them to do my eye makeup. Flawless!!!!</li>
            <li> Every makeup lover like myself understands the importance of having the right sponges and brushes to achieve that flawless makeup look we all want to achieve. When I first saw these and was so obsessed I just had to had these cute mini sponges. Now they claim that its great for blending in those hard to reach spaces and creases and even blending in cream products for contouring of the nose. I can&#x27;t say that it makes that good of an impression that every makeup lover must have these min sponges. Yes they are really cute, but I don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re that essential to complete or even blend my makeup to perfection. But never the less, if you&#x27;re into just having a broad range of makeup tools, these are a cute little addition but not super necessary. hope this helps, happy blending.</li>
            <li> perfect for concealers or around the nose. easy to use.</li>
            <li> These are really tiny, Almost un usable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the size of a tiny robin&#x27;s egg. If I had known that, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it (seriously, put some freaking dimensions on it - though, I guess I should have googled it and watched a video for size comparison). I thought, hey, it might be half the size of the regular one, but no... like 1/8th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any how, it is the same as the other... I would go to Ulta and get the bigger Real Techniques one. It is same texture at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Too small for applying makeup</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful blender for smaller hard to reach spots for more percise areas of curves around the nose, eyes, upper lips and even good for highlighting, contouring areas.  Not meant for larger areas of the face, recommend the larger BB in pink.  Its a great product though and shipping super fast!  As per advertized and quality is terrific.  Been using for 2weeks with concealer, foundation and contouring powders/liquids.  Washes well and dries a bit damp, but can use a towel or blow dryer to help with that.  I&#x27;d reorder again!</li>
            <li> These tiny beauty blenders are super tiny, yet helpful &amp; very cute!&lt;br /&gt;Its perfect for blending out your concealer, and great for using under your eyes to get into every little spot, since these&lt;br /&gt;beauty blenders are tiny.&lt;br /&gt;They wash very easily &amp; dry fast too...&lt;br /&gt;These have been part of my daily makeup routine, and Ive been loving the results!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend these little ones :)</li>
            <li> Really too small to be of good use. The material doesn&#x27;t  seem to be the same as the regular sized beauty blender either.</li>
            <li> These small sponges are great for applying concealer around the eyes area.  They do not pull or tug the delicate skin and blend the product beautifully.  Wish I had discovered them sooner.</li>
            <li> A little small for my tastes, but could be great for someone else.</li>
            <li> They are super cute, not very functional.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off using a regular beauty blender to apply concealer and draw contours.. this micro mini is just too micro :) If it were a tag bigger, I think I&#x27;d like it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for under the eyes!</li>
            <li> Just got them yesterday, and used one this morning with my concealer, and what a difference.  I had been using the large sized one for both my foundation as well as my concealer but these smaller sized ones make getting around the eyes so much easier.  A must have now for makeup!</li>
            <li> I actually thought these would be a little big larger than they were - I didn&#x27;t read the description very well.  But, I love the Beauty Blender.  I use a product called Paula&#x27;s Choice Shine Stopper over my SPF and you&#x27;re not supposed to rub it in - you are supposed to dab it, which isn&#x27;t great for a smooth-looking appearance.  Using Beauty Blender sponges solves that problem.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Works well for placing concealer under eyes or powder.</li>
            <li> so amazing I like these better than the full size because one you get two and also i just concel so these are perfect for that and so easy to travel with</li>
            <li> So usefel for concealer!!</li>
            <li> I am using my husband&#x27;s account. Ok I am a HUGE fan of the beauty blender&#x27;s but as far as these I am not a fan. Here is why. They work ok with concealer BUT the shape is no different than the end of the regular size beauty blender so I reach for it all the time. Why dirty up a big one for my foundation and these little ones for concealer and then have to wash them all when I could dirty just one and use it for everything. I hope this made since lol I would not buy them again. I&#x27;ll stick to my bigger one.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! I love it!</li>
            <li> Perfect! Even cheaper than I could have purchased with my professional discount. Great for under-eye use and to get into little areas and crevices which the original BB struggles with.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve researched the size. They are very small, the big one is more worth your money</li>
            <li> Good product. Excellent Job.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very handle and blend the concealer very smooth .. good job</li>
            <li> Love this mini blender ,it blends very well ☺</li>
            <li> I really like these. Good for putting makeup on in small, tight areas but I have used them for larger areas too-it just takes a while. I need to buy the regular one too.</li>
            <li> so cute and tiny! perfect for blending in my undereye concealer.</li>
            <li> These little sponges work great.</li>
            <li> I bought these for applying under eye concealer and it works wonderfully.  I originally bought the larger beauty blender which works great too but it was a little bulky for the under eye area.  The mini beauty blender works much better for those smaller areas and they are much easier to clean.</li>
            <li> They are very very small, and hard to manipulate at first, they cannot be used dried as the big size beauty blender. Nevertheles, they give the same amazing flawless/airbrushed result.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for concealing under eyes and trouble spots</li>
            <li> I got this mainly to apply undereye concealer, as my larger BB original is a little big for getting in and around the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;First, as I see others have stated as well, I was surprised by just how small these are.  They are pretty tiny.  For my purposes, I could have used something about 50% smaller than the original, and this is probably about 70-80% smaller.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is not as dense and is more porous than my larger original.&lt;br /&gt;Intially, I wasn&#x27;t optimistic, but after using it a couple of weeks, I will say it does get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for undereyes, and I also find it handy for eye primer and dabbing a bit of concealer (liquid or mineral) just where needed.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, while it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected, I would still recommend.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this sponge...it is tiny however it gets in the small areas n gives my highlight a vibrant look. It did expand after i drenched it in water, it is soooo soft...i love it&lt;br /&gt;Will buy the big one got this as a tester.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Again&lt;br /&gt;Happy &amp; Returning Customer</li>
            <li> I use these small beauty blenders to apply concealer and foundation over my dark circles. They get into my inner corners and small spaces around my eyes that a larger sponge couldn&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for me that the big one can&#x27;t do.  Was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> The product is the real. it is like the actual beauty blender at sephora and comes excatly like the picture. it blends very well for highlighting and i do say it is worth the buy. and also it comes right on time</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it was going to be so small but I like it</li>
            <li> They are just ok. I have both the authentic and the not so authentic and they both work the same.</li>
            <li> These cute little baby blenders are great for the eye area, and for contouring. Some makeup artists and beauty authorities online have said they&#x27;re a gimmick, and that you should just use the pointed end of the regular beauty blender to do the same thing, but when you want to use a rounded end, you can only do that with this mini size in small areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using one for shading and one for concealer/highlight and I&#x27;m loving these, despite owning at least 65 high end makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> Baby beauty blender. Tbh, ive yet to find a real reason for these but i have seen them used as contouring tools. I sometimes use this beauty booger under my eyes for lightening wizardry but i really could just use my finger or the actual beauty blender. They are soft lil squishies who work best damp.</li>
            <li> It was a lot smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> The receipt of the request Thanks</li>
            <li> This blender went above and beyond my expectations. I have purchased &amp;#34;dupes&amp;#34;, or wanna-be Beauty Blenders, in the last thinking they are &amp;#34;all the same&amp;#34;. Boy was I wrong! The BBs expand with water to almost twice the original size. The pointed tip ensures accuracy for tight spaces (i.e., corners of eyes), whereas the rounded party blends concealer flawlessly on the rest of face. I am extremely pleased with this product and will never buy another brand again. I&#x27;M HOOKED!</li>
            <li> Great for under the eyes, but I still prefer to just use the original size.</li>
            <li> The size you want for around the eyes</li>
            <li> Great product - same quality as the Original, but doesn&#x27;t really do anything the full size BB can&#x27;t do. I won&#x27;t buy these again as I just don&#x27;t see a need to have different sized sponges. With the Original BB&#x27;s pointed tip, you can get into all the small areas with ease.</li>
            <li> These worked wonderfully!</li>
            <li> These are awesome, but they are just to small for just about everything. I prefer the original Beauty Blender over the micro.</li>
            <li> I have used the larger ones for years but these are really great for getting along the nose line and under the eyes as well as along the hairline.  I will add these to daily makeup routine.  Although some might not think they are necessary, which the probably aren&#x27;t for most, I have found them to be a very handy product.</li>
            <li> These are awesome for concealer and eyeshadow primer.</li>
