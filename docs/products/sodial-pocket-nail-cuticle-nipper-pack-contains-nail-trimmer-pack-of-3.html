            <li>Reguardless of being a bit large they still are usable and I love having my own tools knowing they are sterile and reusable.</li>
            <li>Everything is wonderful although the cuticle nipper isn&#x27;t that sharp.</li>
            <li>Easy to reach the hangnail.</li>
            <li>They arrived fairly quickly and are a must have!</li>
            <li>but looks kinda cheap product.</li>
            <li>The price is right and the tools work!</li>
            <li>This is an upgrade to what I was using before, it really helps me clean  cuticle area  better and faster.</li>

            <li>Very exact nippers.</li>
            <li>Nippers are not super easy to squeeze, which is good</li>
            <li>The first set was so cheap and amazing that I couldn&#x27;t possible</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Thank you the package arrived on time and the price was just right.</li>
            <li>Mmmm... I pay cheap and the product is very very cheap, I prefer go to Walgreens and buy other ones for 8 dls</li>

            <li>Just make sure to be careful to not be to rough as they are quite serious and can scratch up your natural nail easily.</li>
            <li>its hard to find such good quality tools for such a low cost!</li>
            <li>This clipper is not sharp at all</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long I survived without these things...</li>
            <li> i got this because i was worried about using the one&#x27;s in the nail salon&#x27;s, and getting sick from them, So i got my own to take to the salon, and not have to worry about anything</li>
            <li> only thing i didnt like is that they were shipped loose in my package with other items, but who cares...?</li>
            <li> so you are less likely to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> Only wish the size was a little smaller for the cuticle pushback tooI because i have small nails.</li>
            <li> They are so inexpesive, but so sturdy and sharp.  </li>
            <li> Cuticle pushers are very sharp so be careful.  </li>
            <li> I typically have problems with trimmers over time, but this one seems to be made well.</li>
            <li> They are amazing quality and INSANELY well priced</li>
            <li> wow were we wrong.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and time.</li>
            <li> Clippers are small and efficient.</li>
            <li> I mean it does its job.</li>
            <li> ill buy</li>
            <li> and it is close to useless.  </li>
            <li> I hate to spend the money on a manicure</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.  </li>
