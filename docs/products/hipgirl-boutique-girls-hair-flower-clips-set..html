            <li>I get compliments all the time and my boys love seeing them in my hair.</li>
            <li>Perfect for 3rd grade girls Hawaiian themed birthday party.</li>
            <li>I just love these flowers in my hair.  </li>
            <li>So many girls in the house, we needed as many of these as we could get.</li>
            <li>Vibrant and great assortment of colors.</li>
            <li>but no one really notices because the colors are so good.</li>
            <li>The flower is glued to the clip part and they come off easy.</li>
            <li>these are great and with enough colors you match them to any outfit!  </li>
            <li>Colors are vivid and a nice assortment and also they clip easily into the hair and does not hurt taking them out.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s two flowers of each color, which makes coordinating my work uniforms and hair clips super easy.</li>
            <li>For the price these are adorable and have held together despite my daughter ripping them out of her hair as fast as I can put them in.  </li>
            <li>I have a 2 1/2 year old daughter and thought these would be nice to keep the hair out of her face</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve held up fine since then and are still pretty.</li>
            <li>Overall, very cute and stay well in her hair.</li>
            <li>They are pretty and I&#x27;ve given them away too!</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised that these are so sturdy yet elegant.</li>
            <li>Way prettier than I expected and good quality.</li>
            <li>but luckily they&#x27;re made with the hot glue</li>
            <li>These are just the right size - about the size of a 50 cent piece.  </li>
            <li>Super cute and can have multiple in your hair without looking over crowded.</li>
            <li>These are pretty, fun, and Well made I have had mine for 6 months</li>
            <li>I enjoy passing them out to little girls who notice my own flower in my hair.</li>
            <li>These are really pretty.  </li>
            <li>Pretty colors.</li>
            <li>They are just a bit smaller than most I&#x27;ve seen sold in hair salons, but they are much cheaper too.</li>
            <li>Sure, I could probably assemble them myself from craft supplies, but for less than $1 each, it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>I was so thrilled to receive these little beauties.</li>
            <li>These flower clips are perfect for up do, beach style, or to add a little flair to everyday outfits.</li>
            <li>I plan on shopping with this seller again very soon.</li>
            <li>Looks like real flower.</li>
            <li>They are made well, look real, and hold hair in place.</li>
            <li>The first time we used these, they were such a hit, we decided to order more clips for the next tour group.  </li>
            <li>These come in really vibrant colors and are attached to a clip.  </li>
            <li>These little hair clips are really cute and well made.  </li>
            <li>These are very soft barrettes in my hair from the metal being covered.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at the quality of these hair clips!</li>
            <li>Wow wow WOW!!</li>
            <li>Would have given 5 stars for quality, but my daughter has straight hair and they kinda stick out from her head, so probably would look better on thick wavy hair, but we still like them!</li>
            <li>Boy was I surprised.</li>
            <li>The material used is durable, soft, and flexible.</li>
            <li>The clips are soft and will not hurt your hair.</li>
            <li>I used it as prizes for my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s Birthday games.</li>
            <li>For the amount I paid they should have fixed the problem.</li>
            <li>Not only are they cute and cheaper that I would have spent in individual ones but they also stayed in place through- hiking, scuba diving, swimming.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to glue them back on a few times, but once I use my glue gun they seem to stick on better.</li>
            <li>However, the second batch of flowers looked different from the flowers we had leftover from the first batch.</li>
            <li>We used these in our high school musical South Pacific.</li>
            <li>Not really designed to hold much hair, but I didn&#x27;t expect them to do that.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a big deal, but uniformity in size and shape was expected since we ordered the exact same item.  </li>
            <li>These were literally a few dollars, so I expected them to be cheap.</li>

            <li> These were literally a few dollars, so I expected them to be cheap.</li>
            <li> They are fastened to a metal alligator clip 1.75 inches long and the clip is covered in a grosgrain ribbon that corresponds to the color on the edge of the petals.   </li>
            <li> They are all white with the characteristic yellow center, but some have a tint at the edges of the petals (either blue, green, purple, pink or mango).  </li>
            <li> They add that little tropical touch to my work uniform</li>
            <li> I bought a ton of these for party favors for a Hawaiian-themed birthday party (for a little girl who was really missing the islands).</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying (because my daughter sometimes leaves them in random places and sometimes gets lost).</li>
            <li> They come in a small sturdy rectangular box 5.5 x 4 x 3 inches.  </li>
            <li> Pointless now.</li>
            <li> Any time she runs around or plays hard, the flower comes off.</li>
            <li> Also, a couple of flowers had broken off from the clips.</li>
            <li> It came broken.</li>
            <li> None are broken or dirty.</li>
            <li> unfortunately I can&#x27;t!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> My 4-year-old daughter only wears these. She gets compliments all the time and people always ask me where I got them from. This is my second time buying (because my daughter sometimes leaves them in random places and sometimes gets lost). The prices doesn&#x27;t bother me and I will keep buying them.</li>
            <li> These are very soft barrettes in my hair from the metal being covered. They are pretty and I&#x27;ve given them away too!</li>
            <li> These are being used sort of as &amp;#34;favors&amp;#34; for tour group members by a travel agency in Hawaii. The first time we used these, they were such a hit, we decided to order more clips for the next tour group.  However, the second batch of flowers looked different from the flowers we had leftover from the first batch. It wasn&#x27;t a big deal, but uniformity in size and shape was expected since we ordered the exact same item.  Also, a couple of flowers had broken off from the clips.</li>
            <li> We used these in our high school musical South Pacific. We put them in the girls hair and they looked beautiful on stage.</li>
            <li> Super cute and can have multiple in your hair without looking over crowded. I like the added touch of adding ribbon to cover the alligator clip.</li>
            <li> These are really pretty.  I love them.  However 16 pieces is allot.  I would have been happy with four.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> my daughter loved them she is gonna wear them to he hula practices, good quality, great colors clips stay in</li>
            <li> Love they hair clips. I enjoy passing them out to little girls who notice my own flower in my hair. They&#x27;re the perfect size.</li>
            <li> Loved them. Great for our Luau Baby shower!</li>
            <li> These Hawaiian flower barrettes are just like the ones we saw in Hawaii only a ton cheaper.  My girls love them!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these flower clips, they are the perfect size and the colors are beautiful. I plan on shopping with this seller again very soon. I&#x27;m very pleased. Thank you</li>
            <li> These are just the right size - about the size of a 50 cent piece.  Colors are vivid and a nice assortment and also they clip easily into the hair and does not hurt taking them out.</li>
            <li> I love these hair clips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at the quality of these hair clips! Beautiful for kids and adults.</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time. These were literally a few dollars, so I expected them to be cheap. Boy was I surprised. The material used is durable, soft, and flexible. There are plenty of colors to chose from and the color will not come off. They are very securely fastened on there so I do not worry about it falling off. I am really pleased.</li>
            <li> These come in really vibrant colors and are attached to a clip.  They are made out of foam - but no one really notices because the colors are so good.</li>
            <li> these are great and with enough colors you match them to any outfit!  They are also easy to care for and washable!</li>
            <li> I bought these flowers for my daughter who is 2.5. They are very cute and come in a variety of colors which is nice. The flower is glued to the clip part and they come off easy. Any time she runs around or plays hard, the flower comes off. I&#x27;ve had to glue them back on a few times, but once I use my glue gun they seem to stick on better. Overall, very cute and stay well in her hair.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous,  great quality, great price! Will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> These little hair clips are really cute and well made.  They will look great in my daughters hair for her 12th Birthday Luau party!</li>
            <li> Love these!  Vibrant and great assortment of colors.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for the girls in my class to wear on the Hawaiian theme day.  They all loved them.  The flowered were constructed well and were not made of the flimsy silk material.  I was really pleased with these.</li>
            <li> good size, great quality, vey happy, I only will use a few but they are perfect for a my friends gift, I  am very happy I purchased them!!!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed by these hair clips. They came in small gift box and the flowers were beautiful and arrived in perfect shape. The finishing with the ribbon clip is a nice touch. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Looks like real flower. Excellent quality. The clips are soft and will not hurt your hair. I used it as prizes for my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s Birthday games.</li>
            <li> For the price these are adorable and have held together despite my daughter ripping them out of her hair as fast as I can put them in.  I have a 2 1/2 year old daughter and thought these would be nice to keep the hair out of her face but she refuses to wear anything in her hair.  I&#x27;ve worn them a couple time and they are the perfect size and look really cute for adults or kids (if yours are more cooperative than mine).</li>
            <li> Made really nice. Good quality. A hit at the Hawaiian theme bridal shower. Pretty colors. Stay in your hair well.</li>
            <li> These are well made , not cheep looking! Would have given 5 stars for quality, but my daughter has straight hair and they kinda stick out from her head, so probably would look better on thick wavy hair, but we still like them!</li>
            <li> Great quality - worked perfect as a little gift from Hawaii for my and my daughter&#x27;s girlfriends.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with these plumeria clips. They are just a bit smaller than most I&#x27;ve seen sold in hair salons, but they are much cheaper too. Great size for girl&#x27;s hair, and they were perfect as party favors for my daughter&#x27;s birthday.  Great quality. Sure, I could probably assemble them myself from craft supplies, but for less than $1 each, it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised that these are so sturdy yet elegant. Way prettier than I expected and good quality. The box they are in is even nice.</li>
            <li> These are perfect! Well made and really cute.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have these.  Nice colour choices, and they are durable.  Great price too.</li>
            <li> These flower clips are perfect for up do, beach style, or to add a little flair to everyday outfits. I absolutely love these clips! I get compliments all the time and my boys love seeing them in my hair. They are made well, look real, and hold hair in place.</li>
            <li> Great price for the quality/quantity. Perfect for 3rd grade girls Hawaiian themed birthday party. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> These are pretty, fun, and Well made I have had mine for 6 months and they are still in good shape</li>
            <li> I just love these flowers in my hair.  They are really beautiful and lifelike. The assortment of colors was wonderful.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with the packaging on these.  They come in a small sturdy rectangular box 5.5 x 4 x 3 inches.  Each Plumeria flower is 2.5 inches in diameter and there are a variety of colors.  They are all white with the characteristic yellow center, but some have a tint at the edges of the petals (either blue, green, purple, pink or mango).  They are fastened to a metal alligator clip 1.75 inches long and the clip is covered in a grosgrain ribbon that corresponds to the color on the edge of the petals.   Really nice quality!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got these! So many girls in the house, we needed as many of these as we could get. One of these broke when I put it on but luckily they&#x27;re made with the hot glue I can just fix it myself. But the quality of these pieces is great, I was very happy.</li>
            <li> Wow wow WOW!! I was so thrilled to receive these little beauties. The colors are so bright. None are broken or dirty. There&#x27;s two flowers of each color, which makes coordinating my work uniforms and hair clips super easy. They add that little tropical touch to my work uniform and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy. Even better, my coworkers love the flowers too!!</li>
            <li> I bought a ton of these for party favors for a Hawaiian-themed birthday party (for a little girl who was really missing the islands). They&#x27;ve held up fine since then and are still pretty. I like that the clip is covered in a coordinating ribbon - nice detail!</li>
            <li> Daughter loves the colors, and they work well as an accent in her hair.  Not really designed to hold much hair, but I didn&#x27;t expect them to do that.</li>
            <li> It came broken. They didn&#x27;t even bother to try to fix the problem. I needed them for an event and couldn&#x27;t even use them. Pointless now. For the amount I paid they should have fixed the problem. If I could give them no starts I would. unfortunately I can&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> These clips are good quality and nicely priced. I love them!</li>
            <li> These are so adorable!</li>
            <li> Ordered these for my hawaii trip and they were perfect. Not only are they cute and cheaper that I would have spent in individual ones but they also stayed in place through- hiking, scuba diving, swimming. Thumbs up</li>
