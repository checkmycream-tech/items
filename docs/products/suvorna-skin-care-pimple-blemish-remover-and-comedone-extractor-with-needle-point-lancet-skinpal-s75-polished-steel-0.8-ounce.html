            <li>Nice quality product.</li>
            <li>nice instrument to have, come in nice case</li>
            <li>Easy to use and fits in a travel bag in its own case.</li>
            <li>but it is just too bulky to for me to use it effectively and to aim accurately on my face because of its weight.</li>
            <li>This works much better than a needle</li>
            <li>I read many reviews before purchasing this pimple remover.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t mind spending more.  </li>
            <li>The right angle is good.  </li>
            <li>Lancet is great, it&#x27;s sharp and the angle is also very nice.</li>
            <li>Best used by folks other than me, that know what they are doing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The lancet feels fine and durable</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it&#x27;s a great design.</li>
            <li>In fact, I don&#x27;t even use the scoop end for this reason, but the lancet is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Works great and will last forever.</li>
            <li>Just a light touch of the lancet is all thats needed.  </li>
            <li>The lancet side is great, especially with the angled tip</li>
            <li>One of the two hoses received came apart right where the brass fitting connects to the hose</li>
            <li>This tool is so cool.</li>
            <li>It may work good if I have two at the same time.</li>
            <li>Then wash with a mild soap like safeguard or dial.</li>
            <li>i got this actually just for the lancet because i don&#x27;t like this kind of comedone extractor, i&#x27;d prefer the wire loop type.    </li>
            <li>The lancet is useful though.</li>
            <li>Needle is useful</li>
            <li>the lancet is perfect- tiny and sharp.</li>
            <li>Lancet is great for gently teasing open certain blocked up pores or comedones enough to extract them, but the little scoop thing on the end works better for a kind of acne</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as listed and very fast delivery</li>
            <li>Great product for those hard to reach areas like inside your ear -</li>
            <li>did exactly what it was supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>This does just about exactly what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>and it is easier to be exact with.</li>
            <li>I thought would be easy to perform on myself (with the aid of nice illuminated magnification) was hard for me.</li>
            <li>It can be pierced easily &amp; you can stab your fingers if you&#x27;re not careful while handling the instrument.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to work with and definitely takes the problem right away</li>
            <li>came with a nice case I can keep other tools in.</li>
            <li>comedone extractor is very abrasive and removes more skin than necessary.</li>
            <li>It was delivered very quickly, and I would use this seller and this brand of tool again in the future.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;d be nice if it&#x27;s a little lighter.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t leave it out just anywhere or kids can really get hurt.</li>
            <li>Works better than I&#x27;d expected.</li>
            <li>This has been a very helpful tool.  </li>
            <li>quick delivery but not sure if it works as good as i expected.</li>
            <li>round, main part though doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to put pressure correctly around a blackhead or pimple.</li>
            <li>The needle part is sharp but the other end does not work as good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very sharp and finely made.</li>
            <li>laugh at the intelligence of doing minor surgery on myself.</li>
            <li>Comes in a nice little pink leather sleeve for storing.</li>
            <li>So far it hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of the Milia but at least I&#x27;m able &amp;#34;to poke&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t afford to see a professional, this is plan</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to see how fancy looking this was when it arrived.  </li>
            <li>Be careful... sharp and easy to damage face if not experianced</li>
            <li>it also comes with a little holder that is pretty classy.</li>
            <li>Worked okay for the bigger white heads, the smaller ones needed more painful pressing and some scraping.</li>
            <li>Overall, for the price, it is considerably well made.</li>
            <li>but it is very pointy and sharp</li>

            <li> but it is very pointy and sharp</li>
            <li> The lancet is very sharp, but the hole on the other end isn&#x27;t large enough.  </li>
            <li> This only really works on very small white heads.  </li>
            <li> it has a right angle bend intended for easier use, but it makes using the lancet harder because it&#x27;s hard to angle my hand to aim the lanset at my blackheads.    </li>
            <li> I am old but have a few blemishes that still seem to come up.  </li>
            <li> Blot dry, never rub.</li>
            <li> Works well and minimizes redness due to flat surface.  </li>
            <li> and we have only had it for less than two months.</li>
            <li> Never ever squeeze a white or black head or pimple.</li>
            <li> so be careful.</li>
            <li> there are few reviews that says the hole on the ends isn&#x27;t very big but for me</li>
            <li> The Comedone Extractor side is harder to work with, but lancet helps out a lot.  </li>
            <li> the center and hopefully in time my skin will release the Milia.  </li>
            <li> The center hole is small but the part is so big</li>
            <li> I get stabbed when using the other end..</li>
            <li> The lance is the bomb.&lt;br /&gt;The other side is practically worthless.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The other end works too, but that&#x27;s not a use</li>
            <li> The pointy end is quite sharp and has stayed sharp.&lt;br</li>
            <li> : My only criticism would be the ineffective rubber tip safety cap that is uselessly small.</li>
            <li> and it is very sharp.  </li>
            <li> It has a very sharp end that seems to do the job well.</li>
            <li> The tip end is very sharp &amp; does its job well so exercise caution when using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> do wish that the lance was shorter because once it pierces your skin, if you&#x27;re not being really careful it can poke through your cheek or past the zit itself...</li>
            <li> However, the remover end is harder to use; the hole is a bit on the small side.</li>
            <li> I have often (I don&#x27;t patrol and look for or find blemishes that small--it&#x27;s meant for small ones).  </li>
            <li> The hole is probably too small.</li>
            <li> it is way to thick and makes it a little hard to use.    </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to use.</li>
            <li> He has to push too hard and it hurts.</li>
            <li> THIS THING JUST SUCKS</li>
            <li> But the extractor is a little weird.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my son says this one is not as well made as the doctor&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> the extractor is weird, so I just bought another one.</li>
            <li> Disappointing!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice quality product.</li>
            <li> did exactly what it was supposed to do.  stubborn blackhead picker.  I am old but have a few blemishes that still seem to come up.  This works.</li>
            <li> Does the job but it is very pointy and sharp so be careful. Can&#x27;t leave it out just anywhere or kids can really get hurt.Store with safety in mind.</li>
            <li> i got this actually just for the lancet because i don&#x27;t like this kind of comedone extractor, i&#x27;d prefer the wire loop type.    for the lancet, it&#x27;s great. it&#x27;s very sharp and finely made. it has a right angle bend intended for easier use, but it makes using the lancet harder because it&#x27;s hard to angle my hand to aim the lanset at my blackheads.    i also tried to use the remover just to try it out. it is way to thick and makes it a little hard to use.    overall, the product is well made in terms of materials. it also comes with a little holder that is pretty classy. its holding part has good traction to hold too. but it is just too bulky to for me to use it effectively and to aim accurately on my face because of its weight. it&#x27;d be nice if it&#x27;s a little lighter.</li>
            <li> Lancet is great, it&#x27;s sharp and the angle is also very nice. Material seems good. One of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.   But the extractor is a little weird. The center hole is small but the part is so big so it&#x27;s hard to use. So I give 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I get stabbed when using the other end..</li>
            <li> This tool is so cool. I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it&#x27;s a great design. Worked wonderfully. Took care of my pimple w/ minimum trauma to the skin. Love the design and very good quality. Comes in a nice little pink leather sleeve for storing.</li>
            <li> One of the two hoses received came apart right where the brass fitting connects to the hose and we have only had it for less than two months. Disappointing!!</li>
            <li> The lancet is very sharp, but the hole on the other end isn&#x27;t large enough.  In fact, I don&#x27;t even use the scoop end for this reason, but the lancet is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This item does what the description says it will ... there are few reviews that says the hole on the ends isn&#x27;t very big but for me - I think it&#x27;s just the perfect size. At the end of the day - it just depends on the person using it. Overall, for the price, it is considerably well made.</li>
            <li> Not quite what I wanted but did the job.</li>
            <li> Great product for those hard to reach areas like inside your ear - but you have to have someone do it for you</li>
            <li> They are great tools for executing pimples.  It is easy to work with and definitely takes the problem right away</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t afford to see a professional, this is plan B.&lt;br /&gt;What I thought would be easy to perform on myself (with the aid of nice illuminated magnification) was hard for me. Great tools. Best used by folks other than me, that know what they are doing.&lt;br /&gt;I laugh at the intelligence of doing minor surgery on myself.</li>
            <li> The lance is the bomb.&lt;br /&gt;The other side is practically worthless.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish that the lance was shorter because once it pierces your skin, if you&#x27;re not being really careful it can poke through your cheek or past the zit itself...</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see how fancy looking this was when it arrived.  It&#x27;s a tool, and tools have to be used correctly--for me, the pointy end is the tool I wanted and it is very sharp.  It works well for its purpose.  The other end works too, but that&#x27;s not a use I have often (I don&#x27;t patrol and look for or find blemishes that small--it&#x27;s meant for small ones).  So for me, the pointy end is well done and this was a great purchase.  It was delivered very quickly, and I would use this seller and this brand of tool again in the future.</li>
            <li> Went to the dermatologist and while I was there I asked about having a couple of white spots removed from my face.  They wanted one hundred dollars for each spot.  While I was getting dressed the lady that was helping me told me that I could just go on Amazon and get the same tool that the doctor uses.  So I did and the spots are gone and it just cost me about $12.00.</li>
            <li> Worked okay for the bigger white heads, the smaller ones needed more painful pressing and some scraping. Will probably buy a different version.</li>
            <li> This does just about exactly what it is supposed to do.  The Comedone Extractor side is harder to work with, but lancet helps out a lot.  Expecially since it is needle size so it doesn&#x27;t make a big piercing and it is easier to be exact with.</li>
            <li> nice instrument to have, come in nice case</li>
            <li> Quality tool! I&#x27;d never used anything like this, so I ordered this one as well as one of the loop style ones. Works great and will last forever.</li>
            <li> The right angle is good.  It is good for whiteheads and I do not see the purpose of using it for blackheads. Never ever squeeze a white or black head or pimple. Just a light touch of the lancet is all thats needed.  If it does not all come out give it time like a day. Use alcohol and cotton balls to disinfect your face, yes it stings but only for a moment. Then wash with a mild soap like safeguard or dial. Blot dry, never rub. Not for children to use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to get rid of Milia on my forehead.  So far it hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of the Milia but at least I&#x27;m able &amp;#34;to poke&amp;#34; the center and hopefully in time my skin will release the Milia.  This works much better than a needle</li>
            <li> I used this on several larger pimples and it worked like a charm. I also have used the side of the end with the hole to rub the tops of black/white heads to open them up. Works better than I&#x27;d expected.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as listed and very fast delivery</li>
            <li> This has been a very helpful tool.  It has a very sharp end that seems to do the job well.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews before purchasing this pimple remover. The lancet side is great, especially with the angled tip so you can get close to a mirror and see the pimple clearly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comedone extractor is very abrasive and removes more skin than necessary. The entire surface is too abrasive.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I saw all those Youtube videos about blackheads and stuff. The pointy end is quite sharp and has stayed sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The round, main part though doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to put pressure correctly around a blackhead or pimple. The hole is probably too small.</li>
            <li> Lancet is great for gently teasing open certain blocked up pores or comedones enough to extract them, but the little scoop thing on the end works better for a kind of acne I tend not to get.  (I&#x27;ve seen it work well on Youtube though.)  Once things are loosened up, I use Suvorna&#x27;s Ador Whitehead / Acne Remover &amp; Comedone Extractor.</li>
            <li> Be careful... sharp and easy to damage face if not experianced</li>
            <li> This only really works on very small white heads.  If you are looking to extract blackheads, find another product. It is ineffective on clogged pores.</li>
            <li> Works well and minimizes redness due to flat surface.  Easy to use and fits in a travel bag in its own case.</li>
            <li> The lancet feels fine and durable</li>
            <li> We were hoping to get one like they use at the dermatologist.  Looked thru all the reviews.  Didn&#x27;t mind spending more.  Unfortunately, my son says this one is not as well made as the doctor&#x27;s.  He has to push too hard and it hurts. The lancet is useful though.</li>
            <li> THIS THING JUST SUCKS</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  However, the remover end is harder to use; the hole is a bit on the small side.</li>
            <li> Pros:  Well made, durable &amp; sturdy. The tip end is very sharp &amp; does its job well so exercise caution when using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: My only criticism would be the ineffective rubber tip safety cap that is uselessly small. It can be pierced easily &amp; you can stab your fingers if you&#x27;re not careful while handling the instrument.  These instruments should definitely be kept away from children at all costs for obvious safety reasons.</li>
            <li> comodone part is garbage. Needle is useful</li>
            <li> the lancet is perfect- tiny and sharp. the extractor is weird, so I just bought another one. came with a nice case I can keep other tools in. I&#x27;d get again just for the lancet</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Great Seller!</li>
            <li> quick delivery but not sure if it works as good as i expected. The needle part is sharp but the other end does not work as good. It may work good if I have two at the same time.</li>
