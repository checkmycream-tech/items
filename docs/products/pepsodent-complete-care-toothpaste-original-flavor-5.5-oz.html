    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t disappoint and has, imo, the best flavor of any toothpaste out there.</li>
            <li>wonderfully check ups at my dentist</li>
            <li>This is one of the best toothpastes out there</li>
            <li>Pepsodent is the best toothpaste for the price.</li>
            <li>I have always LOVED my Pepsodent toothpaste!</li>
            <li>the cost is a great factor to my husband and I.</li>
            <li>A great product at a great price--how often does that happen these days?</li>
            <li>I fly thru toothpastes like every week</li>
            <li>Pepsodent has a great lather (is that what it is called?</li>
            <li>a nice bonus!</li>
            <li>Pepsodent has a delicious, mild taste that rinses from your mouth after brushing, protects your teeth, and is just a great product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good to see I&#x27;m not alone.    </li>
            <li>Very lovely taste.</li>
            <li>You will have to try this toothpaste, it really is the best in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It does clean teeth well and tastes great</li>
            <li>Most toothpastes burn my mouth.</li>
            <li>More than that, they feel polished.</li>
            <li>In fact, it&#x27;s more what I would call a tooth</li>
            <li>Most toothpastes end up running out the corners of my mouth, but Pepsodent stays where it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s generally available for around a dollar a tube, and made in the USA!</li>
            <li>, of toothpastes I like better, well gotta put it in second place although very good!</li>
            <li>I have tried many $1 store type pastes, and you get a 6oz.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean after using this.</li>
            <li>A good deal is a good deal especially when it works.</li>
            <li>The three stars isn&#x27;t because the product wasn&#x27;t amazing, because it most certainly was.</li>
            <li>Tried and true, this one has been around for a lot of years!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m a huge Colgate fan here.</li>
            <li>I love the taste and it is effective at keeping my teeth white and cavity-free.</li>
            <li>The original Pepsodent toothpaste, for whatever reason, is more gentle and doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li>The texture is not thick and goopy like most toothpastes.</li>
            <li>As a chef, it&#x27;s critical for him that he be able to accurately taste ingredients and dishes.</li>
            <li>but WELL worth the effort.</li>
            <li>Cleans well and leave my breath fresh longer than the others.</li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s fresh without making you feel like you just chewed your way through a crate of Life Savers.</li>
            <li>So if you like a good bargain, I say choose this over other value brands.</li>
            <li>Grandma got it right</li>
            <li>Its amazing, in just a few days my teeth start feeling clean again.</li>
            <li>It has the best flavor of all the toothpastes out there and if you&#x27;ve never tried it before or merely don&#x27;t like pastes and prefer gels, etc...prepare to switch brands...</li>
            <li>AND last of all, it has such a reasonable price for being such a great product!</li>
            <li>Taste nice and teeth always feel cleaner then other pastes.</li>
            <li>It has fluoride, it rinses clean and as far as whitening, I&#x27;m a smoker</li>
            <li>This texture works really well if you have a power toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Personally I perfer Pepsodent&#x27;s flavor - the other tooth pastes are much to minty for my likes but to each his own.  </li>
            <li>I ordered Pepsodent recently as it was my favorite toothpaste as a teen.  </li>
            <li>the abrasiveness is bit too high for me, thus the four stars instead of five.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Before switching I used mostly Tom&#x27;s and other Natural pastes.</li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s slightly cheaper and you get a free toothbrush or something...</li>
            <li>The cool, minty flavor gives my entire mouth such a clean tasteâ€¦I KNOW I am getting my teeth clean because I brush the recommended 2 minutes at the very least.</li>
            <li>After using the pepsodent again the sensitive tooth is now \\&quot;dormant\\&quot; and my teeth seem whiter.</li>
            <li>after a few weeks, my teeth always feel sort-of fuzzy, like I&#x27;ve eaten a ton of sugar and candy and no amount of brushing will get them clean.    </li>
            <li>Pepsodent doesn&#x27;t have quite as much density or after flavor longevity as long as Colgate Total.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered the pepsodent from Amazon.com, it took only 2 days to receive the product but with the sensitive tooth it seemed like a week.</li>
            <li>About the third day one of my sensitive upper teeth started to throb when I would drink ice water.</li>
            <li>The price of this tooth paste is always lower then the newer ones on the market and living on Social Security</li>
            <li>Every once in a while, my wife will pick up a different brand with the words Total, Complete, Whitening, etc.</li>
            <li>And I was surprised to one day experience bleeding gums though I flossed and brushed daily.</li>
            <li>It was because you can go to Dollar General and pick it up for only a buck!</li>
            <li>I first started using pepsodent in the 1960&#x27;s and can still hear the commercial jingle with the little guy in the canoe and drums in the background.  </li>
            <li>I read a review that said the main complaint of the reviewer was that it wasn&#x27;t a high tech toothpaste and didn&#x27;t have tartar</li>

            <li> /&gt;It is a tad watery, and it does mess with my gums a little, but if you only have a few bucks this toothpaste is a lifesaver.</li>

            <li> This was affordable and had the predictable wintergreen flavor.</li>
            <li> For those having trouble finding it, try Dollar Tree stores!</li>

            <li> Pepsodent is hard to find these days</li>
            <li> I usually see it there and it, like everything else there, costs a dollar!</li>

            <li> Most toothpastes burn my mouth. The original Pepsodent toothpaste, for whatever reason, is more gentle and doesn&#x27;t burn. I hope they keep making it!</li>
            <li> Pepsodent has been my toothpaste for over 40 years. Not only does it clean but it also relieves any tooth nerve pain associated with cold drinks or food. Actually we had a problem with availability in our area so I had to use Colgate. About the third day one of my sensitive upper teeth started to throb when I would drink ice water. I ordered the pepsodent from Amazon.com, it took only 2 days to receive the product but with the sensitive tooth it seemed like a week. After using the pepsodent again the sensitive tooth is now \\&quot;dormant\\&quot; and my teeth seem whiter. You will have to try this toothpaste, it really is the best in my opinion. Also if it&#x27;s only money that concerns you, Pepsodent usually sells for around ONE DOLLAR, I would pay three times that just for the relief from the sensitive tooth ache.</li>
            <li> I ordered Pepsodent recently as it was my favorite toothpaste as a teen.  It didn&#x27;t disappoint and has, imo, the best flavor of any toothpaste out there.</li>
            <li> Pepsodent is hard to find these days but WELL worth the effort. It has the best flavor of all the toothpastes out there and if you&#x27;ve never tried it before or merely don&#x27;t like pastes and prefer gels, etc...prepare to switch brands...oh- and get ready to pay a lot less than you are now for all the other pastes and gels out there...a nice bonus! And for us oldsters: YOU&#x27;LL WONDER WHERE THE YELLOW WENT WHEN YOU BRUSH YOUR TEETH WITH PEPSODENT!...look that one up on video from the 50s. PS- Buy it!</li>
            <li> I first started using pepsodent in the 1960&#x27;s and can still hear the commercial jingle with the little guy in the canoe and drums in the background.  Cleans well and leave my breath fresh longer than the others.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t seem to find this locally anymore. I love the taste and it is effective at keeping my teeth white and cavity-free.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand of tooth paste since the 1960&#x27;s and I get wonderfully check ups at my dentist 2 times a year with my annual check ups.  Personally I perfer Pepsodent&#x27;s flavor - the other tooth pastes are much to minty for my likes but to each his own.  The price of this tooth paste is always lower then the newer ones on the market and living on Social Security the cost is a great factor to my husband and I.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean after using this. More than that, they feel polished. Very lovely taste. Will continue to buy and use this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about the only person I know that has zero cavities at age 44 and I think it has a lot to do with this toothpaste. This is one of the best toothpastes out there and it&#x27;s good to see I&#x27;m not alone.    Every once in a while, my wife will pick up a different brand with the words Total, Complete, Whitening, etc. because it&#x27;s slightly cheaper and you get a free toothbrush or something... after a few weeks, my teeth always feel sort-of fuzzy, like I&#x27;ve eaten a ton of sugar and candy and no amount of brushing will get them clean.    Quietly, I&#x27;ll slip all the other brands in the trash and replace them Pepsodent. Its amazing, in just a few days my teeth start feeling clean again. We don&#x27;t have city water, so I also rinse with Act II Restoring mouthwash for the flouride.</li>
            <li> I like Pepsodent. I like the taste--it&#x27;s fresh without making you feel like you just chewed your way through a crate of Life Savers. The texture is not thick and goopy like most toothpastes. In fact, it&#x27;s more what I would call a tooth *polish* than a tooth paste. This texture works really well if you have a power toothbrush. Most toothpastes end up running out the corners of my mouth, but Pepsodent stays where it&#x27;s supposed to. It has fluoride, it rinses clean and as far as whitening, I&#x27;m a smoker and I get compliments on how white my teeth are. Plus it&#x27;s generally available for around a dollar a tube, and made in the USA! There&#x27;s every reason you could think of for buying it. A great product at a great price--how often does that happen these days?</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste that we have ever found (my partner... now husband... hooray for equality!) that doesn&#x27;t damage your tongue&#x27;s taste buds over time. As a chef, it&#x27;s critical for him that he be able to accurately taste ingredients and dishes. Virtually every toothpaste seems to gradually desensitize your ability to distinguish flavours with the sharpness and accuracy that he needs. Pepsodent has a delicious, mild taste that rinses from your mouth after brushing, protects your teeth, and is just a great product. Grandma got it right: brush with Pepsodent!</li>
            <li> Tried and true, this one has been around for a lot of years! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I only give 5 stars if I am just crazy about something. Being as there are a couple,( just a couple mind you!), of toothpastes I like better, well gotta put it in second place although very good! For those having trouble finding it, try Dollar Tree stores! I usually see it there and it, like everything else there, costs a dollar!</li>
            <li> Only toothpaste I brush with. Taste nice and teeth always feel cleaner then other pastes.</li>
            <li> This was affordable and had the predictable wintergreen flavor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pepsodent for 2 years. Before switching I used mostly Tom&#x27;s and other Natural pastes. And I was surprised to one day experience bleeding gums though I flossed and brushed daily. Truth is I thought, that&#x27;s my lot because it wasn&#x27;t going away even with these other brands. I bought Pepsodent one day when my funds were beyond low and I thought $.99! What a sale! I didn&#x27;t know this was the usual price. So time goes by and I&#x27;m hooked- I like this toothpaste! Flavor and price! Then one day a light-bulb moment realized - NO MORE BLEEDING GUMS! How can that be? Who cares? You don&#x27;t need to shell out the bucks for a quality Toothpaste. A good deal is a good deal especially when it works. I am forever grateful!</li>
            <li> I use Pepsodent on occasion, as I did when I was kid.  It does clean teeth well and tastes great but....the abrasiveness is bit too high for me, thus the four stars instead of five.  I read a review that said the main complaint of the reviewer was that it wasn&#x27;t a high tech toothpaste and didn&#x27;t have tartar control.&lt;br /&gt;According to my dentist, tartar control is at the handle end of your toothbrush...not in a tube.</li>
            <li> Pepsodent is the best toothpaste for the price. I have tried many $1 store type pastes, and you get a 6oz. toothpaste with Pepsodent that actually isn&#x27;t horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a tad watery, and it does mess with my gums a little, but if you only have a few bucks this toothpaste is a lifesaver. I fly thru toothpastes like every week, I&#x27;m a huge Colgate fan here. Pepsodent doesn&#x27;t have quite as much density or after flavor longevity as long as Colgate Total.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pepsodent can be found at Dollar Tree, Dollar General, Kroger, just to name a few. And, Amazon of course. So if you like a good bargain, I say choose this over other value brands.</li>
            <li> I have always LOVED my Pepsodent toothpaste! The cool, minty flavor gives my entire mouth such a clean tasteâ€¦I KNOW I am getting my teeth clean because I brush the recommended 2 minutes at the very least. Pepsodent has a great lather (is that what it is called? All I know is that I get lots of bubbles that can work their way through the teeth). AND last of all, it has such a reasonable price for being such a great product! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like the taste but it is runny.</li>
            <li> The three stars isn&#x27;t because the product wasn&#x27;t amazing, because it most certainly was.It was because you can go to Dollar General and pick it up for only a buck! So don&#x27;t make the same mistake as I did, and go to DG to buy it.</li>
