            <li> I like all of the Sung perfumes so far.</li>
            <li> It goes on a bit heavy, but dries down quickly for a soft fragrance that lasts for hours.  </li>
            <li> I have actually put some on, worked out in the yard all day long</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it has been sitting on the shelf a long time or what.  </li>
            <li> It lasts long and fills any room you walk into.</li>
            <li> i will definitely look at other perfumes</li>
            <li> It lasts all day long with just one spritz, unlike other perfumes.  </li>
            <li> Not many perfumes stay on long, but this one does for me!</li>
            <li> Use a little, lasts, well, forever.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> It has a somewhat floral scent that&#x27;s not too heavy, and it lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not satisfied with this bottle.</li>
            <li> I have had my share of expensive perfumes but non compares to this low cost perfume.</li>
            <li> Hard o find</li>
            <li> When it was finished I had a hard time finding it</li>
            <li> This is a perfume that is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> But this last bottle purchased is a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> At least 3 times a week I have people asking me what perfume I&#x27;m wearing and where can they buy it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been wearing it a lot lately.</li>
            <li> at least I have been told that over and over.  </li>
            <li> Only thing bad was that it took FOREVER ( like the name)</li>
            <li> Of course, I wish I could give negative stars!</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance before and never get tired of it.</li>
            <li> THIS is even atrocious as a room spray, which is usually where the &amp;#34;klunker&amp;#34; perfumes end up.</li>
            <li> Impossible to get off of you!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when it disappeared from store shelves.</li>
            <li> Just absolutely HORRIBLE scent!</li>

            <li> I love this perfume! I have ordered it many times, this time it was a gift!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.  I received it quickly and I love the price.  I will order again.  But I won&#x27;t pay over $25 for it, because that&#x27;s the price I pay on FragranceNet.com.</li>
            <li> Same packaging and scent as product purchased from perfume retailers- but at a nicer price! Shipping was quick. I will reorder from Amazon.  As for the perfume, I have used Sung&#x27;s Forever, well, for forever, 20 years, it always brings many compliments. Doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies nor migraines. Clean, fresh scent. Use a little, lasts, well, forever. I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it!  It is my signature fragrance!  Always get compliments for &amp;#34;smelling good&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have on numerous occasions purchased Alfred Sung Forever.  It is one of my favorite perfumes.  But this last bottle purchased is a disappointment.  The perfume does not smell.  I don&#x27;t know if it has been sitting on the shelf a long time or what.  But I&#x27;m not satisfied with this bottle.</li>
            <li> I buy this perfume on a regular basis.  I&#x27;ve been getting compliments on it for years (from both men &amp; women).  It&#x27;s a very fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this perfume for years and still get compliments.  I&#x27;ve never tired of it.  I wear it both day and night.</li>
            <li> The smell is ok, doesn&#x27;t last all day. I&#x27;ll stick to SHI my fav.</li>
            <li> The only perfume I use. Hard o find so glad you carry it</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for over 20 years, Amazon has the best price.  I recommend this scent to any woman...it&#x27;s lightly floral without being overwhelming.  At least 3 times a week I have people asking me what perfume I&#x27;m wearing and where can they buy it.  It lasts all day long with just one spritz, unlike other perfumes.  I have actually put some on, worked out in the yard all day long and it still smells as fresh as when first applied.</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume for many years.  It is a light fresh scent that lasts longer than you expect.  You may not notice it but others around you will notice as you walk by, when they hug you, etc.  I can&#x27;t wear many perfumes because they make me sneeze but this one never bothers me.  I work in a hospital where we are not supposed to wear scents but I have and have never had a patient complain.  Most compliment on the scent as I&#x27;m moving around them and want to know the name.  It smells good, makes me feel good and other people enjoy it too.  With the awesome price you can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff. Alfred Sung and Amazon are always the go to place when I am stumped for a gift.</li>

            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances. I was very disappointed when it disappeared from store shelves. So I was very happy to find it available on Amazon. It&#x27;s a very pretty fragrance. Not too heavy. It wears very well throughout the day without disappearing or fading.</li>
            <li> I like the floral scents and this is a great smell, which is not too strong but not too light. It can be worn during the day and I&#x27;ve been wearing it a lot lately. Good smell for a great price.</li>
            <li> I have too say that this a very sexy and clean parfum,it is what I was hoping for Alfred Sung has been great with Fragrance for a very long time,I can&#x27;t wait too hear \\&quot;What is that you have on?\\&quot; (LOL) Also recieved it as was promised.</li>

            <li> I have used this fragrance before and never get tired of it. Amazon had an excellent price for it and I am pleased that I could get it from them. It&#x27;s a light fragrance which can be worn anytime!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume and will be purchasing again because I can&#x27;t find it anway here in sarnia.my sister inlaw also loves it so I will be letting her know where to get it</li>
            <li> The scent is beautiful and lasts all day.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.  I like oriental/floral scents.  I would recommend to 30 plus group.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, slightly spicy floral fragrance.  It goes on a bit heavy, but dries down quickly for a soft fragrance that lasts for hours.  It&#x27;s 4.2 oz., instead of the usual 3.4 oz., and the price is great.</li>
            <li> This is a light, feminine and fresh fragrance. I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase and forever an aficionado of Alfred Sung perfumes. The order arrived on time and perfectly packaged, Thankyou!.</li>
            <li> My mother loves this perfume and she cannot find it anywhere in stores,  I found it online for cheap, i couldn&#x27;t pass it up.  She was excited to receive it!! Big thumbs up, smells awesome!</li>
            <li> Inexpensive but very good fragrance.</li>
            <li> AS ALWAYS  ALFRED SUNG FOREVER IS MY. GO T O FRAGRANCE  OF CHOICE FRESH CRISP AND CLeann</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product and it has a very reasonable price.  My only concern is: will it still be available the next time a need to place an order?</li>
            <li> This perfume is my signature scent :)</li>
            <li> This is my second fragrance purchase from this designer, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! This smells absolutely wonderful! It has a somewhat floral scent that&#x27;s not too heavy, and it lasts throughout the day. I&#x27;ve received several compliments.</li>
            <li> Cannot make up my mind between Pure or forever. What can I  say Alfred Sung has done it again. I am definitely  purchasing more of his perfumes in the near future. Wonderful price as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 20 years! 1 of my favorite perfumes! It&#x27;s a Great Price, as well as a Great Smell! You can use it Either way, for the Day or the night! Not many perfumes stay on long, but this one does for me!</li>
            <li> Everytime I wear this spray EVERYONE ask whats the name, where do I get it. I&#x27;m in love with this spray, it smells so good. Only thing bad was that it took FOREVER ( like the name) lol to come in the mail.</li>
            <li> I have tried other Alfred Sung perfume for women&#x27;s, but this is not my favorite, its too strong and smells different after while.</li>
            <li> Excellent 100% Recommended</li>
            <li> I first owned and used this perfume back in 1999 on my way to college. I got so many compliments whenever I wore it. I purchased it in store then. When it was finished I had a hard time finding it but mugh to my surprise my sister located it online and I was excited to find that Amazon carries it. I have had my share of expensive perfumes but non compares to this low cost perfume. It lasts long and fills any room you walk into. It has a soft, fresh, youthful, flower scent. Well worth the buy.</li>
            <li> My wife will not wear another Parfum.  I have been trying to find the body lotion but no luck....someone please help????</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and stays in the air long after you&#x27;ve walked away...</li>

            <li> Forever by Alfred Sung for Women. I would buy from seller again.  I bought this as a gift, the person I purchased it for loved the scent when I wore it. The item was received in a timely manner and the description was very accurate..</li>
            <li> ordering was a breeze, but the best part was the price...CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP and FREE shipping.  package arrived  on time</li>

            <li> I love Alfred Sung&#x27;s line. All of the perfumes or cologne&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried smell amazing. i will definitely look at other perfumes</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, as a gift for a Registered Nurse who was caring for my wife. Bravo!</li>
            <li> My Mom&#x27;s favorite perfume! She loves this perfume!</li>
            <li> I like all of the Sung perfumes so far.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume! I get compliments each time I wear Alfred Sungs Forever. It smells light and flowery without causing a headache! This is my 3rd bottle. I highly suggest this perfume.</li>
            <li> I love this parfum and used it since 10 years ago, but unfortunately in my country this parfum has been discontinued, so i was searching on AMAZON.com and i saw it there, i ordered it and when i received it, i was so happy. I used it, and it stays on my body the whole day, so i cannot complain about anything, I just need to say THANK YOU amazon for having it on your site.</li>
            <li> Some perfumes are just right for an individual--Sung&#x27;s Forever is &amp;#34;my&amp;#34; scent--at least I have been told that over and over.  Since none of the local stores carry it anymore I was happy to find it on Amazon--and received excellent service.</li>
            <li> The best scent ever!! I love it..stays on all day.. i get a lot of compliments  whenever I wear this.</li>
            <li> I am always told how good I smell, at the grocery store, the gas station, everywhere.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for many years and I&#x27;m still amazed how it makes others initiate a complement.</li>
            <li> This was such a fabulous deal, I love this fragrance and have not been able to locate it any longer at my local dept stores. I&#x27;m tempted to order another one, plus you really get a large size at such a great price! Every time I wear this perfume, it never fails, someone always asks me what am I wearing?</li>
            <li> Just absolutely HORRIBLE scent! VERY cloying and &amp;#34;Old Lady&amp;#34;!!! The person who was wearing it must have been mistaken because she smelled of FENDI or KRIZIA, classic, not run of the mill, which I love. THIS is even atrocious as a room spray, which is usually where the &amp;#34;klunker&amp;#34; perfumes end up. VERY STRONG! Impossible to get off of you! Allergic! Trés grandmere!!! Gross! And I adore perfume! Of course, I wish I could give negative stars!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells too sweet but it&#x27;s just my preference but the Shi smells fresh n nice......a more mature scent</li>
