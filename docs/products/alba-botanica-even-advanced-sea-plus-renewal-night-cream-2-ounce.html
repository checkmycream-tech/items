            <li>I am dealing with this face cream because I don&#x27;t like wasting something perfectly great.</li>
            <li>It smells great, but I understand how some would consider the scent &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li>and I loved the idea of sea stuff in it.  </li>
            <li>Product is a superior cream I have been using for years.</li>
            <li>This is truly a good buy and equivalent to those over $100 creams....</li>
            <li>I put it on before my foundation and it acts as a line filler surprisingly.  </li>
            <li>but it is no longer what I loved.  </li>
            <li>Keep up the good work, Alba.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call it a good dupe for La Mer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d call it a good dupe for Mary Kay...</li>
            <li>It moisturizes, evens out my skin tone, clears my zits and makes my skin look GOOD.</li>
            <li>Feels great and has a nice fragrance.</li>

            <li>and this works amazing on acne scars.</li>
            <li>THIS CREAM IS AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>I never say cream is amazing, trust me</li>
            <li>This stuff is kind of amazing.</li>
            <li>a nice quality face cream without the chemicals that&#x27;s an affordable price.  </li>
            <li>Oh and it smells SO nice</li>
            <li>Otherwise it is a nice nightime lotion.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best skin moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I really liked the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li>The Alba Sea Plus Renewal Cream does smell nice and is supposed to be hypoallergenic however 80% of the time I used this cream I suffered from a fragrance-related asthma allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>It smells kind of like men&#x27;s deodorant.</li>
            <li>The cream feels really nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have liked all of the Alba products that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>and my wife liked it.</li>
            <li>So nice.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly see a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice too.</li>
            <li>The smell is very pleasant in my opinion, and I can understand why people who really need the moisture rave about this</li>
            <li>The smell is light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Also, this product came in good packaging and very quickly.</li>
            <li>To be fair, the Jasmin cream has a strong scent too.</li>
            <li>the scent is very strong to me.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very strong.</li>
            <li>Glad I was able to return it!</li>
            <li>love it, love it!  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product - so rich nourishing to my skin!!!  </li>
            <li>It goes on so nicely and doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance like most products, which tends to bother my skin.  </li>
            <li>This cream is the best I haves used so far.</li>
            <li>and I was raving about it to all my friends about how soft my skin felt and how awesome it smells.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried alba products before but so far I&#x27;m really impressed.</li>
            <li>I liked this better when it was a cream, not a butter.</li>
            <li>I use the day cream too - love love love!</li>
            <li>I realized it&#x27;s really effects when people start telling how beautiful my skin was and wanting to know what I had done.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This cream does not irritate or clog my skin that seems to love to break out with no warning or reason.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my skin feel and it doesnt break me out.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure-</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this cream -</li>
            <li>I use the scrub and have enjoyed that.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I did JUST get this TODAY</li>
            <li>It does not moisturize as well, but it does not irritate my skin, so I&#x27;ll use it until I find something I like better.      </li>
            <li>I have been using Alba&#x27;s Sea Plus night cream for about three months now, so I feel I can give a better time-tested review on this stuff.</li>
            <li>After using this stuff for two months, I have a clearer more youthful complexion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve fallen completely in love with this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It took over a week for my skin to get better.</li>
            <li>, I also discovered lemon juice as an astringent and the two combined are like magic for my skin.</li>
            <li>I have used the top shelf from dept stores and they do not compare.</li>
            <li>I have perfectly healthy skin</li>
            <li>So far I am very happy with this Alba Even Advanced Renewal Night Cream.</li>
            <li>I love the Alba seaweed toner in this line.</li>
            <li>I will say too, after using it a week, I don&#x27;t feel my skin is any better or softer, unlike most who rave about it&#x27;s benefits.</li>
            <li>A dermatologist told me years ago to make sure I moisturize well</li>
            <li>I used to use the Hawaiian moisturizer, toner and face wash by Alba, but wanted a more moisturizing cream for the night.  </li>
            <li>it makes my face feel smooth and luxurious, and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Just how I like it. :)</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s cruelty free to boot!</li>
            <li>I love their Jasmin and Vitamin E cream.</li>
            <li>However, 1) it&#x27;s lovely, and 2) I can&#x27;t smell it after I&#x27;ve applied it.</li>
            <li>After several months of use, this didn&#x27;t irritate my skin (win!)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t just love it</li>
            <li>, I want it more than life itself.</li>
            <li>products are definitely my favorite since the do not test on animals and are vegetarian :)</li>
            <li>comes this lovely product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t put my finger on it, but when i wake up in the morning I look much better if I have applied this stuff before bed.  </li>
            <li>After a year of using my skin changed drastically for better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I use it every night and love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>My skin has softened and brightened, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this night cream.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels better.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff, the price was better than I have seen anywhere else.</li>
            <li>However, the smell is just okay and takes a bit of getting used to.</li>
            <li>So many say they do</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer at night, it gives me moisture without that greasy feel, I use it at night after I cleanse with Alba AcneDote cleansers.</li>
            <li>I will update in about 2 weeks of using it.08/08/2011  UPDATE 08/23/2011 LOVE IT, LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Now that cooler weather has set in and the air is drier, I love it and use it every night.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 38, and my skin drinks most lotion.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and feels great.</li>
            <li>Love the alba moisture cream (aloe tea)</li>
            <li>i love everything from the smell to the feel of my skin from this.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I also love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Love this night cream.  </li>
            <li>I honestly love this cream.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price looks much better as an add-on item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and have used it for a couple of years.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s deeply moisturizing, perfect for night.</li>
            <li>its very rich and creamy not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see if it makes a difference in skin tone - they say it takes 2 weeks but honestly?</li>
            <li>I love the density of this cream, but the strong fragrance just makes me never want to use it.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is strong and overwhelming.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong but it&#x27;s ok for night cream</li>
            <li>I wake up with soft amazing skin each morning :) smells great like fresh daffodils.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful smell and gives my dry skin lots of moisture!  </li>
            <li>It feels great, penetrates fast, and I&#x27;m excited to see the results in 2 weeks as it&#x27;s supposed to even out your skin tone.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually pleasant but a bit strong for a face cream and somewhat unusual.</li>
            <li>Very fair price vs. what I pay for this product in local stores.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many different moisturizers, so, I can say that this is a great cream, leaves my skin soft, moist, and with great complexion</li>
            <li>I like it because s for the most part is free of harmful types of ingredients</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cruelty free night cream.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and good price.</li>
            <li>Goes on very nice and is not greasy, leaves my skin clearly hydrated and does not make me break out.</li>
            <li>i love this rich cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a good price, too, I am going to continue with this one!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought other brands on amazon and this one I like best.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy, isn&#x27;t too sticky or gooey.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s magical jar and with one sweep, gathered a field of freshly grown, exotic flowers and with one motion, scattered it all over your face.    </li>
            <li>My skin is soft and smooth and my makeup looks great on.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s scent to something so strong and nausea inducing</li>
            <li>The scent is so strong it stings my eye and makes me sneeze.</li>
            <li>The cream is moisturizing but that doesn&#x27;t make up for the strong odor.</li>
            <li>Not seeing anything very special about this product, but it is cruelty-free, which is important to me.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t know if I liked the smell of this product</li>
            <li>Wow, pretty incredible stuff, and that is after one use.</li>
            <li>It does absorb more quickly now, so if you&#x27;re in a humid climate that could be a plus.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel like it does after a dip in the ocean!</li>
            <li>I wish they had a fragrance free version instead of the strong \\&quot;urinal cake\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li>With this, I actually see a decrease  in fine lines, and my skin feels great.  </li>
            <li>I recommend getting DMAE in your products and you will see a huge difference in your skin.</li>
            <li>and I already notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I had a HUGE blister the size of a quarter appear on the bridge of my nose.  </li>
            <li>and I feel like it&#x27;s important to put some sort of moisturizer on my skin at night.  </li>
            <li>i use this cream at night and it is very moisturizing and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I recognize that damage takes time to heal and it is not entirely reversible, so I am happy with this result because I don&#x27;t expect one product to do all the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend that all people looking to wake up and brighten their skin try this fabulous product.</li>
            <li>I started using this at night and liked it so much that I use it in the morning as well</li>
            <li>I wish they made it in a fragrance free version.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and nongreasy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silky, creamy smooth.  </li>
            <li>I was told by a friend of mine who is an estetician that the best way to keep looking good and young is to not touch your face to prevent germs, wash in the mornings and nights, and lastly moisturize really well every day.</li>
            <li>and it is cruelty free.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel great and look younger.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the Even advanced by Alba, and oh my.</li>
            <li>As soon as I switched back, it was happy again.</li>
            <li>It makes my 60-yr-old skin feel SO silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>I like Alba products, and this night cream is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>but it is light.</li>
            <li>I like the way this smells cheap and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I loved the formula I bought maybe 2 years ago, this one is ok but not the same.  </li>
            <li>I do wake up with really soft, if not a bit dewy/oily in a good way skin in the morning, so that is a plus.</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because the smell is somewhat strong, but it is not bad smelling</li>
            <li>1/3 off what my health food store charges--and exact same awesome product--that really DOES reduce age spots!</li>
            <li>(my original review based on purchase from February/March 2011)</li>
            <li>soft.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m still not disappointed with it.</li>
            <li>for the price is worth to try, I do recomend it!</li>
            <li>I gave the product a very fair shot, I used it nightly and managed to make it through half of the jar.</li>
            <li>The original scent of white sand beaches and sea salt is gone, it&#x27;s been replaced with an incredibly floral perfume that is very over powering.</li>
            <li>, it makes me feel clean.</li>
            <li>It really just feels balanced and soft and happy.</li>
            <li>This is a great cream for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a strong cologne, right before going to sleep.</li>
            <li>Go to sleep, wake up in the morning, and place your hand on your freshly renewed, clean, spot free face.</li>
            <li>I am loving this night cream , very smooth, soft and gentle on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try out this product because of all the super emollient oils I saw listed in the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I am 58, do you know how hard it is to get flawless skin at 58.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually rather distressed to find out a product I really loved has been dramatically altered.</li>
            <li>Alba should really advertise this more...</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>I have reordered another 2 ounce pot because it is good enough to try for another month, but I am now looking into Ecco Bella products.</li>
            <li>I love it so much, I use it during the day as well as the night.</li>
            <li>Not a a bad cream per say, but</li>
            <li>and I mean flawless.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this cream at whole foods ( natural food market), and loved it.  </li>
            <li>wanted to love this night cream after reading all the positive reviews, but the scent is so powerful that I could not fall asleep after putting it on my face.</li>
            <li>though this has a pretty strong one, it was not a problem for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had great luck with other Alba products too.</li>
            <li>I would buy from this seller again, received quickly.</li>
            <li>I have only recently started using night moisturizers and did a ton of research on the best alternatives.  </li>
            <li>I use this right after I wash my face at night and in the morning, my face feels nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for natural and cruelty free products that work, and I&#x27;m happy to say that I don&#x27;t need to look any further.  </li>
            <li>I was in search of a new, cruelty free night cream and came across this!</li>
            <li>It does do a good job of moisturizing in the winter when my skin gets dry</li>
            <li>This cream is very thick, perfect for an arid climate.</li>
            <li>Totally attribute that in large part to moisturizing religiously with this awesome cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy or greasy and feels great day or night.</li>
            <li>I really like the Even Advanced line from Alba</li>
            <li>An intense, cheap, perfume-soapy smell that is just repellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Old blemish marks have mostly faded and my skin is softer and well hydrated.</li>
            <li>It keeps you moist, but you&#x27;ve absorbed it by the end of the night.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>have cut back on how much I use it now that I spend more time in doors, and do think that I can notice an increase in acne when I have been using it more.</li>
            <li>The texture is silky and is absorbed well.</li>
            <li>Face is left with a nice dewy feel.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about it, though.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve tried: ProActiv, Neutrogena, Burt&#x27;s Bees, Clearasil, Biore, Lancome, Boscia, Shiseido, Murad, and others (too many to name).</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this works very well for moisturizing, smells nice and does not make me break out.</li>
            <li>Love thia night cream, it leaves like a protectiver barrier aroiund my skin and it feels so soft in the morning when I wake up.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the try.</li>
            <li>I imagine that this moisturizer would be great for people with dry to normal skin types in terms of oil-level.</li>
            <li>while I like to think I look good for my age, other than my Mom telling me so</li>
            <li>DMAE was supposed to be good for your skin - first really brought to attention by Dr. Perricone, but it seems (just from what I was told) that after a period of time it can actually \\&quot;thin\\&quot; the skin.  </li>
            <li>, this is not the right moisturizer for my skin type.</li>
            <li>I love it,  and will continue to use these affordable products for as long as they are available.</li>
            <li>This was $5 less, and I love my Alba hand cream, so thought I&#x27;d love this as well.</li>
            <li>Apparently, this product contains some fairly potent things that can be skin irritants (google Paula reviews).  </li>
            <li>Recently I have been switching to Alba products and all of the products I&#x27;ve tried so far, I&#x27;ve loved.     </li>
            <li>Love the fact it doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals (who needs more toxicity?).</li>
            <li>I have dry skin too, but it has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>, I wash my face with dove and warm water, wait 10 min for my skin to dry, then I apply the cream, I do this in the morning(Using the day</li>
            <li>All of Alba&#x27;s products in this line is very gentle to my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>It is lovely for day or night in winter on the upper East Coast.</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t rely on that ;-)</li>
            <li>But, hey, I&#x27;m willing to try this,</li>
            <li>, 1 Ounce - I went with Alba first bc</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it regularly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t smell like an old lady.</li>
            <li>I just touch the top of it and get enough for above my eyes, then do one more pat for my forehead and each cheek.</li>
            <li>The first morning after I used this night cream, I was washing my face and thought, &amp;</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll write more if there&#x27;s more to say, good or bad, as time progresses.</li>
            <li>I tried this first time about a month ago.  </li>
            <li>will most definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this line of products since 2005, and love them despite the recent reformulation.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I finally found something that works !!</li>
            <li>I have used so many products over the years but this is the only one that gave me results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had good skin but people always comment that I look years younger than I actually am.  </li>
            <li>I also use a scrub pad gently with Burts cleanser but very gently.</li>
            <li>It is very thick and goes on beautifully.</li>
            <li>, I  buy my alba even advanced night cream at target for much more money than the price listed here, I am almost  through  with this jar, next time I will definitely repurchase  on amazon.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had it just over six months using it pretty much every night.</li>
            <li>Despite the summer hot humid weather I have not broken out from it yet.  </li>
            <li>Makes skin so soft and full of moisture.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, mild acne-prone, oily, combo skin.</li>
            <li>The creamy texture is ok with me since i have dry skin.  </li>
            <li>After reading these rave reviews I must be super sensitive.</li>
            <li>Also makes the skin super soft.</li>
            <li>I am an older woman and this product really keeps my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Just a bunch of oils that sits on top my dry AA skin.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong and smells like the sea, but is definitely a scent I can handle.</li>
            <li>I thought Alba products, being all organic, would not have such a strong perfumy smell.</li>
            <li>I am not someone who is big on strong fragrances in lotion,</li>
            <li>do feel that this product certainly can&#x27;t help</li>
            <li>it moisturizes and it certainly adheres to the skin.</li>
            <li>I stopped and tried it a few times just to make sure that was reason, and it was!</li>
            <li>, it has a very soothing scent, NOT too strong, but definitely there.  </li>
            <li>It is light, easily absorbed, and really helps my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly this thick cream does not make my super sensitive skin break out.</li>
            <li>Great price for such a little treasure.</li>
            <li>definitely gives you some moisture, and a little goes a looong ways, but it&#x27;s not so great if you are acne prone...</li>
            <li>I ordered a different type then this one (still Alba, just not the even advanced), but kept it because returning things was too much of a hassle (no access to a post office at camp...</li>
            <li>i feel like it will take me a year to use the whole thing.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for anyone!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li>Plus skin cream is very moisturizing, and excellent as a night cream only - it is far too thick for daytime.</li>
            <li>I always wake up with baby soft skin in the morning after applying it at night, and my skin feels fresh and healthier since I began using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I will absolutely continue to use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped even out my skin tone so much</li>
            <li>much prefer the jasmine scented Alba Hawaiian cream.</li>
            <li>Very prompt delivery.  </li>
            <li>It seemed like a real bargain, given the price.</li>
            <li>like maybe I should wash it off soon as I apply it because it smells so much like soap</li>
            <li>Very manly smell that lingers all day or night.</li>
            <li>Reminiscent of cheap after shave.</li>
            <li>But the Avalon Vitamin C moisturizer seems to go on much lighter and does not have the fragrance issue.</li>
            <li>My skin is aging really well.  </li>
            <li>Very creamy and gentle.</li>
            <li>It had really gotten to the point where it wasn&#x27;t even doing anything anymore for me</li>
            <li>Amazon price is much cheaper than whole food.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much for it&#x27;s ability to even my skin tone...</li>
            <li>I hope this will really help it out.</li>
            <li>but this one really does.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is NOT non-comedogenic, and really clogged up my pores.</li>
            <li>it absorbs fast and non greasy</li>
            <li>I really like how my face feels in the morning.</li>
            <li>Skin started sluffing off my face like some really gentle exfolliation going on.</li>
            <li>but this was just WAY too much.</li>
            <li>I use the whole line...</li>
            <li>Hydrates really well</li>
            <li>and really does even your skin tone</li>
            <li>I have used this Alba Advanced night cream for several years and I never want to run out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Really want to purchase&lt;</li>
            <li>I bought this at whole foods I think, not Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It lingered all night and actually kept me from sleeping soundly.</li>
            <li>I got this over the summer, when I was working at a camp, outside 24/7 and covered in ocean water for most of that, too busy to reapply sunscreen as often as needed.</li>
            <li>Ok so far but only 2 uses in.</li>
            <li>My skin gets very dry after I cleanse with a fragrance free, no sulfate gentle cleanser, and my face soaks this cream right up.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work as I have other Alba products I love.</li>
            <li>Awesome product for my sensitive and very dry winter skin... Soak it up before putting on my foundation everyday!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new night cream and decided to try this one thanks to the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>What first caught my eye about Alba Sea Plus Advanced Skin Cream Renewal is that its complex of marine lipids, aloe vera and other great, natural ingredients aid in giving your skin a \\&quot;pick me up,\\&quot; smoothes out blotchiness and visibly improves your skin in two weeks.</li>
            <li>i love this product for all this.. however, it is not as moisterizng over the night cimpared to other product</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great moisturizer , a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>It has sea algea, and is very hydrating for someone who is 35 or older.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s a sin to be using this computer right now, and maybe even more of a sin to have paid for it in sex, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be returning to my Amish past.</li>
            <li>It leaves your face feeling moisturized but not greasy, and I think it helps sensitive, dry skin like mine to look healthy.</li>
            <li>This kind of product is usually catered to women.</li>
            <li>I really like the &#x27;sea&#x27; line of Alba products, but this night cream is a quite a bit heavier than what I normally use - Neutrogena&#x27;s Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration Night.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, and I&#x27;m trying to keep my usage down to a minimum &#x27;cause</li>
            <li>Any skin care product can potentially cause a reaction and so can all my favorite vices (coffee, soda, red wine, chocolate...)  </li>
            <li>If you are purchasing this in hopes to even-out your skin tone, I would give it a shot, but just be realistic.</li>
            <li>An hour later I came back to see how my face looked and rubbed it in some more.</li>
            <li>This product works very well on my skin which is ULTRA sensitive!  </li>
            <li>Really, for me - this is a miracle cream and a must have, as far as I&#x27;m concerned!</li>
            <li>I  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;p.s.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I may be more sensitive than other people about fragrance, but I always try to buy the fragrance-free products when I can.</li>
            <li>So far I really like this cream.  </li>
            <li>great for my difficult combination skin.</li>
            <li>I have an oily T zone, very acne prone skin, it is also sensitive and is normal/dry everywhere where it is not oily.</li>
            <li>most night creams are too heavy or have a bad smell, but this one is awesome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of the few that actually love the scent as well</li>
            <li>My skin is normal and when I asked my sister who is a naturalist for suggestions,  she recommended Alba Sea Plus Renewal Cream.  </li>
            <li>My aging, dry, red, combination, super sensitive skin looks much better after only a week or so of using it.  </li>
            <li>I also use this on my neck where I have some stubborn eczema, and even with the strong fragrance in it, it doesn&#x27;t bother it and is actually the only thing that has worked on it, even beyond Cortizone-10 for eczema and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m content enough right now that it&#x27;s&lt;</li>
            <li>This cream, hmm, looking in the mirror right now, I would say 20 years younger!</li>
            <li>Like an infant&#x27;s newly washed booty.      </li>
            <li>It says \\&quot;new and improved\\</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s helpful, I live in Phoenix, so</li>
            <li>I cannot wear any sort of perfume due to being sensitive of smells as well, so I was concered when I read comments that the smell was strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super moisturizing and keeps your skin from feeling dry.</li>
            <li>I realize that sounds bizarre, but I kept wanting to wake up and wash it off my face and couldn&#x27;t rouse myself to leave a warm bed for a cold bathroom.</li>
            <li>it feels very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Very sensitive, oily, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and my skin is very sensitive, oily, and acne prone, but using these products helps me to keep the acne and oil under control while renewing my skin cells.........</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to fragrance, I would skip it!</li>
            <li>I actually almost pitched it/gave it away after using it the first time...</li>
            <li>I like to use this occassionally at night even during hot weather because it seems to plump up my skin the next day.  </li>
            <li>But now it&#x27;s sitting in my drawer in my bathroom, cause for the first time since teenage (I&#x27;m in my 20s)</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this product because of its natural ingredients and not tested on animals but the smell is way too strong - and as I mentioned in my subject line, my skin felt like it was burning as if there were alcohol in the product.</li>
            <li>Alba Botanica&#x27;s Aloe and Green Tea Oil Free moisturizer works better than this heavy creme at keeping my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>my previous creams were light to no scent</li>
            <li>It is a good consistency so you can wear it during the hot summer months and the cold winter months and not feel like your pores are being clogged</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I see a dramatic difference in the dark spots on my skin after using this product for one month, but I can say it is a very good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that tends to dry out, so I needed a gentle but intense moisturizer for at night.</li>
            <li>also, i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s due to this product or not, but i&#x27;ve been feeling really happy about my skin in general lately.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a little more tightening or even-tone, but it just seems the same.</li>
            <li>a note, you can use this stuff pretty sparingly - I&#x27;m not quite done with my first little tub</li>
            <li>I found this to keep my skin moisturized and clear.</li>
            <li>I clearly have a sensitivity to a chemical in this.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really speak to the benefits of this cream because I only used it once -- and the fragrance was so overpowering I couldn&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li>but I literally put it on here at work - just under my eyes and my skin feels incredibly soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>Has all natural (i think) ingredients</li>
            <li>This night cream will leave your skin soft.  </li>
            <li>When the bottle was empty, I tried another cream that was supposed to do the same thing, only better.</li>
            <li>Not too heavy and not too light.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 20s</li>
            <li>I have followed that for years now and I always get compliments on my skin and how young I look.</li>
            <li>The match then lit a wild fire, called rosacea.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes well and works on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>, I had brown marks from old acne they are almost gone</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I like Mary Kay and have a family who looks young and swears by it, so</li>
            <li>I decided to give it a try and was quite satisfied--not too light nor too heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrance -- do not buy this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but so far they don&#x27;t appear any lighter to me.</li>
            <li>and this makes my skin really soft</li>
            <li>Sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>No break out, natural ingredients...</li>
            <li>I tend to be sensitive to \\&quot;commercial\\&quot; fragrances and find them repugnant.</li>
            <li>maybe it was discontinued or something, but DONT BUY THIS IF YOU&#x27;RE JUST LOOKING FOR A DAY CREAM because they will send you a night cream (which is a good product don&#x27;t get me wrong but</li>
            <li>Good but not Great!</li>
            <li>Its consistency is a bit too thick for me, but the scent is okay.</li>
            <li>I use it at night only since it is kind of thick.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy slight fragrances (I generally use Weleda face creams,)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy, smells fantastic yet not strong to keep me up or have my eyes water.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The other &#x27;sea&#x27; products have a mild &#x27;beachy&#x27; smell that&#x27;s much more subtle.  </li>
            <li>Like a full moon in the mother truckin sky, you only need a little bit to affect the whole mother truckin town.    </li>
            <li>Is very thick compared to night creams I&#x27;ve used in the past, but overall is a wonderful night cream.</li>
            <li>I have spent so much money on high profile products and these cheaper items are doing the trick.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend has told me on multiple occasions (particularly when I&#x27;m not wearing makeup)</li>
            <li>but I did feel it provided a good amount of moisture without irritating my dry, sensitive skin, which is what I bought the product for.</li>
            <li>Oh my, I had such high hopes for this b/c</li>
            <li>other dry skin creams just layed on top of my skin and looked greasy, and/or actually made me break out.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to buy it if your skin is dry or you live in the dessert.</li>
            <li>I am only recommending this product for normal skin because that is what I have</li>
            <li>Very heavy on the moisture but not waxy like some of the organic, paraben- free products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I am waiting for my 3rd box of the cream, because I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>I ordered the moisturizer spf 15 and this night cream they both smell a little funny but is a very soft scent.</li>
            <li>I really like the ingredients, some people aren&#x27;t sure about the adding of DMAE, but a co-worker who used to sell natural skin care products said that where it is listed, in the line of ingredients, which is half way down, means there&#x27;s not much of it in there.  </li>
            <li>The first time I applied this to my face, I noticed immediately the sharp, soapy fragrance.</li>
            <li>I had a major allergic/irritation response to the cream that caused the blisters.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear they are now marketing it primarily as something to reduce uneven skin tone, which was not clear to me from the product listing.</li>
            <li>I already used an Alba face moisturizer, but with the dry hot summer, it wasn&#x27;t enough to keep my face hydrated.</li>
            <li>I use the even advanced daily cream when it is hot and humid, but I use this night Cream all winter long as my face gets very dry and tight.</li>
            <li>This used to be the Sea Plus \\&quot;Renewal\\&quot; Cream, which was a general night cream to help with firmness, wrinkles, etc.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft and possible has improved</li>
            <li>I have gotten several compliments on my 60 year old complexion since I started using this.</li>
            <li>It totally makes my face feel and look moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve developed some stress acne, and they have left some unwelcome pigmentation.  </li>
            <li>I can barely see them.</li>
            <li>I work outside near the ocean</li>
            <li>so this product is definitely not recommended for skin types similar to mines (normal but acne prone).</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t worse, but isn&#x27;t better either, just didn&#x27;t work for me,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and creamy, leaves my face smooth, doesn&#x27;t cause irritation and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>Be very careful with this product and don&#x27;t take all the positive reviews without a grain of salt.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, and not a single breakout!</li>
            <li>This one meets all my requirements, goes on thick, absorbs quickly, and keeps my skin feeling soft and luscious.</li>
            <li>I naturally have very dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Wait til any serums you use to absorb first or it&#x27;ll rub it and itself off and make a snotty mess on your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too bad because the product has received such great reviews</li>
            <li>As indicated on the Alba website, people with mature skin should use this daily and younger people can use this as a night cream.</li>
            <li>After 45 years of using expensive moisturizers, I decided to start using natural and organic products that are much more affordable.  </li>
            <li>It has minimal scent, and it does a decent job at moisturizing.</li>
            <li>As I have stated on my other reviews with the other Alba Even Advanced face cream and cleansing wash that I have purchased and used, this is the first time I have used any other natural products since I have been previously using Origins and this product has done well in comparison to Origins</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been recently told by a care coordinator at a Wellness Center that I should join the 18-25 years old socialization group instead of the 26-55 years old group.</li>
            <li>and I wake up with plump, soft skin that lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>and I broke out the first few times I wore this.</li>
            <li>I was really let down.</li>
            <li>Product smelled to strong and was too irritating for my skin.</li>
            <li>i live in a very dry climate, and my skin was definitely looking &amp;</li>
            <li>When I first tried this in the summer, it felt a little too greasy and heavy to me, so I didn&#x27;t use it much.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, dry, red and acne prone skin</li>
            <li>It is super thick, and you only need a tiny bit of it.</li>
            <li>I have very dry sensitive</li>
            <li>You only need to use a little bit for your whole face.  </li>
            <li>Although j love the smell, I&#x27;m afraid to go near it for fear of breaking out.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I loved the idea of sea stuff in it.  </li>
            <li> Product is a superior cream I have been using for years.</li>
            <li> This is truly a good buy and equivalent to those over $100 creams....</li>
            <li> I put it on before my foundation and it acts as a line filler surprisingly.  </li>
            <li> but it is no longer what I loved.  </li>
            <li> Keep up the good work, Alba.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it a good dupe for La Mer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d call it a good dupe for Mary Kay...</li>
            <li> It moisturizes, evens out my skin tone, clears my zits and makes my skin look GOOD.</li>
            <li> Feels great and has a nice fragrance.</li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> Feels amazing</li>
            <li> and this works amazing on acne scars.</li>
            <li> THIS CREAM IS AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> I never say cream is amazing, trust me</li>
            <li> This stuff is kind of amazing.</li>
            <li> a nice quality face cream without the chemicals that&#x27;s an affordable price.  </li>
            <li> Oh and it smells SO nice</li>
            <li> Otherwise it is a nice nightime lotion.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best skin moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I really liked the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> The Alba Sea Plus Renewal Cream does smell nice and is supposed to be hypoallergenic however 80% of the time I used this cream I suffered from a fragrance-related asthma allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> It smells kind of like men&#x27;s deodorant.</li>
            <li> The cream feels really nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have liked all of the Alba products that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> and my wife liked it.</li>
            <li> So nice.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly see a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice too.</li>
            <li> The smell is very pleasant in my opinion, and I can understand why people who really need the moisture rave about this</li>
            <li> The smell is light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Also, this product came in good packaging and very quickly.</li>
            <li> To be fair, the Jasmin cream has a strong scent too.</li>
            <li> the scent is very strong to me.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very strong.</li>
            <li> Glad I was able to return it!</li>
            <li> love it, love it!  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product - so rich nourishing to my skin!!!  </li>
            <li> It goes on so nicely and doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance like most products, which tends to bother my skin.  </li>
            <li> This cream is the best I haves used so far.</li>
            <li> and I was raving about it to all my friends about how soft my skin felt and how awesome it smells.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried alba products before but so far I&#x27;m really impressed.</li>
            <li> I liked this better when it was a cream, not a butter.</li>
            <li> I use the day cream too - love love love!</li>
            <li> I realized it&#x27;s really effects when people start telling how beautiful my skin was and wanting to know what I had done.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> This cream does not irritate or clog my skin that seems to love to break out with no warning or reason.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin feel and it doesnt break me out.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure-</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this cream -</li>
            <li> I use the scrub and have enjoyed that.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I did JUST get this TODAY</li>
            <li> It does not moisturize as well, but it does not irritate my skin, so I&#x27;ll use it until I find something I like better.      </li>
            <li> I have been using Alba&#x27;s Sea Plus night cream for about three months now, so I feel I can give a better time-tested review on this stuff.</li>
            <li> After using this stuff for two months, I have a clearer more youthful complexion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve fallen completely in love with this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It took over a week for my skin to get better.</li>
            <li> , I also discovered lemon juice as an astringent and the two combined are like magic for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used the top shelf from dept stores and they do not compare.</li>
            <li> I have perfectly healthy skin</li>
            <li> So far I am very happy with this Alba Even Advanced Renewal Night Cream.</li>
            <li> I love the Alba seaweed toner in this line.</li>
            <li> I will say too, after using it a week, I don&#x27;t feel my skin is any better or softer, unlike most who rave about it&#x27;s benefits.</li>
            <li> A dermatologist told me years ago to make sure I moisturize well</li>
            <li> I used to use the Hawaiian moisturizer, toner and face wash by Alba, but wanted a more moisturizing cream for the night.  </li>
            <li> it makes my face feel smooth and luxurious, and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Just how I like it. :)</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s cruelty free to boot!</li>
            <li> I love their Jasmin and Vitamin E cream.</li>
            <li> However, 1) it&#x27;s lovely, and 2) I can&#x27;t smell it after I&#x27;ve applied it.</li>
            <li> After several months of use, this didn&#x27;t irritate my skin (win!)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t just love it</li>
            <li> , I want it more than life itself.</li>
            <li> products are definitely my favorite since the do not test on animals and are vegetarian :)</li>
            <li> comes this lovely product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t put my finger on it, but when i wake up in the morning I look much better if I have applied this stuff before bed.  </li>
            <li> After a year of using my skin changed drastically for better.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I use it every night and love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> My skin has softened and brightened, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this night cream.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels better.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff, the price was better than I have seen anywhere else.</li>
            <li> However, the smell is just okay and takes a bit of getting used to.</li>
            <li> So many say they do</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer at night, it gives me moisture without that greasy feel, I use it at night after I cleanse with Alba AcneDote cleansers.</li>
            <li> I will update in about 2 weeks of using it.08/08/2011  UPDATE 08/23/2011 LOVE IT, LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Now that cooler weather has set in and the air is drier, I love it and use it every night.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 38, and my skin drinks most lotion.</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and feels great.</li>
            <li> Love the alba moisture cream (aloe tea)</li>
            <li> i love everything from the smell to the feel of my skin from this.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I also love the smell.  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Love this night cream.  </li>
            <li> I honestly love this cream.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price looks much better as an add-on item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and have used it for a couple of years.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deeply moisturizing, perfect for night.</li>
            <li> its very rich and creamy not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see if it makes a difference in skin tone - they say it takes 2 weeks but honestly?</li>
            <li> I love the density of this cream, but the strong fragrance just makes me never want to use it.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is strong and overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong but it&#x27;s ok for night cream</li>
            <li> I wake up with soft amazing skin each morning :) smells great like fresh daffodils.</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful smell and gives my dry skin lots of moisture!  </li>
            <li> It feels great, penetrates fast, and I&#x27;m excited to see the results in 2 weeks as it&#x27;s supposed to even out your skin tone.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually pleasant but a bit strong for a face cream and somewhat unusual.</li>
            <li> Very fair price vs. what I pay for this product in local stores.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many different moisturizers, so, I can say that this is a great cream, leaves my skin soft, moist, and with great complexion</li>
            <li> I like it because s for the most part is free of harmful types of ingredients</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cruelty free night cream.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good price.</li>
            <li> Goes on very nice and is not greasy, leaves my skin clearly hydrated and does not make me break out.</li>
            <li> i love this rich cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a good price, too, I am going to continue with this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other brands on amazon and this one I like best.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy, isn&#x27;t too sticky or gooey.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s magical jar and with one sweep, gathered a field of freshly grown, exotic flowers and with one motion, scattered it all over your face.    </li>
            <li> My skin is soft and smooth and my makeup looks great on.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s scent to something so strong and nausea inducing</li>
            <li> The scent is so strong it stings my eye and makes me sneeze.</li>
            <li> The cream is moisturizing but that doesn&#x27;t make up for the strong odor.</li>
            <li> Not seeing anything very special about this product, but it is cruelty-free, which is important to me.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know if I liked the smell of this product</li>
            <li> Wow, pretty incredible stuff, and that is after one use.</li>
            <li> It does absorb more quickly now, so if you&#x27;re in a humid climate that could be a plus.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel like it does after a dip in the ocean!</li>
            <li> I wish they had a fragrance free version instead of the strong \\&quot;urinal cake\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li> With this, I actually see a decrease  in fine lines, and my skin feels great.  </li>
            <li> I recommend getting DMAE in your products and you will see a huge difference in your skin.</li>
            <li> and I already notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I had a HUGE blister the size of a quarter appear on the bridge of my nose.  </li>
            <li> and I feel like it&#x27;s important to put some sort of moisturizer on my skin at night.  </li>
            <li> i use this cream at night and it is very moisturizing and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I recognize that damage takes time to heal and it is not entirely reversible, so I am happy with this result because I don&#x27;t expect one product to do all the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend that all people looking to wake up and brighten their skin try this fabulous product.</li>
            <li> I started using this at night and liked it so much that I use it in the morning as well</li>
            <li> I wish they made it in a fragrance free version.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and nongreasy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s silky, creamy smooth.  </li>
            <li> I was told by a friend of mine who is an estetician that the best way to keep looking good and young is to not touch your face to prevent germs, wash in the mornings and nights, and lastly moisturize really well every day.</li>
            <li> and it is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel great and look younger.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Even advanced by Alba, and oh my.</li>
            <li> As soon as I switched back, it was happy again.</li>
            <li> It makes my 60-yr-old skin feel SO silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> I like Alba products, and this night cream is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> but it is light.</li>
            <li> I like the way this smells cheap and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I loved the formula I bought maybe 2 years ago, this one is ok but not the same.  </li>
            <li> I do wake up with really soft, if not a bit dewy/oily in a good way skin in the morning, so that is a plus.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because the smell is somewhat strong, but it is not bad smelling</li>
            <li> 1/3 off what my health food store charges--and exact same awesome product--that really DOES reduce age spots!</li>
            <li> (my original review based on purchase from February/March 2011)</li>
            <li> soft.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m still not disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> for the price is worth to try, I do recomend it!</li>
            <li> I gave the product a very fair shot, I used it nightly and managed to make it through half of the jar.</li>
            <li> The original scent of white sand beaches and sea salt is gone, it&#x27;s been replaced with an incredibly floral perfume that is very over powering.</li>
            <li> , it makes me feel clean.</li>
            <li> It really just feels balanced and soft and happy.</li>
            <li> This is a great cream for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a strong cologne, right before going to sleep.</li>
            <li> Go to sleep, wake up in the morning, and place your hand on your freshly renewed, clean, spot free face.</li>
            <li> I am loving this night cream , very smooth, soft and gentle on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try out this product because of all the super emollient oils I saw listed in the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I am 58, do you know how hard it is to get flawless skin at 58.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually rather distressed to find out a product I really loved has been dramatically altered.</li>
            <li> Alba should really advertise this more...</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> I have reordered another 2 ounce pot because it is good enough to try for another month, but I am now looking into Ecco Bella products.</li>
            <li> I love it so much, I use it during the day as well as the night.</li>
            <li> Not a a bad cream per say, but</li>
            <li> and I mean flawless.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this cream at whole foods ( natural food market), and loved it.  </li>
            <li> wanted to love this night cream after reading all the positive reviews, but the scent is so powerful that I could not fall asleep after putting it on my face.</li>
            <li> though this has a pretty strong one, it was not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had great luck with other Alba products too.</li>
            <li> I would buy from this seller again, received quickly.</li>
            <li> I have only recently started using night moisturizers and did a ton of research on the best alternatives.  </li>
            <li> I use this right after I wash my face at night and in the morning, my face feels nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for natural and cruelty free products that work, and I&#x27;m happy to say that I don&#x27;t need to look any further.  </li>
            <li> I was in search of a new, cruelty free night cream and came across this!</li>
            <li> It does do a good job of moisturizing in the winter when my skin gets dry</li>
            <li> This cream is very thick, perfect for an arid climate.</li>
            <li> Totally attribute that in large part to moisturizing religiously with this awesome cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy or greasy and feels great day or night.</li>
            <li> I really like the Even Advanced line from Alba</li>
            <li> An intense, cheap, perfume-soapy smell that is just repellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Old blemish marks have mostly faded and my skin is softer and well hydrated.</li>
            <li> It keeps you moist, but you&#x27;ve absorbed it by the end of the night.  </li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> have cut back on how much I use it now that I spend more time in doors, and do think that I can notice an increase in acne when I have been using it more.</li>
            <li> The texture is silky and is absorbed well.</li>
            <li> Face is left with a nice dewy feel.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about it, though.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve tried: ProActiv, Neutrogena, Burt&#x27;s Bees, Clearasil, Biore, Lancome, Boscia, Shiseido, Murad, and others (too many to name).</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this works very well for moisturizing, smells nice and does not make me break out.</li>
            <li> Love thia night cream, it leaves like a protectiver barrier aroiund my skin and it feels so soft in the morning when I wake up.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the try.</li>
            <li> I imagine that this moisturizer would be great for people with dry to normal skin types in terms of oil-level.</li>
            <li> while I like to think I look good for my age, other than my Mom telling me so</li>
            <li> DMAE was supposed to be good for your skin - first really brought to attention by Dr. Perricone, but it seems (just from what I was told) that after a period of time it can actually \\&quot;thin\\&quot; the skin.  </li>
            <li> , this is not the right moisturizer for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I love it,  and will continue to use these affordable products for as long as they are available.</li>
            <li> This was $5 less, and I love my Alba hand cream, so thought I&#x27;d love this as well.</li>
            <li> Apparently, this product contains some fairly potent things that can be skin irritants (google Paula reviews).  </li>
            <li> Recently I have been switching to Alba products and all of the products I&#x27;ve tried so far, I&#x27;ve loved.     </li>
            <li> Love the fact it doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals (who needs more toxicity?).</li>
            <li> I have dry skin too, but it has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> , I wash my face with dove and warm water, wait 10 min for my skin to dry, then I apply the cream, I do this in the morning(Using the day</li>
            <li> All of Alba&#x27;s products in this line is very gentle to my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> It is lovely for day or night in winter on the upper East Coast.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t rely on that ;-)</li>
            <li> But, hey, I&#x27;m willing to try this,</li>
            <li> , 1 Ounce - I went with Alba first bc</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it regularly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t smell like an old lady.</li>
            <li> I just touch the top of it and get enough for above my eyes, then do one more pat for my forehead and each cheek.</li>
            <li> The first morning after I used this night cream, I was washing my face and thought, &amp;</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll write more if there&#x27;s more to say, good or bad, as time progresses.</li>
            <li> I tried this first time about a month ago.  </li>
            <li> will most definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this line of products since 2005, and love them despite the recent reformulation.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I finally found something that works !!</li>
            <li> I have used so many products over the years but this is the only one that gave me results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had good skin but people always comment that I look years younger than I actually am.  </li>
            <li> I also use a scrub pad gently with Burts cleanser but very gently.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and goes on beautifully.</li>
            <li> , I  buy my alba even advanced night cream at target for much more money than the price listed here, I am almost  through  with this jar, next time I will definitely repurchase  on amazon.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had it just over six months using it pretty much every night.</li>
            <li> Despite the summer hot humid weather I have not broken out from it yet.  </li>
            <li> Makes skin so soft and full of moisture.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, mild acne-prone, oily, combo skin.</li>
            <li> The creamy texture is ok with me since i have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> After reading these rave reviews I must be super sensitive.</li>
            <li> Also makes the skin super soft.</li>
            <li> I am an older woman and this product really keeps my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Just a bunch of oils that sits on top my dry AA skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong and smells like the sea, but is definitely a scent I can handle.</li>
            <li> I thought Alba products, being all organic, would not have such a strong perfumy smell.</li>
            <li> I am not someone who is big on strong fragrances in lotion,</li>
            <li> do feel that this product certainly can&#x27;t help</li>
            <li> it moisturizes and it certainly adheres to the skin.</li>
            <li> I stopped and tried it a few times just to make sure that was reason, and it was!</li>
            <li> , it has a very soothing scent, NOT too strong, but definitely there.  </li>
            <li> It is light, easily absorbed, and really helps my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly this thick cream does not make my super sensitive skin break out.</li>
            <li> Great price for such a little treasure.</li>
            <li> definitely gives you some moisture, and a little goes a looong ways, but it&#x27;s not so great if you are acne prone...</li>
            <li> I ordered a different type then this one (still Alba, just not the even advanced), but kept it because returning things was too much of a hassle (no access to a post office at camp...</li>
            <li> i feel like it will take me a year to use the whole thing.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for anyone!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li> Plus skin cream is very moisturizing, and excellent as a night cream only - it is far too thick for daytime.</li>
            <li> I always wake up with baby soft skin in the morning after applying it at night, and my skin feels fresh and healthier since I began using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I will absolutely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped even out my skin tone so much</li>
            <li> much prefer the jasmine scented Alba Hawaiian cream.</li>
            <li> Very prompt delivery.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like a real bargain, given the price.</li>
            <li> like maybe I should wash it off soon as I apply it because it smells so much like soap</li>
            <li> Very manly smell that lingers all day or night.</li>
            <li> Reminiscent of cheap after shave.</li>
            <li> But the Avalon Vitamin C moisturizer seems to go on much lighter and does not have the fragrance issue.</li>
            <li> My skin is aging really well.  </li>
            <li> Very creamy and gentle.</li>
            <li> It had really gotten to the point where it wasn&#x27;t even doing anything anymore for me</li>
            <li> Amazon price is much cheaper than whole food.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much for it&#x27;s ability to even my skin tone...</li>
            <li> I hope this will really help it out.</li>
            <li> but this one really does.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is NOT non-comedogenic, and really clogged up my pores.</li>
            <li> it absorbs fast and non greasy</li>
            <li> I really like how my face feels in the morning.</li>
            <li> Skin started sluffing off my face like some really gentle exfolliation going on.</li>
            <li> but this was just WAY too much.</li>
            <li> I use the whole line...</li>
            <li> Hydrates really well</li>
            <li> and really does even your skin tone</li>
            <li> I have used this Alba Advanced night cream for several years and I never want to run out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Really want to purchase&lt;</li>
            <li> I bought this at whole foods I think, not Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It lingered all night and actually kept me from sleeping soundly.</li>
            <li> I got this over the summer, when I was working at a camp, outside 24/7 and covered in ocean water for most of that, too busy to reapply sunscreen as often as needed.</li>
            <li> Ok so far but only 2 uses in.</li>
            <li> My skin gets very dry after I cleanse with a fragrance free, no sulfate gentle cleanser, and my face soaks this cream right up.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work as I have other Alba products I love.</li>
            <li> Awesome product for my sensitive and very dry winter skin... Soak it up before putting on my foundation everyday!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new night cream and decided to try this one thanks to the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> What first caught my eye about Alba Sea Plus Advanced Skin Cream Renewal is that its complex of marine lipids, aloe vera and other great, natural ingredients aid in giving your skin a \\&quot;pick me up,\\&quot; smoothes out blotchiness and visibly improves your skin in two weeks.</li>
            <li> i love this product for all this.. however, it is not as moisterizng over the night cimpared to other product</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great moisturizer , a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It has sea algea, and is very hydrating for someone who is 35 or older.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s a sin to be using this computer right now, and maybe even more of a sin to have paid for it in sex, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be returning to my Amish past.</li>
            <li> It leaves your face feeling moisturized but not greasy, and I think it helps sensitive, dry skin like mine to look healthy.</li>
            <li> This kind of product is usually catered to women.</li>
            <li> I really like the &#x27;sea&#x27; line of Alba products, but this night cream is a quite a bit heavier than what I normally use - Neutrogena&#x27;s Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration Night.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell, and I&#x27;m trying to keep my usage down to a minimum &#x27;cause</li>
            <li> Any skin care product can potentially cause a reaction and so can all my favorite vices (coffee, soda, red wine, chocolate...)  </li>
            <li> If you are purchasing this in hopes to even-out your skin tone, I would give it a shot, but just be realistic.</li>
            <li> An hour later I came back to see how my face looked and rubbed it in some more.</li>
            <li> This product works very well on my skin which is ULTRA sensitive!  </li>
            <li> Really, for me - this is a miracle cream and a must have, as far as I&#x27;m concerned!</li>
            <li> I  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;p.s.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I may be more sensitive than other people about fragrance, but I always try to buy the fragrance-free products when I can.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this cream.  </li>
            <li> great for my difficult combination skin.</li>
            <li> I have an oily T zone, very acne prone skin, it is also sensitive and is normal/dry everywhere where it is not oily.</li>
            <li> most night creams are too heavy or have a bad smell, but this one is awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of the few that actually love the scent as well</li>
            <li> My skin is normal and when I asked my sister who is a naturalist for suggestions,  she recommended Alba Sea Plus Renewal Cream.  </li>
            <li> My aging, dry, red, combination, super sensitive skin looks much better after only a week or so of using it.  </li>
            <li> I also use this on my neck where I have some stubborn eczema, and even with the strong fragrance in it, it doesn&#x27;t bother it and is actually the only thing that has worked on it, even beyond Cortizone-10 for eczema and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m content enough right now that it&#x27;s&lt;</li>
            <li> This cream, hmm, looking in the mirror right now, I would say 20 years younger!</li>
            <li> Like an infant&#x27;s newly washed booty.      </li>
            <li> It says \\&quot;new and improved\\</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s helpful, I live in Phoenix, so</li>
            <li> I cannot wear any sort of perfume due to being sensitive of smells as well, so I was concered when I read comments that the smell was strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super moisturizing and keeps your skin from feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I realize that sounds bizarre, but I kept wanting to wake up and wash it off my face and couldn&#x27;t rouse myself to leave a warm bed for a cold bathroom.</li>
            <li> it feels very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Very sensitive, oily, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and my skin is very sensitive, oily, and acne prone, but using these products helps me to keep the acne and oil under control while renewing my skin cells.........</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to fragrance, I would skip it!</li>
            <li> I actually almost pitched it/gave it away after using it the first time...</li>
            <li> I like to use this occassionally at night even during hot weather because it seems to plump up my skin the next day.  </li>
            <li> But now it&#x27;s sitting in my drawer in my bathroom, cause for the first time since teenage (I&#x27;m in my 20s)</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product because of its natural ingredients and not tested on animals but the smell is way too strong - and as I mentioned in my subject line, my skin felt like it was burning as if there were alcohol in the product.</li>
            <li> Alba Botanica&#x27;s Aloe and Green Tea Oil Free moisturizer works better than this heavy creme at keeping my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> my previous creams were light to no scent</li>
            <li> It is a good consistency so you can wear it during the hot summer months and the cold winter months and not feel like your pores are being clogged</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I see a dramatic difference in the dark spots on my skin after using this product for one month, but I can say it is a very good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that tends to dry out, so I needed a gentle but intense moisturizer for at night.</li>
            <li> also, i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s due to this product or not, but i&#x27;ve been feeling really happy about my skin in general lately.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a little more tightening or even-tone, but it just seems the same.</li>
            <li> a note, you can use this stuff pretty sparingly - I&#x27;m not quite done with my first little tub</li>
            <li> I found this to keep my skin moisturized and clear.</li>
            <li> I clearly have a sensitivity to a chemical in this.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really speak to the benefits of this cream because I only used it once -- and the fragrance was so overpowering I couldn&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> but I literally put it on here at work - just under my eyes and my skin feels incredibly soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> Has all natural (i think) ingredients</li>
            <li> This night cream will leave your skin soft.  </li>
            <li> When the bottle was empty, I tried another cream that was supposed to do the same thing, only better.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy and not too light.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 20s</li>
            <li> I have followed that for years now and I always get compliments on my skin and how young I look.</li>
            <li> The match then lit a wild fire, called rosacea.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes well and works on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> , I had brown marks from old acne they are almost gone</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I like Mary Kay and have a family who looks young and swears by it, so</li>
            <li> I decided to give it a try and was quite satisfied--not too light nor too heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrance -- do not buy this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but so far they don&#x27;t appear any lighter to me.</li>
            <li> and this makes my skin really soft</li>
            <li> Sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> No break out, natural ingredients...</li>
            <li> I tend to be sensitive to \\&quot;commercial\\&quot; fragrances and find them repugnant.</li>
            <li> maybe it was discontinued or something, but DONT BUY THIS IF YOU&#x27;RE JUST LOOKING FOR A DAY CREAM because they will send you a night cream (which is a good product don&#x27;t get me wrong but</li>
            <li> Good but not Great!</li>
            <li> Its consistency is a bit too thick for me, but the scent is okay.</li>
            <li> I use it at night only since it is kind of thick.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy slight fragrances (I generally use Weleda face creams,)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy, smells fantastic yet not strong to keep me up or have my eyes water.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The other &#x27;sea&#x27; products have a mild &#x27;beachy&#x27; smell that&#x27;s much more subtle.  </li>
            <li> Like a full moon in the mother truckin sky, you only need a little bit to affect the whole mother truckin town.    </li>
            <li> Is very thick compared to night creams I&#x27;ve used in the past, but overall is a wonderful night cream.</li>
            <li> I have spent so much money on high profile products and these cheaper items are doing the trick.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has told me on multiple occasions (particularly when I&#x27;m not wearing makeup)</li>
            <li> but I did feel it provided a good amount of moisture without irritating my dry, sensitive skin, which is what I bought the product for.</li>
            <li> Oh my, I had such high hopes for this b/c</li>
            <li> other dry skin creams just layed on top of my skin and looked greasy, and/or actually made me break out.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to buy it if your skin is dry or you live in the dessert.</li>
            <li> I am only recommending this product for normal skin because that is what I have</li>
            <li> Very heavy on the moisture but not waxy like some of the organic, paraben- free products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I am waiting for my 3rd box of the cream, because I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the moisturizer spf 15 and this night cream they both smell a little funny but is a very soft scent.</li>
            <li> I really like the ingredients, some people aren&#x27;t sure about the adding of DMAE, but a co-worker who used to sell natural skin care products said that where it is listed, in the line of ingredients, which is half way down, means there&#x27;s not much of it in there.  </li>
            <li> The first time I applied this to my face, I noticed immediately the sharp, soapy fragrance.</li>
            <li> I had a major allergic/irritation response to the cream that caused the blisters.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear they are now marketing it primarily as something to reduce uneven skin tone, which was not clear to me from the product listing.</li>
            <li> I already used an Alba face moisturizer, but with the dry hot summer, it wasn&#x27;t enough to keep my face hydrated.</li>
            <li> I use the even advanced daily cream when it is hot and humid, but I use this night Cream all winter long as my face gets very dry and tight.</li>
            <li> This used to be the Sea Plus \\&quot;Renewal\\&quot; Cream, which was a general night cream to help with firmness, wrinkles, etc.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft and possible has improved</li>
            <li> I have gotten several compliments on my 60 year old complexion since I started using this.</li>
            <li> It totally makes my face feel and look moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve developed some stress acne, and they have left some unwelcome pigmentation.  </li>
            <li> I can barely see them.</li>
            <li> I work outside near the ocean</li>
            <li> so this product is definitely not recommended for skin types similar to mines (normal but acne prone).</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t worse, but isn&#x27;t better either, just didn&#x27;t work for me,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and creamy, leaves my face smooth, doesn&#x27;t cause irritation and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> Be very careful with this product and don&#x27;t take all the positive reviews without a grain of salt.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, and not a single breakout!</li>
            <li> This one meets all my requirements, goes on thick, absorbs quickly, and keeps my skin feeling soft and luscious.</li>
            <li> I naturally have very dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Wait til any serums you use to absorb first or it&#x27;ll rub it and itself off and make a snotty mess on your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad because the product has received such great reviews</li>
            <li> As indicated on the Alba website, people with mature skin should use this daily and younger people can use this as a night cream.</li>
            <li> After 45 years of using expensive moisturizers, I decided to start using natural and organic products that are much more affordable.  </li>
            <li> It has minimal scent, and it does a decent job at moisturizing.</li>
            <li> As I have stated on my other reviews with the other Alba Even Advanced face cream and cleansing wash that I have purchased and used, this is the first time I have used any other natural products since I have been previously using Origins and this product has done well in comparison to Origins</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been recently told by a care coordinator at a Wellness Center that I should join the 18-25 years old socialization group instead of the 26-55 years old group.</li>
            <li> and I wake up with plump, soft skin that lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> and I broke out the first few times I wore this.</li>
            <li> I was really let down.</li>
            <li> Product smelled to strong and was too irritating for my skin.</li>
            <li> i live in a very dry climate, and my skin was definitely looking &amp;</li>
            <li> When I first tried this in the summer, it felt a little too greasy and heavy to me, so I didn&#x27;t use it much.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry, red and acne prone skin</li>
            <li> It is super thick, and you only need a tiny bit of it.</li>
            <li> I have very dry sensitive</li>
            <li> You only need to use a little bit for your whole face.  </li>
            <li> Although j love the smell, I&#x27;m afraid to go near it for fear of breaking out.</li>
            <li> I wash my face with hot water and while it is still a little damp, I then apply this lotion on and it totally takes away any dry skin, flakes, and etc that I have.</li>
            <li> After 3 months of use, my scars are noticeably less visible and the spots have lightened considerably.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent hundreds on different night creams from La Mer to Chanel and back again</li>
            <li> If you have specific areas as crow feet that you need special attention, concentrate on those areas with your expensive product and leave the skin to Alba.  </li>
            <li> Too bad, the product itself is amazing, but smelling like someone poured a floral perfume on my face isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t take long for me to get use to it</li>
            <li> I like that it is natural, and it does not feel heavy.</li>
            <li> i use roughly a pea size amount each night, and that&#x27;s helped it last over 6 months since i&#x27;ve purchased it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the brightening aspect since I&#x27;ve been using these products for so long.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy when you apply and it absorbs well, and it keeps my skin feeling moist all night/day long.</li>
            <li> I would be a five star life long fan.</li>
            <li> I really liked this cream but it made me break out shortly after using it :(</li>
            <li> , it reminds me of vacations spent on the Gulf Coast, a sort of white sand mixed with seaweed smell that only a few can probably appreciate.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it due to &amp;#34;pros&amp;#34; listed above.  </li>
            <li> Also, this cream goes a long way - use sparingly!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll see how the other benefits pan out and report back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find a decent night cream that&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li> I believe that same, sharp fragrance is what caused my skin to dry out.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve only been using this a few days now, not really long enough to see any lightening of dark spots.</li>
            <li> But then, one night, I had it sitting on my counter, and was desperate for some moisture, so I slathered it on around my eyes and woke up with normal skin for the first time since probably October.</li>
            <li> smoothes/soothes dry spots without causing breakouts.</li>
            <li> It relieves all of my dry skin, and it smells so soothing.  </li>
            <li> MY SKIN IS OILY T-ZONE DRY FORHEAD &amp; CHEEKS</li>
            <li> Alot of products for sensitive/breakout skin leave my skin feeling dry but this one leaves it silky.</li>
            <li> I have dry flaky skin &amp; this fixes it.</li>
            <li> have dry skin</li>
            <li> I have DRY, ACNE PRONE, REDNESS</li>
            <li> I repurchased it a few months back and was taken back by how overly scented it is now.</li>
            <li> After two months of using Alba, I would recommend this product for anyone with normal skin in their late fifties and sixties (my age and my sisters) without hesitation...</li>
            <li> For me, I needed something a lot thicker than the average moisturizers and definitely something to put on at night.</li>
            <li> It has not only evened my complexion, it&#x27;s made the oily parts of my face WAY less oily, and moisturized the dry parts.</li>
            <li> Well, first off, I don&#x27;t need help with uneven skin tone, and second, I am just not that crazy about the new formula.</li>
            <li> However, I had to send this item back because it appeared to have been previously used before it was sent to me...</li>
            <li> I like it a lot having very dry skin</li>
            <li> Instead my skin becomes very dry after I just splash water on my face in the morning.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face, neck, and chest and it is not greasy on my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> My scars have faded away considerably, it is softer and less dried out.</li>
            <li> The only downside is the scent, which is a little too perfumey for my tastes.</li>
            <li> I have been using only this cream for the night for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I only have a few wrinkles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days)&lt;br</li>
            <li> especially this night cream does not make my face oily and heavy when I put it on before I go to bed</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few days and already in the morning</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavier than the day cream, which should be expected, and it does the job overnight.</li>
            <li> Going back to the green tea moisturizer</li>
            <li> not really what I want in a night</li>
            <li> I suffer from very dry skin in the winter, and using other lotions on my face always made me feel oily and break out.  </li>
            <li> but if you are not super dry, this is probably not the product for you.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy like other night creams I have used.</li>
            <li> (sorry for the shouting ;-))</li>
            <li> I use other alba products without problems</li>
            <li> : I purchased this cream after reading the other reviews from Amazon customers, and it did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> The smell on the other hand is repulsive.  </li>
            <li> This product stays on my face through the night, isnt&#x27; greasy-feeling and hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts, like some other overnight creams do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether it has actually evened my skintone or just improved the quality of my skin surface due to hydration.</li>
            <li> However, I am NOT a fan of the extremely soapy smell of this.</li>
            <li> now (jar is 3/4 empty) and it has not helped lighten my dark spots at all.</li>
            <li> I wish it was fruity, like other Alba products.</li>
            <li> All other creams cause me to break out, this one doesnt</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars because it is very heavily scented.</li>
            <li> After a few nights, my skin started to peel and dry up.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this product would fade some persistent dark spots left from acne, but it&#x27;s been a month already and so far it has failed to do what it promised.</li>
            <li> the air is very dry year round.</li>
            <li> Very thick and all natural.</li>
            <li> It is heavy, so a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really hard for me to find a deep moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make me breakout.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dull appearance overall.</li>
            <li> Since I just started I can&#x27;t comment if it helps dark spots or not yet.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this cream based on the reviews, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
            <li> I have dark skin.</li>
            <li> Dark circles around my eyes and patches of dark skin on my forehead.</li>
            <li> It helps break up the dark spots in my complexion and even out the skin appearance.  </li>
            <li> I use this every night, a sunscreen every day and my dark spots are just as dark as when I started.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend if you&#x27;re looking to get rid of dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and a lot of acne scars and dark spots all over my face.</li>
            <li> just right for all the cold dry air... using day and night, but figure in summer will be a little heavy for day cream...</li>
            <li> I stopped using all other products except for a daily facial scrub and an expensive product for crows feet around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> No more dry forehead,</li>
            <li> very moisterizing and very thin...</li>
            <li> I get little acne, but it did doesn&#x27;t cause the huge and painful pimples I used to get.</li>
            <li> Due to the oily-nature of my skin, heavily moisturizing products like this one push the balance of my skin over the edge into acne-land.</li>
            <li> This does less than the day cream</li>
            <li> my skin imperfections a bit and helps so that i look less puffy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thick, so I would recommend that you pat dry your face after you wash it</li>
            <li> I got this a little bit ago, and use it when my skin starts to look a little blah.</li>
            <li> A little dab in the evening</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even noticed a little darkness reduction under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Maybe I should down play this alittle, I don&#x27;t want them to raise the price!</li>
            <li> The pot is fairly small in size but because it is a heavy and thick cream, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have difficulties with uneven skin tone from acne scarring, and in the three months I&#x27;ve been using this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;It isn&#x27;t heavy</li>
            <li> so the water left behind can help spread the cream over your face.</li>
            <li> The skin performance results were nice, but the fragrance is OVERPOWERING and awful.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this everyday, as it is a bit heavy.  </li>
            <li> I used to get this a few years ago and then tried something else for a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about as pale and blotchy as when I started.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, the dry patches are still there, hence the minus 1 star.</li>
            <li> I got this product because my skin is super dry in the winter between the cold and the artificial heat.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and never wear lotion/cream because I am afraid I will break out.</li>
            <li> The consistency is a little thick with a sort of paste like texture</li>
            <li> prefer the day cream texture- a little too thick for my prefence.</li>
            <li> Makes me think of Mermaids with the green little jar and the sea plus renewal in it!!</li>
            <li> and I have no more breakouts.</li>
            <li> It is red, unsightly and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> In the end, I found myself breaking out with small bumps, and A LOT of blackheads.</li>
            <li> Was pretty disappointed in this....</li>
            <li> It caused me to have a wierd rash that I have never experienced with any other creme.  </li>
            <li> opened it to find it dried up and hard !</li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t have any saggy skin or anything; i was just looking for something to help with the random dry patches of skin that i have on my face (around my lips and eyebrows).</li>
            <li> My skin looks even and radiant in the morning after I use it, and I recommend it for people who have skin that tends to go dull on you every now and again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a hard time finding a night cream that kept my face moist overnight.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s hard to describe the smell, somewhat like a lake).</li>
            <li> I still use alba botanica body lotion cause if suits me amazing, but this product really disappointed me :(</li>
            <li> I initially bought this in the store, because I was desperate and needed anything to combat my combo skin.</li>
            <li> Some poeple commented on the smell honestly I never had a problem.</li>
            <li> I use it at night because it is a bit thick for daytime, but when I wake up, my face feels the smoothest it ever has.</li>
            <li> Thick and ineffectual.</li>
            <li> It has a thick, oily consistency and doesn&#x27;t work out too well on my combination skin.</li>
            <li> Thick and has some irritation with it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to work well on the face because it is just too thick like a butter almost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit thick</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a thick paste of sorts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too thick now for someone with oily skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is extremely moisturizing, but not to the point of making this skin feel like it is suffocating or greasy.</li>
            <li> my skin looks and feels, seriously like a baby</li>
            <li> Some people complain about the smell....which I think is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I have not broken out this bad since puberty!</li>
            <li> This cream is thick and soothing, and has never, ever broken me out.</li>
            <li> and I like the smell - hard to find a combo that you like and can use every day, but I&#x27;ve found it!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been getting that a lot lately!</li>
            <li> I am sad to say i am unable to use this product due to the scent.</li>
            <li> I reacted almosy instantly :(</li>
            <li> and this product does not irriate it in the least!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I had flaky, beyond dry skin across my brow bone and under my eyes at times, to the point where it was painful.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and made me break out.</li>
            <li> They were so bad that the doctor said if it didn&#x27;t heal it could go down to the cartilage which would ruin my nose.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear purfumes, and I do get a bit ill when around them, so</li>
            <li> Since some of its essence comes from the sea it does have a weird smell.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I had some weird dreams that night that my face was inside a guy&#x27;s armpit.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this was not a match made in heaven for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i am not so crazy about this cream.  </li>
            <li> I had been using Proactiv green tea moisturizer for years out of fear that I would break out horribly if I switched to anything else.</li>
            <li> I tried coconut oil, mango butter, Burt&#x27;s Bees eye cream, and nothing seemed to work without making it burn like crazy or make it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> It was really bad on my chin and bottom cheek area.</li>
            <li> 2 stars are because it isnt specifically bad</li>
            <li> and my skin went crazy!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend always remarks about it (so annoying).</li>
            <li> bad product !</li>
            <li> Bad!</li>
            <li> This night cream smells terrible and the fragrance lingers.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worst.</li>
            <li> but... my heavens the smell is terrible.  </li>
            <li> they could just fix that horrible smell</li>
            <li> I no longer have those awful age spots!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this night cream for about 1 month and I love it. It is heavy, so a little bit goes a long way. I use this right after I wash my face at night and in the morning, my face feels nice and soft. It is not greasy like other night creams I have used. I gave it four stars because the smell is somewhat strong, but it is not bad smelling and I broke out the first few times I wore this. But since then, I have had no problems.</li>
            <li> I swear by this cream. It is lovely for day or night in winter on the upper East Coast. This cream does not irritate or clog my skin that seems to love to break out with no warning or reason. I have been using only this cream for the night for a few years now. I hope Alba does not reformulate it or cancel its production...</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and have been using this for about 5 months now. I love how it makes my skin feel and it doesnt break me out. I also use a scrub pad gently with Burts cleanser but very gently. These 2 products seem to be working well. I have spent so much money on high profile products and these cheaper items are doing the trick. I recommend getting DMAE in your products and you will see a huge difference in your skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple weeks now and I already notice a huge difference. Old blemish marks have mostly faded and my skin is softer and well hydrated. All of Alba&#x27;s products in this line is very gentle to my acne prone skin. I use this over benzol peroxide cream at night and the Alba sea moisturizer over the benzol peroxide during the day and I have no more breakouts. Love it!</li>
            <li> So far I really like this cream.  It goes on easy, isn&#x27;t too sticky or gooey.  It keeps you moist, but you&#x27;ve absorbed it by the end of the night.  The smell is light and pleasant.  I only have a few wrinkles and they respond well to any moisturizer, so I can&#x27;t say for sure- I just know I like it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and never wear lotion/cream because I am afraid I will break out. Finally, I decided to try again and I ordered this cream. I wore it last night and I woke up and my skin didn&#x27;t break out and it feels very soft. I&#x27;m really happy I found this to keep my skin moisturized and clear. Since I just started I can&#x27;t comment if it helps dark spots or not yet. Also, this product came in good packaging and very quickly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this cream - I use it at night because it is a bit thick for daytime, but when I wake up, my face feels the smoothest it ever has. This stuff is amazing and I like the smell - hard to find a combo that you like and can use every day, but I&#x27;ve found it! I use the day cream too - love love love!</li>
            <li> Finally- a nice quality face cream without the chemicals that&#x27;s an affordable price.  Not greasy and seems to work well.</li>
            <li> Pros: even with my eczema-proned skin this didn&#x27;t cause any problems, no break-outs either, no greasy feeling, pleasant smell&lt;br /&gt;Cons: perhaps its problems with my skin cleansers, but this hasn&#x27;t helped to increase the overall moisture level of my skin (note: I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do feel that this product certainly can&#x27;t help and I feel like it&#x27;s important to put some sort of moisturizer on my skin at night.  I would recommend it due to &amp;#34;pros&amp;#34; listed above.  I feel like over time the &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; will work itself out.  I&#x27;m also going to switch over to the cleanser version of this product.  I use the scrub and have enjoyed that.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good price. Product smelled to strong and was too irritating for my skin. I really wanted this to work as I have other Alba products I love.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really speak to the benefits of this cream because I only used it once -- and the fragrance was so overpowering I couldn&#x27;t use it again. I may be more sensitive than other people about fragrance, but I always try to buy the fragrance-free products when I can. I really wanted to like this cream based on the reviews, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work out for me. If you are sensitive to fragrance, I would skip it!</li>
            <li> Okay, so I did JUST get this TODAY (sorry for the shouting ;-)) but I literally put it on here at work - just under my eyes and my skin feels incredibly soft and supple.  I&#x27;m 44 and while I like to think I look good for my age, other than my Mom telling me so, I can&#x27;t rely on that ;-) So, after reading all of the reviews I had to buy this and it&#x27;s only $10!  I really like the ingredients, some people aren&#x27;t sure about the adding of DMAE, but a co-worker who used to sell natural skin care products said that where it is listed, in the line of ingredients, which is half way down, means there&#x27;s not much of it in there.  DMAE was supposed to be good for your skin - first really brought to attention by Dr. Perricone, but it seems (just from what I was told) that after a period of time it can actually \\&quot;thin\\&quot; the skin.  But, hey, I&#x27;m willing to try this, next on my list is Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night, 1 Ounce - I went with Alba first bc it was cheaper and I loved the idea of sea stuff in it.  Oh and it smells SO nice, it has a very soothing scent, NOT too strong, but definitely there.  I&#x27;m excited to see if it makes a difference in skin tone - they say it takes 2 weeks but honestly? I&#x27;m content enough right now that it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;1. $10&lt;br /&gt;2. Feels amazing&lt;br /&gt;3. Has all natural (i think) ingredients&lt;br /&gt;4. Makes me think of Mermaids with the green little jar and the sea plus renewal in it!! ;-)</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Recently I have been switching to Alba products and all of the products I&#x27;ve tried so far, I&#x27;ve loved.     This night cream will leave your skin soft.  Like an infant&#x27;s newly washed booty.      It will lighten your spots.  Acne spots, sun spots, we ain&#x27;t  judging.    You only need to use a little bit for your whole face.  Like a full moon in the mother truckin sky, you only need a little bit to affect the whole mother truckin town.    If smells like an angel descended from heaven with it&#x27;s magical jar and with one sweep, gathered a field of freshly grown, exotic flowers and with one motion, scattered it all over your face.    If glitter had a smell, this is what it would smell like.      It will soak into your skin and the moment it does, you will hear a gospel choir singing your praises in the background.  You will swear you have heard Michael Jackson&#x27;s voice lost in the midst of the choir, but you will not truly know.  Don&#x27;t dwell on that.  Go to sleep, wake up in the morning, and place your hand on your freshly renewed, clean, spot free face.</li>
            <li> 1/3 off what my health food store charges--and exact same awesome product--that really DOES reduce age spots!</li>
            <li> I am 24 so i don&#x27;t have any saggy skin or anything; i was just looking for something to help with the random dry patches of skin that i have on my face (around my lips and eyebrows). i use this cream at night and it is very moisturizing and smells amazing. 2 ounces is also a lot. i feel like it will take me a year to use the whole thing. also, i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s due to this product or not, but i&#x27;ve been feeling really happy about my skin in general lately. you know that feeling you get when you look in the mirror and your face is just glowing? i&#x27;ve been getting that a lot lately! unfortunately, the dry patches are still there, hence the minus 1 star. but if you don&#x27;t have that problem, then this is a 5 star cream!</li>
            <li> I had to throw it out after 1 week.  It caused me to have a wierd rash that I have never experienced with any other creme.  I clearly have a sensitivity to a chemical in this.  I use other alba products without problems</li>
            <li> This product works very well on my skin which is ULTRA sensitive!  It has a wonderful smell and gives my dry skin lots of moisture!  I would highly recommend this product for anyone!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive. I wanted to like this product because of its natural ingredients and not tested on animals but the smell is way too strong - and as I mentioned in my subject line, my skin felt like it was burning as if there were alcohol in the product.</li>
            <li> I love the density of this cream, but the strong fragrance just makes me never want to use it. Its really overwhelmingly strong!!</li>
            <li> I bought this creme for the second time (from this seller and a different seller as well,) and both times I got the night cream instead of the regular sea plus renewal cream, which is what it says on the title and what is shown on the photo.  maybe it was discontinued or something, but DONT BUY THIS IF YOU&#x27;RE JUST LOOKING FOR A DAY CREAM because they will send you a night cream (which is a good product don&#x27;t get me wrong but not what you paid for!)</li>
            <li> ***April 2011 Update- I ordered my second container, and they&#x27;ve changed the product! It says \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; on the package, but I don&#x27;t like it as much. It&#x27;s thinner and the fragrance is stronger. I&#x27;m actually rather distressed to find out a product I really loved has been dramatically altered. It does absorb more quickly now, so if you&#x27;re in a humid climate that could be a plus. It does not moisturize as well, but it does not irritate my skin, so I&#x27;ll use it until I find something I like better.      (my original review based on purchase from February/March 2011): I purchased this cream after reading the other reviews from Amazon customers, and it did not disappoint. It took away the redness I&#x27;d been experiencing and my skin looked radiant while using it! When the bottle was empty, I tried another cream that was supposed to do the same thing, only better. It was three times more expensive and made my skin red and bumpy. Lesson learned- this is the only cream I&#x27;ll use! At this price, you can&#x27;t lose by trying it.     If it&#x27;s helpful, I live in Phoenix, so the air is very dry year round. This cream is very thick, perfect for an arid climate. I use it at night and a sunscreen with retinol in it for day. I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s. LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I love this nighttime moisturizer! It goes on so nicely and doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance like most products, which tends to bother my skin.  I bought this along with the daytime sea moss moisturizer with the SPF, together they fulfill my skins needs for the majority of the year.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, no greasy feeling. I don&#x27;t mine the smell at all, it makes me feel clean. I use the sea lipids too. Great price for such a little treasure.</li>
            <li> I have been using Alba&#x27;s Sea Plus night cream for about three months now, so I feel I can give a better time-tested review on this stuff. I have difficulties with uneven skin tone from acne scarring, and in the three months I&#x27;ve been using this product my skin tone has improved from a zero to a four on a one to ten scale. I recognize that damage takes time to heal and it is not entirely reversible, so I am happy with this result because I don&#x27;t expect one product to do all the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sea Plus skin cream is very moisturizing, and excellent as a night cream only - it is far too thick for daytime. I always wake up with baby soft skin in the morning after applying it at night, and my skin feels fresh and healthier since I began using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product and I will absolutely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> In the last month, I have had some issues with breakouts, leaving my skin area with blotchy scar tissue. It is red, unsightly and uncomfortable. What first caught my eye about Alba Sea Plus Advanced Skin Cream Renewal is that its complex of marine lipids, aloe vera and other great, natural ingredients aid in giving your skin a \\&quot;pick me up,\\&quot; smoothes out blotchiness and visibly improves your skin in two weeks. I have seen improvement in two days. My scars have faded away considerably, it is softer and less dried out. The smell is strong and smells like the sea, but is definitely a scent I can handle. I recommend that all people looking to wake up and brighten their skin try this fabulous product. I found it for only ten dollars. My understanding is that it can run upwards of fifteen dollars, and its ingredients are found in $100.00 cremes that promise the same results. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have dark skin. Dark circles around my eyes and patches of dark skin on my forehead. After using this stuff for two months, I have a clearer more youthful complexion. I&#x27;m 37 and I&#x27;ve been recently told by a care coordinator at a Wellness Center that I should join the 18-25 years old socialization group instead of the 26-55 years old group. I know products don&#x27;t work for every skin type, but this stuff worked for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve fallen completely in love with this moisturizer. It&#x27;s helped even out my skin tone so much I actually question whether or not I even need foundation anymore. I&#x27;m one of the few that actually love the scent as well, it reminds me of vacations spent on the Gulf Coast, a sort of white sand mixed with seaweed smell that only a few can probably appreciate. The consistency is a little thick with a sort of paste like texture but I don&#x27;t mind at all since it spreads on my face like silk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent hundreds on different night creams from La Mer to Chanel and back again but this is one takes the cake when it comes to results. Please don&#x27;t ever discontinue this, Alba!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now changed my review from 5 stars to 1. I repurchased it a few months back and was taken back by how overly scented it is now. The original scent of white sand beaches and sea salt is gone, it&#x27;s been replaced with an incredibly floral perfume that is very over powering. I do not know why they decided to change it&#x27;s scent to something so strong and nausea inducing but, they did. The scent is so strong it stings my eye and makes me sneeze. Too bad, the product itself is amazing, but smelling like someone poured a floral perfume on my face isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This cream is great&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t heavy&lt;br /&gt;Clears skin</li>
            <li> After a few nights, my skin started to peel and dry up. It was really bad on my chin and bottom cheek area. It took over a week for my skin to get better. The fragrance is strong and overwhelming. I have sensitive, mild acne-prone, oily, combo skin. Glad I was able to return it!</li>
            <li> I found this cream to leave a waxy feeling on my face. it moisturizes and it certainly adheres to the skin. i am not so crazy about this cream.  I dont notice any smell or irritation with this cream although others have mentioned it.&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer the jasmine scented Alba Hawaiian cream.</li>
            <li> After 45 years of using expensive moisturizers, I decided to start using natural and organic products that are much more affordable.  My skin is normal and when I asked my sister who is a naturalist for suggestions,  she recommended Alba Sea Plus Renewal Cream.  Her suggestion was to use it day and night which I did.  I stopped using all other products except for a daily facial scrub and an expensive product for crows feet around my eyes.  After two months of using Alba, I would recommend this product for anyone with normal skin in their late fifties and sixties (my age and my sisters) without hesitation...forget about the $60 products.  If you have specific areas as crow feet that you need special attention, concentrate on those areas with your expensive product and leave the skin to Alba.  I am only recommending this product for normal skin because that is what I have and this is a personal review.  Hope this helps you with a glowing complexion and an affordable product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry, red and acne prone skin so it&#x27;s really hard for me to find a deep moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make me breakout. I started using this at night and liked it so much that I use it in the morning as well and it&#x27;s perfect. Keeps my skin soft and possible has improved it&#x27;s dull appearance overall. Side note, I also discovered lemon juice as an astringent and the two combined are like magic for my skin. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Very prompt delivery.  Very fair price vs. what I pay for this product in local stores.  Product is a superior cream I have been using for years.</li>
            <li> I like how this product feels. I would put in on at night. I don&#x27;t necessarily see any anti aging help or anthing like that going on,so if that is what your looking for I would try elsewhere. Otherwise it is a nice nightime lotion.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best skin moisturizer I have ever used. I use it under organic bronzer in the am and my skin is still hydrated by bedtime. I have gotten several compliments on my 60 year old complexion since I started using this.I have used the top shelf from dept stores and they do not compare. Alba should really advertise this more...a lot of women have never heard of it...what a shame!</li>
            <li> I have used Alba products for years, but just tried this cream after reading some reviews.  This is truly a good buy and equivalent to those over $100 creams.... really saw some differences after just a few days... great winter cream and just right for all the cold dry air... using day and night, but figure in summer will be a little heavy for day cream... incredible price for such a great product!</li>
            <li> I really liked the way it makes my skin feel and I will buy the product again. I think it is a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> As indicated on the Alba website, people with mature skin should use this daily and younger people can use this as a night cream. I&#x27;m 21-years-old and I tried using this as my night cream however the cream is much too heavy and greasy for my liking. I have perfectly healthy skin but sometimes I do get acne so this product is definitely not recommended for skin types similar to mines (normal but acne prone). The Alba Sea Plus Renewal Cream does smell nice and is supposed to be hypoallergenic however 80% of the time I used this cream I suffered from a fragrance-related asthma allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> As I have stated on my other reviews with the other Alba Even Advanced face cream and cleansing wash that I have purchased and used, this is the first time I have used any other natural products since I have been previously using Origins and this product has done well in comparison to Origins especially this night cream does not make my face oily and heavy when I put it on before I go to bed and when I wake up my face is still moisturized.  So far I am very happy with this Alba Even Advanced Renewal Night Cream.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try out this product because of all the super emollient oils I saw listed in the ingredients. It seemed like a real bargain, given the price. I was really let down. The first time I applied this to my face, I noticed immediately the sharp, soapy fragrance. I believe that same, sharp fragrance is what caused my skin to dry out. Alba Botanica&#x27;s Aloe and Green Tea Oil Free moisturizer works better than this heavy creme at keeping my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> This does less than the day cream</li>
            <li> The creamy texture is ok with me since i have dry skin.  The smell on the other hand is repulsive.  It smells like a bar of soap that I smushed onto my face.  I keep feeling like maybe I should wash it off soon as I apply it because it smells so much like soap</li>
            <li> Thick and ineffectual.</li>
            <li> Very manly smell that lingers all day or night. Reminiscent of cheap after shave. The cream is moisturizing but that doesn&#x27;t make up for the strong odor. I love the Alba seaweed toner in this line.</li>
            <li> After reading these rave reviews I must be super sensitive. I thought Alba products, being all organic, would not have such a strong perfumy smell. I have used this now for over a week, and still can&#x27;t get used to the odor of it. I don&#x27;t wear purfumes, and I do get a bit ill when around them, so I guess this is not the cream for me. I wish they made it in a fragrance free version. I will say too, after using it a week, I don&#x27;t feel my skin is any better or softer, unlike most who rave about it&#x27;s benefits. I wish it worked that well for me, but I will be going back to the Avalon organic Vitamin C cream I was using. This was $5 less, and I love my Alba hand cream, so thought I&#x27;d love this as well. But the Avalon Vitamin C moisturizer seems to go on much lighter and does not have the fragrance issue.</li>
            <li> I got this over the summer, when I was working at a camp, outside 24/7 and covered in ocean water for most of that, too busy to reapply sunscreen as often as needed. I ordered a different type then this one (still Alba, just not the even advanced), but kept it because returning things was too much of a hassle (no access to a post office at camp...).&lt;br /&gt;It definitely gives you some moisture, and a little goes a looong ways, but it&#x27;s not so great if you are acne prone...&lt;br /&gt;I have cut back on how much I use it now that I spend more time in doors, and do think that I can notice an increase in acne when I have been using it more. but I ha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: don&#x27;t get this if you are acne prone.</li>
            <li> I am sad to say i am unable to use this product due to the scent. I reacted almosy instantly :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I swear by it.  My skin is aging really well.  A dermatologist told me years ago to make sure I moisturize well and this has been the product I use..  It goes on smooth and nongreasy and I think its great.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it regularly. However, I had to send this item back because it appeared to have been previously used before it was sent to me...yuck.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Hawaiian moisturizer, toner and face wash by Alba, but wanted a more moisturizing cream for the night.  This was perfect!  It totally makes my face feel and look moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> i love this rich cream. it makes my face feel smooth and luxurious, and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> It has a thick, oily consistency and doesn&#x27;t work out too well on my combination skin. It does do a good job of moisturizing in the winter when my skin gets dry but I use it sparingly. Since some of its essence comes from the sea it does have a weird smell. My boyfriend always remarks about it (so annoying).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thick, so I would recommend that you pat dry your face after you wash it so the water left behind can help spread the cream over your face. I like the smell. It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t smell like an old lady. No parabens and made in the USA. Just how I like it. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s silky, creamy smooth.  Not too heavy and not too light.  I put it on before my foundation and it acts as a line filler surprisingly.  And it&#x27;s cruelty free to boot!</li>
            <li> I got this a little bit ago, and use it when my skin starts to look a little blah. I love the smell, and I&#x27;m trying to keep my usage down to a minimum &#x27;cause I feel I wanna make it last. My skin looks even and radiant in the morning after I use it, and I recommend it for people who have skin that tends to go dull on you every now and again.</li>
            <li> Oh my, I had such high hopes for this b/c I love their Jasmin and Vitamin E cream. The skin performance results were nice, but the fragrance is OVERPOWERING and awful. To be fair, the Jasmin cream has a strong scent too. However, 1) it&#x27;s lovely, and 2) I can&#x27;t smell it after I&#x27;ve applied it. This night cream smells terrible and the fragrance lingers. It has just moved to the category of luxurious foot cream for me.</li>
            <li> I use this at night and it keeps my face moist throughout the night. The texture is silky and is absorbed well. Face is left with a nice dewy feel.</li>
            <li> Love this cream! It absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel like it does after a dip in the ocean!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 20s and this works amazing on acne scars. Also makes the skin super soft. I love it so much I recommend it to everyone with hyper pigmentation!</li>
            <li> Very sensitive, oily, acne prone skin. After several months of use, this didn&#x27;t irritate my skin (win!) but it also didn&#x27;t help improve my skin texture. I get little acne, but it did doesn&#x27;t cause the huge and painful pimples I used to get.</li>
            <li> This kind of product is usually catered to women. I was told by a friend of mine who is an estetician that the best way to keep looking good and young is to not touch your face to prevent germs, wash in the mornings and nights, and lastly moisturize really well every day. I have followed that for years now and I always get compliments on my skin and how young I look. This cream is the best I haves used so far.</li>
            <li> Be very careful with this product and don&#x27;t take all the positive reviews without a grain of salt.  I NEVER break out and had a hideous response to this cream which has given me a lifetime non curable dermatological condition.  Apparently, this product contains some fairly potent things that can be skin irritants (google Paula reviews).  I had a HUGE blister the size of a quarter appear on the bridge of my nose.  Several others showed up.  They were so bad that the doctor said if it didn&#x27;t heal it could go down to the cartilage which would ruin my nose.  Steroids and antibiotics did not work.  Then, my entire face broke out in what looked like cystic acne.  I&#x27;ve never had acne in my entire life. Found a great dermatologist who told me that 2 things had happened.  I had a major allergic/irritation response to the cream that caused the blisters.  That was the lighting of the match, so to speak.  The match then lit a wild fire, called rosacea.  You can only get this to go into remission and can&#x27;t cure it.  Any skin care product can potentially cause a reaction and so can all my favorite vices (coffee, soda, red wine, chocolate...)  It was a nightmare experience and I am going to seek some type of response from the company.</li>
            <li> Great night cream. Very creamy and gentle. I don&#x27;t go to bed without it.</li>
            <li> I liked it. Not crazy about it, though.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer ever! Didnt give me break outs. Im hooked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently discovered this Night Cream in my Rumspringa, and I cannot express to you the lust its created in my soul. For years I&#x27;ve struggled with my image, but this cream makes me feel beautiful! I don&#x27;t just love it, I want it more than life itself. I know it&#x27;s a sin to be using this computer right now, and maybe even more of a sin to have paid for it in sex, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be returning to my Amish past. Thank you, Alba Botanica, for liberating me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, this cream used to be five dollars, and now the price has gone up. That&#x27;s why I only put four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May God forgive me.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few days and already in the morning my skin is looking brighter and healthier. Not to mention it smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Alba products are definitely my favorite since the do not test on animals and are vegetarian :)</li>
            <li> I had been using Proactiv green tea moisturizer for years out of fear that I would break out horribly if I switched to anything else. It had really gotten to the point where it wasn&#x27;t even doing anything anymore for me though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had flaky, beyond dry skin across my brow bone and under my eyes at times, to the point where it was painful. I tried coconut oil, mango butter, Burt&#x27;s Bees eye cream, and nothing seemed to work without making it burn like crazy or make it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comes this lovely product. It is super thick, and you only need a tiny bit of it. I just touch the top of it and get enough for above my eyes, then do one more pat for my forehead and each cheek. I use it day and night and it is a miracle product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is extremely moisturizing, but not to the point of making this skin feel like it is suffocating or greasy. It really just feels balanced and soft and happy. I also use this on my neck where I have some stubborn eczema, and even with the strong fragrance in it, it doesn&#x27;t bother it and is actually the only thing that has worked on it, even beyond Cortizone-10 for eczema and my Eucerin cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the smell is something else. It smells kind of like men&#x27;s deodorant. I actually almost pitched it/gave it away after using it the first time... I had to wash it off my face because I couldn&#x27;t stand it. But then, one night, I had it sitting on my counter, and was desperate for some moisture, so I slathered it on around my eyes and woke up with normal skin for the first time since probably October. I have to admit I had some weird dreams that night that my face was inside a guy&#x27;s armpit. But now, I&#x27;m used to it. Just like any perfume you wear, you&#x27;ll get used to it and not even notice it after a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and not a single breakout! For this price, you have to give it a try!</li>
            <li> I like it very much. Amazon price is much cheaper than whole food. Highly recommended to buy it if your skin is dry or you live in the dessert.</li>
            <li> The cream feels really nice on my skin. But that smell is unbareable! It&#x27;s like a strong cologne, right before going to sleep. Who thought of that?</li>
            <li> great for my difficult combination skin. smoothes/soothes dry spots without causing breakouts. smells great! lasts around 5-7 months per jar.</li>
            <li> I loved the formula I bought maybe 2 years ago, this one is ok but not the same.  I have very dry sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2 stars are because it isnt specifically bad but it is no longer what I loved.  If I had never used it before it would have warranted 4 star rating, I am vegetarian and I think it used to specify vegan ingredients and it is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel great and look younger. Just wish it had purer ingredients.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t put my finger on it, but when i wake up in the morning I look much better if I have applied this stuff before bed.  I think it evens out my skin imperfections a bit and helps so that i look less puffy.  I use this along with the toner.  The toner clears up acne and this stuff doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> Best cream ever. I realized it&#x27;s really effects when people start telling how beautiful my skin was and wanting to know what I had done. After a year of using my skin changed drastically for better. I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars because it is very heavily scented. Surprisingly this thick cream does not make my super sensitive skin break out. It moisturizes well and works on sensitive skin. I can&#x27;t say much for it&#x27;s ability to even my skin tone... I&#x27;m about as pale and blotchy as when I started.</li>
            <li> I suffer from very dry skin in the winter, and using other lotions on my face always made me feel oily and break out.  The lotion is awesome.  It relieves all of my dry skin, and it smells so soothing.  I like to use this occassionally at night even during hot weather because it seems to plump up my skin the next day.  I wouldn&#x27;t use this everyday, as it is a bit heavy.  Also, this cream goes a long way - use sparingly!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else!  I have very sensitive skin and this works wonders.</li>
            <li> bad product ! opened it to find it dried up and hard !</li>
            <li> Feels great, smells great!  I use it every night and love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product - so rich nourishing to my skin!!!  Worth every penny!!!!  I would recommend this to use at note and during the day under ur SPF</li>
            <li> The first morning after I used this night cream, I was washing my face and thought, &amp;#34;Wow, my skin feels so soft.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m still not disappointed with it. My skin has softened and brightened, and I love it. It&#x27;s heavier than the day cream, which should be expected, and it does the job overnight. Love the fact it doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals (who needs more toxicity?). Keep up the good work, Alba.</li>
            <li> I have used this night cream for a couple of years.  It helps break up the dark spots in my complexion and even out the skin appearance.  I don&#x27;t care for the fragrance.  I like fragrance-free products, especially on my face.&lt;br /&gt;But I put up with the scent because of the efficiency of the cream.</li>
            <li> Great product! Makes skin so soft and full of moisture. Thank u!</li>
            <li> Great affordable night cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many different moisturizers, so, I can say that this is a great cream, leaves my skin soft, moist, and with great complexion BUT I can smell it too...THE ENTIRE NIGHT (until I wash it off in the morning).      I wish they had a fragrance free version instead of the strong \\&quot;urinal cake\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li> Not seeing anything very special about this product, but it is cruelty-free, which is important to me. It has minimal scent, and it does a decent job at moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I love this night cream.  It&#x27;s not heavy, smells fantastic yet not strong to keep me up or have my eyes water.  It feels great, penetrates fast, and I&#x27;m excited to see the results in 2 weeks as it&#x27;s supposed to even out your skin tone.  I&#x27;ve developed some stress acne, and they have left some unwelcome pigmentation.  I hope this will really help it out.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new night cream and decided to try this one thanks to the positive reviews. I am so glad I did. My skin looks and feels better. I love the thickness and the scent is perfect. I look forward to bedtime just so I can put it on. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> I am loving this night cream , very smooth, soft and gentle on my face and neck. Make my skin looks much younger  , I  buy my alba even advanced night cream at target for much more money than the price listed here, I am almost  through  with this jar, next time I will definitely repurchase  on amazon.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff, the price was better than I have seen anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week.  I stopped by a friend house today and he commented on my face, \\&quot; you look younger,  what have you been doing? \\&quot; I swear the only change is this stuff.  In love with this product!</li>
            <li> absorbs quickly, feels and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> this product caused a rather severe irritation on my face.</li>
            <li> I already used an Alba face moisturizer, but with the dry hot summer, it wasn&#x27;t enough to keep my face hydrated. I saw an immediate improvement with the renewal cream (I use it at night). I also love Alba because they are cruelty-free: NO animal testing!</li>
            <li> Goes on very nice and is not greasy, leaves my skin clearly hydrated and does not make me break out. I see a big difference in the way my skin feels and looks in the morning when I use it. However, the smell is just okay and takes a bit of getting used to.</li>
            <li> Ok so far but only 2 uses in. Wait til any serums you use to absorb first or it&#x27;ll rub it and itself off and make a snotty mess on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is reminiscent of 1970s men&#x27;s cologne &amp;#34;Canoe&amp;#34; by Dana (or &amp;#34;Ambush&amp;#34; by the same maker for women.) I would prefer it not on my face tho. It&#x27;s overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll write more if there&#x27;s more to say, good or bad, as time progresses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a hard time finding a night cream that kept my face moist overnight. So many say they do but this one really does. I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s all I will buy now.</li>
            <li> the scent is very strong to me. my previous creams were light to no scent so maybe i&#x27;m just not used to the traditional amount of scent.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s sticky/heavy which i suppose is waht you want in the evenings.</li>
            <li> Thick and has some irritation with it.</li>
            <li> This product stays on my face through the night, isnt&#x27; greasy-feeling and hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts, like some other overnight creams do. I&#x27;m not sure whether it has actually evened my skintone or just improved the quality of my skin surface due to hydration. But either way, I&#x27;ll take it!!</li>
            <li> Not a a bad cream per say, but I&#x27;ve ended up using it as a body cream. It doesn&#x27;t seem to work well on the face because it is just too thick like a butter almost. I have dry skin too, but it has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a night cream. Very heavy on the moisture but not waxy like some of the organic, paraben- free products I&#x27;ve tried.  I like it a lot having very dry skin but if you are not super dry, this is probably not the product for you.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer at night, it gives me moisture without that greasy feel, I use it at night after I cleanse with Alba AcneDote cleansers. I&#x27;m 47 and my skin is very sensitive, oily, and acne prone, but using these products helps me to keep the acne and oil under control while renewing my skin cells......... My skin is soft and smooth and my makeup looks great on. I use the Alba  Hawaiian Jasmine &amp; Vitamin E Moisture Cream during the day.......</li>
            <li> I ordered the moisturizer spf 15 and this night cream they both smell a little funny but is a very soft scent. I will update in about 2 weeks of using it.08/08/2011  UPDATE 08/23/2011 LOVE IT, LOVE IT. LOVE IT!  MY SKIN IS OILY T-ZONE DRY FORHEAD &amp; CHEEKS, I wash my face with dove and warm water, wait 10 min for my skin to dry, then I apply the cream, I do this in the morning(Using the day ceam I bough both) and before to bed (using the nigth cream at night) my skin looks and feels, seriously like a baby I couldn&#x27;t believe it until I try it, I had brown marks from old acne they are almost gone I can barely see them. 2 weeks of used and I already feel and see the diference. for the price is worth to try, I do recomend it! happy, happy skin :)</li>
            <li> When I first tried this in the summer, it felt a little too greasy and heavy to me, so I didn&#x27;t use it much. Now that cooler weather has set in and the air is drier, I love it and use it every night. It&#x27;s super moisturizing and keeps your skin from feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I see a dramatic difference in the dark spots on my skin after using this product for one month, but I can say it is a very good moisturizer. My skin gets very dry after I cleanse with a fragrance free, no sulfate gentle cleanser, and my face soaks this cream right up. I use it in the morning and at night and will continue for another month to see what happens then. If you are purchasing this in hopes to even-out your skin tone, I would give it a shot, but just be realistic. I have reordered another 2 ounce pot because it is good enough to try for another month, but I am now looking into Ecco Bella products. Good but not Great!</li>
            <li> Great night cream for the price!  I have very sensitive skin and this product does not irriate it in the least!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month. It hasn&#x27;t helped, hasn&#x27;t hurt. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a good dupe for La Mer. I&#x27;d call it a good dupe for Mary Kay...smell and all. Thankfully, I like Mary Kay and have a family who looks young and swears by it, so I am dealing with this face cream because I don&#x27;t like wasting something perfectly great. I was expecting a little more tightening or even-tone, but it just seems the same. I do wake up with really soft, if not a bit dewy/oily in a good way skin in the morning, so that is a plus.</li>
            <li> This is a great cream for dry skin. I  Highly recommend. Very thick and all natural. Takes some effort to absorb into skin.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed with this when I started using it first and I was raving about it to all my friends about how soft my skin felt and how awesome it smells. But now it&#x27;s sitting in my drawer in my bathroom, cause for the first time since teenage (I&#x27;m in my 20s) I broke out! Bad! Although j love the smell, I&#x27;m afraid to go near it for fear of breaking out. I stopped and tried it a few times just to make sure that was reason, and it was! Cause the second I stopped using it, my skin cleared out. I still use alba botanica body lotion cause if suits me amazing, but this product really disappointed me :(</li>
            <li> I have an oily T zone, very acne prone skin, it is also sensitive and is normal/dry everywhere where it is not oily. To find a product that doesn&#x27;t break me out is a feat. So far, I&#x27;ve tried: ProActiv, Neutrogena, Burt&#x27;s Bees, Clearasil, Biore, Lancome, Boscia, Shiseido, Murad, and others (too many to name). I have never found a moisturizing cream that actually does any benefit (i.e. moisturizes without leaving me with acne or a shiny forehead the next morning), but I kept trying. I decided to try the Even advanced by Alba, and oh my. I am waiting for my 3rd box of the cream, because I cannot live without it. It moisturizes, evens out my skin tone, clears my zits and makes my skin look GOOD. I don&#x27;t need to use corrective makeup when I use this cream and it manages my acne even at that \\&quot;special\\&quot; time of month when it&#x27;s at it&#x27;s worst. Really, for me - this is a miracle cream and a must have, as far as I&#x27;m concerned!</li>
            <li> I initially bought this in the store, because I was desperate and needed anything to combat my combo skin. I was amazed by the results! It has not only evened my complexion, it&#x27;s made the oily parts of my face WAY less oily, and moisturized the dry parts. I love it so much, I use it during the day as well as the night. Some people complain about the smell....which I think is ridiculous. It smells great, but I understand how some would consider the scent &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34;. I tried to switch to something else....and my skin went crazy! As soon as I switched back, it was happy again. It&#x27;s a great product for the price...try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> This product is my go to night cream. I like it because s for the most part is free of harmful types of ingredients Feels great and has a nice fragrance. I am an older woman and this product really keeps my skin soft and smooth. I reorder it often as needed.</li>
            <li> I have never been a night cream user before, but the reviews here enticed me. The smell is very pleasant in my opinion, and I can understand why people who really need the moisture rave about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, this is not the right moisturizer for my skin type. I have extremey oily, acne prone skin. This moisturizer is NOT non-comedogenic, and really clogged up my pores. I gave the product a very fair shot, I used it nightly and managed to make it through half of the jar. In the end, I found myself breaking out with small bumps, and A LOT of blackheads. Due to the oily-nature of my skin, heavily moisturizing products like this one push the balance of my skin over the edge into acne-land. Sadly, this was not a match made in heaven for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have given this product three stars to be fair, and honest. I imagine that this moisturizer would be great for people with dry to normal skin types in terms of oil-level. However, my personal experience would be closer to one star. I have not broken out this bad since puberty! (I am 25 now)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for several years. It feels great on my skin and doesn&#x27;t cause it to be oily. I feel like it does what it advertises. I have liked all of the Alba products that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know if I liked the smell of this product but it didn&#x27;t take long for me to get use to it (it&#x27;s hard to describe the smell, somewhat like a lake). Beyond that, this product works well. It is a good consistency so you can wear it during the hot summer months and the cold winter months and not feel like your pores are being clogged or you aren&#x27;t getting enough moisture on your skin. My skin does feel softer in the morning. I didn&#x27;t notice that this product evened out my skin tone but I did feel it provided a good amount of moisture without irritating my dry, sensitive skin, which is what I bought the product for.</li>
            <li> I tried this first time about a month ago.  It makes my 60-yr-old skin feel SO silky smooth.  It&#x27;s such a good price, too, I am going to continue with this one!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve only been using this a few days now, not really long enough to see any lightening of dark spots. I do like the consistency. However, I am NOT a fan of the extremely soapy smell of this. The fragrance is very strong. It hasn&#x27;t irritated my face yet, but I don&#x27;t like having this smell follow me around all night.&lt;br /&gt;Update: 6/2/15- So I&#x27;ve been using this every night for a while now (jar is 3/4 empty) and it has not helped lighten my dark spots at all. I use this every night, a sunscreen every day and my dark spots are just as dark as when I started. Did not work at all!&lt;br /&gt;Update: 7/4/15- Finished the jar and still no improvement in the discolorations on my face. Would not recommend if you&#x27;re looking to get rid of dark spots.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I use it in combination with amara organics vit. c serum.</li>
            <li> very moisterizing and very thin... it absorbs fast and non greasy i love this product for all this.. however, it is not as moisterizng over the night cimpared to other product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 38, and my skin drinks most lotion. With this, I actually see a decrease  in fine lines, and my skin feels great.  I would highly recommend this product.  Price is comparable to Vitamin Cottage, but the home delivery cannot be beat!</li>
            <li> Upon opening the product, I was a bit put off by the smell. It&#x27;s actually pleasant but a bit strong for a face cream and somewhat unusual. I decided to give it a try and was quite satisfied--not too light nor too heavy or greasy. I really like how my face feels in the morning. Great value at that price.</li>
            <li> HERE IS THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS CREAM.  I put it on and massaged it in. An hour later I came back to see how my face looked and rubbed it in some more. Skin started sluffing off my face like some really gentle exfolliation going on. I started seeing glowing flawless skin and I mean flawless. I am 58, do you know how hard it is to get flawless skin at 58.  THIS CREAM IS AMAZING.  I never say cream is amazing, trust me, I am a cream junkie, always searching for the one that makes me look 10 years younger. This cream, hmm, looking in the mirror right now, I would say 20 years younger! Wow, pretty incredible stuff, and that is after one use. Maybe I should down play this alittle, I don&#x27;t want them to raise the price!</li>
            <li> I like Alba products, and this night cream is fantastic.  I&#x27;ve used it for over a year, and it is great for nighttime skin hydration.  I like that it is natural, and it does not feel heavy.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cruelty free night cream. It leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit thick but I love it. The smell is a bit strong but it&#x27;s ok for night cream because I can just go to bed after I applied it to my face.</li>
            <li> I am using this night cream from last one week and I am not seeing any improvement in my skin tone or color as others have mentioned in their reviews. Instead my skin becomes very dry after I just splash water on my face in the morning. Also, I started getting tiny pimples on my face after I started using it. However, the box says to try for 2 weeks so I will continue using it and update after 1 week.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. Very moisturizing and feels great. Good ingredients.</li>
            <li> Wonderful feel &amp; fragrance. Used every drop!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrance -- do not buy this product!&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to love this night cream after reading all the positive reviews, but the scent is so powerful that I could not fall asleep after putting it on my face. I enjoy slight fragrances (I generally use Weleda face creams,) but this was just WAY too much. What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I was in search of a new, cruelty free night cream and came across this! I&#x27;ve never tried alba products before but so far I&#x27;m really impressed. The pot is fairly small in size but because it is a heavy and thick cream, a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and I think it&#x27;s made a difference in my hyper pigmentation. Overall I&#x27;ll definitely be repurchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that tends to dry out, so I needed a gentle but intense moisturizer for at night. This is great for that. It leaves your face feeling moisturized but not greasy, and I think it helps sensitive, dry skin like mine to look healthy. I&#x27;ve had great luck with other Alba products too.</li>
            <li> Good and my wife liked it. Ordered again the 2 pieces.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! It&#x27;s silky and immediately absorbs into my skin. It&#x27;s not too heavy or greasy and feels great day or night. The only downside is the scent, which is a little too perfumey for my tastes. I wish it was fruity, like other Alba products. Still, great product! I&#x27;ve made it part of my regular skincare regimen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an alba organics junkie... I use the whole line... This erases wrinkles without causing blocked pores! So nice. Use it.</li>
            <li> I would buy from this seller again, received quickly. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years now. I have sensitive skin and this works very well for moisturizing, smells nice and does not make me break out. Alot of products for sensitive/breakout skin leave my skin feeling dry but this one leaves it silky.</li>
            <li> Greasy! Just a bunch of oils that sits on top my dry AA skin. Love the alba moisture cream (aloe tea) but it is light.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! I have dry flaky skin &amp; this fixes it. Yay!</li>
            <li> i love everything from the smell to the feel of my skin from this. it is part of my nightly routine and i&#x27;m very happy with it. i use roughly a pea size amount each night, and that&#x27;s helped it last over 6 months since i&#x27;ve purchased it. will most definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Hydrates really well and really does even your skin tone</li>
            <li> I have been looking for natural and cruelty free products that work, and I&#x27;m happy to say that I don&#x27;t need to look any further.  I really like the Even Advanced line from Alba and I can honestly see a difference in my skin.  It smells nice too. No complaints here-good stuff!!</li>
            <li> I used to get this a few years ago and then tried something else for a while. This used to be the Sea Plus \\&quot;Renewal\\&quot; Cream, which was a general night cream to help with firmness, wrinkles, etc. It&#x27;s clear they are now marketing it primarily as something to reduce uneven skin tone, which was not clear to me from the product listing. Well, first off, I don&#x27;t need help with uneven skin tone, and second, I am just not that crazy about the new formula. The consistency is like cocoa butter or something...it&#x27;s a thick paste of sorts. I liked this better when it was a cream, not a butter. It&#x27;s just too thick now for someone with oily skin. Sigh. It&#x27;s so hard to find a decent night cream that&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li> Was pretty disappointed in this.... Did nothing for me. Didn&#x27;t like the feel of it either.</li>
            <li> I like the way this smells cheap and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy. I&#x27;ve bought other brands on amazon and this one I like best. By the way I&#x27;m a dude.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for about 2weeks. It has a pleasant soapy smell and makes my skin feel good. I was initially attracted to this brand because it&#x27;s cruelty-free and inexpensive. I was hoping it would fade my sun spots but so far they don&#x27;t appear any lighter to me.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and made me break out. I don&#x27;t like it. Besides the fact that it makes wrinkles disappear by damaging skin cells and filling them with DMAE. I threw the bottle away</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this line of products since 2005, and love them despite the recent reformulation.  I use the even advanced daily cream when it is hot and humid, but I use this night Cream all winter long as my face gets very dry and tight. I&#x27;ve always had good skin but people always comment that I look years younger than I actually am.  This cream is thick and soothing, and has never, ever broken me out. I use it on my face, neck, and chest and it is not greasy on my very dry skin. It just gets soaked up immediately!! I also love the smell.  I can&#x27;t comment on the brightening aspect since I&#x27;ve been using these products for so long. I love it,  and will continue to use these affordable products for as long as they are available.</li>
            <li> Love thia night cream, it leaves like a protectiver barrier aroiund my skin and it feels so soft in the morning when I wake up. Have been using it for a couple years now.</li>
            <li> I have used this Alba Advanced night cream for several years and I never want to run out.&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin and I feel that this is the best cream for nightly use.  I also use it during the day, especially in the winter months.  It isn&#x27;t greasy when you apply and it absorbs well, and it keeps my skin feeling moist all night/day long.</li>
            <li> most night creams are too heavy or have a bad smell, but this one is awesome. I was hooked from day one and this is now part of my nightly beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I really liked this cream but it made me break out shortly after using it :( threw it out. Going back to the green tea moisturizer</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this product would fade some persistent dark spots left from acne, but it&#x27;s been a month already and so far it has failed to do what it promised. Its consistency is a bit too thick for me, but the scent is okay. It makes my face a bit oily in the morning but not too unbearable. My skin isn&#x27;t worse, but isn&#x27;t better either, just didn&#x27;t work for me,</li>
            <li> prefer the day cream texture- a little too thick for my prefence.</li>
            <li> This stuff is kind of amazing. A little dab in the evening and I wake up with plump, soft skin that lasts all day long. No more dry forehead, and it&#x27;s even minimized my breakouts. My boyfriend has told me on multiple occasions (particularly when I&#x27;m not wearing makeup) how great my skin looks. Totally attribute that in large part to moisturizing religiously with this awesome cream. (And if a guy is actually noticing results, you know they&#x27;ve gotta be real!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a note, you can use this stuff pretty sparingly - I&#x27;m not quite done with my first little tub and I&#x27;ve had it just over six months using it pretty much every night.</li>
            <li> I have only recently started using night moisturizers and did a ton of research on the best alternatives.  This one meets all my requirements, goes on thick, absorbs quickly, and keeps my skin feeling soft and luscious.</li>
            <li> Love it , works well and great smell</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  I have very dry skin and this makes my skin really soft</li>
            <li> Love this night cream.  I work outside near the ocean (lots of sun and wind), and this is a very nourishing cream without feeling too heavy.  Smells good too!</li>
            <li> I have DRY, ACNE PRONE, REDNESS skin!&lt;br /&gt;This is my go to night cream for when winter comes rolling in with revenge!</li>
            <li> Awesome product for my sensitive and very dry winter skin... Soak it up before putting on my foundation everyday!</li>
            <li> I honestly love this cream. It has sea algea, and is very hydrating for someone who is 35 or older. Really want to purchase&lt;br /&gt;more when I have a chance. The cream reminds me of a affordable dupe of the La Mer Cream. Some poeple commented on the smell honestly I never had a problem. I cannot wear any sort of perfume due to being sensitive of smells as well, so I was concered when I read comments that the smell was strong.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Sensitive to smells and this smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> All other creams cause me to break out, this one doesnt</li>
            <li> I naturally have very dry, sensitive skin. For me, I needed something a lot thicker than the average moisturizers and definitely something to put on at night. This product is everything and more !! It is very thick and goes on beautifully. I wash my face with hot water and while it is still a little damp, I then apply this lotion on and it totally takes away any dry skin, flakes, and etc that I have. I am so glad I finally found something that works !! I recommend for anybody with my skin conditions.</li>
            <li> I really like the &#x27;sea&#x27; line of Alba products, but this night cream is a quite a bit heavier than what I normally use - Neutrogena&#x27;s Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration Night.  I will try it for a while, for the &#x27;even&#x27; effect, to see how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other &#x27;sea&#x27; products have a mild &#x27;beachy&#x27; smell that&#x27;s much more subtle.  This cream is over-scented, in my opinion.  It&#x27;s not offensive, but it&#x27;s like putting perfume/cologne on your face before bed - not really what I want in a night cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll see how the other benefits pan out and report back.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing!!!! I just turned 30 and have been using this product for about 3 months. I have acne prone skin and a lot of acne scars and dark spots all over my face. After 3 months of use, my scars are noticeably less visible and the spots have lightened considerably. I have used so many products over the years but this is the only one that gave me results. Definitely worth the try.</li>
            <li> Received in a timely fashion and does a good job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Only product I will use.  No break out, natural ingredients...love it, love it!  Can&#x27;t believe what I get for the price!</li>
            <li> i live in a very dry climate, and my skin was definitely looking &amp;#34;old lady-ish&amp;#34;. other dry skin creams just layed on top of my skin and looked greasy, and/or actually made me break out. this cream absorbs well, does not make me break out, and seems to have improved both the texture and glow of my skin. highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;p.s. even though i am 60, my skin doesn&#x27;t look it!</li>
            <li> I bought this at whole foods I think, not Amazon.  Amazon&#x27;s price looks much better as an add-on item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works but... my heavens the smell is terrible.  An intense, cheap, perfume-soapy smell that is just repellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it didn&#x27;t work so well I probably would have thrown it out, or used it up on my feet or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it works.  My aging, dry, red, combination, super sensitive skin looks much better after only a week or so of using it.  Despite the summer hot humid weather I have not broken out from it yet.  A little goes a long way.  Skin seems smoother and plumper and my redness has evened out a bit.  The result is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they could just fix that horrible smell I would be a five star life long fan.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and have used it for a couple of years.  It is light, easily absorbed, and really helps my dry skin.  In fact, I also use it as a day cream during the winter months.  It absorbs so well I don&#x27;t have an issue putting my makeup over it.</li>
            <li> didnt improve my aging skin</li>
            <li> I like the texture of this product but the fragrance overwhelmed me. I tend to be sensitive to \\&quot;commercial\\&quot; fragrances and find them repugnant. Essential oils don&#x27;t bother me a bit. This product reeks of \\&quot;commercial\\&quot; fragrance. It lingered all night and actually kept me from sleeping soundly. I realize that sounds bizarre, but I kept wanting to wake up and wash it off my face and couldn&#x27;t rouse myself to leave a warm bed for a cold bathroom. Consequently, my sleep was compromised. I can still smell the fragrance in my hair and even on my pillow! It&#x27;s too bad because the product has received such great reviews and I was looking forward to using it. If you tend to be similarly sensitized to odors/fragrances, be forewarned.</li>
            <li> I got this product because my skin is super dry in the winter between the cold and the artificial heat.  I use it at night only since it is kind of thick.  I am not someone who is big on strong fragrances in lotion, though this has a pretty strong one, it was not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this cream at whole foods ( natural food market), and loved it.  it&#x27;s a great moisturizer , a little goes a long way.  purchased it her on amazon this time around because the price in unbeatable.  Def would recommend this item to anyone anyone looking for a quality item with out the expense.</li>
            <li> Love this! its very rich and creamy not greasy at all. Just what i needed.</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference in skin complexion, This is my second order and I will continue to keep buying! I no longer have those awful age spots! I t not only balances your skin tone but it feels good and smell is pleasant. Someone always seems to tell me you smell good</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s thick and creamy, leaves my face smooth, doesn&#x27;t cause irritation and isn&#x27;t greasy. It&#x27;s deeply moisturizing, perfect for night. I&#x27;ve even noticed a little darkness reduction under my eyes. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Is very thick compared to night creams I&#x27;ve used in the past, but overall is a wonderful night cream. I wake up with soft amazing skin each morning :) smells great like fresh daffodils.</li>
