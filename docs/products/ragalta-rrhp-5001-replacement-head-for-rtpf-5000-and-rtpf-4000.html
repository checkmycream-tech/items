            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>Good luck on all your guys.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very interesting design.</li>
            <li>Great service, very friendly and quick to reply to my e-mails as well.</li>
            <li>But I love this shaver.</li>
            <li>Really looked forward to this shaver, seemed a great price for a shaver.  </li>
            <li>I give it a 1 because it cant be used more than 3 times without being charged and no customer support.</li>
            <li>Make sure to advertise the product correctly.</li>
            <li>I bougth this one for me, why spend $200 for a shaver with less attachments, I am so happy I bougth 2 more, one for my father and one for my brother, all are happy with their shaver.  </li>
            <li>looks great, but bought it brand new, says its charged, and</li>
            <li>So, if you dont have any problems with it, then you should be fine.</li>
            <li>I contacted Ragalta, the company that makes the shaver, and they happily replaced the entire 5-bladed head for me free of charge.</li>
            <li>Advanced Design.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very worth product.</li>
            <li>The instructions about the product and how to clean it are for the pits.  </li>
            <li>The picture shows the full razor set yet</li>
            <li>but not bad for the money.  </li>
            <li>This is just the replacement head for an extraordinary amount of money.  </li>
            <li>The heads are small; real easy, and quick to clean.</li>
            <li>Yes it is cheaper but not worth it when it doesn&#x27;t provide a good shave.</li>
            <li>5 heads is a plus, and even though the ear and nose trimmer is included; I never used one before, and it&#x27;s not scary, or hurts, at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Really doesn&#x27;t shave; just kind of runs over the hair and leaves most of it behind.  </li>
            <li>First the shaver does not charge..brand new, right out of the box  - it won&#x27;t charge.</li>
            <li>the fine print says it&#x27;s a replacement head not the actual shaver and get this...they won&#x27;t sell the shaver anymore because it&#x27;s &amp;</li>
            <li>Although this shaver was cheap, still it broke after only 5 months!</li>
            <li>I am very disapointed that when I opened the shaver head I found a bunch of hair in it.  </li>
            <li>The shaver does a decent job.  </li>
            <li>I do spend a little more time than I would like going back over hair</li>
            <li>I like the close shave, the way the heads will get under the nose - around the chin, but plan to take a little more time cleaning than I was use to with other shavers.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on this shaver; spend a little more for brand and quality.</li>
            <li>Was kind of skeptical, because reviews were sort of mixed.</li>
            <li>The first 2 times I received the shaver completely dead and would not take a charge.</li>
            <li>the batter runs down very rapid...</li>
            <li>Shaves close, and with a whole lot less, repititions.</li>
            <li>If you are going to sell an open box product (which I only found out just now that is what this company sells) at least clean out the hair or replace the head on the razor.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> The shaver does a decent job.  I do spend a little more time than I would like going back over hair it missed the 1st , 2nd, or even 3rd time.  but not bad for the money.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I bougth this one for me, why spend $200 for a shaver with less attachments, I am so happy I bougth 2 more, one for my father and one for my brother, all are happy with their shaver.  Great value!!!!!</li>
            <li> The shaver works wonderfully. Although I haven&#x27;t tried the nose/ear trimmer yet. I actually had a defective center piece on the 5-bladed head. I contacted Ragalta, the company that makes the shaver, and they happily replaced the entire 5-bladed head for me free of charge. Great service, very friendly and quick to reply to my e-mails as well. Great Product, great service, and great price (i got it on sale).</li>
            <li> Was kind of skeptical, because reviews were sort of mixed. But I love this shaver. The heads are small; real easy, and quick to clean. Shaves close, and with a whole lot less, repititions. 5 heads is a plus, and even though the ear and nose trimmer is included; I never used one before, and it&#x27;s not scary, or hurts, at all.&lt;br /&gt;I can say, I don&#x27;t have to try another shaver brand; in my lifetime. If I have to buy another; it will be from these guys. Hope I can remember their name. Back to the cleaning... If you use water, 4 seconds. A brush, 10-14 seconds. Nothing detaches, except for the center head. But once you figure how to twist it off, it&#x27;s a snap.</li>
            <li> Advanced Design. Great packaging. Good quality. It&#x27;s a very worth product. Good luck on all your guys. It&#x27;s a very interesting design.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my husband on Groupon and he was VERY disappointed in it. Yes it is cheaper but not worth it when it doesn&#x27;t provide a good shave. The closeness wasn&#x27;t there and it just seemed like it didn&#x27;t grab all the hairs. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this shaver; spend a little more for brand and quality.</li>
            <li> Really looked forward to this shaver, seemed a great price for a shaver.  Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t merit the anticipation.  Really doesn&#x27;t shave; just kind of runs over the hair and leaves most of it behind.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> The product is what I wanted and hoped for.  The instructions about the product and how to clean it are for the pits.  How to get the center cutter out is almost non-existant.  I like the close shave, the way the heads will get under the nose - around the chin, but plan to take a little more time cleaning than I was use to with other shavers.  By buying it here I saved on cost and shipping expensives looking at others and getting a flyer from another source whose S&amp;H was double Amizon.</li>
            <li> Although this shaver was cheap, still it broke after only 5 months! I wouldn&#x27;t buy another. Replacement blades are hard to come by.</li>
            <li> This is just the replacement head for an extraordinary amount of money.  The razor and accessories were not included.  I now see this same complaint posted 5 months ago.  Nothing has been changed to correct this item display.</li>
            <li> The battery went bad after 4 months. I have attemted multiple times to contact them. Customer support does not return emails...So, if you dont have any problems with it, then you should be fine. I give it a 1 because it cant be used more than 3 times without being charged and no customer support. I wont support a company that wont back up its product.</li>
            <li> looks great, but bought it brand new, says its charged, and when you go to turn it on it buzzes for about 4 seconds and tells you to plug it in. Plug it in and still won&#x27;t turn on. Don&#x27;t know if mine was defective, but why take the risk if your odds are 50/50 that it will be? What a waste of time.</li>
            <li> The picture shows the full razor set yet I only got the tip of the razor. Make sure to advertise the product correctly. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The shaver seems like a great product.  I am very disapointed that when I opened the shaver head I found a bunch of hair in it.  If you are going to sell an open box product (which I only found out just now that is what this company sells) at least clean out the hair or replace the head on the razor.  Now I have to go spend another $12 to replace the head.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shaver 4 times. The first 2 times I received the shaver completely dead and would not take a charge. The last 2 times I received the replacement head only and not the shaver.</li>
            <li> The battery is a joke... looses its charge without notice I had this product for less than three months with very little use and the batter runs down very rapid...</li>
            <li> DO NOT buy this product!!!! First the shaver does not charge..brand new, right out of the box  - it won&#x27;t charge. Then I try to buy a replacement for just the shaver and they send me just a replacement head. The picture shows a shaver, the description mentions a shaver but they just send you just the head. I returned it twice until one of the reps told me the fine print says it&#x27;s a replacement head not the actual shaver and get this...they won&#x27;t sell the shaver anymore because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;under review&amp;#34;! Code for what I already knew...it&#x27;s a piece of junk and should not be sold! Shame on you Amazon for selling such a bad product.</li>
            <li> It is fraud. Name of the product is Ragalta RTPF-4000 Shaver . Picture shows shaver. Reviews are about shaver. I got shaver cartridge!</li>
            <li> Very quick shipment and an awesome quality of the item! I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Wouldnt charge or keep a charge. It is crap</li>
    </ol>
