    <ol>
            <li>Impressed.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Happy to find it.</li>
            <li>This mascara stays put without flaking or melting, and it does a great job of volumizing my puny lashes.</li>
            <li>Save your money and try this mascara, you&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
            <li>Purchased this on Amazon because the price was good</li>
            <li>love it , eyelashes are flawless :)</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with Mary Kay Mascara.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara - great seller.</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>ladies this is my favorite mascara EVERRRRRRRRRRRR!</li>
            <li>I love this mascara!</li>
            <li>Seriously, amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent mascara I would recommend to anyone wanting to update their mascara; getting ready to order another one.</li>
            <li>I bought this after getting a sample because I thought the sample was good, for some reason this full version isnt as good as the sample I had.</li>
            <li>You dont need much to bring out your beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re cool with paying that much for a month of excellent wear (I wear it every day for work), then this is the mascara for you!!</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>the Lash Love mascara stays put with no flaking.  </li>
            <li>It is my favorite mascara</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t bring myself to pay $25 for the high-end department store brands, but I&#x27;ve tried MK Lash Love and also their waterproof.  </li>
            <li>We both love it because it makes our lashes fuller and longer...</li>
            <li>I love this mascara...</li>
            <li>Normally love it.</li>
            <li>I received this brand of mascara as a sample from another mail order purchase and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>it easily coats my lashes, and makes them look fuller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price for this product.  </li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly.</li>
            <li>Had to buy a cheap one to get by.</li>
            <li>I rate it one to two stars at best and would only use it if I had no other mascara to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great product that I will say compares to Lancome Defincils at half the cost.</li>
            <li>Will be buying again, finally have my favorite mascara again!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s up there along the lines of the &#x27;so over rated Maybelline Great Lash&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;- another one that&#x27;s wet and spikey - who wants that on your lashes?</li>
            <li>Worth every cent</li>
            <li>True product, fast shiping!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure there are any mascaras that stay in place perfectly all day, especially if you have foundation on under your eyes</li>
            <li>but I would say Lash Love is a cut above drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>I tried the new Lash Lengthening formula - had used the old formula for several years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I like the formula in general - not clumpy or fiber-y, smooth.  </li>
            <li>First swipe coats lashes well, but doesn&#x27;t really bring out the volume promised.  </li>
            <li>Easy to remove with regular face wash.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes super long and beautiful, not clumpy and overly thick and unnatural looking.  </li>
            <li>ask for better and the price is very reasonable compared to Diorshow which melts down your face after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>Instead of a spiral bristle style, they&#x27;ve gone with wider spaced silicone-like &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; that allow too much product to glob up on the brush.  </li>
            <li>The style of the brush and the inadequate removal of excess product led to a very spiked, globby application and a lot of clean-up on my lids and under eye area.  </li>
            <li>I had to remove around 75% of the mascara from the wand with a tissue before applying to get a reasonable result.  </li>
            <li>It is my holy grail of mascaras and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Mascara is very &amp;#34;clumpy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried CoverGirl Lash Blast, Shiseido (loved that one but so expensive), Clinique, Maybelline, Lancome HD (liked it but not the wand), and a bunch of other mascaras that I probably forgot about.</li>
            <li>My lashes look long and full with no clumping.  </li>
            <li>I despise the new brush style.  </li>
            <li>And to the other reviewer who thinks others were paid to write reviews -- I&#x27;m definitely not one of them, I just love this mascara and thought it deserved a 5-star rating.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is an old tube.</li>
            <li>This is better than others I&#x27;ve tried, but not better than the Ultimate.  </li>
            <li>Obviously don&#x27;t put on too much at once and let it dry first before you open your eyes all the way.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take unusually long to dry - dries quickly.</li>
            <li>This one has got to be my favorite, which is totally random, because Mary Kay products aren&#x27;t really up my alley.</li>
            <li>After a hard day at a very humid, hot job</li>
            <li>No regrets.  </li>

            <li> The waterproof is very difficult to get off even with remover, but Lash Love is also very durable but by the end of the day there are little black particles under my eyes.  </li>

            <li> But this tube is hard to use.</li>
            <li> but alas, I now think these reviewers must be getting paid to endorse this</li>

    <ol>
            <li> ordered black and received brown!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with Mary Kay Mascara. It goes on so smoothly. You dont need much to bring out your beautiful lashes. Great product.</li>
            <li> Love it!  No regrets.  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing the MK Ultimate Mascara for about 8 years now and have not found a mascara that compares.  This is better than others I&#x27;ve tried, but not better than the Ultimate.  First swipe coats lashes well, but doesn&#x27;t really bring out the volume promised.  It leaves lashes slightly separated for me.</li>
            <li> I tried the new Lash Lengthening formula - had used the old formula for several years and loved it.  Hated the new, so decided to try the new Lash Love formula.  I like the formula in general - not clumpy or fiber-y, smooth.  I despise the new brush style.  Instead of a spiral bristle style, they&#x27;ve gone with wider spaced silicone-like &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; that allow too much product to glob up on the brush.  The container opening is too big to remove excess mascara from the wand, especially the last 1/3 of the brush.  The style of the brush and the inadequate removal of excess product led to a very spiked, globby application and a lot of clean-up on my lids and under eye area.  I had to remove around 75% of the mascara from the wand with a tissue before applying to get a reasonable result.  What a waste!  I will not be ordering Mary Kay mascara until they improve their wand design.</li>
            <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t leave &amp;#34;strings&amp;#34; of mascara on the lashes like some I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  It&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Was looking forward to this mascara but alas, I now think these reviewers must be getting paid to endorse this&lt;br /&gt;product.  It does not provide any volume, it&#x27;s wet and spikey (I hate spikey)and I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price for this product.  I rate it one to two stars at best and would only use it if I had no other mascara to use.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s up there along the lines of the &#x27;so over rated Maybelline Great Lash&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;- another one that&#x27;s wet and spikey - who wants that on your lashes?</li>
            <li> This is a great product that I will say compares to Lancome Defincils at half the cost. It does not flake and it stays on even when sweating while working out. Worth every cent</li>
            <li> ladies this is my favorite mascara EVERRRRRRRRRRRR! It makes my lashes super long and beautiful, not clumpy and overly thick and unnatural looking.  Seriously, amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> It is my holy grail of mascaras and is reasonably priced.  My lashes look long and full with no clumping.  After a hard day at a very humid, hot job the Lash Love mascara stays put with no flaking.  It is my favorite mascara and I recommend it all of my friends.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t bring myself to pay $25 for the high-end department store brands, but I&#x27;ve tried MK Lash Love and also their waterproof.  The waterproof is very difficult to get off even with remover, but Lash Love is also very durable but by the end of the day there are little black particles under my eyes.

            <li> love it , eyelashes are flawless :)</li>
            <li> I bought this after getting a sample because I thought the sample was good, for some reason this full version isnt as good as the sample I had. It does nothing for my lashes, I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I&#x27;ve tried CoverGirl Lash Blast, Shiseido (loved that one but so expensive), Clinique, Maybelline, Lancome HD (liked it but not the wand), and a bunch of other mascaras that I probably forgot about. This one has got to be my favorite, which is totally random, because Mary Kay products aren&#x27;t really up my alley. I got this as a gift from my BF&#x27;s cousin who sells Mary Kay stuff, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything when I tried it. Flash forward a year later, and this is my go-to mascara everyday. I will definitely repurchase this! My 13-year-old sister even steals this from me even though I have a ton of other mascaras. We both love it because it makes our lashes fuller and longer...everyone always asks me if I&#x27;m wearing falsies! And to the other reviewer who thinks others were paid to write reviews -- I&#x27;m definitely not one of them, I just love this mascara and thought it deserved a 5-star rating. I can understand why she would think that this mascara leaves your lashes \\&quot;wet and spiky\\&quot; but what mascara doesn&#x27;t? If you want thicker, dramatic lashes this mascara is for you. Obviously don&#x27;t put on too much at once and let it dry first before you open your eyes all the way. It doesn&#x27;t take unusually long to dry - dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara...it easily coats my lashes, and makes them look fuller. However, after about a month of using it, it starts to flake. If you&#x27;re cool with paying that much for a month of excellent wear (I wear it every day for work), then this is the mascara for you!!</li>
            <li> Mascara is very &amp;#34;clumpy&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t know if it is an old tube. Normally love it. But this tube is hard to use. Had to buy a cheap one to get by.</li>
            <li> I like it and use almost 7 years</li>
            <li> Order came in within 5 days . Impressed.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara - great seller.</li>
            <li> True product, fast shiping! Will be buying again, finally have my favorite mascara again!</li>
            <li> I received this brand of mascara as a sample from another mail order purchase and fell in love with it.  It makes my lashes long and thick, and it stays put, but isn&#x27;t difficult to remove.  Purchased this on Amazon because the price was good and I don&#x27;t have a Mary Kay consultant.  Happy to find it.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent mascara I would recommend to anyone wanting to update their mascara; getting ready to order another one.</li>
            <li> This mascara stays put without flaking or melting, and it does a great job of volumizing my puny lashes. Easy to remove with regular face wash.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t ask for better and the price is very reasonable compared to Diorshow which melts down your face after a couple of hours. Save your money and try this mascara, you&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
            <li> PORQUE EL PRODUCTO NUNCa me llego y no recibí mi dinero, continuo a la espera de mi devolucion. o del producto o del din ero.</li>
