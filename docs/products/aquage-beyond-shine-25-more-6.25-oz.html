            <li>It leaves your hair soft and very healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>Aquage is the best stuff for my hair, but it is pretty hard to find in beauty salons,  once you like a product, then they tend to get rid of it or you can&#x27;t find it in the salons</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other spray shine/heat protectant products and most others weigh my hair down and/or leave it looking greasy instead of shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I have healthy hair, tends to be a little oily, this product did not work for me.</li>
            <li>I have some fine some coarse hair, medium thickness, little to no wave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is expensive but good value because it last about 20 times use&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lite and silk not wet like pump protectors, holds the straight silky look for a few days</li>

            <li> I love Aquage Beyond shine.  It makes your hair silky smooth &amp; protects the hair from the use of the flat iron.</li>
            <li> Greatest shine spray I have ever used.  It leaves your hair soft and very healthy looking.  I just wish it was available in local salons.</li>
            <li> Aquage Beyond Shine spray was initially introduced to me in 2002 by my Hairdresser. She would spray it on the section of hair she was going to flat iron to make it shine. I now use it after I am through with the flat iron because I use thermo protectant spray before straightening, but this spray works wonders either way. i have frizzy wavy hair that I sometimes curl into ringlets with a curling iron. After I am through curling I spray Beyond Shine on and like magic my curls are shiny and perfect. I love love love this spray and recommend it to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> Aquage is the best stuff for my hair, but it is pretty hard to find in beauty salons,  once you like a product, then they tend to get rid of it or you can&#x27;t find it in the salons like i said previously.</li>

            <li> Lightweight, fresh light scent, and really protects hair from blow dryer and flat iron heat.  I&#x27;ve been using Beyond Shine by Aquage for over five years.  I even have it in travel sizes so I don&#x27;t have to forgo it while I&#x27;m away from home.  I&#x27;ve tried other spray shine/heat protectant products and most others weigh my hair down and/or leave it looking greasy instead of shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> Never had a hair product like this one. It is wonderful ! My hair looks shine and not greasy. I love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have healthy hair, tends to be a little oily, this product did not work for me. I have some fine some coarse hair, medium thickness, little to no wave. No hair color. Will never purchase again. Expensive and gross.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. My stylist started using this on my hair years ago.  I have greatly benefitted from using myself now for several years. Nothing else compares. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great product line. I bought as gift for daughter. Very helpful for curly (frizzy) hair.</li>
            <li> My hair looks like spun gold when I use it.  I travel everywhere with it.</li>
            <li> Great product - fast ship from the seller - thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this product,  I will reorder, when I need more, it works better that anything. and it smells so good.</li>
            <li> I like this size for traveling.</li>
            <li> My daughter has used this product for years. It&#x27;s lite and silk not wet like pump protectors, holds the straight silky look for a few days</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Leaves a nice sheen without the weight of a serum.</li>
            <li> Great product and arrived very fast!</li>
