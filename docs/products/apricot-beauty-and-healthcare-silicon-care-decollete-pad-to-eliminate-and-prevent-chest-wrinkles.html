            <li>and it worked amazing!</li>
            <li>I used this shirt the first three nights and it works perfectly, but I found it obsolete after that time period.</li>
            <li>I cut out two holes from the tightest athletic shirt I own, one hole for each breast, so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s honestly like magic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a month, and the pad works just as great as it did the first night</li>

            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I need more area coverd</li>
            <li>so I follow the suggestion included in the instructions and wear a close fitting t-shirt (or sports bra) to help keep the pad in place when I use it while sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I emailed this company many times asking questions...</li>
            <li>I will be returning this, but for anyone not sensitive to the silicone, this is still an Awesome product!!</li>
            <li>It was more smooth.  </li>
            <li>I wish I would have stayed with the tried and true!</li>
            <li>This Silicone Decollette Pad is easy to wear, it sticks well to the skin and does what it promises.</li>
            <li>skin-friendly, easy to use</li>
            <li>and I always make sure to clean it after every use.</li>
            <li>, I rinse it off and it is good as new.</li>
            <li>Decreases lines significantly</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product and I consider it money very well spent.</li>
            <li>But I will use these for life because the benefits are tremendous.</li>
            <li>I wear a bra every night too, and I imagine the holes would look very funny if you didn&#x27;t use a bra.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with the results in appearance and skin texture that regular use has given me.</li>
            <li>This product did exactly as it said it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item and this seller!!</li>
            <li>I wakes up with a smooth and soft d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;.</li>
            <li>i used this the first night I received it</li>
            <li>and if you take good care of your pad by washing it regularly you will have fun with it for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love the large size to cover large area especially up by collar bones.</li>
            <li>love that I can use it for a long while</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen results right ways highly recommend</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t sweat when I sleep and don&#x27;t have large breasts</li>
            <li>Still, the pad works VERY well.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who has chest wrinkles they want to get rid of ASAP!</li>
            <li>I will go back to the original brand I got which sticks really well.</li>
            <li>I think the main thing the pad does is it keeps my skin in place</li>
            <li>To truly notice improvements or differences in appearances we must wear this with snug fitting tops and wear it daily if possible.</li>
            <li>it suggested wearing a tight top.</li>
            <li>I had hoped this would be a high quality product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this excitedly, tried it out and for first few days I felt like there was a difference in wrinkling of chest area.  </li>
            <li>for the reviewers saying it doesn&#x27;t stick, I&#x27;ve found that it sticks ok, and when it loses its stickiness (every 3 - 4 days)</li>
            <li>I really prefer European products whenever I can get them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to stop using the d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; now as the silicone is obviously not allowing my skin to breath and the area is very irritated each morning.</li>
            <li>The pad is very soothing and is no trouble at all to wear for hours; it stays firmly in place while I am sitting, standing/walking, or resting on my back.</li>
            <li>As a side-sleeper I suffer from deep lines in my decollette for such a long time now and like many other female buyers of magic promising chest wrinkle solutions I was doubtful about this product in the beginning.</li>
            <li>I usually wear a tight fitting shirt with it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying this because I want to keep my skin on my chest area as smooth and subtle as possible.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stick well or stay on very well, not good for side sleepers, or large breast.</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stick well or stay on very well, not good for side sleepers, or large breast.</li>
            <li> This is weird, because now whenever I move in my sleep, I sound like I&#x27;m crumpling a grocery bag.  </li>
            <li> Usually European beauty products are pure grade and don&#x27;t have a ton of additives that are irritating.</li>
            <li> I use other one chest pads (different brand) and they haven&#x27;t caused me to feel that.</li>
            <li> Some of my other friends have used similar products but I chose this one, because it is made in Germany.</li>
            <li> I did wear a sports bra at night to hold it down with a tight tshirts as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;After 3 days I started getting &amp;#34;sweat bumps&amp;#34; between my cleavage which typically happens during the hot summer months.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know of a tight tshirt on earth that would prevent it from shifting then becoming useless as u sleep.</li>
            <li> It does not stay on after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> However after a few days I developed a rash, I am not sure if I am allergic to the silicone (Never thought I was)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to think of that, but I just left the crinkly plastic film that is was resting in on it, on the side not touching my skin.  </li>
            <li> But I had to give it at least a try and have to admit that my doubts and wrinkles simply disappeared over night.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Reviewers said using a tight shirt fixed their problem, but being thin with large breasts means my boobs would prevent the shirt from being tight over the area between my breasts, so (sounds crazy, and looks it too)</li>
            <li> I have tried everything, tight shirts etc.</li>
            <li> you wear a tight shirt to keep the pad in place.</li>
            <li> I do not like to sleep in tight clothing.</li>
            <li> and it does help a little</li>
            <li> It will move to the side if you do not secure it.</li>
            <li> VERY disappointing, also thick and much heavier than other similar products.</li>
            <li> Do not buy - a sheer waste of money; does not work and should never be so expensive to be so ineffective.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s going back as completely useless and a waste of money for me.  </li>
            <li> The only weird thing (and no one else seems to have mentioned it) is that it is sticky on both sides.  </li>
            <li> so not sure what the problem is.  </li>
            <li> It was a waste of my money!</li>
            <li> keeps this pad (and the SilcSkin brand) in place long after the stickiness starts to fail.</li>
            <li> However I woke up with an icy pain in my chest like I had a chest cold</li>
            <li> , it is weird and a little uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> My chest wrinkles were getting worse every night</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this</li>
            <li> Terrible doesn&#x27;t stick and only used it twice</li>
            <li> The bad part is the material is not sticky and does not adhere well to the skin.</li>
            <li> Crap.  </li>
            <li> Horrible product!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Do not buy - a sheer waste of money; does not work and should never be so expensive to be so ineffective.</li>
            <li> This product did exactly as it said it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am well endowed (I wear a 32DD bra), and my boobs smash together when I sleep, as I&#x27;m a side sleeper. I think the main thing the pad does is it keeps my skin in place so I don&#x27;t wake up wrinkled. I&#x27;ve worn it every night for a week now and my chest wrinkles have improved more and more. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the reviewers saying it doesn&#x27;t stick, I&#x27;ve found that it sticks ok, and when it loses its stickiness (every 3 - 4 days), I rinse it off and it is good as new. Reviewers said using a tight shirt fixed their problem, but being thin with large breasts means my boobs would prevent the shirt from being tight over the area between my breasts, so (sounds crazy, and looks it too) I cut out two holes from the tightest athletic shirt I own, one hole for each breast, so my boobs wouldn&#x27;t hold the shirt off my chest. I wear a bra every night too, and I imagine the holes would look very funny if you didn&#x27;t use a bra. I used this shirt the first three nights and it works perfectly, but I found it obsolete after that time period. Pulling my bed covers up to my chest while sleeping in fetal position is enough to hold the pad in place for me now. Electrode gel helps too (EMPI Tac Gel (50 gm), http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00266Y3XQ/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1), will provide stickiness, though it may prevent the product from working so I would just put it in select spots and use it sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that I can use it for a long while (supposedly; I&#x27;ll let you know if that&#x27;s not the case for me), and I&#x27;ll keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> It does not stay on after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> Definitely works! Love the large size to cover large area especially up by collar bones. However I woke up with an icy pain in my chest like I had a chest cold so I took off the pad and then went back to sleep for about 30 mins and upon waking the chest pain and lung pain had gone away. Perhaps I am allergic? I use other one chest pads (different brand) and they haven&#x27;t caused me to feel that. So I was just wanting to post this in hopes to see if anyone else had a similar reaction. But I will use these for life because the benefits are tremendous. Smooth-smooth-smooth.&lt;br /&gt;thanks!</li>
            <li> I had been using the SilcSkin decollete pad and needed to reorder, but it was temporarily unavailable, so I bought this one.  I like it.  It is larger than the SilcSkin pad, and works about the same.  The only weird thing (and no one else seems to have mentioned it) is that it is sticky on both sides.  I didn&#x27;t know what to think of that, but I just left the crinkly plastic film that is was resting in on it, on the side not touching my skin.  This is weird, because now whenever I move in my sleep, I sound like I&#x27;m crumpling a grocery bag.  Still, the pad works VERY well.  I find that wearing a sports bra backwards (so the racer back falls between my breasts) keeps this pad (and the SilcSkin brand) in place long after the stickiness starts to fail.</li>
            <li> This Silicone Decollette Pad is easy to wear, it sticks well to the skin and does what it promises. I highly recommend this item and this seller!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stick well or stay on very well, not good for side sleepers, or large breast. Actually left deep creases on my chest😣</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying this because I want to keep my skin on my chest area as smooth and subtle as possible. Some of my other friends have used similar products but I chose this one, because it is made in Germany. I really prefer European products whenever I can get them. Usually European beauty products are pure grade and don&#x27;t have a ton of additives that are irritating. This one works perfectly. To truly notice improvements or differences in appearances we must wear this with snug fitting tops and wear it daily if possible.</li>
            <li> I have used the Silc Skin d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; pads for over a year and thought I would try this one after reading the reviews. Well, I will be sending it back. I have to tape it on to keep it from falling off and in the morning I have red marks on my chest both from the pad itself and the tape! I wish I would have stayed with the tried and true!</li>
            <li> This does not stay on!  I have tried everything, tight shirts etc., I don&#x27;t sweat when I sleep and don&#x27;t have large breasts so not sure what the problem is.  It gets one star for the size as it is bigger than the last brand I ordered and being tall I need more area coverd but it&#x27;s going back as completely useless and a waste of money for me.  I will go back to the original brand I got which sticks really well.</li>
            <li> Terrible doesn&#x27;t stick and only used it twice</li>
            <li> This worked when I was awake and just relaxing. I don&#x27;t know how people sleep with it on, it is weird and a little uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Crap.  Didn&#x27;t stick at all.  I will go back to the Calvert dec pad</li>
            <li> This product is great. I sleep with the silicone on my d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; nightly. I wakes up with a smooth and soft d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;. You need to we at a shirt over it. It will move to the side if you do not secure it.</li>
            <li> Does stick to skin, when product arrived it suggested wearing a tight top. VERY disappointing, also thick and much heavier than other similar products. I had hoped this would be a high quality product.</li>
            <li> This pad is the perfect size and shape to prevent and/or correct decollete wrinkles. The bad part is the material is not sticky and does not adhere well to the skin. I don&#x27;t know of a tight tshirt on earth that would prevent it from shifting then becoming useless as u sleep. If they add some adhesive to it this will be a #1 product.</li>
            <li> They work great I&#x27;ve seen results right ways highly recommend</li>
            <li> Decreases lines significantly</li>
            <li> It definitely smoothes out the wrinkling on my chest but tends to fall off.</li>
            <li> Horrible product! This item did not stick at all. It was a waste of my money! I would give no stars if I could...</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and I consider it money very well spent. I am thrilled with the results in appearance and skin texture that regular use has given me. I will not hesitate to re-order when the time comes. The pad is very soothing and is no trouble at all to wear for hours; it stays firmly in place while I am sitting, standing/walking, or resting on my back. I am a restless sleeper so I follow the suggestion included in the instructions and wear a close fitting t-shirt (or sports bra) to help keep the pad in place when I use it while sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you order this product, don&#x27;t be put off when you receive the order confirmation from Amazon with a four to six week delivery estimate. The pad is shipped from the manufacturer in Germany. I received my order within about 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The decollette pad is an excellent addition to any woman&#x27;s beauty regime, and I recommend it without reservation.</li>
            <li> As a side-sleeper I suffer from deep lines in my decollette for such a long time now and like many other female buyers of magic promising chest wrinkle solutions I was doubtful about this product in the beginning. But I had to give it at least a try and have to admit that my doubts and wrinkles simply disappeared over night.&lt;br /&gt;This pad is so great!&lt;br /&gt;It’s skin-friendly, easy to use and if you take good care of your pad by washing it regularly you will have fun with it for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely recommend this pad to my friends.</li>
            <li> I ordered this a month ago and this definitely blew my mind! My chest wrinkles were getting worse every night but this is the only product that has actually worked for me to prevent my wrinkles. It&#x27;s amazing! I use it every night. I usually wear a tight fitting shirt with it and I always make sure to clean it after every use. It&#x27;s been a month, and the pad works just as great as it did the first night I&#x27;ve used it! It&#x27;s honestly like magic. So happy with my purchase, thank you!! I highly recommend this to anyone who has chest wrinkles they want to get rid of ASAP!</li>
            <li> Great product...I emailed this company many times asking questions...I like it..it works.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;It does not stay In place. It is recommended&lt;br /&gt;that you wear a tight shirt to keep the pad in place. I do not like to sleep in tight clothing. I missed this piece of information before I purchased this item.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of this and it does help a little but I was hoping it would stay put while I was sleeping and it always slips off.  I still like it though because I&#x27;m not as wrinkled in the morning and it&#x27;s training me to sleep on my back.</li>
            <li> i used this the first night I received it and it worked amazing! I did wear a sports bra at night to hold it down with a tight tshirts as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;After 3 days I started getting &amp;#34;sweat bumps&amp;#34; between my cleavage which typically happens during the hot summer months. I&#x27;ve had to stop using the d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; now as the silicone is obviously not allowing my skin to breath and the area is very irritated each morning. I will be returning this, but for anyone not sensitive to the silicone, this is still an Awesome product!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this excitedly, tried it out and for first few days I felt like there was a difference in wrinkling of chest area.  It was more smooth.  However after a few days I developed a rash, I am not sure if I am allergic to the silicone (Never thought I was) or if it was the heat/sweat.  Either way, I cant use it anymore or I will break out.  If you have any allergy to silicone, do not purchase.  The product purpose worked great.  Good luck!</li>
