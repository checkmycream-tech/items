            <li>so I can always have it available, love this stuff ...</li>
            <li>Easy on the hair</li>
            <li>Higher end products are better and more $$$</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this way this company filled my order and sent it out quickly.</li>
            <li>Though the price has gone up $5 in the last 6 months it is still a great bargain.  </li>
            <li>I refuse to use cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>Sebastian hairspray is the best, in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li>I thought the seller would not replace even if I returned the nearly full can</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray and delivery was fast and well packaged.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>I like this hair spray so much, I find it holds my hair and doesn&#x27;t become sticky and is easy to use in styling as well.</li>
            <li>Shipping is fast and order has always been accurate.  </li>
            <li>saves $ from local stores and just handy to have it mailed.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased Sebastian&#x27;s hair spray from several different vendors but the ones offered on Amazon by far have the best prices.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great styling tool that doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy!</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>I ordered this hair spray a second time because I love it</li>
            <li>Will never buy it again unless they go back to original formula.</li>
            <li>I tried the usual remedy of soaking the nozzle in warm water but that didn&#x27;t fix the problem.  </li>
            <li>The shipping is rather costly, but if I buy 6 cans, I pay the same shipping as for 3 cans ... not bad.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the new Sebastian plus hairspray.  </li>
            <li>so he could see the defect, but didn&#x27;t want to pay return shipping in case he didn&#x27;t believe that I purchased this particular</li>
            <li>Although this holds the hair nicely when first applied, if later on your brush your hair, it leaves the hair soft and not feeling stiff and gluey like most hair sprays.</li>
            <li>The package came packed very tight and secure.</li>
            <li>One of the 3 cans in my order had a defective spray nozzle and it barely sprayed.  </li>
            <li>but this is a solid old reliable</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, this is the only hairspray I have ever used that doesn&#x27;t make my head itch and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff well worth the price.</li>

            <li> The only hair spray I will use...Easy on the hair yet it holds. I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> There, I said it. I refuse to use cheap stuff. It&#x27;s sticky, it smells bad. Sebastian hairspray is the best, in my humble opinion. And it is often sold out at my local Wegman&#x27;s. I also save money buying it this way. Win-win.</li>
            <li> Hello:&lt;br /&gt;Quality product &amp; on time delivery.&lt;br /&gt;John</li>
            <li> The package came packed very tight and secure. I love this hairspray. It holds my hair in place, especially with our winds in my state. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and will not use anything else.</li>
