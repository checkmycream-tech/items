            <li>received this product for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>This is a nice oil.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li>The cosmetic industry is an important consumer of the antioxidant-rich and youth-rejuvenating pomegranate seed oils, according to the Mountain Rose Herb database.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and effective.  </li>
            <li>Love this oil.</li>

            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I am pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Product came packaged well and very quickly.</li>
            <li>The pomegranate oil itself is fine but the bottle pump needs some improvement.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best price around for such a great beauty oil.</li>
            <li>Some of these benefits are being confirmed by science and are often attributed to the seed-rich oils found in this plant.</li>
            <li>Pomegranate Oil is a great facial oil!  </li>
            <li>This oil is great for the entire face or if you just want to use is under the eyes.  </li>
            <li>smooth even toned skinned.</li>
            <li>love it add it to my other oils and it makes a great face cream</li>

            <li>When used with essential oilsand milder healthier binding agents you end up with some excellent natural herbal health products.</li>
            <li>This is a great company with terrific service and a high quality product line of oils for many uses and skin types.</li>
            <li>The oil improves skin elasticity and regenerates the skin by causing old skin cells called keratinocytes to be sloughed off more quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Natural anti-aging substances are the most sought-after ingredients used in topical anti-wrinkle skin products.</li>
            <li>any higher than 1 star  </li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>2 pumps is more then enough to make about 32 ozs of cream.soaps.lotions.shampoos.</li>
            <li>So I am very dissappointed!</li>
            <li>This Pomegranate Seed Oil from Beautyoils.co was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I was very comfortable with the price and will certainly buy from them again in the future.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing this, I had read Amazon reviews claiming that pomegranate oil from certain vendors had arrived in a rancid condition.  </li>
            <li>I really like this oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For the past year, I had been using Perricone MD Vitamin C Ester Serum, and have been very pleased with the noticeable results on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Their oils are &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; and gentle for my skin and hair.  </li>
            <li>I have been using an oil that costs 4 times as much.  </li>
            <li>Everything I would expect from a high quality oil.</li>
            <li>i put it on ever night and the smile lines i had are now starting to fade.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell particularly, heavy - but good on dry skin.  </li>
            <li>pomegranate seed oil was something new to me.</li>
            <li>Some of its traditional healing benefits include protecting against heart disease, diabetes and cancer, boosting the immune system and reducing hot flashes and night sweats.</li>
            <li>Pomegranate, a fruit native to Asia and the Middle East, has a long and treasured history as both a favorite food and a traditional healing substance.</li>
            <li>Skin feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>Within a couple of days the redness was completely gone.  </li>
            <li>The oils are potent sources of antioxidants and a beneficial fatty acid known as punicic acid, which is a close relative to the health-preserving fat, CLA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revitalizes</li>
            <li>I have also learned that there are a few key things to pay attention to: if a company states the word &#x27;pure&#x27; or 100% or natural- BEWARE!!!</li>
            <li>I live in dry AZ climate and use oils after face creams to lock in moisture.  </li>
            <li>I have dry, very sensitive, rosacea facial skin.  </li>

Additionally, its oils are anti-inflammatory, soothing and moisturizing and benefit dry and sunburned skin, eczema and psoriasis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pomegranate seed oil was something new to me. I had never heard of it before. I have used it for about three weeks now and I have found that my skin seems tighter and fresher looking. I really like this oil. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Pomegranate Oil is a great facial oil!  I love this oil!  I have dry, very sensitive, rosacea facial skin.  This oil is great for the entire face or if you just want to use is under the eyes.  It&#x27;s light and effective.  I also use almond oil but this is a little lighter and absorbs faster.  Skin feels so soft.  And..it doesn&#x27;t cause me any breakouts, and that&#x27;s such a bonus.  Product came packaged well and very quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Absorbs quickly and feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best price around for such a great beauty oil. I use it in my home made skin and hair concoctions.</li>
            <li> Maybe the wrinkles were to deep.  Will continueto use before I score it any higher than 1 star  Quicker results are always expected</li>
            <li> My hands were starting to get crepey and showing my age.  I did some research and found out that Pomegranate Seed Oil would help - so I found this one and I&#x27;m happy to report that it has worked wonders!  I also had an allergic reaction to some under eye cream and put this on and immediately felt relief.  Within a couple of days the redness was completely gone.  I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> This is a great company with terrific service and a high quality product line of oils for many uses and skin types.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this, I had read Amazon reviews claiming that pomegranate oil from certain vendors had arrived in a rancid condition.  Not so in this case.  Both this manufacturer and vendor provided an excellent product, and delivery was timely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past year, I had been using Perricone MD Vitamin C Ester Serum, and have been very pleased with the noticeable results on my skin.  Alas, such short-term luxury costs $98 for a 1-ounce bottle.  Therefore, I recently purchased a 2-ounce bottle of BeautyOils Pomegranate Seed Oil for only $15.95, which equals an $82 difference per ounce.  Both my skin and my pocketbook thank me.</li>
            <li> Everything I would expect from a high quality oil. Very happy, will order again.</li>
            <li> I purchase all of my beauty oils from this company. Their oils are &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; and gentle for my skin and hair.  I will continue to purchase oils from this company!</li>
            <li> I know some feel it is a heavy oil. 2 pumps is more then enough to make about 32 ozs of cream.soaps.lotions.shampoos. When used with essential oilsand milder healthier binding agents you end up with some excellent natural herbal health products.I love the pump (No Waster) I will be  permanent customer!</li>
            <li> love it add it to my other oils and it makes a great face cream</li>

            <li> I love this i put it on ever night and the smile lines i had are now starting to fade. I&#x27;m so excited i can&#x27;t wait until i can see nothing but smooth even toned skinned.</li>

            <li> So I am very dissappointed! When I did some research about pomegranate seed oil I discovered that it should be THICK. This is not! This leads me to believe that it has been diluted although the bottle does not say so. I have also learned that there are a few key things to pay attention to: if a company states the word &#x27;pure&#x27; or 100% or natural- BEWARE!!! I don&#x27;t think I want to purchase from beauty oils.co again. If they cheated on this, then who knows about their other products!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell particularly, heavy - but good on dry skin.  I have horrible eczema and live in very cold/dry weather during the winter and this has been one of the only things that&#x27;s helped.</li>

I was very comfortable with the price and will certainly buy from them again in the future.</li>
            <li> The pomegranate oil itself is fine but the bottle pump needs some improvement. Sometimes it just squirts all over the place and so the oil is wasted. The pump feature should be improved.</li>
