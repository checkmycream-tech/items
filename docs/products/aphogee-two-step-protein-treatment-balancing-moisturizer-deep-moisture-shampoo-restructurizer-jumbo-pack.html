    <ol>
            <li>Aphogee is the best on the market.</li>
            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>I have been using the two step protein and it was very good.</li>
            <li>and it feels great already.</li>
            <li>With a good-quality shampoo and conditioner, some good hair oil treatments and a once a month Aphogee treatment I can maintain beautiful, healthy hair.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>but honestly that didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>both how my hair looks and feels.it is kind of a pain to use</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very happy with this protein treatment and plan to continue to follow her once-a-month instructions.</li>
            <li>Be sure to follow the instructions as stated on the bottle and enjoy your own results!</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I am very impressed, can&#x27;t wait to see what will the second application will do to my curls! :)</li>
            <li>My wife love this product</li>
            <li>and it kept my hair shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I have always wondered why nobody seems to know about it, Everyone I have introduced it to Love it as well.</li>
            <li>I tried this item and it really stops the shedding, I love this product great investment.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t notice that it did anything for my already healthy hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>love this product</li>
            <li>My hair was falling out after putting a strong perm on it and my hair immediately stopped breaking after my treatment.</li>
            <li>Great improvement to my hair after only one use.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;The product does have a horrid smell and it does irritate the skin, so be sure to wear an old t-shirt and have a towel handy.</li>
            <li>Thanks Aphogee! :)</li>
            <li>My hair is not so damaged but after using this product, I have noticed that it has become very shiny and strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every dime.</li>
            <li>but if you are serious about keeping your bleached hair healthy this is a good tool to have in your arsenal.</li>
            <li>maybe after a few more uses I will be able to see a change in my hair.</li>
            <li>I would suggest if anyone is interested, to watch the aphogee two step treatment video.</li>
            <li>It really does work!</li>
            <li>It was exactly as  pictured on the site.</li>
            <li>The product does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do...</li>
            <li>I guess for the next customer they can use more packing in the box to try and prevent leakage so the customer gets 100% of their product.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have heard many people say that the product is of quality, but I have not noticed a different myself.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair feel much better after initial use.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t lose too much.</li>
            <li>I used it a week afterwards and it did make my hair feel healthier and much</li>
            <li>Another reason for the three stars is that the product is much cheaper at every store in my neighborhood</li>
            <li>and It helps the color stay vibrant longer.</li>
            <li>My hair was lacking elasticity, the first application my curls were back.</li>
            <li>I could have purchased three (3) large bottles of these items for similar prices at another store.</li>
            <li>I also use a dime-size drop of a mix of 100% pure Aragon oil mixed with biosilk hair therapy treatment.</li>
            <li>works well and leaves my hair soft</li>
            <li>I have no idea whether the formula has been changed or the product is old.</li>
            <li>The conditioner smells like stinky mens collgne and the picture is misleading… the bottles are no where near the size of what is shown.</li>
            <li>This time the texture and the color of the liqued are different and they don&#x27;t have the same positive effect on my hair.</li>

            <li> I was disappointed because in the picture both the Balancing Moisturizer and the Deep Moisture Shampoo appear to be the same size, however, when the package arrived the Balancing Moisturizer was quite small!</li>
            <li> hard to use and didn&#x27;t notice difference in quality of hair</li>
            <li> Never-ever do this to paying customers, it&#x27;s dishonest and it&#x27;s not nice.</li>

            <li> My wife love this product</li>
            <li> Love it! Great improvement to my hair after only one use.</li>
            <li> I started using this stuff years ago when I was a platinum blond and it kept my hair shiny and healthy. Now I am a red head and It helps the color stay vibrant longer. I have always wondered why nobody seems to know about it, Everyone I have introduced it to Love it as well.</li>
            <li> Aphogee is the best on the market. I am a witness. My hair was falling out after putting a strong perm on it and my hair immediately stopped breaking after my treatment. It&#x27;s worth every dime. Just follow the instructions, and you will see the results.</li>

            <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I used the product 2 weeks ago and I am not seeing or experiencing the breakage I had before. It really does work! I did it for my kids and seeing the same results. Thanks Aphogee! :)&lt;br /&gt;The product does have a horrid smell and it does irritate the skin, so be sure to wear an old t-shirt and have a towel handy. Be sure to follow the instructions as stated on the bottle and enjoy your own results!</li>
            <li> I got my product on time. It was exactly as  pictured on the site. Only problem was it was leaking...but I didn&#x27;t lose too much.The product does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do...maybe after a few more uses I will be able to see a change in my hair. I guess for the next customer they can use more packing in the box to try and prevent leakage so the customer gets 100% of their product.</li>
            <li> Not for my hair texture made it very dry</li>
            <li> Arrived just in time for my vacation. Aphogee restored my hair about 70%, but I&#x27;ve stopped using it for a while (trying to give my hair a break). Anyway, my hair was a mushy mess before so I highly recommend this product. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I used this before I bleached my hair and I didn&#x27;t notice that it did anything for my already healthy hair. It seemed like it left a little bit of a residue that washed out the next time but I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement. Once I bleached my medium brown hair blonde I used it a week afterwards and it did make my hair feel healthier and much like it felt before I bleached it. I dyed it on a Friday and my hairdresser said to use it twice the next week and once a month afterwards, no more or it might cause breakage. I only did it once and it feels great already. So far I&#x27;m very happy with this protein treatment and plan to continue to follow her once-a-month instructions. I do think it made a difference in both how my hair looks and feels.it is kind of a pain to use and it is a bit messy but if you are serious about keeping your bleached hair healthy this is a good tool to have in your arsenal. I also use a dime-size drop of a mix of 100% pure Aragon oil mixed with biosilk hair therapy treatment. With a good-quality shampoo and conditioner, some good hair oil treatments and a once a month Aphogee treatment I can maintain beautiful, healthy hair. I will post updates if anything changes.</li>
            <li> I have heard many people say that the product is of quality, but I have not noticed a different myself. Another reason for the three stars is that the product is much cheaper at every store in my neighborhood then it is on this site.</li>
            <li> My hair is not so damaged but after using this product, I have noticed that it has become very shiny and strong. I&#x27;m still going to use this before each hair coloring just to protect it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the two step protein and it was very good. This time the texture and the color of the liqued are different and they don&#x27;t have the same positive effect on my hair. I have no idea whether the formula has been changed or the product is old.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> The conditioner smells like stinky mens collgne and the picture is misleading… the bottles are no where near the size of what is shown.</li>
            <li> Does wonders on my hair! love this product</li>
            <li> Great product!  Makes your hair feel much better after initial use.</li>
