            <li>Works well, excellent price, and I carry it around in my purse.</li>
            <li>concealer and highlighter in one is perfect and it&#x27;s slender and compact to not take up a lot of room.  </li>
            <li>You add it to your lips then use a lip pencil to create the perfect palette for your lipstick.</li>
            <li>PERFECT!!</li>
            <li>Very good</li>
            <li>I am very happy with it and am glad that I discovered this product!</li>
            <li>under eye concealer is great but the highlighter is alittle too shimmery for my taste.</li>
            <li>It is not the best, but the highlighter was nice.</li>
            <li>Highlighter is great.</li>
            <li>The highlighter is great too below eyebrows, on cheekbones, etc., but use it sparingly.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price for this great product.</li>
            <li>Favorite product ever!!</li>
            <li>this stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li>The very excellent deal and I am pleased to deal with you again, and I will recommend my friends to this product.</li>
            <li>Awesome product and even more amazing for the price!</li>
            <li>It works great, I love it!</li>
            <li>this is one handy product that does many wonderful things.</li>
            <li>Well for starters this product does not break the bank and that is always a good thing.</li>
            <li>This product is so creamy..looks so good.  </li>
            <li>A good concealer.</li>
            <li>Amazing product  great coverage amazing price</li>
            <li>Conceals nicely and the highlighter gives my eyes that bright look without being too overpowering.  </li>
            <li>This is the best highlighter I&#x27;ve used under and around my eyes (and I&#x27;ve gone through a bunch looking for the right one)</li>
            <li>I have worked for MAC and another very popular brand and when it come to concealers it depends on so many things.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this concealer/highlighter!  </li>
            <li>Magic!</li>
            <li>I actually liked this more than I thought I would!  </li>
            <li>Covers nicely</li>
            <li>Hey it would be nice to think that our make-up stays put and stays perfect all day but lets be real, no cosmetics truly do that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great, super versatile color, and it has a creamy-ish texture.</li>
            <li>E.L.F. Under eye concealer and highlighter is very easy to apply and blend.</li>
            <li>Love this eye concealer and easy to apply!</li>
            <li>If you want very light coverage</li>
            <li>The highlighter seems most helpful of the two.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>overall great product though for the price!</li>
            <li>It was just okay.  </li>
            <li>I love this concealer and highlighter duo.</li>
            <li>I love love love this Under Eye Concealer.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t stay on my face for more than an hour.</li>
            <li>It has many uses from the traditional all the way to the perfect pout.</li>
            <li>Love love this concealer.</li>
            <li>I never used a highlighter before, but I love it.</li>
            <li>need to get more, almost out.</li>
            <li>I need to start using it more.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t blend well, sits on top of skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine a better one out there.</li>
            <li>Color is right for my fair, olive skin.</li>
            <li>The makeup is great, but as far as packaging goes</li>
            <li>it is easy to take with you for any touch ups you may need.</li>
            <li>It is pretty good, but I wish the white has a bit more staying power</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right consistency -- covers without caking into fine lines.</li>
            <li>So far this product has worked nicely on me.  </li>
            <li>If you want to look fresh and awake then by all means this is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>This product has the right amount of light-diffusing power, but doesn&#x27;t provide much coverage, even layered on top of the concealer....</li>
            <li>I am a make up lover but rarely use concealer..</li>
            <li>Because I thought it was a heavy duty concealer to cover up darkness under my eye, but it is more like a very very very light cover up.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t provide much concealing under eyes, which is where I wanted it.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find it much in the stores around here, so will need to stock on it</li>
            <li>The makeup seemed very watery and diluted.</li>
            <li>Both products are very watery.</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t have much \\&quot;highlight.\\&quot; The \\&quot;concealer\\</li>
            <li>I wish there was a whole tube of just the highlighter.</li>
            <li>BETTER THAN EXPECTED...</li>
            <li>I have to use another concealer, and then this applied carefully on the top....</li>
            <li>really well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Is nice for everyday wear makeup.</li>
            <li>Found I can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li>I could pretty much put on the highlighter, and it would not dry, and I could wipe it off with my finger.</li>
            <li>The highlighter is a little better than the concealer.</li>
            <li>This works really well and leaves a light sheen under my eyes to deflect the dark circles.</li>
            <li>It hid dark puffy circles and light lines.</li>
            <li>It makes my sensitive skin break out</li>
            <li>Take it from a Professional</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a bit sheer and blends away rather fast.</li>
            <li>Works a lot better than other more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>Then when your lips are blotted and ready for their close up take the highlighter and dab it in the center of your pout for that classic Monroe lip.</li>
            <li>So there you have it, this product does NOT cover up major issues</li>
            <li>It offers no coverage and may as well be sheer.</li>
            <li>I love the concealer and highlighter and use it everyday, but after a couple weeks of using it, the middle part snapped in half.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t crease and covers my dark circles really well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product for concealing dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li>Not only does it cover minor imperfections the highlighter has more than a few other uses.</li>
            <li>the concealer is pretty much a waste, just doesn&#x27;t cover -</li>
            <li>You can also use the highlighter for a tiny bit of shimmer on your eye lids ( Pro advice ) , apply your matte shadow as normal and take a Q-tip and just dab a small amount right in the center of your lid.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s just not high enough quality for my skin type.</li>
            <li> The highlighter part is a little too shimmery for me, but I used the concealer side up completely.  </li>
            <li> As a professional I recommend this to my clients for at home everyday use.  </li>
            <li> I do not agree with this, well not completely.</li>
            <li> I only got 2 hours of sleep the other night</li>
            <li> (minus one star)</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product serves to be pointless especially for a product that is supposed to CONCEAL...</li>
            <li> I was trying to use for dark spots and under eye circles but couldn&#x27;t make it work.</li>
            <li> Covers my dark circles under my eye</li>
            <li> Three dollars plus tax down the drain.</li>
            <li> One other pro trick for the e.l.f combo set is this, use the concealer as a lip primer!</li>
            <li> I have terrible dark circles under my eyes and this always makes them disappear like magic!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.  </li>
            <li> If you are in need of a heavy cover-up then no this is not for you.</li>
            <li> And also I bought mine at target for half the price!</li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes that are hard to cover.</li>
            <li> I used the under eye concealer and a little highlighter over my face primer and foundation and the make up does not budge at all through out the day!</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed with the size of the bottle though, it seems like it will not last that long.</li>
            <li> highligher looks like glitter on my and personally, I dont like that totally fake glow on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i believe it makes my dark cycles look gray and weird looking</li>
            <li> but  this product made me realize that they have gotten worse.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Thoroughly disappointing.</li>
            <li> I used to wear Channel make up, very expensive.  </li>
            <li> If anything it made my eyes look twice as bad and my circles aren&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> bad</li>
            <li> Just terrible.</li>

            <li> Love this eye concealer and easy to apply! It works great, I love it! Is nice for everyday wear makeup.</li>
            <li> Love it. Covers nicely and I don&#x27;t look like I have raccoon eyes!</li>
            <li> does not work as well as i hoped, also it i believe it makes my dark cycles look gray and weird looking</li>
            <li> under eye concealer is great but the highlighter is alittle too shimmery for my taste. overall great product though for the price!</li>
            <li> It was just okay.  The applicator broke off and the product got muddy after a month or so.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again but didn&#x27;t feel ripped off or anything.  It&#x27;s just not high enough quality for my skin type.</li>
            <li> Works well, excellent price, and I carry it around in my purse. I&#x27;d purchase again. The highlighter is a little better than the concealer.</li>
            <li> Because I thought it was a heavy duty concealer to cover up darkness under my eye, but it is more like a very very very light cover up. It is not the best, but the highlighter was nice. I guess this is what you expect when you by an e.l.f. product.</li>
            <li> Highlighter is great. Concealer is meh.</li>
            <li> Very good I usecit inbthe morning when I have bags under my eyes so I recomend this product USE IT</li>
            <li> The very excellent deal and I am pleased to deal with you again, and I will recommend my friends to this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this concealer for awhile now and just recently ran out, so I needed to restock. I love this concealer and highlighter duo. I have dark circles under my eyes that are hard to cover. This works really well and leaves a light sheen under my eyes to deflect the dark circles. The highlighter is great too below eyebrows, on cheekbones, etc., but use it sparingly. A little goes a long way. You can&#x27;t beat the price for this great product.</li>
            <li> Favorite product ever!! I have terrible dark circles under my eyes and this always makes them disappear like magic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be short on this:&lt;br /&gt;the concealer doesnt offer either a médium coverage! it just dissapear no matter how I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;The highligher looks like glitter on my and personally, I dont like that totally fake glow on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wont buy this never again</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  I thought I would give this a try because a couple of YouTube girls raved about it. I don&#x27;t understand why. I&#x27;ll stick to my Maybelline Instant Age Rewind and my MAC Pro Longwear concealers.</li>
            <li> So far this product has worked nicely on me.  I was a little disappointed with the size of the bottle though, it seems like it will not last that long.</li>
            <li> I love the concealer and highlighter and use it everyday, but after a couple weeks of using it, the middle part snapped in half. The makeup is great, but as far as packaging goes you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> As a professional I recommend this to my clients for at home everyday use.  Amazing product  great coverage amazing price</li>
            <li> Just terrible. If anything it made my eyes look twice as bad and my circles aren&#x27;t that bad but  this product made me realize that they have gotten worse.</li>
            <li> I love love love this Under Eye Concealer. It works better than some of the expensive ones and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.  Can&#x27;t find it much in the stores around here, so will need to stock on it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concealer and highlighter in one is perfect and it&#x27;s slender and compact to not take up a lot of room.  And of course, the price rocks for something that works so well.  Please keep carrying this!!</li>
            <li> E.L.F. Under eye concealer and highlighter is very easy to apply and blend. I will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Elf concealer just doesn&#x27;t work out for me. It makes my sensitive skin break out and it doesn&#x27;t stay on my face for more than an hour. Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin type but the concealer side of things just doesn&#x27;t seem to do the job. It leaves my skin greasy with red blotches.</li>
            <li> Hi everyone! I wanted to leave my two cents about e.l.f Under Eye concealer and Highlighter so here goes. Well for starters this product does not break the bank and that is always a good thing. Now I have read the &amp;#34; you get what you pay for &amp;#34; reviews but I do not agree with this, well not completely. I have worked as a Make-up artist for two of the biggest companies out there. I have worked for MAC and another very popular brand and when it come to concealers it depends on so many things. If you are in need of a heavy cover-up then no this is not for you. If you want to look fresh and awake then by all means this is a fantastic product. Not only does it cover minor imperfections the highlighter has more than a few other uses. You can use as directed or you can use it as a primer for your sparkle shadows. You can also use the highlighter for a tiny bit of shimmer on your eye lids ( Pro advice ) , apply your matte shadow as normal and take a Q-tip and just dab a small amount right in the center of your lid. This technique give you that subtle light that draws you right in, like a secret spotlight for your peepers!  One other pro trick for the e.l.f combo set is this, use the concealer as a lip primer! You add it to your lips then use a lip pencil to create the perfect palette for your lipstick. Then when your lips are blotted and ready for their close up take the highlighter and dab it in the center of your pout for that classic Monroe lip. So there you have it, this product does NOT cover up major issues but it does cover and it is easy to take with you for any touch ups you may need. Hey it would be nice to think that our make-up stays put and stays perfect all day but lets be real, no cosmetics truly do that. It has many uses from the traditional all the way to the perfect pout. Take it from a Professional this is one handy product that does many wonderful things.</li>
            <li> Love love this concealer. It doesn&#x27;t crease and covers my dark circles really well. The highlighter does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Works a lot better than other more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this concealer/highlighter!  I am a make up lover but rarely use concealer..bad I know..this stuff is amazing!  Conceals nicely and the highlighter gives my eyes that bright look without being too overpowering.  And also I bought mine at target for half the price!</li>
            <li> I used to wear Channel make up, very expensive.  This product is so creamy..looks so good.  I am very happy with it and am glad that I discovered this product!</li>
            <li> Works well for my under eye bags and circles. I never used a highlighter before, but I love it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product for concealing dark under eye circles. It&#x27;s just the right consistency -- covers without caking into fine lines.</li>
            <li> This product serves to be pointless especially for a product that is supposed to CONCEAL... It offers no coverage and may as well be sheer. Thoroughly disappointing. Should have known... You definitely get what you pay for!!!</li>
            <li> You couldn&#x27;t even tell I was wearing it. The makeup seemed very watery and diluted. I ended up throwing it out.</li>
            <li> I bought this for contouring. It is pretty good, but I wish the white has a bit more staying power, it&#x27;s a bit sheer and blends away rather fast.</li>
            <li> Magic! What a deal bought 1 for home and purse! Found I can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li> Both products are very watery. I could pretty much put on the highlighter, and it would not dry, and I could wipe it off with my finger. It also didn&#x27;t have much \\&quot;highlight.\\&quot; The \\&quot;concealer\\&quot; was so sheer, why bother? Three dollars plus tax down the drain.</li>
            <li> need to get more, almost out. its a bit liquidy but it works out well. I need to start using it more.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t blend well, sits on top of skin. Color is right for my fair, olive skin. I was trying to use for dark spots and under eye circles but couldn&#x27;t make it work. I tried with and without various primers and setting powders, too.</li>
            <li> This is the best highlighter I&#x27;ve used under and around my eyes (and I&#x27;ve gone through a bunch looking for the right one) that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune. I can&#x27;t imagine a better one out there. *note - the concealer is pretty much a waste, just doesn&#x27;t cover - I wish there was a whole tube of just the highlighter. (minus one star)</li>
            <li> PERFECT!! BETTER THAN EXPECTED...A MUST FOR ANY MAKEUP BAG!!!!</li>
            <li> This product does just the job! I used the under eye concealer and a little highlighter over my face primer and foundation and the make up does not budge at all through out the day! I only got 2 hours of sleep the other night (I have a toddler at home), and this pen worked wonders! It hid dark puffy circles and light lines. It looked as though I had gotten 8 hours of sleep. Awesome product and even more amazing for the price!</li>
            <li> This product has the right amount of light-diffusing power, but doesn&#x27;t provide much coverage, even layered on top of the concealer.... I have to use another concealer, and then this applied carefully on the top.... so not quite as convenient as I had hoped....</li>
            <li> A good concealer. Covers my dark circles under my eye really well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how the highlighter is bc I don&#x27;t know how to use it! I will learn one day!</li>
            <li> If you want very light coverage this is for you.</li>
