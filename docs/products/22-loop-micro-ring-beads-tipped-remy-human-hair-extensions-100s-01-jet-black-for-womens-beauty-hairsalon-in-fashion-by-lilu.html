            <li>my customer was very happy on the quality of the hair would recommend this seller to others and they have great prices.</li>
            <li>The idea and concept of these is great because it takes out a step when looping the hair.</li>
            <li>great hair quality</li>
            <li>it said to use good quality products</li>
            <li>While I loved the ease of the loops (and believe me this aspect made me add a star here), the quality of the hair and the beads was sub-par.</li>
            <li>My experience has been good.</li>
            <li>It feels good and blends well with my hair.</li>
            <li>and I gotta say that they are actually really good quality extensions.  </li>

            <li>True to description and good quality!</li>
            <li>For the cheap price its great.</li>
            <li>Hang on to the plastic loops if you do decide to buy because then you can make your own if you have the time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to the pulling and annoyances extensions of any kind come with</li>
            <li>love love!</li>
            <li>VERY easy to apply,  will be definitely buying more!!!:)</li>
            <li>the top of the loop would melt hair would fall apart.</li>
            <li>love the hair it was just as described by the seller&lt;br /&gt;hair</li>
            <li>i-tips are going to be better to use if you dont want damage to your hair and are looking for longevity.</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li>(make sure to carry a brush).</li>
            <li>Got 200 strands. :)</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I just love these</li>
            <li>By the way I bought two packs and was satisfied with my hair.</li>
            <li>For me I love it</li>
            <li>Just I love them.</li>
            <li>I love the hair I bought.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick, and I am pleased with he product, just wish it stays in longer!</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use any other kind, these are so amazing!!</li>
            <li>Luckily I have some beads of my own that I will be putting on them instead of</li>
            <li>i bought two packs and cant imagine this looking very full in my hair.</li>
            <li>They looked great and natural, but you can&#x27;t brush all of your hair.</li>
            <li>Loops make it very easy and quick to apply.</li>
            <li>You will need a separator to make sure your parts and pieces are done clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t shed they&#x27;re easy to install</li>
            <li>Once again, I&#x27;m satisfied, this length is a true 22\\</li>
            <li>Very soft good product.</li>
            <li>The hair is great and is in great condition, but the beads are metal and it makes it so they are hard to clam in, and also come out quickly.</li>
            <li>Hair was so stringy and cheap.</li>
            <li>Great hair, so beautiful and blended into my fine natural blonde hair, and they are so much easier to use than the ones with separate rings.</li>
            <li>Received my order sooner than expected and the hair is great quality, overall a good buy!</li>
            <li>Super easy to put in</li>
            <li>and the shipping was very fast about 5-6 business days to Michigan. :-)</li>
            <li>The only thing that was good about this hair was how easy it was to put on, that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Above was my original review.</li>
            <li>Other than that I am happy, they were relatively cheap with 2 day prime shipping, and they work for volume.</li>
            <li>Although the price was good, the quality of the hair left me awestruck.</li>
            <li>i use 3 packs for a full head.</li>
            <li>you well need 2 packs for a full hair</li>
            <li>I purchased the 18\\&quot; before from this same seller and I loved them.</li>
            <li>The product idea is great, but again, in application much was left to be desired.</li>
            <li>They liked good the first day or two after that you could tell from a distance it wasn&#x27;t real hair, it got very frizzy and kinda nappy even after following care instructions to the T.</li>
            <li>It sheds way to much, and the loops were cheep and snapped easy.</li>
            <li>If you use your own silicone beads they definitely stay in longer</li>
            <li>I would never order from this company if you want to actually look nice after the application.</li>
            <li>on time&lt;br /&gt;easy to apply and so soft :)</li>
            <li>I originally thought these hair extensions were awesome, I was WRONG.</li>
            <li>nice but thinner than expected.</li>
            <li>I do not expect them to last more than a month</li>
            <li>I will most likely be repurchasing from this seller</li>
            <li>Sceptical at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a former stylist and have done everything too many hair from color to see in exemptions and fusion.</li>
            <li>They looked nice, just wish I could&#x27;ve enjoyed them more then one day. :(</li>
            <li>look and feel like real hair</li>
            <li>to style and VERY soft.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>They do not shed as much as others have reviewed but that might be luck of the draw for me.</li>
            <li>My beautician thought I had spent much more money than I did.</li>
            <li>I fear that they may have wrecked my real hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I have washed my hair with these in and they dont really fall apart like people have said from what I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really picky on my hair.</li>
            <li>The hair was decent and I won&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say buy an extra pack just to be safe &amp; use it in thr future if u dont need it.</li>
            <li>After wearing these for a while there is SO much damage to your natural hair.</li>
            <li>It is very shiny and cheap looking and does not blend well with normal african american hair.</li>
            <li>Another side note you might have to cut them if you dont like how not thick at the bottom it is.</li>
            <li>there ok for the price.. dont like the microloops too sticky and messy...</li>
            <li>Very fun to wear, but they started coming out when I brushed my fingers through my hair the next morning.</li>
            <li>This made it hard to get a great finished product as one side of my head was fuller than the other.</li>
            <li>The quality of the hair is that of a regular silky straight and tangles quite a bit.</li>
            <li>i love this product, it lasts me at least 4 months.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s how I know), and they&#x27;re really soft.</li>
            <li>but the extra cost kind of sucks.</li>
            <li>And when you get tired of not being able to REALLY brush your hair, you&#x27;ll wanna take them out.</li>
            <li>Some had some good things to say and some had ill things.</li>
            <li>I have thin hair and used about 3/4 of the 100 strands they did give me nice volume to my hair not much.</li>
            <li>Feel soft and they&#x27;re really long.</li>

            <li> And when you get tired of not being able to REALLY brush your hair, you&#x27;ll wanna take them out.</li>
            <li> Some had some good things to say and some had ill things.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and used about 3/4 of the 100 strands they did give me nice volume to my hair not much.</li>
            <li> Feel soft and they&#x27;re really long.</li>
            <li> I thought that I was getting a bargain, but definitely got far less than I had bargained for.</li>
            <li> Of course with any long length it will be thinner than a shorter length.</li>
            <li> long so,yup I beef another bag to replace the 10s.</li>
            <li> This was 100 strands and 100 strands is really only equal to a half a pack.</li>
            <li> &quot;, goes all the way down my back</li>
            <li> I was actually quite disappointed with this product, only giving 2 stars because they were easy to put in, and stayed in.</li>
            <li> I used them to add black lowlights to the underneath of my blonde hair.</li>
            <li> BUT the beads do not have silicone in them which makes it harder to stay on your hair.</li>
            <li> So I never really write a review</li>
            <li> In order to salvage the hair and my expenses I had to go have a haircut which added to my costs and made it impossible to reuse the extensions because if I took them out there was no way to get them back into the exact spot, which made it necessary to have another cut once reapplied.</li>
            <li> The other thing that was wrong with the hair was that although I ordered several packs of the 22&amp;#34; hair, very few of the extensions were still full at the 22&amp;#34; mark.</li>
            <li> By afternoon, at least 75 of the 200 had slid out, and with a general pull I had the rest out that night.</li>
            <li> First of all, none of the extensions were uniform: some were thick while others were thin.</li>
            <li> When you take them out it is a pain because there is a TON of hidden mats and knots in your hair.</li>
            <li> I got the #60 and the black ones.</li>
            <li> Way to long for me and hard to get used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other extensions &amp; they don&#x27;t even compare to these!!</li>
            <li> I feel like I wasted my money and will NOT be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> However these are money wasted if you are looking for longevity.</li>
            <li> Thin but for the price I double some</li>
            <li> Some of the worst extensions I&#x27;ve had!they constantly fall out the hair thins quickly</li>
            <li> I bought these hair extensions this past month</li>
            <li> The keratin glue that holds them together is hard and after your hair has been in them for a while</li>
            <li> They should of used silicone or something else beside the metal that was hard to close onto the hair and hard to reopen without pulling out your hair.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;d recommend at least 2 packs for people with shoulder length hair looking to get length.</li>
            <li> i like the look of thick hair.</li>
            <li> but it did no good.</li>
            <li> Hair was horrible shedded wayyyyy too much</li>
            <li> not happy with it at all.</li>
            <li> These are u-tips and are very bad for your natural hair.</li>
            <li> I ended up cutting about 5 inches off to make them not look straggly.</li>
            <li> I even bought very expensive shampoo and conditioner cmbecause</li>

            <li> my customer was very happy on the quality of the hair would recommend this seller to others and they have great prices.</li>
            <li> Some of the worst extensions I&#x27;ve had!they constantly fall out the hair thins quickly and it&#x27;s not fully human hair what a rip off!</li>
            <li> Hair was so stringy and cheap. I couldn&#x27;t even straighten it the top of the loop would melt hair would fall apart. The only thing that was good about this hair was how easy it was to put on, that&#x27;s about it. Hey you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> nice but thinner than expected. i bought two packs and cant imagine this looking very full in my hair.</li>
            <li> I was actually quite disappointed with this product, only giving 2 stars because they were easy to put in, and stayed in. They liked good the first day or two after that you could tell from a distance it wasn&#x27;t real hair, it got very frizzy and kinda nappy even after following care instructions to the T. I even bought very expensive shampoo and conditioner cmbecause it said to use good quality products but it did no good. I feel like I wasted my money and will NOT be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> love the hair it was just as described by the seller&lt;br /&gt;hair look and feel like real hair and it do excellent with heat.</li>
            <li> Hair was horrible shedded wayyyyy too much I contacted seller weeks before writing this review with no response I had to take the links out 3 weeks after putting them in because they started to shed and fall out . Never again ! Need a refund</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other extensions &amp; they don&#x27;t even compare to these!! I won&#x27;t use any other kind, these are so amazing!!</li>
            <li> Of course with any long length it will be thinner than a shorter length. This was 100 strands and 100 strands is really only equal to a half a pack. So for fullness and volume my suggestion is 4 packs or 3 1/2 if you have thicker hair like mine. The hair was decent and I won&#x27;t complain BUT the beads do not have silicone in them which makes it harder to stay on your hair. Luckily I have some beads of my own that I will be putting on them instead of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above was my original review. After wearing these for a while there is SO much damage to your natural hair. The keratin glue that holds them together is hard and after your hair has been in them for a while and you have moved around somewhat it will cut your hair. The rings are metal. The quality of the hair is that of a regular silky straight and tangles quite a bit. It is very shiny and cheap looking and does not blend well with normal african american hair. The idea and concept of these is great because it takes out a step when looping the hair. However these are money wasted if you are looking for longevity. These are u-tips and are very bad for your natural hair. You will need a separator to make sure your parts and pieces are done clean. Hang on to the plastic loops if you do decide to buy because then you can make your own if you have the time. i-tips are going to be better to use if you dont want damage to your hair and are looking for longevity. I do not recommend these anymore.</li>
            <li> Very fun to wear, but they started coming out when I brushed my fingers through my hair the next morning. By afternoon, at least 75 of the 200 had slid out, and with a general pull I had the rest out that night. They looked nice, just wish I could&#x27;ve enjoyed them more then one day. :(</li>
            <li> The hair is great and is in great condition, but the beads are metal and it makes it so they are hard to clam in, and also come out quickly. The shipping was quick, and I am pleased with he product, just wish it stays in longer! If you use your own silicone beads they definitely stay in longer though- but the extra cost kind of sucks.</li>
            <li> While I loved the ease of the loops (and believe me this aspect made me add a star here), the quality of the hair and the beads was sub-par. Although the price was good, the quality of the hair left me awestruck. First of all, none of the extensions were uniform: some were thick while others were thin. This made it hard to get a great finished product as one side of my head was fuller than the other. The other thing that was wrong with the hair was that although I ordered several packs of the 22&amp;#34; hair, very few of the extensions were still full at the 22&amp;#34; mark. This made the overall look appear to be stringy at the bottom. In order to salvage the hair and my expenses I had to go have a haircut which added to my costs and made it impossible to reuse the extensions because if I took them out there was no way to get them back into the exact spot, which made it necessary to have another cut once reapplied. Lastly, the beads themselves were substandard as the coloring cracked away when I applied them to my hair leaving the silver shinny bead exposed and visible in some spots. I thought that I was getting a bargain, but definitely got far less than I had bargained for. I would never order from this company if you want to actually look nice after the application. The product idea is great, but again, in application much was left to be desired. Never again!!!</li>
            <li> i love this product, it lasts me at least 4 months. i use 3 packs for a full head. i like the look of thick hair. i&#x27;d recommend at least 2 packs for people with shoulder length hair looking to get length. it&#x27;s a time consuming project but i&#x27;ve been wearing extensions for years so i&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li> Super easy to put in and it was delivered well before the estimated time.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to style and VERY soft.&lt;br /&gt;Love love love!</li>
            <li> I purchased these basically because they were the only item with prime 2 day shipping. If you are looking to lengthen your hair these will not work. I ended up cutting about 5 inches off to make them not look straggly. I have thin hair and used about 3/4 of the 100 strands they did give me nice volume to my hair not much. They do not tangle, when applying them lay them over a brush and pull them through as you grab a strand it will help so they do not get tangled when applying. They do not shed as much as others have reviewed but that might be luck of the draw for me. The micro-loops do however need to be brushed several times a day because the strands will look &amp;#34;noodley&amp;#34; (if that&#x27;s a word) you can tell that the strands are together (make sure to carry a brush). Other than that I am happy, they were relatively cheap with 2 day prime shipping, and they work for volume. I do not expect them to last more than a month but for the price and  being in a pickle they will work for now.</li>
            <li> Easy installation and blends beautifully</li>
            <li> It sheds way to much, and the loops were cheep and snapped easy. The description was 100% human hair but not dyeable. not happy with it at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair and ended up getting 20 inch hair... It&#x27;s not an issue because the price is work 20 inches but stillll....</li>
            <li> there ok for the price.. dont like the microloops too sticky and messy...</li>
            <li> Great hair, so beautiful and blended into my fine natural blonde hair, and they are so much easier to use than the ones with separate rings. I used them to add black lowlights to the underneath of my blonde hair. I will most likely be repurchasing from this seller</li>
            <li> I ordered these based off the rating score. Some had some good things to say and some had ill things. My experience has been good. My beautician thought I had spent much more money than I did. It feels good and blends well with my hair. I will be ordering this again for my daughter. Oh and we had no problems with the clips at all.</li>
            <li> Great hair! Way to long for me and hard to get used to. Next time I will be doing the 18 inch!</li>
            <li> Sceptical at first but I&#x27;ll try anything once. I&#x27;m a former stylist and have done everything too many hair from color to see in exemptions and fusion. I wanted something easier and bought this. I love it! I&#x27;m used to the pulling and annoyances extensions of any kind come with so it&#x27;s no bother to me. I recommend buying 2quantities at a time as a start. I have short hair this time and added 10inches plus the 22now and I like to keep it long so,yup I beef another bag to replace the 10s. Loops make it very easy and quick to apply.</li>
            <li> I bought these hair extensions this past month and I gotta say that they are actually really good quality extensions.  I also got it in the mail alot faster than I thought it would take. VERY easy to apply,  will be definitely buying more!!!:)</li>
            <li> Very soft good product. Thin but for the price I double some</li>
            <li> The shipping was excellent.  The Hair was great!  Price Awesome! But the clamps that were attached were awful!  They should of used silicone or something else beside the metal that was hard to close onto the hair and hard to reopen without pulling out your hair.  Because of those clamps, I will not be using this seller again.</li>
            <li> I originally thought these hair extensions were awesome, I was WRONG. They looked great and natural, but you can&#x27;t brush all of your hair. And when you get tired of not being able to REALLY brush your hair, you&#x27;ll wanna take them out. When you take them out it is a pain because there is a TON of hidden mats and knots in your hair. I fear that they may have wrecked my real hair. I will never get micro bead hair extensions ever again.</li>
            <li> Got mine in today and practiced on a strand. It&#x27;s really easy and they look great! Feel soft and they&#x27;re really long. Got 200 strands. :)</li>
            <li> great hair quality you well need 2 packs for a full hair&lt;br /&gt;came on time&lt;br /&gt;easy to apply and so soft :)</li>
            <li> True to description and good quality! Thanks</li>
            <li> So I never really write a review but im going to on these extensions.  I got the #60 and the black ones. I love them. For the cheap price its great. Real human hair, can be cut, can be dyed (which by the way I toned mine so that&#x27;s how I know), and they&#x27;re really soft. I have washed my hair with these in and they dont really fall apart like people have said from what I&#x27;ve read. They stay in my hair really good. I dont know I just love these and I&#x27;m really picky on my hair. I thought I&#x27;d give them a try and here is my try. I will definitely be purchasing hair from this seller again. By the way I bought two packs and was satisfied with my hair. I still have a lot extra since my hair is so short and then. Another side note you might have to cut them if you dont like how not thick at the bottom it is. For me I love it so I dont have to do it myself. Just I love them.</li>
            <li> Received my order sooner than expected and the hair is great quality, overall a good buy! I had my links put on as soon as I received them and they look great! Great service!</li>
            <li> For the price u pay, the hair is excellent quality.  I&#x27;d say buy an extra pack just to be safe &amp; use it in thr future if u dont need it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 18\\&quot; before from this same seller and I loved them. Once again, I&#x27;m satisfied, this length is a true 22\\&quot;, goes all the way down my back and I&#x27;m only 5ft even. Blended well into my hair, I&#x27;m African American with non processed hair, only pressed out. If curled, they last all day without hair spray. Great hair, will purchase again and again!! Oh yeah and the shipping was very fast about 5-6 business days to Michigan. :-)</li>
            <li> I love the hair I bought.</li>
            <li> I love these. They don&#x27;t shed they&#x27;re easy to install and they are so silky. I haven&#x27;t styled them yet I love them how they are !!!!</li>
