    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have no complains about the item. it arrives in estimated time and in perfect conditions. Now I am using it and it has all the characteristics described in the announcement. Thank you very much for the purchase.</li>
            <li> I could never set this down after I used it the first time. My hair is naturally very curly (extremely small curls) and this straightened it out in seconds. I was also able to add waves (very big curls) with it. It also makes the hair appear little shiny, but I think that effect lasts only for an hour or two. The other reviewers who have given lower rating seem to have a problem with the plastic build - I think that will be a problem only if it falls way too many times.   TIP:  Even though this is a flat iron, you can almost make wavy curls by rotating the iron. Takes a little bit of practice.    PROS:   Easy to use   Small footprint   Comes with travelling case   Well packed   Low price  CONS:   Somewhat inflexible cord   Incoherent manual (should have come with easy to follow directions)  NOT DURABLE (Updated after 3 months)  Overall, I love it and highly recommend it.   UPDATE AFTER 3 MONTHS: I loved this product...that is, until the flat iron popped right out while I was using it about a month ago. This was both disappointing and frustrating because the deadline to return the item had already passed and the company refused to take the product back or issue a refund. So, I am revising MY rating to 3 STARS!</li>
            <li> This straightener worked really great for me.  I did notice when I first bought it how light it was, which worried me somewhat, but I used it nevertheless.  About a month after buying it, the logo on the side  (which covers some type of screw to keep the two pieces of the straightener together, I think that that&#x27;s it&#x27;s purpose, anyway) popped off while I was using it.  I didn&#x27;t think too much about it until I used it again last weekend.  It did not open and close properly.  I have to manually hold it together so that it straightens my hair.  I still have the piece that came off, and have tried to put it together, but it still doesn&#x27;t work.  I rarely even use the straightener, and it broke after less than five times of me using it.  Kiyoseki seems like a great idea, but it is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> My stepdaughter loves this straightener!  Her other one had broke and when we looked this one up online it was $140!  I was super happy when I found it on Amazon for a much lower price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron after seeing it on tv. It was quite expensive so I figured it must be good. Wrong!  My first clue was when it arrived and appeared very cheap and plastic-y. It is supposed to get very hot, but never got hot enough to thoroughly straighten my hair, even at the highest setting. I have thick, wavy hair, so perhaps this would be better suited for someone with thinner hair. Unfortunately for me, though, the only useful thing about this flat iron is the heatproof case it came with, which I am using with a different iron, and the hair clips that came along as a bonus. There are many better flat irons out there that cost the same or even less than this one!</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick, course hair, this think works like a miracle. After the first use, there was some lost in performance, but it keeps working great. I&#x27;ve had it for over three years before I decided to give it to my younger sisters. I&#x27;m looking forward to buying it again. And now instead of $140 with tax and S&amp;H I only pay $25. If it fails me like many people have been saying it&#x27;s only $25. That&#x27;s just shampoo at some salons. My only complain it that it does leave my hair feeling hot (410 degrees), but it doesn&#x27;t fry it. It&#x27;s very sleek. I love this thing.</li>
            <li> I have mixed hair Part indian, part spanish and part african american so it&#x27;s hard to find the right product without over processing my hair. Ive tried so many different types of flat irons and they burn my hair and damage it really bad even some chi irons did a bad job and I couldn&#x27;t find the right one, then I tried the kiyoseki mineral ceramic flat iron and it does wonders to my hair.. I love it!  [[ASIN:B0041E7GEO Kiyoseki Mineral Ceramic 3 In 1 Styler, Flat Iron Plus More]]</li>
            <li> At first I thought it didn&#x27;t work like they said it would, and then I watched the instructional video.  After some practice, I have found that it works wonders.  I&#x27;m so glad that I decided to buy it.  Also, at check out I signed up for an Amazon.com credit card and I only paid $3.99...The best four dollars I have ever spent.</li>
            <li> These flat irons are awesome.  It straightens my hair quickly and easily and leaves my hair feeling soft. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like I had heat on it. I loved them so much I purchased two more for my daughters. I only wish they made them a little more wider because if you try to straighten too much hair at once it will take you longer to get that section straight.</li>
            <li> Like this brand....did not use item as of yet but will soon!</li>
            <li> I ordered these flatirons because my friend had a pair and I loved them.  Maybe I should have gotten them from wherever she got hers because and it was these stopped working less than two months after I received them and it was too late to return them.  I was really dissapointed in this purchase from Icydeals.</li>
            <li> I have had 2 of these in the past year and a half. The first one went out in 3 months and the second lasted about a year.Both times seem to be a shortage of some kind. It is pretty good as far as preformance(better than wallmart or drug store brands). The paint does wear off after a few months. I paid $120 for mine!</li>
            <li> I have had my k styled for 3 years and to this day I am still impressed.. I have very curly hair that used to seem impossible to straighten. I would spend at least an hour and half straightening my hair. I heard about the kiyoseki styler from a review on YouTube and I decided to purchase it. It was 140 when I purchased it and the website offered a payment plan. I was still very skeptical about this product as I read a ton of bad reviews as well as good ones. I read things about how the paint came off or it fell apart and I have yet to see anything close. This product also replaced my curling iron, thank god. I love it and would definitely purchase again if I had to. :)</li>
            <li> I have a question.May you send me the product in its original package ? Please don&#x27;t envolve it in another box because I Want to import it to my country so if the package it&#x27;s bigger i will pay extra.Also the last time I bought the product you didn&#x27;t send me \\&quot;Crystal fuse conditioning mist, 2 ounce \\&quot;. If I buy a new product will you send me everything( that includes 2 Crystal fuse conditioning mist) Please answer mi doubts as soon as posible .Thnks</li>
            <li> Love my flat iron.  This is my second one.  The first one stopped working after 7 years.</li>
            <li> this is the second time purchasing this product. I love this flat iron. Just wished it was still available. thank you</li>
            <li> OMG! Okay so I been wanting to try this straightener for 2 years and when I finally decided to get it....I WAS DISAPPOINTED! My hair doesn&#x27;t even feel nice after straightning. It even feels and looks cheap? And the 2nd day I had it the whole thing just fell apart like the clamp that holds its all together just unscrewed and keeps popping out. My old hair straightner works better then this crap. i was basically just pissed know I have to look for a better straightener. WASTE OF MONEY &amp; I don&#x27;t recommend for any hair type.</li>
            <li> I had mines since it came out and I just gave it away BIG mistake the chi from target sucks and it burns my hair I won&#x27;t buy it from this sight but straight from kstyler it&#x27;s self also solia from folica.com is great 2!</li>
            <li> I love it I used it n it never burned or over process my hair it lasted me for many years now its time for a new only cuz my 14 year old got to it n its no longer working we have gotten great use of it I had paid 140.00 n it was all worth it hope its still the same just ordered a new one....</li>
            <li> Good product fast shipping</li>
