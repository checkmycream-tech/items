            <li>so when you dab makeup there it stays smooth.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say if it really reduces puffs and so forth as advertised, but it feels great and hydrates that delicate skin beautifully.  </li>
            <li>story short, use it right get good results, use it as a NIGHT cream</li>
            <li>I received this as as a free gift and find it very moisturizing.  </li>

            <li>and you will notce absolutely NOTHING</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t think that this price is very competitive as it is cheaper online at Nordstrom than it is here.</li>

            <li>The fine lines HAVE softened though, so at least I have that going for me!</li>
            <li>I have tried products from high end to low, and still no real improvement with circles.</li>
            <li>I used straight vitamin E oil (like out of a pill) and a slightly damp aspirin pill on my eyes.</li>
            <li>My recommendation is to massage it in to the skin really well as it can be a little greasy.  </li>

            <li> Because you only use a little bit, this jar will last sooo long!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to conceal dark circles that have suddenly appeared under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The tubes are the same amount, cheaper and typically you get an eye shadow pallet lip gloss mascara and eye</li>
            <li> In other words don&#x27;t just buy the jar/pot of it.</li>
            <li> I bought this due to rave reviews from other Amazon customers.</li>
            <li> : I have dark circles under my eyes that are</li>
            <li> SO dark people have wondered if I had bruises or was mal nourished.</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with dark circles and skin sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This cream (I believe) has helped with my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 months and  have noticed that it is a little lighter.</li>
            <li> So I have read a few reviews of this product of people saying it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t in the past, but I guess they were bought by Este Lauder who DOES test.  </li>
            <li> Then I apply my makeup as usual over the creme.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Clinique All About Eyes is a bit expensive, and that&#x27;s why it gets one star knocked down for me-</li>
            <li> 1st is this product which works almost instantly, then MAC prep and prime base visage which then evens out my skin tone and smooths my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes approximately 1/2 an hour to do so.  </li>
            <li> also it hydrates the thin skin</li>
            <li> I have the worst dark circles ever since I was a kid, I didn&#x27;t know you could ever get rid of dark circles.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Yes they are THAT bad</li>
            <li> bad days I need to use this product twice a day</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product so bad, I&#x27;ve been using it for months and didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all...</li>
            <li> After about 3 weeks of use I got a terrible eye infection (which I&#x27;d never had before) and nothing seemed to help.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good stuff.  I just wish Clinique didn&#x27;t test on animals.  They didn&#x27;t in the past, but I guess they were bought by Este Lauder who DOES test.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I received this as as a free gift and find it very moisturizing.  It hydrates the skin around the eyes nicely.  My recommendation is to massage it in to the skin really well as it can be a little greasy.  I put it on a night before I go to bed and don&#x27;t worry about rubbing it in too much.</li>
            <li> It arrived at time. Also, Was a nice to sse a new presentation on big size. My Wife love this brand</li>
            <li> So I have read a few reviews of this product of people saying it doesn&#x27;t work. It is becuase you are not using it correctly&lt;br /&gt;My background: I have dark circles under my eyes that are SO dark people have wondered if I had bruises or was mal nourished. Yes they are THAT bad&lt;br /&gt;as a kid I used straight vitamin E oil (like out of a pill) and a slightly damp aspirin pill on my eyes. As I got older I realized not the best idea in the world and so the hunt began for me and has now ENDED with this product.&lt;br /&gt;How to use. Right before you go out in public or before you put makeup on you use this. It is part of my make up AND au natural prep. 1st is this product which works almost instantly, then MAC prep and prime base visage which then evens out my skin tone and smooths my skin.&lt;br /&gt;On bad days I need to use this product twice a day but it ALWAYS works like fail safe works.&lt;br /&gt;It is not a moisturizing type product and won&#x27;t clog your face and won&#x27;t make it oily either!&lt;br /&gt;The price...well its steep BUT Clinique usually offers it in a gift pack for a fraction of the price. In other words don&#x27;t just buy the jar/pot of it. The tubes are the same amount, cheaper and typically you get an eye shadow pallet lip gloss mascara and eye make up remover (I JUST bought one for 25 and there was another one availible for 15)&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, use it right get good results, use it as a NIGHT cream and you will notce absolutely NOTHING</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this product and I use it twice a day.  I can&#x27;t say if it really reduces puffs and so forth as advertised, but it feels great and hydrates that delicate skin beautifully.  I used the Roc eye cream before I used this one, and the Clinique just seems gentler and more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Great for puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> I have to say that it has faded my undereye wrinkles. I am amazed! Lot&#x27;s of products claim to be having different effects, however Clinique&#x27;s All About Eyes is the one that faded my wrinkles in about a weeks time. I do recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> love this eye cream...if I run out, I see a difference within a couple of days. However, I don&#x27;t think that this price is very competitive as it is cheaper online at Nordstrom than it is here. Would recommend the cream though :)</li>
            <li> This is the best product the Clinique makes.&lt;br /&gt;Have been using it for years.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t imagine starting or ending the day without it.</li>
            <li> Good! very good trust this brand I love it nomatter what. It is very special. Good choices for me !</li>
            <li> I use this product every night.  It takes the puffiness away from under my eyes. I have used this for years.</li>
            <li> Its ok light weight yes,non greasy just didin&#x27;t do anything for me</li>
            <li> I bought this due to rave reviews from other Amazon customers. I have to admit I had very high expectations. I have dark circles and fine lines. I have tried products from high end to low, and still no real improvement with circles. I have been using All About Eyes for about a month now, and I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in my circles. The fine lines HAVE softened though, so at least I have that going for me!</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day, am and pm and love it.  My area around the eyes is very dry and this really helps.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to conceal dark circles that have suddenly appeared under my eyes.  I read the prior posts on how to correctly use it.  I dab on a little under my eyes first thing in the morning and let it soak in.  It takes approximately 1/2 an hour to do so.  Then I apply my makeup as usual over the creme.  I do not use this product as a night-time creme.  So far, it seems to be doing a great job reducing the circles.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this... It comes unwrapped and is not the real thing</li>
            <li> Exelent product, fast delivery</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years, and decided to purchase on line.  it arrived on time, and I am still happy with it. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for years and I am very satisfied with results. I definitely would recommend this to others and I have done so. Both of my daughters also use Clinique products.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product so bad, I&#x27;ve been using it for months and didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all... I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it...</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for your eyes.  Have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with dark circles and skin sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;This product is by far the only product I would use that would actually banish my dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For many weeks and months I have tried several products by Roc, Loreal, Garnier, Lancome- so many different companies, and for some reason- every single thing I used only seemed to make my problem worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clinique All About Eyes is a bit expensive, and that&#x27;s why it gets one star knocked down for me- It&#x27;s just more expensive than so many other similar brands,&lt;br /&gt;but it absolutely works.&lt;br /&gt;It works quickly. I want to say it&#x27;s like magic, but that would sound like an ad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It simply works. It works better (by a mile!) than any other product I tried for the same exact problem.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product. I&#x27;ve been using this for many years. I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> I have the worst dark circles ever since I was a kid, I didn&#x27;t know you could ever get rid of dark circles. I saw such great reviews on this and I bought it, I have been using for a week night and day and wow!! This stuff really works on both dark circles and fine lines! I&#x27;m so glad I don&#x27;t actually have to wear make up to cover it up!</li>
            <li> I have darkness under my eyes due to being fair skinned. I have been using this for about 2 months and  have noticed that it is a little lighter. also it hydrates the thin skin so when you dab makeup there it stays smooth. I also use around my mouth to hydrate tiny lines!!!!</li>
            <li> I usually love Clinique but this product was a nightmare for me. After about 3 weeks of use I got a terrible eye infection (which I&#x27;d never had before) and nothing seemed to help. Eventually I had to have surgery because my tear duct on the left side was so clogged. I can&#x27;t say for sure that it was because of this stuff, but I&#x27;d never had problems until I started using it. Now I have a scar on my face and my tear duct had to be completely rebuilt. This is probably a rare occurrence but I just wanted to share my experience!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a stocking stuffer for Christmas.  She has had this cream before and absolutely loves it.  This was a very good value for the 1 oz. size..</li>
            <li> Must have. Makes you feel really good and refreshed.</li>
            <li> this eye cream is amazing!  it feels wonderful and goes on so smooth....much nicer than the Clinique Rich for eyes which is a thicker cream.</li>
            <li> This cream (I believe) has helped with my dark circles.  Because you only use a little bit, this jar will last sooo long!</li>
