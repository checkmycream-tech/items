            <li>Thank you:)!</li>
            <li>Creamy, lucious, and has a nice floral scent.</li>
            <li>Thanks for this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s mostly organic which is great because my skin reacts indifferently to a lot of products that are easily available on the shelves.</li>
            <li>Most outstanding!</li>
            <li>And even though it is sold as a body cream, I&#x27;ve been using it on my face as a rich night cream and it works amazingly!</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now and like the light texture, which is surprisingly moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Great texture, not greasy, wonderful slight aroma (clove and honey?), and helping my eczema.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, it did moisturize my skin very well, and I loved the way my skin felt in the morning!</li>
            <li>Great product and arrived so fast!</li>
            <li>It has a very light texture.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of the face cream, and the body cream does not disappoint!</li>
            <li>This stuff is my latest favorite hand cream..</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d personally love something a lil fruitier or maybe just honey scent or even unscented.</li>
            <li>cream!&lt;br /&gt;Great company as well :)</li>
            <li>I recently started using it, and it is AWESOME!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended this product to my friends:).</li>
            <li>Not a scent I love, but a scent that I&#x27;m picky about.</li>
            <li>I love this company and I love the feeling of their products.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft &amp; smooth, plus it has an excellent ingredient list.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it for my whole body, but my hands and srms love it!!</li>
            <li>It has made my skin feel great, smooth and has a scent that is clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Bee Friendly for making such wonderful products!</li>
            <li>A really fine product.  </li>
            <li>When I apply at it at night and wake up the next morning, my face has a nice healthy glow!</li>
            <li>Thank you for making something so pure and effective</li>
            <li>Thank you for making such a great product.</li>
            <li>By nighttime, my skin still felt just as smooth and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I guess I was expecting a sweet, honey type scent - this is strongly scented with Lavender.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, really works well in relieving dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have eczema on my hands and sometimes my hands sting and break out  from trying lotions or creams but this stuff has only helped the inflammation and feels really good going on.</li>
            <li>This stuff is thick, non greasy &amp; smells great!</li>
            <li>I use two other Bee Friendly products, and can&#x27;t wait to try more!!</li>
            <li>It prevented my skin from peeling, and even soothed a mild sunburn.  </li>
            <li>but the skin absorbs it quickly leaving no trace of oil.</li>
            <li>I love my new moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It absorbed quickly, and wasn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked for years for the right moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love this body moisturizer, but the price is too high for frequent use .</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it was too oily</li>
            <li>I used this lotion first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>I like to use it immediately after showering, while skin is still wet and warm.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very concentrated.  </li>
            <li>My winter itch on my legs is almost gone, thanks to this stuff.</li>
            <li>A little went a long way - so this is a great value as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This organic body cream has a nice consistency and leaves the skin soft with a slight eucalyptus scent.</li>
            <li>Hoping they come up with some other scents as it&#x27;s not bad right now</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It costs a little more, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this stuff at first, because it isn&#x27;t thick and creamy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream if you are looking for a natural based, luxurious moisturizing treat for your skin!</li>
            <li>can get anymore natural than this</li>
            <li>Previous reviews are right on!</li>
            <li>The natural essential oils scents smell so amazing, but also subtle and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Last but not least</li>
            <li>This is a very thick and rich moisturizer, and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I took it on vacation with me to Cancun last week, and was pleasantly surprised to find that the facial cream worked equally well after a day in the hot Mexican sun.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely rich so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and not as dry.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This stuff is thick, non greasy &amp; smells great!

            <li> Excellent product, really works well in relieving dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is terrific cream. It is soft and goes a long long way.  It has made my skin feel great, smooth and has a scent that is clean and fresh.  I use it every night before bed and after every shower.  It absorbs into the skin and does not leave any oil spots on clothes or bed clothes.  I will purchase again and again.  Thanks for this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Love this cream! All their products are amazing!!!</li>
            <li> This cream is the bee&#x27;s knees:)! It is wonderfully nourishing. When I apply at it at night and wake up the next morning, my face has a nice healthy glow!

            <li> A really fine product.  This winter has been brutally cold in the Northeast, and this company&#x27;s body and facial creams really helped me rehydrate my skin.  A little goes a long way- it&#x27;s very concentrated.  I took it on vacation with me to Cancun last week, and was pleasantly surprised to find that the facial cream worked equally well after a day in the hot Mexican sun.  It prevented my skin from peeling, and even soothed a mild sunburn.  Last but not least, after I apply it to my face, I usually have a little left on my hands and fingers.  I have used that small amount to run my fingers through my hair so that it does not dry out and get so frizzy.  Hey- maybe they should start a hair care product line.  I would buy it in a heartbeat.  It costs a little more, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this lotion at all. I guess I was expecting a sweet, honey type scent - this is strongly scented with Lavender. Not a scent I love, but a scent that I&#x27;m picky about. This lotion has an &amp;#34;in your face&amp;#34; lavender scent that does not go away or fade.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency was thinner than I was expecting as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it did moisturize my skin very well, and I loved the way my skin felt in the morning! It absorbed quickly, and wasn&#x27;t greasy. A little went a long way - so this is a great value as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If not for the scent it would&#x27;ve been a 5 star product.</li>
