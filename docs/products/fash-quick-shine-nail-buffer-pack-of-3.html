            <li>The price is great too.</li>

            <li>This nail buffer is not terrible, nor is it the best.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think the shine was that good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good if you tear your unpolished nail, a bit.  </li>
            <li>I got what I ordered and it was on time and in good shape.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be good quality - haven&#x27;t bought from this vendor before -</li>
            <li>These work good.</li>
            <li>It was inexpensive and good in a pinch.</li>
            <li>good size, easy grip, happy with them.  </li>
            <li>I love these nail buffers, my nails have never been in better shape!!  </li>
            <li>They are so light and do a great job.</li>
            <li>I usually do my own nails.</li>
            <li>Nice pack of 3</li>
            <li>my nails buffed up to a nice shine.  </li>
            <li>I have been using another nail buffer that has very easy to follow instructions; as well as leaves my nails ultra shiny.  </li>
            <li>It makes your nails soft and shiny and the price is perfect.</li>
            <li>When you repair the break, you can get the fix looking nice without painting as many layers of polish over it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve honestly used better ....</li>
            <li>Very happy with our purchase, exactly as described, arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Did not work at all, very cheap.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better ones, but they were about 3x the price.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a great product!  </li>
            <li>They are ok for stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li>I ordered five more of the Fash buffers.&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Without polish, the effect of buffing the nails smooth is a wonderful, naturally polished look.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>I shouldn&#x27;t fault this buffer though, since I think most are probably this way, which is why it gets 3 stars for working.</li>
            <li>this was a ok buy, was looking for ones that would work better for my lady.</li>
            <li>she said the work ok</li>
            <li>I bought these as stocking stuffers and they are fabulous!</li>
            <li>These are okay.  </li>
            <li>That one is way better quality, and comes with instructions</li>
            <li>Product is ok , but after you throw out the packaging you will not be able to figure out which side is for what.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>If you cannot deal with satisfactory results, do splurge on a better brand.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>some people have more ridges than others, do it may takes a bit longer)&lt;br /&gt;(2) orange</li>
            <li>(You can take a swab of alcohol to your nails to remove oils and help the polish stick better - cleaner surface</li>
            <li>A nice smooth nail takes polish so much better.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;ve used much better.  </li>
            <li>They work very well and leave a very nice shine to finish the items with</li>
            <li>I did not think I could ever get my unruly nails to look good, but this FASH Nail Buffer Quick Shine is exactly what I needed!!  </li>
            <li>I love this type of tool because it is so easy, filer, smoother and buffer in one... but not this one.</li>
            <li>They work to smooth the top of the nail, which is what I wanted them for</li>
            <li>Three in one package, big enough for a good hand grip yet very light weight, they do a good job and not pricey!</li>
            <li>I received the product well before the final receive by date, it came exactly as described and it works great!!</li>
            <li>Super price, will order more.</li>
            <li>They have four sides, each primarily a buffer.</li>
            <li>I seen this and couldn&#x27;t pass it up for the cheap price.</li>
            <li>I liked these buffers so much that I came on Amazon and</li>
            <li>This buffer will smooth ridges but doesn&#x27;t accomplish any shininess at all.</li>
            <li>All sides are extremely smooth.</li>
            <li>The results are incomparable.</li>
            <li>I personally do it lightly once a week to keep up appearance, nothing perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Really happy with this so far so worth the money for those who didn&#x27;t get directions&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>so I can do my nails quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>It works great and really does leave your nails looking like a clear shiny nail polish has been applied!</li>
            <li>I rarely have the time to go to the salon so these are a dream!</li>
            <li>These do a nice job, so don&#x27;t fall for those kiosk at the mall, when you get more for your buck that does the same thing.</li>
            <li>A friend suggested buffing the top of the tips very well to smooth the exposed, layered edges.  </li>
            <li>Quick smooth and shine for my nails.</li>
            <li>They buff nails nicely and the shine portion seems to be holding up so far.</li>
            <li>Worth the cheap price</li>
            <li>Not expensive and an easy way to acquire a variety of buffers.</li>
            <li>not as great as other nail buffers I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>The nail buffers all seem fine, but it came with no instructions as to what side did what and which you were supposed to use first.</li>
            <li>You just do all four steps really quickly and there you go.</li>
            <li>I love my new buffer quick shine pads.  </li>
            <li>it is good, but still dont understand wich part is first, second and so..</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!!  </li>
            <li>I really like the nail buffer!!  </li>
            <li>this buffer gives an amazing shiny look to the nails, as if u r putting transparent nail polish on them , my nails looked lovely in few minutes</li>
            <li>Useful.</li>
            <li>For the price of this buffer it is worth it.</li>
            <li>After trial and error, I got a decent smooth and sheen to my nails, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I got these in replacement for the old Sephora buffers but they aren&#x27;t as good, they don&#x27;t seem to have enough stuff on them, they just don&#x27;t do the trick like the Sephora one&#x27;s did.</li>
            <li>You can get better quality buffers with the steps actually listed right on the buffer itself.  </li>
            <li>I bought this after watching my favorite youtube makeup girl talking about how to make your nailpolish last longer.</li>
            <li>It would have helped to have instructions in what side to use first.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>But it was not difficult to figure it out.]</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no instructions on which side to use first</li>
            <li>I will definitely be looking for a better quality product.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using these for the gentlemen at the salong; using the buff shines allows there nails to shine naturally without looking to phony.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t explain which side to use first and the colors I received did not match up to follow others instructions.  </li>
            <li>Works ok compared to similar products.</li>
            <li>First of all the directions for each color don&#x27;t match the buffer.  </li>
            <li>First of all, there are no instructions.  </li>
            <li>Will probably just get a better one from an actual store.</li>
            <li>It is very light weight, and I think I&#x27;ll order several more once I know how long one of them lasts.  </li>
            <li>They seem to be as good as the more expensive ones purchased from a beauty store.</li>
            <li>I use it for long conference calls, so I end up with a cute set of presentable nails afterward.</li>
            <li>They wear out after several uses, but they are pretty cheap</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried a few different of the FASH brand buffers and haven&#x27;t been happy with any of them.  </li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to get these when they were $0.99.  </li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I have used this to make unpainted nails very glossy, but that wasn&#x27;t my reason for buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there is so much difference between all side with the exception of the buffer side.</li>
            <li>Also, one side doesn&#x27;t seem to have any real function.</li>
            <li>The FASH is described as having different faces that file, smooth and buff.  </li>
            <li>This buffer however is very dissapointing.  </li>
            <li>(so I can have one at home, one in my gym bag, etc) for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>These work really well when trying to give yourself a manicure.</li>
            <li>They buff my nails really well.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much grain on the block</li>
            <li>I used it trial and error until I think I found the right ones, then marked then with pencil.</li>
            <li>I most definitely will be ordering more in the future, however one lasts a long time doing my nails once to twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think it took off enough off the top surface or shined it as much as the last nail buffer I purchased.</li>
            <li>is the least or most abrasive!  </li>
            <li>I would spring a little more to get a nicer nail buffer.</li>
            <li>I love these little things.  </li>
            <li>Going back to my gray, green and white buffer that leaves me with a great shine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than nothing, but not better than much.  </li>
            <li>That is the first one I got and after having it for a year and using it at least a dozen times, it still gave me a better shine than the new buffer from FASH.</li>
            <li>luck, I hope this review can assist you in your purchase and help you understand how to buff your nails if you&#x27;re new to it.</li>
            <li>With a little work, using the sides from rough to smooth, you can get a decent smooth semi glassy look from your nails.</li>
            <li>The cheap ones were not coarse enough to have any effect.  </li>
            <li>Instructions weren&#x27;t very clear as to which side is which</li>
            <li>All sides of the board feel exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>to be used once every 3 weeks, not more coz it weakens nails of used more often than this</li>
            <li>The guide for which part of the buffer you use first lists colors that aren&#x27;t on the actual buffer.  </li>
            <li>These blocks leave my nails VERY shiny and, most importantly, unlike the buffers on the expensive kit, the shine LASTS a long time.</li>
            <li>No need for clear polish...</li>
            <li>So far they have.  </li>
            <li>All natural attention to our nails.</li>
            <li>I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t be too surprised by now, but any buffer I have tried works once and never again.  </li>
            <li>This was completely misrepresented in the description.  </li>
            <li>There is no green or gray side to this buffer as the instructions indicate.  </li>
            <li>Most buffers only give you 3 different sides (the 2 smaller sides being the same), but this one gives you 4.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find a buffing block that didn&#x27;t cost a ridiculous amount.</li>
            <li>the first 2 sides seem to be of the same grit but 3 and 4 are obvious.</li>
            <li>These are okay but not nearly as good as the &amp;#34;Flash&amp;#34; buffer.</li>
            <li>Its good for smoothing out your nails, if you have ridges but other than that its not much good.</li>
            <li>the only problem is it has no directions of which side to use first, what direction to use on the nail and for how long.</li>
            <li>Other similar products have 4 distinct degrees of smoothness/roughness per side which I prefer.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and product is as expected.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that these are so wide, which makes the job so much easier.</li>
            <li>They make my nails look exactly like the nail salon product and for much less money.</li>
            <li>The colors on the ones sent to me are dark peach, light peach, pink and yellow.  </li>
            <li>Worth a few extra dollars.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have paid more money and gotten something that is actually usable instead of this guessing game.</li>
            <li>There all of the surfaces are very similar and therefore hard to figure out which side to use first (as they are not marked) also the strips started coming off before I had even finished my first hand.</li>
            <li>I had a few in the past which worked much better than this one.</li>
            <li>Several months ago I bought a rather expensive nail kit from a shopping network, but the buffers that came with the kit are not even half as good as  these ones.</li>

            <li> Super price, will order more.</li>
            <li> They have four sides, each primarily a buffer.</li>
            <li> I seen this and couldn&#x27;t pass it up for the cheap price.</li>
            <li> I liked these buffers so much that I came on Amazon and</li>
            <li> This buffer will smooth ridges but doesn&#x27;t accomplish any shininess at all.</li>
            <li> All sides are extremely smooth.</li>
            <li> The results are incomparable.</li>
            <li> I personally do it lightly once a week to keep up appearance, nothing perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Really happy with this so far so worth the money for those who didn&#x27;t get directions&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> so I can do my nails quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> It works great and really does leave your nails looking like a clear shiny nail polish has been applied!</li>
            <li> I rarely have the time to go to the salon so these are a dream!</li>
            <li> These do a nice job, so don&#x27;t fall for those kiosk at the mall, when you get more for your buck that does the same thing.</li>
            <li> A friend suggested buffing the top of the tips very well to smooth the exposed, layered edges.  </li>
            <li> Quick smooth and shine for my nails.</li>
            <li> They buff nails nicely and the shine portion seems to be holding up so far.</li>
            <li> Worth the cheap price</li>
            <li> Not expensive and an easy way to acquire a variety of buffers.</li>
            <li> not as great as other nail buffers I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> The nail buffers all seem fine, but it came with no instructions as to what side did what and which you were supposed to use first.</li>
            <li> You just do all four steps really quickly and there you go.</li>
            <li> I love my new buffer quick shine pads.  </li>
            <li> it is good, but still dont understand wich part is first, second and so..</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!!  </li>
            <li> I really like the nail buffer!!  </li>
            <li> this buffer gives an amazing shiny look to the nails, as if u r putting transparent nail polish on them , my nails looked lovely in few minutes</li>
            <li> Useful.</li>
            <li> For the price of this buffer it is worth it.</li>
            <li> After trial and error, I got a decent smooth and sheen to my nails, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I got these in replacement for the old Sephora buffers but they aren&#x27;t as good, they don&#x27;t seem to have enough stuff on them, they just don&#x27;t do the trick like the Sephora one&#x27;s did.</li>
            <li> You can get better quality buffers with the steps actually listed right on the buffer itself.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after watching my favorite youtube makeup girl talking about how to make your nailpolish last longer.</li>
            <li> It would have helped to have instructions in what side to use first.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> But it was not difficult to figure it out.]</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no instructions on which side to use first</li>
            <li> I will definitely be looking for a better quality product.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using these for the gentlemen at the salong; using the buff shines allows there nails to shine naturally without looking to phony.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t explain which side to use first and the colors I received did not match up to follow others instructions.  </li>
            <li> Works ok compared to similar products.</li>
            <li> First of all the directions for each color don&#x27;t match the buffer.  </li>
            <li> First of all, there are no instructions.  </li>
            <li> Will probably just get a better one from an actual store.</li>
            <li> It is very light weight, and I think I&#x27;ll order several more once I know how long one of them lasts.  </li>
            <li> They seem to be as good as the more expensive ones purchased from a beauty store.</li>
            <li> I use it for long conference calls, so I end up with a cute set of presentable nails afterward.</li>
            <li> They wear out after several uses, but they are pretty cheap</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried a few different of the FASH brand buffers and haven&#x27;t been happy with any of them.  </li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to get these when they were $0.99.  </li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have used this to make unpainted nails very glossy, but that wasn&#x27;t my reason for buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is so much difference between all side with the exception of the buffer side.</li>
            <li> Also, one side doesn&#x27;t seem to have any real function.</li>
            <li> The FASH is described as having different faces that file, smooth and buff.  </li>
            <li> This buffer however is very dissapointing.  </li>
            <li> (so I can have one at home, one in my gym bag, etc) for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> These work really well when trying to give yourself a manicure.</li>
            <li> They buff my nails really well.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much grain on the block</li>
            <li> I used it trial and error until I think I found the right ones, then marked then with pencil.</li>
            <li> I most definitely will be ordering more in the future, however one lasts a long time doing my nails once to twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think it took off enough off the top surface or shined it as much as the last nail buffer I purchased.</li>
            <li> is the least or most abrasive!  </li>
            <li> I would spring a little more to get a nicer nail buffer.</li>
            <li> I love these little things.  </li>
            <li> Going back to my gray, green and white buffer that leaves me with a great shine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than nothing, but not better than much.  </li>
            <li> That is the first one I got and after having it for a year and using it at least a dozen times, it still gave me a better shine than the new buffer from FASH.</li>
            <li> luck, I hope this review can assist you in your purchase and help you understand how to buff your nails if you&#x27;re new to it.</li>
            <li> With a little work, using the sides from rough to smooth, you can get a decent smooth semi glassy look from your nails.</li>
            <li> The cheap ones were not coarse enough to have any effect.  </li>
            <li> Instructions weren&#x27;t very clear as to which side is which</li>
            <li> All sides of the board feel exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> to be used once every 3 weeks, not more coz it weakens nails of used more often than this</li>
            <li> The guide for which part of the buffer you use first lists colors that aren&#x27;t on the actual buffer.  </li>
            <li> These blocks leave my nails VERY shiny and, most importantly, unlike the buffers on the expensive kit, the shine LASTS a long time.</li>
            <li> No need for clear polish...</li>
            <li> So far they have.  </li>
            <li> All natural attention to our nails.</li>
            <li> I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t be too surprised by now, but any buffer I have tried works once and never again.  </li>
            <li> This was completely misrepresented in the description.  </li>
            <li> There is no green or gray side to this buffer as the instructions indicate.  </li>
            <li> Most buffers only give you 3 different sides (the 2 smaller sides being the same), but this one gives you 4.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find a buffing block that didn&#x27;t cost a ridiculous amount.</li>
            <li> the first 2 sides seem to be of the same grit but 3 and 4 are obvious.</li>
            <li> These are okay but not nearly as good as the &amp;#34;Flash&amp;#34; buffer.</li>
            <li> Its good for smoothing out your nails, if you have ridges but other than that its not much good.</li>
            <li> the only problem is it has no directions of which side to use first, what direction to use on the nail and for how long.</li>
            <li> Other similar products have 4 distinct degrees of smoothness/roughness per side which I prefer.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and product is as expected.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that these are so wide, which makes the job so much easier.</li>
            <li> They make my nails look exactly like the nail salon product and for much less money.</li>
            <li> The colors on the ones sent to me are dark peach, light peach, pink and yellow.  </li>
            <li> Worth a few extra dollars.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have paid more money and gotten something that is actually usable instead of this guessing game.</li>
            <li> There all of the surfaces are very similar and therefore hard to figure out which side to use first (as they are not marked) also the strips started coming off before I had even finished my first hand.</li>
            <li> I had a few in the past which worked much better than this one.</li>
            <li> Several months ago I bought a rather expensive nail kit from a shopping network, but the buffers that came with the kit are not even half as good as  these ones.</li>
            <li> The variance between the other two sides is barely noticable, but the coarse and shine sides work well.</li>
            <li> and I find that I just leave several ridges and bumps because it takes too long to buff.</li>
            <li> I bought quite a few in the hopes they would live up to the expectation.  </li>

            <li> The only side that seems to do what it is supposed to do is the buffer, which does leave a shine on nail but without the other sides doing their job nails don&#x27;t hold the buff shine as well.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, the colors noted in the direction are different from reality.  </li>

            <li> The black printing of the logo comes off when you use the coarse side.</li>

            <li> I know these probably don&#x27;t last that long, but I&#x27;d at least like a few uses out of it</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very happy with our purchase, exactly as described, arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I have purchased these  buffers previously as part of a nail care set.  The FASH buffer set did not meet my expectations.  The prep side wasn&#x27;t quite coarse enough and the final shine side just doesn&#x27;t shine well enough.</li>
            <li> These do a nice job, so don&#x27;t fall for those kiosk at the mall, when you get more for your buck that does the same thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than nothing, but not better than much.  All sides of the board feel exactly the same.  I would spring a little more to get a nicer nail buffer.</li>
            <li> This buffer isn&#x27;t bad for the price. With a little work, using the sides from rough to smooth, you can get a decent smooth semi glassy look from your nails. I&#x27;ve used better ones, but they were about 3x the price. I&#x27;d definitely buy this again and keep a few on hand. BYW, for those who have mentioned they didn&#x27;t know the proper order to buff with each side, this buffer should be used in order...  Coral (says FASH on this side)  Pink  Yellow  Purple (for final glassy finish)</li>
            <li> Arm yourself with these and you&#x27;re set to go. Not expensive and an easy way to acquire a variety of buffers. Useful.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve give it 5 but it came without instructions and they aren&#x27;t written in the description! But I found them in one of the reviews. It makes your nails soft and shiny and the price is perfect.</li>
            <li> These are totally useless. They came with instructions which have no relationship to these files. Instructions say to use the gray side for filing... BUT THERE IS NO GRAY SIDE! They have four sides, each primarily a buffer. Nothing that actually files the nails. A total waste!</li>
            <li> I bought this after watching my favorite youtube makeup girl talking about how to make your nailpolish last longer. She was probably using a more expensive brand but to try it out I seen this and couldn&#x27;t pass it up for the cheap price. It works great and really does leave your nails looking like a clear shiny nail polish has been applied! You just do all four steps really quickly and there you go. Fast shipping and product is as expected.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to get these when they were $0.99.  I bought quite a few in the hopes they would live up to the expectation.  So far they have.  They buff nails nicely and the shine portion seems to be holding up so far.</li>
            <li> The colors were not well defined. I didn&#x27;t think the shine was that good. I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> The product was not the greatest in buffer.  I was a little disappointed in the shine.  It would have helped to have instructions in what side to use first.</li>
            <li> PERFECT!!!  No need for clear polish...I work in the health field where no nail polish is allowed...I just buff them and they are perfect!!!  Thank you for such a great product!  Fast shipping too!!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great buffers for at home attention to a lady&#x27;s nails. All natural attention to our nails. A beautiful shine is as good as colour!</li>
            <li> Really. Not happy with this product. I have had this type of nail tool for years. Apparently different brands. The file sides do not file and do not smooth nails. I love this type of tool because it is so easy, filer, smoother and buffer in one... but not this one. The only side that seems to do what it is supposed to do is the buffer, which does leave a shine on nail but without the other sides doing their job nails don&#x27;t hold the buff shine as well. I will be ordering a different brand.</li>
            <li> I usually do my own nails. I rarely have the time to go to the salon so these are a dream! I can file, buff, sand and shine my nails all with the same tool. I like that I only have a few things so I can do my nails quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;All 4 sides are the same (except for the colors).&lt;br /&gt;Even if there was a noticeable difference in the 4 sides, there is no way to know which order to use the sides in.&lt;br /&gt;I threw them in the trash.</li>
            <li> These are okay but not nearly as good as the &amp;#34;Flash&amp;#34; buffer.</li>
            <li> I like the buffer the only problem is it has no directions of which side to use first, what direction to use on the nail and for how long. Thanks.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with instructions.  I tried all sides, got a little shine for a less than a day, wouldn&#x27;t buy it again but wouldn&#x27;t bother to return it either.</li>
            <li> I got these in replacement for the old Sephora buffers but they aren&#x27;t as good, they don&#x27;t seem to have enough stuff on them, they just don&#x27;t do the trick like the Sephora one&#x27;s did. They are ok for stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> They are so light and do a great job. Several months ago I bought a rather expensive nail kit from a shopping network, but the buffers that came with the kit are not even half as good as  these ones. These blocks leave my nails VERY shiny and, most importantly, unlike the buffers on the expensive kit, the shine LASTS a long time. I also like the fact that these are so wide, which makes the job so much easier. I liked these buffers so much that I came on Amazon and re-ordered.&lt;br /&gt;[The instructions do not match the colors on my buffers. But it was not difficult to figure it out.]</li>
            <li> I needed to replace the Obey Your Body nail buffer and these are a perfect replacement. I received 3 for less than I would have paid for the Obey Your Body one! GREAT!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no instructions on which side to use first and you get only a few uses per block before you have to throw it away.</li>
            <li> Meh. I got these yesterday. I used them today. There all of the surfaces are very similar and therefore hard to figure out which side to use first (as they are not marked) also the strips started coming off before I had even finished my first hand. Once I finally got it figured out, I was disappointed in the end result. I will definitely be looking for a better quality product.</li>
            <li> I love my new buffer quick shine pads.  They make my nails look exactly like the nail salon product and for much less money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used products that have this design before and the sides had specific textures for their intended uses (filing, smoothing, buffing, shining) but all of these sides feel the same. They work to smooth the top of the nail, which is what I wanted them for but if you want a product that does all four functions, find something else.</li>
            <li> Buffing with the FASH gave minimal gloss compared to previous buffers . It smooths the nails, but not satisfactory job.</li>
            <li> The nail buffers all seem fine, but it came with no instructions as to what side did what and which you were supposed to use first. I tried looking up instructions online but I could only find instructions that referred to a \\&quot;peach colored side\\&quot; but I don&#x27;t have one of those! I guess that is the gray colored side on mine? Instructions would have been helpful.</li>
            <li> Instructions weren&#x27;t very clear as to which side is which</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  I later ordered some cheaper buffing blocks, and ended up throwing them in the trash.  The cheap ones were not coarse enough to have any effect.  The roughest side of these is only slightly smoother than a nail file.  I ordered five more of the Fash buffers.&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;I like this buffer.  I could feel the difference in texture with my finger tip, and the different colors help not to mix them up.  The orange side with the logo was roughest, turning smoother from pink, to yellow, to purple.  It is very light weight, and I think I&#x27;ll order several more once I know how long one of them lasts.  I have used this to make unpainted nails very glossy, but that wasn&#x27;t my reason for buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve a problem with my nails delaminating. In the days after shaping them with a file, the layers of the actual nail peel apart.  The result looks like chipped polish, even if I don&#x27;t wear any.  I tried all sorts of basecoats, polishes, and soaks .  It didn&#x27;t matter what I brushed onto my nails, they simply flaked apart, from tip backward up to 1/4\\&quot;.  A friend suggested buffing the top of the tips very well to smooth the exposed, layered edges.  It worked!  I can polish my nails and not see it peel back the next day.  Without polish, the effect of buffing the nails smooth is a wonderful, naturally polished look.  This block works great for that, too.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks, now, and it still works.  It&#x27;s also good if you tear your unpolished nail, a bit.  When you repair the break, you can get the fix looking nice without painting as many layers of polish over it.  I was glad to find a buffing block that didn&#x27;t cost a ridiculous amount. I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t be too surprised by now, but any buffer I have tried works once and never again.  In fact, I hadn&#x27;t even gotten to my toes yet, and this one was already beginning to wear out.  I know these probably don&#x27;t last that long, but I&#x27;d at least like a few uses out of it so I don&#x27;t have to spend a few dollars on one every month!  I shouldn&#x27;t fault this buffer though, since I think most are probably this way, which is why it gets 3 stars for working.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time. Does not work as expected. Could not use product for its intended purpose. I recommend purchasing from Sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I enjoy using these for the gentlemen at the salong; using the buff shines allows there nails to shine naturally without looking to phony.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am missing something but this buffer did not buff at all. I would not recommend this product. ...</li>
            <li> this buffer gives an amazing shiny look to the nails, as if u r putting transparent nail polish on them , my nails looked lovely in few minutes&lt;br /&gt;recommended to be used once every 3 weeks, not more coz it weakens nails of used more often than this</li>
            <li> Terrible product.  This was completely misrepresented in the description.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the colors noted in the direction are different from reality.  All but one of the sides are rough.  This buffer will smooth ridges but doesn&#x27;t accomplish any shininess at all.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a lot of different nail 4 sided nail file buffers and this is one of the worst. It is the best looking one however,</li>
            <li> I actually bought this item for use in polishing silver disks that I use to stamp names and sayings into. They work very well and leave a very nice shine to finish the items with</li>
            <li> The guide for which part of the buffer you use first lists colors that aren&#x27;t on the actual buffer.  So it&#x27;s your guess as where to start.  You can get better quality buffers with the steps actually listed right on the buffer itself.  After trial and error, I got a decent smooth and sheen to my nails, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect buffing block, shines my nails up great! I use it for long conference calls, so I end up with a cute set of presentable nails afterward.</li>
            <li> Doesnt work that well as advertised and has no directions.  Buy something else and save yourself the trouble.  Nails are not that shiny</li>
            <li> No issues at all with this product. Was a great price and works great! I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> it is good, but still dont understand wich part is first, second and so.. :d</li>
            <li> I really like the nail buffer!!  However, I wish it had instructions indicating which order to use the sides.  I used it trial and error until I think I found the right ones, then marked then with pencil. that was a mistake because the pencil comes off on my nails!  good thing I have 3 in the pack!</li>
            <li> this was a ok buy, was looking for ones that would work better for my lady. she said the work ok</li>
            <li> I bought these as stocking stuffers and they are fabulous! Everyone loves them and I would buy them again definitely!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t explain which side to use first and the colors I received did not match up to follow others instructions.  Works ok compared to similar products.</li>
            <li> I love these little things.  They wear out after several uses, but they are pretty cheap so it is no big deal.</li>
            <li> These are okay.  There is not a side that files ridges as well as I would like.  I don&#x27;t think there is so much difference between all side with the exception of the buffer side.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, didnt give the best shine that I was looking for.</li>
            <li> First of all the directions for each color don&#x27;t match the buffer.  Even so, this product does not work.  There is no green or gray side to this buffer as the instructions indicate.  The buffer matches the picture:  pink, orange, purple, and yellow.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get crazy about it! I had a few in the past which worked much better than this one.</li>
            <li> The 4 sides are only slightly different in texture.  Other similar products have 4 distinct degrees of smoothness/roughness per side which I prefer.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried a few different of the FASH brand buffers and haven&#x27;t been happy with any of them.  they do not offer the variety of files that i&#x27;m looking for.  all of the sides are basically the same on all that i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 of the items.  I most definitely will be ordering more in the future, however one lasts a long time doing my nails once to twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I got what I ordered and it was on time and in good shape.  However the description for each side used colors that were not on the product.</li>
            <li> The only negative comment I&#x27;m making about your product is that I have no real way to tell which of the 4 sides is the least or most abrasive!  There was no explanation sheet with that information and one has to use \\&quot;feel\\&quot; instead.  Probably not the best use of your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; [[ASIN:B002QY86BI Flash Shiner Nail Buffer]]</li>
            <li> All sides are extremely smooth. Doesn&#x27;t do a very good job at buffing ridges out of nails. Can&#x27;t tell which side is which.</li>
            <li> The directions that come with the package don&#x27;t match the colors of the different sides which makes this difficult to use. Also, one side doesn&#x27;t seem to have any real function.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed after using this product, for the results were poor. My nails were shinier before I used this product! I would NOT recommend this product to my friends &amp; family!</li>
            <li> These work great.  Quick smooth and shine for my nails.</li>
            <li> The FASH is described as having different faces that file, smooth and buff.  The sides are almost all identical.  No face has enough texture to file a nail.&lt;br /&gt;I can use these as buffers, but I&#x27;ll have to buy something else to do the rest.</li>
            <li> My husband bought these because my buffer from my Seacret nail kit was getting worn out. When I got these in the mail I was highly disappointed. The colors on the instructions didn&#x27;t match. My nails aren&#x27;t shiney. Just spend a couple extra dollars on the Seacret nail buffer. That one is way better quality, and comes with instructions and you only need to use 3 sides of the buffer.</li>
            <li> I have been using another nail buffer that has very easy to follow instructions; as well as leaves my nails ultra shiny.  This buffer however is very dissapointing.  I purchased these as gifts for the holidays, but saved one for myself.  First of all, there are no instructions.  The ones on this page do not match the colors on my buffer.  The colors on the ones sent to me are dark peach, light peach, pink and yellow.  After figuring out the grit of each side, I cannot for the life of me get anything like a shine from these nail buffers.&lt;br /&gt;What a dissapointment.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Going back to my gray, green and white buffer that leaves me with a great shine.  Worth a few extra dollars.</li>
            <li> Nice pack of 3 (so I can have one at home, one in my gym bag, etc) for a reasonable price.  Seems to be good quality - haven&#x27;t bought from this vendor before - and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I like these nail buffers a lot! Three in one package, big enough for a good hand grip yet very light weight, they do a good job and not pricey!</li>
            <li> I love these nail buffers, my nails have never been in better shape!!  I did not think I could ever get my unruly nails to look good, but this FASH Nail Buffer Quick Shine is exactly what I needed!!  Thank You!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product!  I have had no issues and everything was just as I expected.  The only suggestion that I have is that you put which side is for what purpose on the actual product.  I have to save the insert that was part of the packaging to know which side I should be using for what purpose.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all, very cheap.  Works no better than rubbing a sheet of paper on your nails.</li>
            <li> Product is ok , but after you throw out the packaging you will not be able to figure out which side is for what.&lt;br /&gt;Also they do not perform as well as the simple CVS or walgreen brand.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again because of above reasoning. This is a hint for the manufacturer to simply put a 1,2,3,4 on there.......</li>
            <li> This product may work but since it didn&#x27;t come with instructions who knows if they are using it correctly.  I saw directions on the product page but it references a gray, blue, pink, and green side but the product I received has gray ends, a peach side, yellow side, and 2 pink sides.  How is anyone supposed to know which side to use for which step?  I wish I would have paid more money and gotten something that is actually usable instead of this guessing game.</li>
            <li> not as great as other nail buffers I&#x27;ve had.  Didn&#x27;t think it took off enough off the top surface or shined it as much as the last nail buffer I purchased.</li>
            <li> This nail buffer works great and makes your nails shiny. Just like the salons! Super price, will order more. Like the colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve honestly used better ....i was quite upset with the results. Not much of a shine like a previous product i&#x27;ve used. :/ now they are sitting away not being used.</li>
            <li> I received the product well before the final receive by date, it came exactly as described and it works great!!</li>
            <li> Really happy with this so far so worth the money for those who didn&#x27;t get directions&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 use grey side&lt;br /&gt;Step 2 use pink side&lt;br /&gt;Step 3 use green side&lt;br /&gt;Step 4 use purple side</li>
            <li> The buffer has multiple abrasive sides and does not provide any shine for your nails. Its good for smoothing out your nails, if you have ridges but other than that its not much good. If you want shine, get the Flash Shine Nail Buffer. That is the first one I got and after having it for a year and using it at least a dozen times, it still gave me a better shine than the new buffer from FASH.</li>
            <li> This nail buffer is not terrible, nor is it the best. For the price of this buffer it is worth it. I have never bought one before this, but borrowed a more expensive kiosk buffer from a friend. The results are incomparable. For me this buffer will suffice. If you cannot deal with satisfactory results, do splurge on a better brand.&lt;br /&gt;Once and for all, because this buffer DOES NOT INCLUDE DIRECTIONS:&lt;br /&gt;Cut and file nails before buffing&lt;br /&gt;Use sides in this order (I buff side to side or horizontally)&lt;br /&gt;(1) pink (approximately 6-10 seconds for each nail until smooth - some people have more ridges than others, do it may takes a bit longer)&lt;br /&gt;(2) orange (same time)&lt;br /&gt;(3) purple (10-15 seconds per nail)&lt;br /&gt;(4) yellow (20-25 seconds per nail)&lt;br /&gt;Now, I don&#x27;t paint my nails. I simply buff to look neat, however, if you do paint them, now is the time. (You can take a swab of alcohol to your nails to remove oils and help the polish stick better - cleaner surface, cleaner look in the end)&lt;br /&gt;Remember, adjust times as needed for the results best suited to you.&lt;br /&gt;You must also be careful, you are, in essence, sanding and polishing your nails. DO NOT do this everyday. I personally do it lightly once a week to keep up appearance, nothing perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, I hope this review can assist you in your purchase and help you understand how to buff your nails if you&#x27;re new to it.</li>
            <li> These work really well when trying to give yourself a manicure. They buff my nails really well. The price is great too.</li>
            <li> This product does not have any directions.  It does not work at all.  My nails we not shiny after several uses,</li>
            <li> A three pack of nail buffers is perfect for someone who does their own nails like me. A nice smooth nail takes polish so much better. Most buffers only give you 3 different sides (the 2 smaller sides being the same), but this one gives you 4.</li>
            <li> This buffer does not come with instructions. The only instructions I could find are on the Amazon page where it is sold, except that the buffers I received have very different colors than the instructions given. I attempted to figure it out be looking at the various pictures of the product and comparing, but following the instructions from that gave me the polishing panel as step 3, and a rougher panel as step 4. So, after about 20 mins I gave up. Haven&#x27;t used them. What a waste! :(</li>
            <li> These work good. They seem to be as good as the more expensive ones purchased from a beauty store. I would purchase them again.</li>
            <li> It would be helpfun if there was some sort of Instuctions on what the different colrs (pads) are how to be used. Which pad for shine, smoothing etc.</li>
            <li> The directions are completely wrong.  It works....okay but i&#x27;ve used much better.  Worth the cheap price I suppose.  Will probably just get a better one from an actual store.</li>
            <li> The black printing of the logo comes off when you use the coarse side. The variance between the other two sides is barely noticable, but the coarse and shine sides work well. It was inexpensive and good in a pinch.</li>
            <li> my nails buffed up to a nice shine.  the first 2 sides seem to be of the same grit but 3 and 4 are obvious. wish they were numbered.  good size, easy grip, happy with them.  Sephora buffers seem to get my nails a little shinier.</li>
            <li> These buffers do the job, but very slowly. There isn&#x27;t much grain on the block and I find that I just leave several ridges and bumps because it takes too long to buff.</li>
