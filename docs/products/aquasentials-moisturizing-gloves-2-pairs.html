            <li>The price is great; it&#x27;s good to have 2 pairs</li>
            <li>This product is very great, the gloves are comfy and fit well.  </li>
            <li>so I do not think the one size fits all will hold good here.</li>
            <li>Good for hands that get abused by both indoor and outdoor work.</li>
            <li>In dish washing gloves I wear a size medium, and these gloves fit me perfectly.</li>
            <li>for me this one fits really good</li>
            <li>I lotion/cream up my hands really good a couple times a week&lt;br /&gt;right</li>
            <li>The lotion doesn&#x27;t get washed off during the night it can do a good job at that time.</li>
            <li>and this was a really good price.</li>
            <li>so I guess you could call them a good buy</li>
            <li>These are so nice and of a very nice quality.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be able to stand the smell!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more!</li>
            <li>The fit is great.</li>
            <li>Great price and the gloves fit my hand but the lotion one puts on one&#x27;s hands</li>
            <li>Excellent product and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Being able to read reviews helped me to make a good decision.</li>
            <li>They are nice because of the longer wrist.  </li>
            <li>They also wash nicely with no issues.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>The gloves are very smooth and fit great.  </li>
            <li>The material is very good, and love the colorful dos.</li>
            <li>They are also very comfortable, I&#x27;m not distracted by them in my sleep, in fact I think having warm hands has helped me sleep better.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>very comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>I used to have these kind of gloves before, &amp; now can&#x27;t seem to find them as easily in the stores.</li>
            <li>nice gloves  most comfortable moisturizing gloves</li>
            <li>overall very happy</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, these are just ok.</li>
            <li>I might buy them again if I don&#x27;t find better options, but I&#x27;ll be on the lookout for better ones.</li>
            <li>It is a lot more work for the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>But it is a lot more comfy for the users.</li>
            <li>They have an interesting design.</li>
            <li>just ok.</li>
            <li>Well What I can Say these gloves, are just great they are made very well.</li>
            <li>My hands are nice and smooth when I wake  up in the morning.</li>
            <li>These have lasted through many washes.  </li>
            <li>I did find that the lotion would seep out of the gloves making it not so enjoyable.</li>
            <li>As for the design, it&#x27;s not the best, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me since I only use them at night anyway!</li>
            <li>I just wish they covered more of my wrist because sometimes I get paper cuts there too.  </li>
            <li>bought these for my mom for christmas presents and she love it.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many pairs of cotton gloves to wear at night to help keep moisturizer on my hands.</li>
            <li>Most of the cotton gloves I wear stretch and fall off</li>
            <li>My rating was based on  because I have not been able to try it out yet to see if it was a five star or not.</li>
            <li>Will purchase more as needed.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
            <li>I love these, but they just don&#x27;t preserve moisture over a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>We have all been satisfied with this item.  </li>
            <li>What more</li>
            <li>I am SO glad I found these.  </li>
            <li>Excellent gloves, now if I could only get into the habit...  </li>
            <li>Much better than just cotton gloves that stretch, shrink &amp; fall off.</li>
            <li>glad i picked these gloves.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>anything else I&#x27;m touching.</li>
            <li>they seen to stay on better while sleeping i will order again.</li>
            <li>They are good quality, and they have stayed in good shape even after being washed several times.</li>
            <li>but these have just enough stretch to fit and hold perfectly.</li>
            <li>I have very dry hands in the winter and these gloves are perfect to apply lotion and sleep in.</li>
            <li>I have gardening gloves that fit better.</li>
            <li>I have long fingers and these gloves fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>The first lasted about a year, then ripped along the seams--- that is my own fault though, I sort of abused them by washing them every week.  </li>
            <li>They work fine for their purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have washed them once and they held up and did not shrink and the seams are fine.</li>
            <li>They are fine.  </li>
            <li>Helps tremendously!</li>
            <li>they hold in your moisturizer and the little bit of stretch is just perfect.</li>
            <li>these are awesome protect your heavy lotion from rubbing off onto your sheets;  they are light &amp; airy....</li>
            <li>Comfortable (if they happen to fit you)&lt;br</li>
            <li>They fit well and is made of quality material.</li>
            <li>These are the only gloves I have found that work great at night for my hands.</li>
            <li>they are comfortable and absorb the sweat caused by vinyl gloves.</li>
            <li>Also they are perfect to heavily cream hands, put gloves on and sleep in.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a medium build woman (5&#x27; 8\\&quot; - size 7 rings) and they are fitted, but comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve washed these quite a few times now (line drying), and they&#x27;re holding up perfectly.  </li>
            <li>They fit snug and work as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>(yes, I comfortably sleep while wearing them).&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, they&#x27;re worth it. :)</li>
            <li>They stretch to fit your hands.</li>
            <li>so they fit snugly.</li>
            <li>I have long fingers, great fit.  </li>
            <li>I am small (5&#x27;3\\&quot;) and the gloves fit me perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased the item to put on at night after putting hand cream.</li>
            <li>While all do the job with adequate moisturizer, these Aquabella gloves seem to keep my hands comfortable longer without the need to reapply lotion before I remove them in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Great to use for people who have dry, cracked hands and fingers.  </li>
            <li>Aquasentials Moisturizing Gloves are great, purchased to use them when applying balm for dry skin.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic gently form fitting gloves.</li>
            <li>Have tried several brands of cotton gloves over the years and these are by far the best I have tried.  </li>
            <li>They have a bit of stretch and fit nice and snug but not tight.  </li>
            <li>2-3 nights of use can clearly feel and see more moisturizer hands!</li>
            <li>Good fit, fabric is not thin, and last thru many washings.</li>
            <li>They cover my whole hand and wrist and are very comfortable to wear throughout the night.</li>
            <li>Since they were advertised as \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; gloves, I figured  there would be some sort of special plastic layer on the inside.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing special or moisturizing about the gloves themselves.  </li>
            <li>I have several pairs and always give them as a gift with a good hand cream.</li>
            <li>They have also held up nicely with frequent washing.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s best to mosuturize them and wear gloves to bed or for at least an hour or two a day.</li>
            <li>I like to choose exactly what moisturizer I put on my skin, so these plain gloves are perfect for that.</li>
            <li>These gloves fit well, wash well and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>People who have been giving this good ratings probably never took it off after an hour of use because this DOES NOT allow the fluid to be absorbed by your hands.</li>
            <li>The gloves are cute and will most likely do the trick.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t overwhelmed with these, they were adequate.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the Aquasentials Moisturizing Gloves I recently purchased on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>However, they feel soft inside and they keep my hands pretty warm.</li>
            <li>Good Item, serves it purpose, however have to be careful with the amount if cream that is placed on hand.</li>
            <li>They wouldn&#x27;t stretch and I felt like they absorbed the moisture instead of locking it into my hands.</li>
            <li>I have a skin condition on my hands and hoped that this would help as the dermatologist(s) have not been able to clear it up.  </li>
            <li>These are nice enough to wear for dress up.  </li>
            <li>The cotton material just absorbed the lotion.  </li>
            <li>originally bought these for a replacement for the many &#x27;beauty gloves&#x27; that appear on the shelves of the local stores.  </li>
            <li>The arrived right on time also.</li>
            <li>But, all in all, they do the trick and the price is right.  </li>
            <li>BUT WITH THE GLOVES AND THE RIGHT MOISTURERIZER</li>
            <li>There is nothing unusual or special about it.</li>
            <li>They were a little tighter than I would have liked, but they were still fine.</li>
            <li>I like these very much.</li>
            <li>I got these as an add on and they are better the other type I got as they stretch to fit my hands</li>
            <li>I am so happy with them it is so hard to find them</li>
            <li>well  not too hot for wearing overnight  </li>
            <li>but I just sew it up and throw them in the washer on hot because I use a heavyy duty greasey cream.</li>
            <li>Although I can say that I was surprised when he tried them on and they fit well</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find them to be any different or better than others I have purchased.</li>
            <li>My hands were really suffering from the winter!  </li>
            <li>Soft, comfy, correct fit.  </li>
            <li>I looked at many, and finally decided on these.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First off, I have psoriasis on one of my hands</li>
            <li>My hands are softer and all the cracks have healed within the first two weeks of using them.  </li>
            <li>hands age first</li>
            <li>but these gloves are exactly what I was looking for to re-hydrate my hands overnight.  </li>
            <li>is my first set</li>
            <li>They are light and comfortable...  did not take long to get used to wearing gloves to bed!  </li>
            <li>Fit fine but not much to go on about here...</li>
            <li>I thought that &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; meant there would be some sort of liner or special interior, and these are cotton gloves that are nothing special, plus they are way too big for me.</li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;ll shrink a bit so perhaps fit better with a few washings.</li>
            <li>So far these gloves have held up through a few washings and they fit nicely.  </li>
            <li>pretty much gets shoved off by putting on the gloves for the night.</li>
            <li>so I hope they last a good long time.  </li>
            <li>gloves too large to stay on , they need some type of stretch in them .  </li>
            <li>I did have to cut the tips off the fingers, though, so I could use my smart phone in bed.</li>
            <li>I always air dry these, so I can&#x27;t really say for sure.</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t understand why the size is so large.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t seem very durable&lt;</li>
            <li>The prints on the gloves is very girlish.   </li>
            <li>and you really should wash them after ever use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased numerous cotton gloves to wear at bedtime to keep my hands comfortable.  </li>
            <li>do, so I have found these to really help.</li>
            <li>I got them in a very timely manner, but they already have two holes in them just from putting them on and taking them off.  </li>
            <li>I have been wearing these gloves nightly for about 2 1/2 months now and they are holding up very well, with no holes or ripped seams.  </li>
            <li>The shipment was speedy and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>These gloves work real well holding the hand cream moisture to hydrate your hands.</li>
            <li>Stretchy and comfortable, the fabric is similar to something you&#x27;d find on a quality baby&#x27;s onesie.</li>
            <li>i have moist hands again thanks to the gloves.</li>
            <li>I believe these would be very good for ordinary dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered these gloves one other time and they&#x27;ve held together at the seams way better than others I have had.</li>
            <li>I have extreme eczema (sp?) and have to wear gloves for most household chores.</li>
            <li>To give you an idea of how big my hands are size 6 rings fit on my pinky size 7 on my left ring finger and size 8 on my right ring a size 9 will fit on either hand of my pointer and middle fingers.</li>
            <li>The name implies that it has extra special qualities that will keep your hand moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have big hands for a women and glad they make these large enough for me</li>
            <li>These gloves fit well, and have worked very well to treat my dry hands in the wintertime.  </li>
            <li>Very good, soft and pleasant, little bit difficult to put it on when hands are only just moisturized.</li>
            <li>so they fit my long fingers quite well.  </li>
            <li>just to be honest, my feet and hands are small anyway</li>
            <li>Nothing more or less.</li>
            <li>I use these to bed when I put a lot of lotion on, particularly for my cuticles.</li>
            <li>These gloves are great to wear with a thick lotion especially in winter.  </li>
            <li>I have several pair of these gloves, and I even cut the tips of the fingers off of one pair so that I can wear them over my regular hand lotion and still be able to use the computer.</li>
            <li>My older ones were falling apart</li>
            <li>I use them to moisture my older child&#x27;s hands.</li>
            <li>Decent product though.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Its size is far too large for me.  </li>
            <li>I usually buy size large gloves because the medium size fingers are too short for me; these in medium fit my hands just fine.</li>
            <li>They are ok but not stretchable so do not fit well</li>
            <li>After washing they shrink up a bit, but will return to normal after wearing again.</li>
            <li>Plain whites or skin color would look better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how these are any more moisturizing than plain cotton gloves.</li>
            <li>no issues for me, tight fit but yet flexible and very</li>
            <li>My hands were very dry and with one use they are soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable and cover my whole hand very well, actually past my wrists.</li>
            <li>The brand new gloves tore at the stitches</li>
            <li>They are think enough to feel like they are keeping the moisture in, however, they are also light enough that they don&#x27;t bother me while sleeping.  </li>
            <li>Very soft, 90% cotton and 10% spandex.</li>
            <li>My hands/wrists are long and narrow, so the fit is only okay.</li>
            <li>I have pretty big hands</li>
            <li>The only real issue is that I can&#x27;t use my touchscreen with these on!</li>
            <li>Have paid more for moisturizing gloves in the past.</li>
            <li>They are so old and worn, I needed to find a new pair.  </li>
            <li>I just use them at night after I apply oil to my dry hands to keep it from getting on the sheets and to help it all get absorbed.</li>
            <li>reversible (for my particular use, this is a big con as I can only use the right hand</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re light enough that I barely notice them when I&#x27;m falling asleep, and my hands are noticeably softer the next day.</li>
            <li>They help hand creams stay on your hands long enough to be absorbed!</li>
            <li>They are large enough that they cover the wrist.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is if use vaseline, it seems to stay in the gloves and the inside started changing color a little, so make sure to flip the gloves inside out and wash them to prevent rust etc.</li>
            <li>these fit well without much stretching, with a little bit extra on the fingertips, which didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve washed them once, and the both developed holes in them.</li>
            <li>I am a nurse and to say I wash my hands frequently</li>
            <li>It seems to be going well so far.</li>
            <li>The gloves keep the Vaseline on my hands and my hands are extremely soft in the mornings when I remove the gloves.</li>
            <li>as far as I can&lt;br</li>
            <li>word nightly, these gloves help to enhnace the natural moistures and even&lt;br /&gt;seem to help recover that moisture lost in a busy day.</li>
            <li>Thank you for this product and the soft comfort they provide.</li>
            <li>So far they are proving to be durable.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t do any &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34;, and any cream I put on my hands was absorbed by the gloves, and because they are so large, they were just plain in the way at bedtime.</li>
            <li>hands were dry, this cream along with the gloves at night time really helps alot!  </li>
            <li>However, like other reviewers, I do find them to be on the narrower side, so larger hands may not find them as comfortable.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 6&#x27;3\\&quot; and lg/xlg gloves almost always seem to be too small), but can easily wear these gloves.  </li>
            <li>These gloves wash week after week and slim down to their firm form fitting shape!</li>
            <li>only caveat that I can voice: The first couple of sets I tried developed about an inch-long split of the seam on the outside (pinky side) of the hand.  </li>
            <li>This was due to me trying to pull the gloves on from the wrist while the hand the glove was going over was freshly covered with moiturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hands are fairly small, and I find that the fingers are long and the body of the glove loose so even those with larger hands should also be able to fit well into them.</li>
            <li>Using these with a good thick lotion, wearing them overnight, really aids in healing dry rough hands.</li>
            <li>I need to wear them all day long and at night I have psoriasis,and they help so much.</li>
            <li>So much better than my prior ones, which you had to stretch a ton before even getting them on-and even then, they barely reached past my palm.</li>
            <li>The fingers on these were too long, so I can&#x27;t do much while I&#x27;m wearing them.</li>
            <li>These gloves are quality size and thickness yet not too thick, stay on real well,  comfortable cotton and last much longer thru numerous washings than the others I have purchased locally.  </li>
            <li>Use on my hands at night with moisturizing cream and the following day, my hands feel like new.</li>
            <li>We wash the gloves in the gentle cycle in a lingerie bag and it dry them.</li>
            <li>If you get dry hands this time of year,  these will really help.</li>
            <li>I have small hands &amp; these fit fine, though fingers are a little long, but doesn&#x27;t matter to me, it does the job.</li>
            <li>These gloves are very soft, yet very simple cotton gloves.</li>
            <li>even the length because my husband stands over 6ft tall and his long fingers and a decent sized palm.</li>
            <li>They generally stay on all night without falling off.</li>
            <li>My fingers split in the Winter and lathering on moisturizing cream at night and slipping on these gloves is really a hand saver for me.  </li>
            <li>and I refuse to work in the dirt with my bare hands.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a woman who has normal sized hands, but with long fingers.</li>
            <li>I have longer fingers, and these fit GREAT-they cover down past my wrist just a little bit and feel so comfortable on.  </li>
            <li>The gloves seem to work, but I often wake up without one or other of them on my hands so they don&#x27;t stay on very well..</li>
            <li>I have smaller hands but long narrow fingers and most gloves are either too loose or too short in the fingers.  </li>
            <li>THE GLOVES ARE NOT STRONG &amp; DURABLE, MINE HAS A HOLE IN IT, BY THE THUMB, I WAS VERY GENTLE WITH IT, WHILE PUTTING IT ON FOR THE 1ST TIME.</li>
            <li>so they just fit pretty loose, unfortunately.</li>
            <li>Unlike the thin cotton gloves available in drugstores, these thicker gloves hold up through many washings and last a few years rather than a few months.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>I am 5&#x27;9\\&quot; woman and the gloves are so tight on my hands that I have to tug them down to fit properly on my fingers.</li>
            <li>But if your hands are a little on the large size, they may not fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>

            <li> This product is very great, the gloves are comfy and fit well.  </li>
            <li> so I do not think the one size fits all will hold good here.</li>
            <li> Good for hands that get abused by both indoor and outdoor work.</li>

            <li> so I guess you could call them a good buy</li>

            <li> You won&#x27;t be able to stand the smell!</li>

            <li> The fit is great.</li>

            <li> Excellent product and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> Being able to read reviews helped me to make a good decision.</li>
            <li> They are nice because of the longer wrist.  </li>
            <li> They also wash nicely with no issues.</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>

            <li> I used to have these kind of gloves before, &amp; now can&#x27;t seem to find them as easily in the stores.</li>
            <li> nice gloves  most comfortable moisturizing gloves</li>
            <li> overall very happy</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, these are just ok.</li>
            <li> I might buy them again if I don&#x27;t find better options, but I&#x27;ll be on the lookout for better ones.</li>
            <li> It is a lot more work for the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> But it is a lot more comfy for the users.</li>
            <li> They have an interesting design.</li>
            <li> just ok.</li>
            <li> Well What I can Say these gloves, are just great they are made very well.</li>
            <li> My hands are nice and smooth when I wake  up in the morning.</li>
            <li> These have lasted through many washes.  </li>
            <li> I did find that the lotion would seep out of the gloves making it not so enjoyable.</li>
            <li> As for the design, it&#x27;s not the best, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me since I only use them at night anyway!</li>
            <li> I just wish they covered more of my wrist because sometimes I get paper cuts there too.  </li>
            <li> bought these for my mom for christmas presents and she love it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many pairs of cotton gloves to wear at night to help keep moisturizer on my hands.</li>
            <li> Most of the cotton gloves I wear stretch and fall off</li>
            <li> My rating was based on  because I have not been able to try it out yet to see if it was a five star or not.</li>
            <li> Will purchase more as needed.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
            <li> I love these, but they just don&#x27;t preserve moisture over a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> We have all been satisfied with this item.  </li>
            <li> What more</li>
            <li> I am SO glad I found these.  </li>
            <li> Excellent gloves, now if I could only get into the habit...  </li>
            <li> Much better than just cotton gloves that stretch, shrink &amp; fall off.</li>
            <li> glad i picked these gloves.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> anything else I&#x27;m touching.</li>
            <li> they seen to stay on better while sleeping i will order again.</li>
            <li> They are good quality, and they have stayed in good shape even after being washed several times.</li>
            <li> but these have just enough stretch to fit and hold perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands in the winter and these gloves are perfect to apply lotion and sleep in.</li>
            <li> I have gardening gloves that fit better.</li>
            <li> I have long fingers and these gloves fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> The first lasted about a year, then ripped along the seams--- that is my own fault though, I sort of abused them by washing them every week.  </li>
            <li> They work fine for their purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have washed them once and they held up and did not shrink and the seams are fine.</li>
            <li> They are fine.  </li>
            <li> Helps tremendously!</li>
            <li> they hold in your moisturizer and the little bit of stretch is just perfect.</li>
            <li> these are awesome protect your heavy lotion from rubbing off onto your sheets;  they are light &amp; airy....</li>
            <li> Comfortable (if they happen to fit you)&lt;br</li>
            <li> They fit well and is made of quality material.</li>
            <li> These are the only gloves I have found that work great at night for my hands.</li>
            <li> they are comfortable and absorb the sweat caused by vinyl gloves.</li>
            <li> Also they are perfect to heavily cream hands, put gloves on and sleep in.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a medium build woman (5&#x27; 8\\&quot; - size 7 rings) and they are fitted, but comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed these quite a few times now (line drying), and they&#x27;re holding up perfectly.  </li>
            <li> They fit snug and work as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> (yes, I comfortably sleep while wearing them).&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, they&#x27;re worth it. :)</li>
            <li> They stretch to fit your hands.</li>
            <li> so they fit snugly.</li>
            <li> I have long fingers, great fit.  </li>
            <li> I am small (5&#x27;3\\&quot;) and the gloves fit me perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased the item to put on at night after putting hand cream.</li>
            <li> While all do the job with adequate moisturizer, these Aquabella gloves seem to keep my hands comfortable longer without the need to reapply lotion before I remove them in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Great to use for people who have dry, cracked hands and fingers.  </li>
            <li> Aquasentials Moisturizing Gloves are great, purchased to use them when applying balm for dry skin.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic gently form fitting gloves.</li>
            <li> Have tried several brands of cotton gloves over the years and these are by far the best I have tried.  </li>
            <li> They have a bit of stretch and fit nice and snug but not tight.  </li>
            <li> 2-3 nights of use can clearly feel and see more moisturizer hands!</li>
            <li> Good fit, fabric is not thin, and last thru many washings.</li>
            <li> They cover my whole hand and wrist and are very comfortable to wear throughout the night.</li>
            <li> Since they were advertised as \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; gloves, I figured  there would be some sort of special plastic layer on the inside.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing special or moisturizing about the gloves themselves.  </li>
            <li> I have several pairs and always give them as a gift with a good hand cream.</li>
            <li> They have also held up nicely with frequent washing.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s best to mosuturize them and wear gloves to bed or for at least an hour or two a day.</li>
            <li> I like to choose exactly what moisturizer I put on my skin, so these plain gloves are perfect for that.</li>
            <li> These gloves fit well, wash well and the price was right.  </li>
            <li> People who have been giving this good ratings probably never took it off after an hour of use because this DOES NOT allow the fluid to be absorbed by your hands.</li>
            <li> The gloves are cute and will most likely do the trick.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t overwhelmed with these, they were adequate.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Aquasentials Moisturizing Gloves I recently purchased on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> However, they feel soft inside and they keep my hands pretty warm.</li>
            <li> Good Item, serves it purpose, however have to be careful with the amount if cream that is placed on hand.</li>
            <li> They wouldn&#x27;t stretch and I felt like they absorbed the moisture instead of locking it into my hands.</li>
            <li> I have a skin condition on my hands and hoped that this would help as the dermatologist(s) have not been able to clear it up.  </li>
            <li> These are nice enough to wear for dress up.  </li>
            <li> The cotton material just absorbed the lotion.  </li>
            <li> originally bought these for a replacement for the many &#x27;beauty gloves&#x27; that appear on the shelves of the local stores.  </li>
            <li> The arrived right on time also.</li>
            <li> But, all in all, they do the trick and the price is right.  </li>
            <li> BUT WITH THE GLOVES AND THE RIGHT MOISTURERIZER</li>
            <li> There is nothing unusual or special about it.</li>
            <li> They were a little tighter than I would have liked, but they were still fine.</li>
            <li> I like these very much.</li>
            <li> I got these as an add on and they are better the other type I got as they stretch to fit my hands</li>
            <li> I am so happy with them it is so hard to find them</li>
            <li> well  not too hot for wearing overnight  </li>
            <li> but I just sew it up and throw them in the washer on hot because I use a heavyy duty greasey cream.</li>
            <li> Although I can say that I was surprised when he tried them on and they fit well</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find them to be any different or better than others I have purchased.</li>
            <li> My hands were really suffering from the winter!  </li>
            <li> Soft, comfy, correct fit.  </li>
            <li> I looked at many, and finally decided on these.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> First off, I have psoriasis on one of my hands</li>
            <li> My hands are softer and all the cracks have healed within the first two weeks of using them.  </li>
            <li> hands age first</li>
            <li> but these gloves are exactly what I was looking for to re-hydrate my hands overnight.  </li>
            <li> is my first set</li>
            <li> They are light and comfortable...  did not take long to get used to wearing gloves to bed!  </li>
            <li> Fit fine but not much to go on about here...</li>
            <li> I thought that &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; meant there would be some sort of liner or special interior, and these are cotton gloves that are nothing special, plus they are way too big for me.</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;ll shrink a bit so perhaps fit better with a few washings.</li>
            <li> So far these gloves have held up through a few washings and they fit nicely.  </li>
            <li> pretty much gets shoved off by putting on the gloves for the night.</li>
            <li> so I hope they last a good long time.  </li>
            <li> gloves too large to stay on , they need some type of stretch in them .  </li>
            <li> I did have to cut the tips off the fingers, though, so I could use my smart phone in bed.</li>
            <li> I always air dry these, so I can&#x27;t really say for sure.</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t understand why the size is so large.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem very durable&lt;</li>
            <li> The prints on the gloves is very girlish.   </li>
            <li> and you really should wash them after ever use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased numerous cotton gloves to wear at bedtime to keep my hands comfortable.  </li>
            <li> do, so I have found these to really help.</li>
            <li> I got them in a very timely manner, but they already have two holes in them just from putting them on and taking them off.  </li>
            <li> I have been wearing these gloves nightly for about 2 1/2 months now and they are holding up very well, with no holes or ripped seams.  </li>
            <li> The shipment was speedy and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> These gloves work real well holding the hand cream moisture to hydrate your hands.</li>
            <li> Stretchy and comfortable, the fabric is similar to something you&#x27;d find on a quality baby&#x27;s onesie.</li>
            <li> i have moist hands again thanks to the gloves.</li>
            <li> I believe these would be very good for ordinary dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these gloves one other time and they&#x27;ve held together at the seams way better than others I have had.</li>
            <li> I have extreme eczema (sp?) and have to wear gloves for most household chores.</li>
            <li> To give you an idea of how big my hands are size 6 rings fit on my pinky size 7 on my left ring finger and size 8 on my right ring a size 9 will fit on either hand of my pointer and middle fingers.</li>
            <li> The name implies that it has extra special qualities that will keep your hand moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have big hands for a women and glad they make these large enough for me</li>
            <li> These gloves fit well, and have worked very well to treat my dry hands in the wintertime.  </li>
            <li> Very good, soft and pleasant, little bit difficult to put it on when hands are only just moisturized.</li>
            <li> so they fit my long fingers quite well.  </li>
            <li> just to be honest, my feet and hands are small anyway</li>
            <li> Nothing more or less.</li>
            <li> I use these to bed when I put a lot of lotion on, particularly for my cuticles.</li>
            <li> These gloves are great to wear with a thick lotion especially in winter.  </li>
            <li> I have several pair of these gloves, and I even cut the tips of the fingers off of one pair so that I can wear them over my regular hand lotion and still be able to use the computer.</li>
            <li> My older ones were falling apart</li>
            <li> I use them to moisture my older child&#x27;s hands.</li>
            <li> Decent product though.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Its size is far too large for me.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy size large gloves because the medium size fingers are too short for me; these in medium fit my hands just fine.</li>
            <li> They are ok but not stretchable so do not fit well</li>
            <li> After washing they shrink up a bit, but will return to normal after wearing again.</li>
            <li> Plain whites or skin color would look better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how these are any more moisturizing than plain cotton gloves.</li>
            <li> no issues for me, tight fit but yet flexible and very</li>
            <li> My hands were very dry and with one use they are soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable and cover my whole hand very well, actually past my wrists.</li>
            <li> The brand new gloves tore at the stitches</li>
            <li> They are think enough to feel like they are keeping the moisture in, however, they are also light enough that they don&#x27;t bother me while sleeping.  </li>
            <li> Very soft, 90% cotton and 10% spandex.</li>
            <li> My hands/wrists are long and narrow, so the fit is only okay.</li>
            <li> I have pretty big hands</li>
            <li> The only real issue is that I can&#x27;t use my touchscreen with these on!</li>
            <li> Have paid more for moisturizing gloves in the past.</li>
            <li> They are so old and worn, I needed to find a new pair.  </li>
            <li> I just use them at night after I apply oil to my dry hands to keep it from getting on the sheets and to help it all get absorbed.</li>
            <li> reversible (for my particular use, this is a big con as I can only use the right hand</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re light enough that I barely notice them when I&#x27;m falling asleep, and my hands are noticeably softer the next day.</li>
            <li> They help hand creams stay on your hands long enough to be absorbed!</li>
            <li> They are large enough that they cover the wrist.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is if use vaseline, it seems to stay in the gloves and the inside started changing color a little, so make sure to flip the gloves inside out and wash them to prevent rust etc.</li>
            <li> these fit well without much stretching, with a little bit extra on the fingertips, which didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed them once, and the both developed holes in them.</li>
            <li> I am a nurse and to say I wash my hands frequently</li>
            <li> It seems to be going well so far.</li>
            <li> The gloves keep the Vaseline on my hands and my hands are extremely soft in the mornings when I remove the gloves.</li>
            <li> as far as I can&lt;br</li>
            <li> word nightly, these gloves help to enhnace the natural moistures and even&lt;br /&gt;seem to help recover that moisture lost in a busy day.</li>
            <li> Thank you for this product and the soft comfort they provide.</li>
            <li> So far they are proving to be durable.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t do any &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34;, and any cream I put on my hands was absorbed by the gloves, and because they are so large, they were just plain in the way at bedtime.</li>
            <li> hands were dry, this cream along with the gloves at night time really helps alot!  </li>
            <li> However, like other reviewers, I do find them to be on the narrower side, so larger hands may not find them as comfortable.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 6&#x27;3\\&quot; and lg/xlg gloves almost always seem to be too small), but can easily wear these gloves.  </li>
            <li> These gloves wash week after week and slim down to their firm form fitting shape!</li>
            <li> only caveat that I can voice: The first couple of sets I tried developed about an inch-long split of the seam on the outside (pinky side) of the hand.  </li>
            <li> This was due to me trying to pull the gloves on from the wrist while the hand the glove was going over was freshly covered with moiturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hands are fairly small, and I find that the fingers are long and the body of the glove loose so even those with larger hands should also be able to fit well into them.</li>
            <li> Using these with a good thick lotion, wearing them overnight, really aids in healing dry rough hands.</li>
            <li> I need to wear them all day long and at night I have psoriasis,and they help so much.</li>
            <li> So much better than my prior ones, which you had to stretch a ton before even getting them on-and even then, they barely reached past my palm.</li>
            <li> The fingers on these were too long, so I can&#x27;t do much while I&#x27;m wearing them.</li>
            <li> These gloves are quality size and thickness yet not too thick, stay on real well,  comfortable cotton and last much longer thru numerous washings than the others I have purchased locally.  </li>
            <li> Use on my hands at night with moisturizing cream and the following day, my hands feel like new.</li>
            <li> We wash the gloves in the gentle cycle in a lingerie bag and it dry them.</li>
            <li> If you get dry hands this time of year,  these will really help.</li>
            <li> I have small hands &amp; these fit fine, though fingers are a little long, but doesn&#x27;t matter to me, it does the job.</li>
            <li> These gloves are very soft, yet very simple cotton gloves.</li>
            <li> even the length because my husband stands over 6ft tall and his long fingers and a decent sized palm.</li>
            <li> They generally stay on all night without falling off.</li>
            <li> My fingers split in the Winter and lathering on moisturizing cream at night and slipping on these gloves is really a hand saver for me.  </li>
            <li> and I refuse to work in the dirt with my bare hands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman who has normal sized hands, but with long fingers.</li>
            <li> I have longer fingers, and these fit GREAT-they cover down past my wrist just a little bit and feel so comfortable on.  </li>
            <li> The gloves seem to work, but I often wake up without one or other of them on my hands so they don&#x27;t stay on very well..</li>
            <li> I have smaller hands but long narrow fingers and most gloves are either too loose or too short in the fingers.  </li>
            <li> THE GLOVES ARE NOT STRONG &amp; DURABLE, MINE HAS A HOLE IN IT, BY THE THUMB, I WAS VERY GENTLE WITH IT, WHILE PUTTING IT ON FOR THE 1ST TIME.</li>
            <li> so they just fit pretty loose, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Unlike the thin cotton gloves available in drugstores, these thicker gloves hold up through many washings and last a few years rather than a few months.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I am 5&#x27;9\\&quot; woman and the gloves are so tight on my hands that I have to tug them down to fit properly on my fingers.</li>
            <li> But if your hands are a little on the large size, they may not fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t care for the stars and swirls pattern and will probably buy plain gloves next time.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is the fingers are way too long, but I have smaller hands, so that might be the problem.</li>
            <li> If you have large hands they may be too small.</li>
            <li> They work well but not sure if they really moisturize your hand.</li>
            <li> They hold their shape, the cuffs are long enough and the hold up well.</li>
            <li> I got these gloves and used my regular hand lotion (that alone was not helping the dry cracked skin) and wore them every night while sleeping.  </li>
            <li> If you have BIG hands, you probably shouldn&#x27;t dry these in a warm/hot dryer.  </li>
            <li> I wash them with a regular load of laundry, but I never machine dry them.  </li>
            <li> definitely recommend these to anyone with dry hands.</li>
            <li> Although i find it unnecessary unless you have super chapped hands.</li>
            <li> If I wear them more than once without washing them, they feel cold and soaked with lotion.</li>
            <li> Apply lotion before bed and wear the gloves all night long.  </li>
            <li> Maybe there could also be sizing for those with long finger nails, that might help.</li>
            <li> Not much difference between these and a pair of white cotton gloves that you put on after moisturizing your hands.</li>
            <li> Wearing these overnight with some thick lotion really helps seal moisture in.</li>
            <li> of the seams are well-sewn, and there is an obvious right and left hand, with a gusset on the thumbs to keep them from bunching uncomfortably.  </li>
            <li> These gloves are just plain old cotton stretch gloves.</li>
            <li> quality, thick (but not too thick) and soft so that I don&#x27;t have to worry too much about it tearing after multiple washes</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband who&#x27;s hands suffer from the dry winters we have.</li>
            <li> Fingertips would get so dry and cracked and</li>
            <li> Cracks and dry skin is gone and I can wear my rings again</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t before because my hands looked so scaly and dry).  </li>
            <li> My hands dry out from the work</li>
            <li> Air dry them, though.</li>
            <li> I purchased these so that I could apply lotion to my dry hands at night.</li>
            <li> Out in the dry West, dry hands are a problem for men and women all tear around.</li>
            <li> They are well made and seem to be helping to heal my dry hand and nail condition.  </li>
            <li> I wash them by hand and let them air dry</li>
            <li> I have dry hands, so I put lotion on and then wear these to bed sometimes.</li>
            <li> My hands are extremely dry and cracking, and I have been looking all over for gloves to sleep in at night so that my hand lotion does not rub off.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone who lives in dry conditions and struggles with applying lotion throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I get dry spots and a rash on my hand in the winter.</li>
            <li> , i let them air dry.  </li>
            <li> When they are dirty, I wash in hot water with clorox and they look like new.  </li>
            <li> My hands aren&#x27;t that much bigger than the average woman</li>
            <li> Some lotions have a small amount of dye or have natural color.  </li>
            <li> so these gloves are too long in the fingers and too wide.  </li>
            <li> CORRECT way to put these on under such conditions is to pull until the fingers are about half-way into the finger holes and then to press down between the fingers to get the gloved hand completly seated in the glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have extremely big hands and these work extremely well!</li>
            <li> I bought these gloves as I have been suffering from very dry hands.    </li>
            <li> They have made the biggest difference in my very dry hands.  </li>
            <li> When I put on lotion and then the gloves, the lotion sinks into the gloves all the way through.</li>
            <li> May not fit larger hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t deliver as expected.</li>
            <li> They might not fit for people with stubby, short fingers.</li>
            <li> I bought these gloves for my daughter-in-law who had rough hands a couple of years ago.  </li>
            <li> In the winter my hands get so chapped and rough</li>
            <li> ; 130 lbs, my hands are not tiny but not huge.  </li>
            <li> She is a small person and actually said they were a bit loose.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other similar gloves that are too loose as I have small hands.</li>
            <li> Wore them overnight and woke up with my hands just as dry as they were the previous day.</li>
            <li> I also have long fingernails which will wear the end of the fingertips and these gloves are thick enough to stand up.  </li>
            <li> was very simple gloves... and too small</li>
            <li> other thing I would suggest:</li>
            <li> I like moisturizing gloves that are fitted so that I can still type and do other things with them being in the way.  </li>
            <li> Nothing out of the ordinary -- just some cotton/spandex white gloves.</li>
            <li> The only negative might be that they could be a little tight, even though they stretch, for someone who has hands larger than a size 7.</li>
            <li> Then, it seemed all the work I had put into rubbing moisturizer cream into hands and fingers was a waste because my hands were dry after I took off the gloves.</li>
            <li> This makes them a little uncomfortable, but for the purpose of putting lotion on and falling right to sleep, they do the trick.</li>
            <li> I have a very average 7.5 size hand, and these gloves felt tight and restrictive, and therefore, not comfortable enough to sleep in.</li>
            <li> Would recommend that these be sold in sizes, since some people think they are a little small, and they are too big on my hands.</li>
            <li> They might be too small, however, for those with very long, or chubby fingers.</li>
            <li> Dry hands NEED these gloves even if you just wear them for a few hours while watching TV!  </li>
            <li> In fact, I often put lotion on my hands before I put on my garden gloves, and that procedure usually helps makes use my hands aren&#x27;t overly dry when I finish gardening.</li>
            <li> I have purchased moisturizing gloves in the past that fell apart, were too loose, and just didn&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
            <li> They are soft and just thick enough to hold in the lotion, without being uncomfortable while I sleep.</li>
            <li> PLUS IT DOESN&#x27;T FEEL SOFT, THE FABRIC IS HARD!!</li>
            <li> They are also fairly tight.</li>
            <li> If my fingers were longer/fatter, it would be tight.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s no special procedures to hide aging hands.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shrink like other gloves I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> I have started pulling them up a little farther to loosen them on my hand and that seems to help.</li>
            <li> I wish they were a little thicker, though</li>
            <li> I do wish they were a little thicker and cheaper</li>
            <li> They have a little stretch</li>
            <li> They are just cotton gloves with a little stretch.</li>
            <li> Does not fit my petite hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these gloves for a few months now and can see a difference in the appearance of my hands.  </li>
            <li> I have washed these gloves a few times and they held up well, no shrinkage.  </li>
            <li> These are thin, white fitted gloves.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> , I need to use heavy duty moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Would wear them at school and work with fabrics that are destroying my hands</li>
            <li> would not recommend unless your looking for just plain fabric gloves.</li>
            <li> too tight!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought at least 2 other alternative gloves to assist in treating my hand skin problems (i.e. atopic dermatitis bouts...!)</li>
            <li> Maybe I have small hands because other customers are claiming they are too small on them, but the gloves hang way off my fingers!</li>
            <li> add a little hand crème, slip these gloves on and they do help to soften your hands!</li>
            <li> have small hands and</li>
            <li> Do get small tears at the seams over time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been washing them by hand, so I&#x27;m not sure if they shrink.</li>
            <li> (all the reviews about them being too small),</li>
            <li> The gloves run a small size.</li>
            <li> but these gloves were too small for me.</li>
            <li> Some people have said they&#x27;re too small -</li>
            <li> I have rather small hands</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY IF YOU&#x27;RE LOOKING FOR GLOVES THAT WILL HOLD THE LIQUID, they&#x27;re useless unless you just want a regular pair of gloves.</li>
            <li> I asked her if she felt they were too small as others mentioned</li>
            <li> Unable to find any in stores, I finally turned to Amazon and found these.</li>
            <li> They have a small amount of cotten in them and they will probably shrink a bit.  </li>
            <li> do think that they are a bit small.</li>
            <li> I have small hands</li>
            <li> My mom loves moisture gloves and was in desperate need of a pair since she lost one of her old set, they were on her wishlist and she loves them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m small</li>
            <li> These are thick cotton gloves that you wear (usually overnight) after putting moisturizer on your hands, in order to prolong the benefit of the lotion and keep it from rubbing off.</li>
            <li> I found it very irritating to have to remove these gloves to turn the pages of the book I was reading in bed, since the fingers were so long that I couldn&#x27;t grip a page.</li>
            <li> but whenever I wear these gloves it sucks up ALL the oil</li>
            <li> He has a very small hand (size 7) and slim fingers.</li>
            <li> so they get dirty, callous and dry.</li>
            <li> but I felt these were a little uncomfortable between my fingers if I pulled them on all the way.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise my hands sweat which is not good for my nails</li>
            <li> *  Not too thick, not too thin.</li>
            <li> They allow lotion to slowly absorb into the skin (while not rubbing off on your sheets and blankets) overnight!  </li>
            <li> both fits perfectly no doubt.</li>
            <li> I am sorry I bought them</li>
            <li> Sadly the gloves didn&#x27;t work either</li>
            <li> The gloves that do feel too weird on my hands thou.</li>
            <li> The lotion that I put on my hands seeped through these very thin gloves and wound up all over the sheets.</li>
            <li> I just toss them in the laundry in cold water and have never had any problem with shrinkage.  </li>
            <li> VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND ILL-FITTED,</li>
            <li> I HAD A BAD RASH</li>
            <li> but they are REALLY bad in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Ugly pattern on both sides (not just one like the</li>
            <li> But i am just disappointed that just from Dec.when I ordered them they went up in price.       </li>
            <li> I HATE IT</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Does not fit my petite hands. Each night I sleep with them on and morning their off my hands. However, they feel soft inside and they keep my hands pretty warm. It&#x27;s recommendable for medium hands only.</li>
            <li> I have extremely big hands and these work extremely well!</li>
            <li> These gloves are just plain old cotton stretch gloves. Since they were advertised as \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; gloves, I figured  there would be some sort of special plastic layer on the inside. Nope. When I put on lotion and then the gloves, the lotion sinks into the gloves all the way through. If I wear them more than once without washing them, they feel cold and soaked with lotion. I&#x27;ve washed them once, and the both developed holes in them. They are also fairly tight. I am 5&#x27;9\\&quot; woman and the gloves are so tight on my hands that I have to tug them down to fit properly on my fingers. I would only recommend them if you are a smaller person.</li>
            <li> This product is very great, the gloves are comfy and fit well.  The only problem I have is the fingers are way too long, but I have smaller hands, so that might be the problem.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have small hands because other customers are claiming they are too small on them, but the gloves hang way off my fingers! This makes them a little uncomfortable, but for the purpose of putting lotion on and falling right to sleep, they do the trick. Very simple cotton material.</li>
            <li> Dry hands NEED these gloves even if you just wear them for a few hours while watching TV!  They help hand creams stay on your hands long enough to be absorbed!</li>
            <li> nice gloves  most comfortable moisturizing gloves I&#x27;ve ever had  work well  not too hot for wearing overnight  overall very happy</li>
            <li> These are thick cotton gloves that you wear (usually overnight) after putting moisturizer on your hands, in order to prolong the benefit of the lotion and keep it from rubbing off. The gloves themselves do not contain any moisturizer; they are simply cotton gloves. I like to choose exactly what moisturizer I put on my skin, so these plain gloves are perfect for that. They are 90% cotton, 10% spandex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;*  They feel soft&lt;br /&gt;*  Not too thick, not too thin. About the thickness of a tshirt.&lt;br /&gt;*  Comfortable (if they happen to fit you)&lt;br /&gt;*  They work fine for their purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have small hands and these fit well without much stretching, with a little bit extra on the fingertips, which didn&#x27;t bother me. This is great, because often \\&quot;one size fits all\\&quot; gloves are way too big. But if your hands are a little on the large size, they may not fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;*  Ugly pattern on both sides (not just one like the pics)&lt;br /&gt;*  May not fit larger hands.&lt;br /&gt;*  They don&#x27;t seem very durable&lt;br /&gt;*  More like a dollar store item, expensive for what you get&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t care for the stars and swirls pattern and will probably buy plain gloves next time. The pattern makes them look a bit dated and silly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these are just ok. I might buy them again if I don&#x27;t find better options, but I&#x27;ll be on the lookout for better ones.</li>
            <li> Do not buy these. Poor fit and too short. Buy Malcolm&#x27;s Miracle gloves - fits perfectly!</li>
            <li> I use these to bed when I put a lot of lotion on, particularly for my cuticles. The gloves themselves don&#x27;t moisturize but they keep the lotion on my hands when I sleep without gooping anything else like the sheets or my face. I like them.</li>
            <li> I bought these gloves as I have been suffering from very dry hands.    The brand new gloves tore at the stitches so I do not think the one size fits all will hold good here. I do not have very big hands so folks with big hands watch out...    I am ruing the fact that I have ordered 4. The prints on the gloves is very girlish.   Plain whites or skin color would look better.</li>
            <li> for the price these are the best, do not stretch out.  Do get small tears at the seams over time but I just sew it up and throw them in the washer on hot because I use a heavyy duty greasey cream. I have several pairs and always give them as a gift with a good hand cream.</li>
            <li> Good Item, serves it purpose, however have to be careful with the amount if cream that is placed on hand. Cause build-up on item, and difficulty in cleaning.</li>
            <li> These are the best gloves I&#x27;ve found, and I&#x27;ve tried almost everything.  Good fit, fabric is not thin, and last thru many washings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these gloves for a few months now and can see a difference in the appearance of my hands.  I am a nurse and to say I wash my hands frequently is an understatement!!  I wear them almost every night with my hand lotion and/or petroleum jelly and they protect my hands and bedding.  They have also held up nicely with frequent washing.  I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because I wish they had pattern choices.</li>
            <li> Good for hands that get abused by both indoor and outdoor work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these gloves one other time and they&#x27;ve held together at the seams way better than others I have had. They are lightweight, so you can still do things (such as turn a book page) while wearing them.</li>
            <li> They fit well and is made of quality material.I&#x27;ve tried other similar gloves that are too loose as I have small hands.I like that the thumb part is sewed on separately,unlike others that just extends from the same piece of fabric.It is a lot more work for the manufacturer.But it is a lot more comfy for the users.</li>
            <li> This product works! My hands were very dry and with one use they are soft and smooth. Just use a good lotion with the gloves!</li>
            <li> was very simple gloves... and too small</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband who&#x27;s hands suffer from the dry winters we have. He puts the topical lotions and ointments on and where the gloves at night. It seems to be going well so far. I haven&#x27;t washed them in the washing machine yet, I&#x27;ve been washing them by hand, so I&#x27;m not sure if they shrink. Although I can say that I was surprised when he tried them on and they fit well (all the reviews about them being too small), even the length because my husband stands over 6ft tall and his long fingers and a decent sized palm. The only thing I see a problem with is that they are not lined on the inside so the lotion soaks in a bit and you really should wash them after ever use. If I could find a glove that helped with the &#x27;moisturizing&#x27; part...I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
            <li> These gloves work great for their purpose. I just use them at night after I apply oil to my dry hands to keep it from getting on the sheets and to help it all get absorbed. They stay on my hands through the night. No oil leaks through. They have an interesting design. Very soft, 90% cotton and 10% spandex. They are medium sized. In dish washing gloves I wear a size medium, and these gloves fit me perfectly. If you have large hands they may be too small.</li>
            <li> These are the only gloves I have found that work great at night for my hands. I use this with Waxlene for my eczema and it seems to be the only thing that keeps it controlled.</li>
            <li> The gloves run a small size. These gloves are very soft, yet very simple cotton gloves. There is nothing unusual or special about it. It doesn&#x27;t seal any moisture, neither does it make your hands softer, even if used with a vast amount of hand cream. Like someother user suggested: you will get the same results if you put socks on your hands.</li>
            <li> These gloves are great to wear with a thick lotion especially in winter.  I have long fingers, great fit.  I also have long fingernails which will wear the end of the fingertips and these gloves are thick enough to stand up.  I have washed these gloves a few times and they held up well, no shrinkage.  I will buy these gloves again.  I also like the whimisical design.</li>
            <li> just ok. i rather just get some plastic gloves.</li>
            <li> I have a pair of gloves that I got from The Body Shop when I was a consultant.  They are so old and worn, I needed to find a new pair.  They are think enough to feel like they are keeping the moisture in, however, they are also light enough that they don&#x27;t bother me while sleeping.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Best gloves I&#x27;ve ever tried and best price of any quality glove I&#x27;ve ever bought. I have extreme eczema (sp?) and have to wear gloves for most household chores. I wear these under vinyl gloves.  they are comfortable and absorb the sweat caused by vinyl gloves. Also they are perfect to heavily cream hands, put gloves on and sleep in.  Allows cream to absorb and not rub off on sheets.</li>
            <li> They keep the lotion from drying overnight.  They are good quality, and they have stayed in good shape even after being washed several times. I don&#x27;t find them to be any different or better than others I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I used to have these kind of gloves before, &amp; now can&#x27;t seem to find them as easily in the stores. I just want something to wear at night to keep medicine on my fingers when my skin flares up. I have small hands &amp; these fit fine, though fingers are a little long, but doesn&#x27;t matter to me, it does the job.</li>
            <li> THE GLOVES ARE NOT STRONG &amp; DURABLE, MINE HAS A HOLE IN IT, BY THE THUMB, I WAS VERY GENTLE WITH IT, WHILE PUTTING IT ON FOR THE 1ST TIME. VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND ILL-FITTED, AND I DONT HAVE FAT FINGERS, IM GOING TO LOOK 4 ANOTHER BRAND. PLUS IT DOESN&#x27;T FEEL SOFT, THE FABRIC IS HARD!! I HATE IT, I HATE IT, I HATE IT!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased numerous cotton gloves to wear at bedtime to keep my hands comfortable.  While all do the job with adequate moisturizer, these Aquabella gloves seem to keep my hands comfortable longer without the need to reapply lotion before I remove them in the morning.  These gloves are quality size and thickness yet not too thick, stay on real well,  comfortable cotton and last much longer thru numerous washings than the others I have purchased locally.  Excellent product and reasonably priced.  The only negative might be that they could be a little tight, even though they stretch, for someone who has hands larger than a size 7.</li>
            <li> My hands aren&#x27;t that much bigger than the average woman but these gloves were too small for me. They wouldn&#x27;t stretch and I felt like they absorbed the moisture instead of locking it into my hands. Plus by the time I get them on I feel like all the lotion I put on is now on the glove. To give you an idea of how big my hands are size 6 rings fit on my pinky size 7 on my left ring finger and size 8 on my right ring a size 9 will fit on either hand of my pointer and middle fingers.</li>
            <li> for me this one fits really good i bought it along with the moisturizing socks same brand both fits perfectly no doubt. just to be honest, my feet and hands are small anyway</li>
            <li> The gloves are very smooth and fit great.  I am very happy with them.  The arrived right on time also.</li>
            <li> Well What I can Say these gloves, are just great they are made very well.I am so happy with them it is so hard to find them so when i did they had only 2 pair. Now i see they are in stock again and i am now getting 6 pair.I need to wear them all day long and at night I have psoriasis,and they help so much. But i am just disappointed that just from Dec.when I ordered them they went up in price.       Thank you Happy Hands In N.Y.</li>
            <li> I use these at night with my home made hand cream. They are comfortable and cover my whole hand very well, actually past my wrists. My hands are nice and smooth when I wake  up in the morning.</li>
            <li> These have lasted through many washes.  They don&#x27;t shrink like other gloves I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. I use them at night after I apply bag balm to my hands.</li>
            <li> I have a very average 7.5 size hand, and these gloves felt tight and restrictive, and therefore, not comfortable enough to sleep in.</li>
            <li> These gloves work great with the Working Hands cream!  They are light and comfortable...  did not take long to get used to wearing gloves to bed!  Fingertips would get so dry and cracked and hands were dry, this cream along with the gloves at night time really helps alot!  Gloves also wash nicely!</li>
            <li> My fingers split in the Winter and lathering on moisturizing cream at night and slipping on these gloves is really a hand saver for me.  The fit is great.</li>
            <li> These are thin, white fitted gloves. Nothing more or less. For the task of wearing at night to help moisturize hands, they&#x27;ll do the trick. Some people have said they&#x27;re too small - I&#x27;m a medium build woman (5&#x27; 8\\&quot; - size 7 rings) and they are fitted, but comfortable.  If my fingers were longer/fatter, it would be tight.</li>
            <li> gloves too large to stay on , they need some type of stretch in them .  I would not buy these again .  I am sorry I bought them</li>
            <li> I have rather small hands but I felt these were a little uncomfortable between my fingers if I pulled them on all the way.  I have started pulling them up a little farther to loosen them on my hand and that seems to help.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t deliver as expected.</li>
            <li> My hands were really suffering from the winter!  I have to go outside and check in vehicles as part of my job and I find it a pain to wear gloves and write on my check-in sheets. I got these gloves and used my regular hand lotion (that alone was not helping the dry cracked skin) and wore them every night while sleeping.  Cracks and dry skin is gone and I can wear my rings again (I didn&#x27;t before because my hands looked so scaly and dry).  Great purchase!!</li>
            <li> I advise anyone to put a pair of socks on your hands instead of purchasing these gloves. You will get the same result and save yourself some money!!!</li>
            <li> Great to use for people who have dry, cracked hands and fingers.  Apply lotion before bed and wear the gloves all night long.  These gloves will protect your clothes and bedsheets from getting greasy stains and allow the lotion to stay on your hands all night.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS. I use coconut, almond and castor oils to moisturize and soften my hands but whenever I wear these gloves it sucks up ALL the oil and my hands end up getting even drier. People who have been giving this good ratings probably never took it off after an hour of use because this DOES NOT allow the fluid to be absorbed by your hands. DO NOT BUY IF YOU&#x27;RE LOOKING FOR GLOVES THAT WILL HOLD THE LIQUID, they&#x27;re useless unless you just want a regular pair of gloves.</li>
            <li> Using these with a good thick lotion, wearing them overnight, really aids in healing dry rough hands.</li>
            <li> The dealer was awesome, however the product is okay.  I did find that the lotion would seep out of the gloves making it not so enjoyable.</li>
            <li> 1 glove ripped on the 2nd use. need a replacement pair. I will send this pair back!</li>
            <li> The gloves seem to work, but I often wake up without one or other of them on my hands so they don&#x27;t stay on very well..</li>
            <li> Aquasentials Moisturizing Gloves are great, purchased to use them when applying balm for dry skin. The material is very good, and love the colorful dos.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered these and uses them every night.  I asked her if she felt they were too small as others mentioned and she said no.  She is a small person and actually said they were a bit loose.  You will have to decide on that part,  but for what they are intended to be use for they are great.</li>
            <li> Soft, comfy, correct fit.  Heps keep moisturizer on the hands.  2-3 nights of use can clearly feel and see more moisturizer hands!</li>
            <li> Great Gloves for mosturizing. They cover my whole hand and wrist and are very comfortable to wear throughout the night.</li>
            <li> I thought that &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; meant there would be some sort of liner or special interior, and these are cotton gloves that are nothing special, plus they are way too big for me. I found it very irritating to have to remove these gloves to turn the pages of the book I was reading in bed, since the fingers were so long that I couldn&#x27;t grip a page. Then, it seemed all the work I had put into rubbing moisturizer cream into hands and fingers was a waste because my hands were dry after I took off the gloves. I don&#x27;t recommend these. They didn&#x27;t do any &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34;, and any cream I put on my hands was absorbed by the gloves, and because they are so large, they were just plain in the way at bedtime. I have gardening gloves that fit better. In fact, I often put lotion on my hands before I put on my garden gloves, and that procedure usually helps makes use my hands aren&#x27;t overly dry when I finish gardening. Would recommend that these be sold in sizes, since some people think they are a little small, and they are too big on my hands. Maybe there could also be sizing for those with long finger nails, that might help.</li>
            <li> I lotion/cream up my hands really good a couple times a week&lt;br /&gt;right before bed and sleep in these. My hands dry out from the work&lt;br /&gt;I do, so I have found these to really help. I may order a second pair.</li>
            <li> I slather my hands with Eucerin cream and sleep in these gloves.  The gloves are substantial and wash well.  I just toss them in the laundry in cold water and have never had any problem with shrinkage.  I have several pair of these gloves, and I even cut the tips of the fingers off of one pair so that I can wear them over my regular hand lotion and still be able to use the computer.</li>
            <li> would not recommend unless your looking for just plain fabric gloves. Fit fine but not much to go on about here...</li>
            <li> I got these as an add on and they are better the other type I got as they stretch to fit my hands (I&#x27;m a guy with big hands).&lt;br /&gt;They can go in the washer (Perm Press cycle).  Air dry them, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed these quite a few times now (line drying), and they&#x27;re holding up perfectly.  These are great moisturizing gloves.</li>
            <li> I purchased these so that I could apply lotion to my dry hands at night. They are soft and just thick enough to hold in the lotion, without being uncomfortable while I sleep. They fit snug and work as I had hoped. However, like other reviewers, I do find them to be on the narrower side, so larger hands may not find them as comfortable. As for the design, it&#x27;s not the best, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me since I only use them at night anyway!</li>
            <li> These gloves are the best I&#x27;ve found over the years.  Unlike the thin cotton gloves available in drugstores, these thicker gloves hold up through many washings and last a few years rather than a few months.&lt;br /&gt;All of the seams are well-sewn, and there is an obvious right and left hand, with a gusset on the thumbs to keep them from bunching uncomfortably.  I especially like the longer coverage over the wrist.&lt;br /&gt;The heavier-weight cotton means they can take the prescription creams and ointments I need to use in winter time without a &#x27;bleed through&#x27; that would stain the sheets (yes, I comfortably sleep while wearing them).&lt;br /&gt;These are one-size-fits-all.  My hands are fairly small, and I find that the fingers are long and the body of the glove loose so even those with larger hands should also be able to fit well into them.</li>
            <li> I handle a lot of papers on my job and needed something to wear on my hands to prevent paper cuts.  I just wish they covered more of my wrist because sometimes I get paper cuts there too.  I don&#x27;t use them for moisturizing so I cannot speak to that.  Great for preventing paper cuts if you shuffle papers all day!</li>
            <li> the gloves were not what I thought however  for the price i suppose that is what I would of got .  The did the trick .</li>
            <li> These gloves are great!  It helps keep the moisture in, great for people with eczema.  The only thing is if use vaseline, it seems to stay in the gloves and the inside started changing color a little, so make sure to flip the gloves inside out and wash them to prevent rust etc.</li>
            <li> too tight! Im 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; 130 lbs, my hands are not tiny but not huge.  I wear a size 6 ring for ex....</li>
            <li> Out in the dry West, dry hands are a problem for men and women all tear around. With these gloves, one can put the heaviest hand cream or lotion on hands at night and NOT smear sheets or pajamas. We wash the gloves in the gentle cycle in a lingerie bag and it dry them. An excellent purchase, as I type this with smooth hands!</li>
            <li> I got them in a very timely manner, but they already have two holes in them just from putting them on and taking them off.  they tear at the seams.</li>
            <li> These work great to wear overnight. I wish they were a little thicker, though</li>
            <li> This was the second pair I bought.  The first lasted about a year, then ripped along the seams--- that is my own fault though, I sort of abused them by washing them every week.  But, all in all, they do the trick and the price is right.  I use Vaseline on my hands at night so, I wanted something that would keep the Vaseline from spreading onto my sheets. The gloves keep the Vaseline on my hands and my hands are extremely soft in the mornings when I remove the gloves.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Aquasentials Moisturizing Gloves I recently purchased on Amazon.  They are well made and seem to be helping to heal my dry hand and nail condition.  Being able to read reviews helped me to make a good decision.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman who has normal sized hands, but with long fingers. They might not fit for people with stubby, short fingers. I say that these gloves allow my hands to breathe while still keeping my hand cream moisturizing. I do wish they were a little thicker and cheaper (they should come in a 2 pack for the price of 1). However, they&#x27;re worth it. :)</li>
            <li> These are fantastic gently form fitting gloves. They allow lotion to slowly absorb into the skin (while not rubbing off on your sheets and blankets) overnight!  Some lotions have a small amount of dye or have natural color.  These gloves wash week after week and slim down to their firm form fitting shape! Since I have started using them, my expensive lotions are now able to heal my hands without me limiting my movements until everything dries.  Plus, since I&#x27;m not up and around, the lotion stays on the skin without being washed off in an hour.</li>
            <li> I bought these gloves for my daughter-in-law who had rough hands a couple of years ago.  as far as I can&lt;br /&gt;remember they helped her hands get softer.  I would like to order some for me to sleep in.</li>
            <li> HELPED MY HANDS GET WELL QUICKER. I HAD A BAD RASH CAUSED BY REACTION TO MEDICATION. IT TOOK A WHILE BUT WITH THE GLOVES AND THE RIGHT MOISTURERIZER THE JOB IS COMPLETED</li>
            <li> I decided that gloves to wear at night (to lock in moisturizing lotion) might help my dessicated winter hands to heal--but which ones to buy?  I looked at many, and finally decided on these.  I chose wisely!  I have been wearing these gloves nightly for about 2 1/2 months now and they are holding up very well, with no holes or ripped seams.  I wash them by hand and let them air dry and there has been no shrinkage.  I am small (5&#x27;3\\&quot;) and the gloves fit me perfectly.  They might be too small, however, for those with very long, or chubby fingers.</li>
            <li> The gloves literally stink. It&#x27;s a strong chemical smell. I tried washing them, soaking them in a clorox solution, washing again. Don&#x27;t waste your money. You won&#x27;t be able to stand the smell!</li>
            <li> They are nice because of the longer wrist.  Do not put them in your Dryer!</li>
            <li> I thought they would hold the moisturizer in. They&#x27;re just regular fabric. I should have just used only winter gloves that had lost their mates.</li>
            <li> They just do not work - I no longer use them.</li>
            <li> They are ok but not stretchable so do not fit well</li>
            <li> Best gloves for applying hand cream to bed. I have tried all sorts of drug store brands but nothing compares to these. They also wash nicely with no issues.</li>
            <li> Bought these to wear at night over my psoriasis med on my hands.  They work quite well.  I have washed them once and they held up and did not shrink and the seams are fine.</li>
            <li> Very good, soft and pleasant, little bit difficult to put it on when hands are only just moisturized.</li>
            <li> bought these for my mom for christmas presents and she love it. very good for her hands.</li>
            <li> I like these very much. The lotion doesn&#x27;t get washed off during the night it can do a good job at that time. I like that it keeps the lotion away from the bedding and it actually saves on lotion because you don&#x27;t need to reapply it all of the time.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many pairs of cotton gloves to wear at night to help keep moisturizer on my hands. I have eczema and at times I need to wear gloves when I&#x27;m home throughout the day, too.  So far these gloves have held up through a few washings and they fit nicely.  Most of the cotton gloves I wear stretch and fall off but these have just enough stretch to fit and hold perfectly. I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> I have dry hands, so I put lotion on and then wear these to bed sometimes. They&#x27;re light enough that I barely notice them when I&#x27;m falling asleep, and my hands are noticeably softer the next day. I did have to cut the tips off the fingers, though, so I could use my smart phone in bed.</li>
            <li> The gloves are cute and will most likely do the trick. The shipment was speedy and the price was reasonable. Would recommend this to anyone. My rating was based on  because I have not been able to try it out yet to see if it was a five star or not.</li>
            <li> I have a skin condition on my hands and hoped that this would help as the dermatologist(s) have not been able to clear it up.  Sadly the gloves didn&#x27;t work either so I am going to go to an alternative medicine provider.  I believe these would be very good for ordinary dry skin.</li>
            <li> I shopped around for a while and this was a really good price.I haven&#x27;t use them too often,but it seems to accomplish their function.</li>
            <li> In the winter my hands get so chapped and rough, I need to use heavy duty moisturizer. When I apply at night, I need something to wear to protect the sheets from the greasy moisturizer. These gloves are perfect.</li>
            <li> these help keep lotion on your hands and not everywhere else and that was my intent so I guess you could call them a good buy</li>
            <li> I work with my hands (dog trainer/handler) so they get dirty, callous and dry. I refuse to have &amp;#34;old lady hands&amp;#34;. Slap on the Eucerin and put my gloves on before bed. Helps tremendously!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality at a fair price....word nightly, these gloves help to enhnace the natural moistures and even&lt;br /&gt;seem to help recover that moisture lost in a busy day. Will purchase more as needed.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
            <li> I love these, but they just don&#x27;t preserve moisture over a couple of hours. The gloves that do feel too weird on my hands thou.</li>
            <li> My hands are extremely dry and cracking, and I have been looking all over for gloves to sleep in at night so that my hand lotion does not rub off. Unable to find any in stores, I finally turned to Amazon and found these. They work great- just what I needed! Thanks!</li>
            <li> These are so nice and of a very nice quality.  They have a little stretch so they fit my long fingers quite well.  Very comfortable.  I wore them last night to bed with hand cream and feel they helped my hands look younger!  These are nice enough to wear for dress up.  Thank you for a very nice product.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several of these gloves several times, both for myself, and two others.  We have all been satisfied with this item.  I have pretty big hands (I&#x27;m 6&#x27;3\\&quot; and lg/xlg gloves almost always seem to be too small), but can easily wear these gloves.  My hands crack open all year but they are REALLY bad in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought these for a replacement for the many &#x27;beauty gloves&#x27; that appear on the shelves of the local stores.  The local gloves were -- for the most part -- all cotton gloves, were too small, and -- even though they were small -- they would still stretch out and fall off during the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Aquasentials Moisturizing Gloves *do* stay on all night.  They are large enough that they cover the wrist.  What more can I say?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only caveat that I can voice: The first couple of sets I tried developed about an inch-long split of the seam on the outside (pinky side) of the hand.  This was due to me trying to pull the gloves on from the wrist while the hand the glove was going over was freshly covered with moiturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CORRECT way to put these on under such conditions is to pull until the fingers are about half-way into the finger holes and then to press down between the fingers to get the gloved hand completly seated in the glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had NO split seams since modifying my method for putting these on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, putting them on a non-moist hand is NO problem: Just pull from the wrist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only other thing I would suggest: If you have BIG hands, you probably shouldn&#x27;t dry these in a warm/hot dryer.  They have a small amount of cotten in them and they will probably shrink a bit.  I always air dry these, so I can&#x27;t really say for sure.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how these are any more moisturizing than plain cotton gloves. The name implies that it has extra special qualities that will keep your hand moisturized. I don&#x27;t see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have eczema and I use these so that my eczema cream will not get rubbed off on the sheets or on my kids when check on the kids in the middle of the night. For that, it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think that they are a bit small. My hands a small-ish, size 4.5 - 5 on ring fingers. While they do have a bit of a stretch, when I wear them, the finger parts are a big snug while the palm part have plenty of room.</li>
            <li> I apply lotion and wear cotton gloves to bed every evening.  My older ones were falling apart so I decided to try and find something to replace them.  I am SO glad I found these.  I have smaller hands but long narrow fingers and most gloves are either too loose or too short in the fingers.  These are perfection!  I like the stretch, I like the coolness and the comfort.  I even bought another pair so I hope they last a good long time.  I&#x27;m sold on these.</li>
            <li> Excellent gloves, now if I could only get into the habit...  The only real issue is that I can&#x27;t use my touchscreen with these on!</li>
            <li> The lotion that I put on my hands seeped through these very thin gloves and wound up all over the sheets. I am now using vinyl gloves that I purchased here on Amazon. I slather my hand with lotion, put the vinyl gloves on and my hand are moisturized when I wake up. That solved the problem for me.</li>
            <li> First off, I have psoriasis on one of my hands so I bought these gloves so that I can keep that hand moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Great quality, thick (but not too thick) and soft so that I don&#x27;t have to worry too much about it tearing after multiple washes&lt;br /&gt;-Good price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Not reversible (for my particular use, this is a big con as I can only use the right hand glove)&lt;br /&gt;-Too big.  I have small hands so these gloves are too long in the fingers and too wide.  I like moisturizing gloves that are fitted so that I can still type and do other things with them being in the way.  With these gloves, I can&#x27;t type without hitting multiple keys.</li>
            <li> These are great for moisturizing. They are just cotton gloves with a little stretch. I use them to moisture my older child&#x27;s hands. I think they&#x27;ll shrink a bit so perhaps fit better with a few washings. He has a very small hand (size 7) and slim fingers.</li>
            <li> These gloves work real well holding the hand cream moisture to hydrate your hands. They stretch to fit your hands. The polka dots are just as shown, must have been added to differentiate them from plane cotton gloves.</li>
            <li> My mom loves moisture gloves and was in desperate need of a pair since she lost one of her old set, they were on her wishlist and she loves them.</li>
            <li> I have longer fingers, and these fit GREAT-they cover down past my wrist just a little bit and feel so comfortable on.  So much better than my prior ones, which you had to stretch a ton before even getting them on-and even then, they barely reached past my palm.</li>
            <li> My hands stay relatively moist while using the gloves. I&#x27;m small so they just fit pretty loose, unfortunately. I wish I can get a darker color as well.</li>
            <li> These gloves fit well, and have worked very well to treat my dry hands in the wintertime.  I wash them with a regular load of laundry, but I never machine dry them.  I hang them up to air-dry.  After washing they shrink up a bit, but will return to normal after wearing again.</li>
            <li> Item was as described</li>
            <li> The Aquasentials Moisturizing Gloves work wonders.  My hands are softer and all the cracks have healed within the first two weeks of using them.  I would recommend to anyone who lives in dry conditions and struggles with applying lotion throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything.  The cotton material just absorbed the lotion.  Wore them overnight and woke up with my hands just as dry as they were the previous day.</li>
            <li> These do have some stretch to them so they fit snugly. They generally stay on all night without falling off. Much better than just cotton gloves that stretch, shrink &amp; fall off. Put on hand lotion, then put these on for the night.</li>
            <li> Happy with these gloves. I don&#x27;t know about the gloves moisturizing, I put hand cream on, then the gloves. I haven&#x27;t washed them yet, I&#x27;ll probably hand wash them.</li>
            <li> Use on my hands at night with moisturizing cream and the following day, my hands feel like new.</li>
            <li> Nice. Would wear them at school and work with fabrics that are destroying my hands There is a stretch to them that soothes my arthritic hands.</li>
            <li> Item is as described. Great value for the money. very comfortable to wear. I originally purchased the item to put on at night after putting hand cream. Although i find it unnecessary unless you have super chapped hands. Decent product though.</li>
            <li> Yes these are moisturizing gloves...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why would you need these you ask?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your hands age first and there&#x27;s no special procedures to hide aging hands. To reverse the signs of aging in your hands it&#x27;s best to mosuturize them and wear gloves to bed or for at least an hour or two a day.</li>
            <li> these are awesome protect your heavy lotion from rubbing off onto your sheets;  they are light &amp; airy....glad i picked these gloves.</li>
            <li> Have tried several brands of cotton gloves over the years and these are by far the best I have tried.  Us them at night with moisturizing cream.  They hold their shape, the cuffs are long enough and the hold up well.</li>
            <li> Its size is far too large for me.  Quality is quite acceptable but I really don&#x27;t understand why the size is so large.</li>
            <li> I just received my gloves this week, so I can&#x27;t comment on how well they hold up,  but these gloves are exactly what I was looking for to re-hydrate my hands overnight.  The price is great; it&#x27;s good to have 2 pairs so you have a pair to wear while the others are in the wash.&lt;br /&gt;  If you get dry hands this time of year,  these will really help.</li>
            <li> The gloves were received as advertised. I haven&#x27;t noticed any great improvement between using and not using them from a moisturizing stand point.</li>
            <li> These gloves are great. They work well but not sure if they really moisturize your hand. I wear them nightly</li>
            <li> I get dry spots and a rash on my hand in the winter. Wearing these overnight with some thick lotion really helps seal moisture in.</li>
            <li> no issues for me, tight fit but yet flexible and very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first set but and they work great.</li>
            <li> I have big hands for a women and glad they make these large enough for me</li>
            <li> These gloves are great. Stretchy and comfortable, the fabric is similar to something you&#x27;d find on a quality baby&#x27;s onesie. I usually buy size large gloves because the medium size fingers are too short for me; these in medium fit my hands just fine. I can even do stuff on my touch screen phone while wearing these gloves. Love them.</li>
            <li> They are fine.  I have not washed them.  So I don&#x27;t know how they would be like after a wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought at least 2 other alternative gloves to assist in treating my hand skin problems (i.e. atopic dermatitis bouts...!) and UNTIL THIS AQUASENTIALS GLOVES NONE KEPT MOISTURE AND HELD-UP TO MY NEEDS...I&#x27;ve used them for a continuous period of 16-18 days and brought my problem UNDER TOTAL CONTROL...(and I PLACED THEM IN THE WASHING MACHINE EVERY 3/4 DAYS !)</li>
            <li> I do not believe these are moisturizing gloves.  If you load your hands with vaseline and put these gloves on, they work okay.  I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Have paid more for moisturizing gloves in the past. These gloves fit well, wash well and the price was right.  Would definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> Great price and the gloves fit my hand but the lotion one puts on one&#x27;s hands pretty much gets shoved off by putting on the gloves for the night.</li>
            <li> these are great and I use them for medicine on my hands.  Thank you for this product and the soft comfort they provide.</li>
            <li> I put these gloves on before putting the rubber type on, when gardening.  Otherwise my hands sweat which is not good for my nails and I refuse to work in the dirt with my bare hands.  When they are dirty, I wash in hot water with clorox and they look like new.  My husband uses his at night after putting a prescription cream on his hands.  Perfect gloves for both of us.</li>
            <li> Used with Aveeno eczema therapy moisturizing cream. Enhanced the results I got with the cream being used alone.</li>
            <li> I sleep in these in the winter after I slather lotion all over my hands.  In the morning the healing is visible.  I wash these gloves in the washing machine in my mesh linen bag.</li>
            <li> these gloves are great!  they hold in your moisturizer and the little bit of stretch is just perfect. you can wear them overnight and they are not cumbersome at all.  they wash well, i let them air dry.  definitely recommend these to anyone with dry hands.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping your hands moisturized.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t overwhelmed with these, they were adequate.  They were a little tighter than I would have liked, but they were still fine.</li>
            <li> I have purchased moisturizing gloves in the past that fell apart, were too loose, and just didn&#x27;t do the job.  These are great.  They have a bit of stretch and fit nice and snug but not tight.  They have made the biggest difference in my very dry hands.  They are also very comfortable, I&#x27;m not distracted by them in my sleep, in fact I think having warm hands has helped me sleep better. Plus the price can&#x27;t be beat. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just simple cloth gloves, but they get the job done.  There&#x27;s nothing special or moisturizing about the gloves themselves.  I use them often at bedtime to allow my hands to soak in my moisturizer all night without getting it on the sheets or my pillow.</li>
            <li> Nothing out of the ordinary -- just some cotton/spandex white gloves. They keep my hand lotion on my hands and not on my keyboard/desk/anything else I&#x27;m touching. My hands/wrists are long and narrow, so the fit is only okay.</li>
            <li> I have long fingers and these gloves fit perfectly.  I have very dry hands in the winter and these gloves are perfect to apply lotion and sleep in.</li>
            <li> Not much difference between these and a pair of white cotton gloves that you put on after moisturizing your hands.</li>
            <li> add a little hand crème, slip these gloves on and they do help to soften your hands!</li>
            <li> I have allergic contact dermatitis, so I have to wear gloves all the time. The fingers on these were too long, so I can&#x27;t do much while I&#x27;m wearing them. The glove fits my hands and wrists well, so I just wear them to bed with ointment.</li>
            <li> Using this product to help with my dry/cracked hands.  I have purchased a couple of different gloves to help moisterize my hands.  These gloves combined with cream are helping.  So far they are proving to be durable.</li>
            <li> i have moist hands again thanks to the gloves. they seen to stay on better while sleeping i will order again.</li>
