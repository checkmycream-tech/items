            <li>If you have ever lived in the Tropics, which I have for many years, this is indispensable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Nothing else prevents chaffing, heat rash, etc, better than this stuff.</li>
            <li>I searched drug stores and purchased many products to relieve my heat rash and nothing helped.</li>

            <li>if you live in hot humid weather, this is the best!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available via mail.</li>
            <li>this is some of the best powder I have used, if you have a rash problem due to heat, this will help.</li>
            <li>and it came very quickly.  </li>
            <li>When I purchased this item three weeks ago it was available fro Amazon Prime, but that no longer appears to be the case.</li>
            <li>I bought this recently after reading all the reviews that stated that it was great for heat rash.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a great product.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product would recommend to anyone who enjoys comfort.</li>
            <li>It is a very cooling and effective powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li>best talc ever invented used in the tropics to help cool down on very hot summers days can recommend and well priced</li>
            <li>When applying it spreads easily, and the thicker the application the quicker &amp; more intense the cooling effect.  </li>
            <li>However, every body is unique.</li>
            <li>My skin where rashes appear is now so clean after using this powder intermittently for about a month now.</li>
            <li>Refreshingly cool feeling and keeps any prickly heat issues from ever happening.</li>
            <li>you will feel so cool it will seem like a miracle.  </li>
            <li>And then I ran into it, and just happened to use to feel cool during those summer nights.</li>
            <li>keeps the boys nice and dry but most of all adds comfort throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I will never be able to live without this stuff!</li>
            <li>Cooling upon first application is very refreshing, and the dry lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li>Snake Brand, you&#x27;ve got another loyal customer.</li>
            <li>I would not hold it against the product since I do sweat a lot, way more than normal.</li>
            <li>although it would have been a good excuse to return to Thailand!</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I brought home extra.</li>
            <li>I had the first full night&#x27;s sleep in over a year.</li>
            <li>I like its fresh feel brought to me.</li>
            <li>Will always have this powder on hand for any kind of heat related rashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had recurrent obnoxious rash right in front of chest</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found that the store brand medicated body powder sold at Target works much better, plus you get a lot more for a lot less.</li>
            <li>I first used this powder in Thailand.</li>
            <li>It says ok for daily use</li>
            <li>that I&#x27;m tall enough so that most people&#x27;s nose are inline with my boobs...</li>
            <li>Please try this if your itching is triggered by  hot conditions.</li>
            <li>I work outside most days</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just a tad hot.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I first bought this powder in Cambodia.</li>
            <li>The powder leaves a great feeling, even if it does not last for too long in my case.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used it I used as much as I had been using of Gold Bond Medicated Powder, which is to say too much, and my nether region was almost uncomfortably cool for about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>My first day in the sun</li>
            <li>But Mexsana only worked \\&quot;most of the time\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t suffer from Prickly heat, even if you don&#x27;t need an antiseptic powder for itchy skin, if you sweat, feel the heat and want to cool down then a nice shower coupled with a nice rub down with Prickly Heat powder over one&#x27;s torso and arms</li>
            <li>it ran out, I ordered more, which came in a large tin that&#x27;s too big to travel with.</li>
            <li>The prickly heat powder was good for a while, but then dried me out too much, and no longer kept my candida at bay like Mexsana does the majority of the time.</li>
            <li>In the past I have gotten fair results with Benedryl pray.</li>
            <li>This powder far exceeded my expectations in its ability to keep me cool and dry in even the most humid of environments.</li>
            <li>I have no doubt that the India knockoff stuff is nothing like the real deal.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really tested it in a situation which would normally make me really sweaty/heated like a hot crowded room or the club</li>
            <li>Ever since then if he spends too much time in the sun he gets prickly heat patches on his feet and chest.  </li>
            <li>and that is really a hot/sweaty area for me if I&#x27;m really exerting myself.</li>
            <li>really helped.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li>and I am now very grateful for her advice.</li>
            <li>Being a heavy chested girl living in a warm humid area I often suffer from heat rash across my chest.  </li>
            <li>I decided to purchase this powder over other products after reading all the glowing reviews and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Better than any other product</li>
            <li>My wife brought a small tin of this back from Thailand, which was a very nice</li>
            <li>I have been showering in cool water twice daily.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to be prepared for the high humidity</li>
            <li>its good but my skin got so tough from scratching it</li>
            <li>No doubt the camphor and menthol are what cause the cool, tingly feeling that lasts for as long as an hour after</li>
            <li>No wonder I rarely had urge to itch there and wasn&#x27;t bacterial/fungus related to my knowledge but heat skin issues which this powder took care of.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t bother me as we&#x27;ve been having really high heat indexes where I live</li>
            <li>I made the right choice to buy up 4 big cans</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona and while not humid -</li>
            <li>but I only use it when I need it and it never fails to work.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re like me with dry or sensitive skin and live in hot parts of the country, then is product is a must-have!</li>
            <li>I live in AZ where it gets up to 120 degrees,and my sensitive skin relished this powder whenever I got a heat rash.</li>
            <li>I found this in the Far East; Thailand and Indonesia.  </li>
            <li>When we returned home, my fiance developed prickly heat.</li>
            <li>I tried antibiotic cream and other skin oitments, and if I scrape it off, dead cells would come off and it would look more intense afterwards.</li>
            <li>This stuff keeps you cool - for a little while anyway.</li>
            <li>I would leave it and the skin tone with go back to normal but with visible rash.</li>
            <li>This Prickly Heat Powder is hardly can find outside the Asia Pacific, glad can order from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Try the Ocean Fresh scent, it&#x27;s lighter and doesn&#x27;t smell as foreign to the American nose.</li>
            <li>I ordered this and two other products to test and this powder relieved ALL the itching from 7am until 6pm on a very stressful day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  After using this for several months I have gone back to my old standard: Mexsana Medicated Powder.</li>

            <li> Being a heavy chested girl living in a warm humid area I often suffer from heat rash across my chest.  </li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this powder over other products after reading all the glowing reviews and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Better than any other product</li>
            <li> My wife brought a small tin of this back from Thailand, which was a very nice</li>
            <li> I have been showering in cool water twice daily.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to be prepared for the high humidity</li>
            <li> its good but my skin got so tough from scratching it</li>
            <li> No doubt the camphor and menthol are what cause the cool, tingly feeling that lasts for as long as an hour after</li>
            <li> No wonder I rarely had urge to itch there and wasn&#x27;t bacterial/fungus related to my knowledge but heat skin issues which this powder took care of.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t bother me as we&#x27;ve been having really high heat indexes where I live</li>
            <li> I made the right choice to buy up 4 big cans</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona and while not humid -</li>
            <li> but I only use it when I need it and it never fails to work.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re like me with dry or sensitive skin and live in hot parts of the country, then is product is a must-have!</li>
            <li> I live in AZ where it gets up to 120 degrees,and my sensitive skin relished this powder whenever I got a heat rash.</li>
            <li> I found this in the Far East; Thailand and Indonesia.  </li>
            <li> When we returned home, my fiance developed prickly heat.</li>
            <li> I tried antibiotic cream and other skin oitments, and if I scrape it off, dead cells would come off and it would look more intense afterwards.</li>
            <li> This stuff keeps you cool - for a little while anyway.</li>
            <li> I would leave it and the skin tone with go back to normal but with visible rash.</li>
            <li> This Prickly Heat Powder is hardly can find outside the Asia Pacific, glad can order from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Try the Ocean Fresh scent, it&#x27;s lighter and doesn&#x27;t smell as foreign to the American nose.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and two other products to test and this powder relieved ALL the itching from 7am until 6pm on a very stressful day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  After using this for several months I have gone back to my old standard: Mexsana Medicated Powder.</li>
            <li> will definitely be re-ordering when the second tin is running low, but I suspect it will be a long time from now.</li>
            <li> I immediately applied the powder and almost instant relief that lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> For the past few years I have suffered from heat rash on my chest and shoulders when doing hard work in warm weather.</li>
            <li> It is also not unusual for me to get this bothersome itching all over my skin when starting to sweat - like ants biting me!  </li>
            <li> 1000 tiny elves blowing icy breath on your balls was 100% correct.</li>
            <li> I was having some strange rash for the LONGEST time -- and this product truly helped.</li>
            <li> I like it, however I was under the impression that it would keep me dry for longer.</li>
            <li> I can use less powder for the same cooling and anti-itch</li>
            <li> The Jasmine has a pleasant scent, unlike the Gold Bond and similar products that smell medicinal and horrible.  </li>
            <li> I have prickly heat and this powder did not really help.</li>
            <li> In south Texas, it is not unusual to experience 104°F weather during the Summer months.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of lotions and oatmeal to help soothe my itchiness...  spent hundreds of dollars on them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d by the brand again, but would be careful to get the lavender scented.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I apply a dusting to my chest and rub the residue from my hands over my tummy and back, and have noticed that there is very little sweating (if any) in the area to which prickly heat has been applied, definately no rash and no funky smell.  </li>
            <li> Just use it sparingly a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> am considering purchasing the other scents.</li>
            <li> We discovered this prosuxt , read other reviews, and though why not?</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to eat healthier, fresh fruits and vegetables, cutting down the intake of sugar.  </li>
            <li> The other powders and creams that I have tried would sometimes work for a little while</li>
            <li> Buy this if you have a rash between your legs due to summer heat!  </li>
            <li> After I read the reviews on this powder I ordered it in slight hope</li>
            <li> A small application to the nether regions has also eliminated the usual use of Clotrimazole anti-fungal for the occasional jock itch.</li>
            <li> I had previously tried everything I could find on google to help, but nothing ever did.</li>
            <li> It tingles a little but doesn&#x27;t burn like Goldbond and the smell is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I do not know why this product is not available in drug</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve gone through few dermatologists and they even dared to name my symptom as seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little like mint heaven!</li>
            <li> try.&lt;br /&gt;The talc is very thick stuff bit like crushed chalk and it has a mentol scent.  </li>
            <li> well lets just say I was always trying to avoid close encounters in small rooms.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been using it for years now at the first sign of the rash and it stops it cold!</li>
            <li> I think cream blocks the pores and makes it worse,am not sure about it though.</li>
            <li> I dont know how common prickly heat condition is in the US, or even how often the term is used.</li>
            <li> For one and 1/2 years I&#x27;ve been to drs, dermatologists, even had biopsies and spent over $2,000.00 on useless office visits, prescriptions and lotions.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s negative side effects and stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I got a terrible rash from shoulder-to-shoulder across my chest and upper back and spreading onto my neck.</li>
            <li> I had a really bad heat rash and this is the ONLY thing that cleared it up.</li>
            <li> It works as well as the other one, but it has a rather unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> It healed up a bad case of prickly heat I had about 2 months ago in less than one week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was skeptical, but I was desperate and decided to give this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After running out I began a desperate online search.</li>
            <li> I put this on after taking a cold shower.</li>
            <li> Like Balla it has a cooling effect, but this stuff smells like Tiger Balm which isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> My husband got a terrible sunburn one year while vacationing in Mexico.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible...</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It&#x27;s great for the relief of heat trash.</li>
            <li> After reading rave reviews for this item, I purchased it. It did not help my heat rash. I do realize different products may help some and not others. I tried many creams, powders, tea tree oil, aloe vera from the living plant, others and nothing seemed to work. I have read many helpful hints for this problem. Here is what seemed to help me. I am putting ice packs on the rash area for 20 minutes twice daily. I have been showering in cool water twice daily. I have been using an antibacterial drying soap on the area to wash. I have been using cotton towels in the area to soak up any sweat, especially while sleeping. I have been trying to eat healthier, fresh fruits and vegetables, cutting down the intake of sugar.  You may want to try Cortizone cream to alleviate pain or itch.  Even though this powder did not seem to help me, I wanted to offer any help I could in helping anyone else with a heat rash.</li>
            <li> I have just used up my Balla powder and decided to try this stuff. Like Balla it has a cooling effect, but this stuff smells like Tiger Balm which isn&#x27;t too bad. Compared to Balla, in terms of cooling, this powder felt like I dropped an ice cube on my kag &amp; pals. This didn&#x27;t bother me as we&#x27;ve been having really high heat indexes where I live and it eventually wears off. Just use it sparingly a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I found this in the Far East; Thailand and Indonesia.  It is the best stuff in the world and I wonder why it can&#x27;t be found in the US.  I made the right choice to buy up 4 big cans but I wonder if I shouldn&#x27;t have bought a case the last time I was in Thailand!  I have no doubt that the India knockoff stuff is nothing like the real deal.</li>
            <li> I first used this powder in Thailand. I loved it so much I brought home extra. After running out I began a desperate online search. I am so pleased to have a US source for this powder now...although it would have been a good excuse to return to Thailand!</li>
            <li> I first discovered this amazing talc in Thailand and was delighted to discover that it&#x27;s available here. It&#x27;s super cool and refreshing - great for after a shower. Smells great and is probably good for prickly heat as well.</li>
            <li> I dont know how common prickly heat condition is in the US, or even how often the term is used. However, when you have it this stuff is awesome. Snake Brand created in 1947 specifically for this purpose and I found it in Thailand. Ive been using it for several years. Have several jars on hand and it starts working immediately. It says ok for daily use but I only use it when I need it and it never fails to work.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this powder over other products after reading all the glowing reviews and I am so glad I did. This powder far exceeded my expectations in its ability to keep me cool and dry in even the most humid of environments. Snake Brand, you&#x27;ve got another loyal customer.</li>
            <li> Had never heard about prickly heat until I accidentally came across it.  Being a heavy chested girl living in a warm humid area I often suffer from heat rash across my chest.  The other powders and creams that I have tried would sometimes work for a little while but I always ended up feeling itchy and sore with exception of Aqueos cream which stopped the itchy/soreness but always resulted in a funky sweaty smell now factor in that I&#x27;m tall enough so that most people&#x27;s nose are inline with my boobs...well lets just say I was always trying to avoid close encounters in small rooms.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I gave prickly heat a try.&lt;br /&gt;The talc is very thick stuff bit like crushed chalk and it has a mentol scent.  When applying it spreads easily, and the thicker the application the quicker &amp; more intense the cooling effect.  I have been using this for four days now.  I apply a dusting to my chest and rub the residue from my hands over my tummy and back, and have noticed that there is very little sweating (if any) in the area to which prickly heat has been applied, definately no rash and no funky smell.  Haven&#x27;t really tested it in a situation which would normally make me really sweaty/heated like a hot crowded room or the club but I&#x27;d still recommend this powder.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great it kept me from getting heat rash and chaffing.</li>
            <li> For one and 1/2 years I&#x27;ve been to drs, dermatologists, even had biopsies and spent over $2,000.00 on useless office visits, prescriptions and lotions. After my own research I guessed that I may have prickly heat condition.     I ordered this and two other products to test and this powder relieved ALL the itching from 7am until 6pm on a very stressful day. I had the first full night&#x27;s sleep in over a year. I hope this will help you. Itching is disfiguring, embarrassing and life limiting. Please try this if your itching is triggered by  hot conditions. This is the answer to a prayer for me!</li>
            <li> Living in tropical Hawaii, this powder is a must! Until I found this powder, nothing else worked including prescription powders from the doctor (some sort of anti-yeast powder). This Snake Brand powder from Thailand is nothing short of a miracle for me. It healed up a bad case of prickly heat I had about 2 months ago in less than one week. Now I use it under my breasts after every shower. Refreshingly cool feeling and keeps any prickly heat issues from ever happening. I will never be able to live without this stuff!</li>
            <li> Best product ever for prickly heat. Suffered for months, thought I had tried everything, then tried Prickly Heat. It&#x27;s the best and started working immediately.</li>
            <li> its good but my skin got so tough from scratching it didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t know that this powder was intended for treating a condition before reading these reviews just now... I use it for my crotch and feet, where it works wonders. It honestly gets sooooo cold</li>
            <li> As stated in the title, this is a rave review for Snake Brand Prickly Heat Powder from Thailand. For the past few years I have suffered from heat rash on my chest and shoulders when doing hard work in warm weather. In the past I have gotten fair results with Benedryl pray. This year when the mercury hit 80° and I was working on remodeling my house I got a terrible rash from shoulder-to-shoulder across my chest and upper back and spreading onto my neck. Nothing was working, even the Mayo Clinic-recommended anhydrous lanolin. After I read the reviews on this powder I ordered it in slight hope it would do something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling sensation of the first application was delightful. It felt like something was happening. Within a day the redness began to go and after two days the blisters started to disappear. After a week of twice-daily application there was just a hint of roughness on my shoulders. After three weeks there is no sign of rash or bumps, even though I am still working on the house daily in 90° temps with a lot of sweating. A small application to the nether regions has also eliminated the usual use of Clotrimazole anti-fungal for the occasional jock itch. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with a product than I am with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those wondering, the ingredients listed on the label are: Talc, Kaolin, Camphor 1.4% w/w, Menthol 0.8% w/w, Perfume, Triclocarban 0.2% w/w. No doubt the camphor and menthol are what cause the cool, tingly feeling that lasts for as long as an hour after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this 150 gram tin will last me for the rest of the year, but I plan to stock up just in case. And for those who care, I&#x27;ve been told the can is quite attractive sitting on the shelf in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One additional comment: After posting this review I went to the product page to add more to my wish list. When I purchased this item three weeks ago it was available fro Amazon Prime, but that no longer appears to be the case.</li>
            <li> It works wonders! The cooling powder feels so good against heat rash and sun burn,</li>
            <li> I have prickly heat and this powder did not really help. Not worth it. But then again, I dont think anything helps to cure prickly heat.</li>
            <li> I bought this recently after reading all the reviews that stated that it was great for heat rash. It works ok but I&#x27;ve found that the store brand medicated body powder sold at Target works much better, plus you get a lot more for a lot less.</li>
            <li> My husband got a terrible sunburn one year while vacationing in Mexico. Ever since then if he spends too much time in the sun he gets prickly heat patches on his feet and chest.  We got this product just because it looked like something different, and it&#x27;s name explained to us finally what the rash was. Thank you ever since! He&#x27;s been using it for years now at the first sign of the rash and it stops it cold! I just tried it under by bra line like another big chested gal user suggested and it worked great. I work outside most days and that is really a hot/sweaty area for me if I&#x27;m really exerting myself. It&#x27;s a little like mint heaven! Thank you for such a great product.</li>
            <li> Prickly Heat Powder is great stuff, the Snake brand is also excellent. Try the Ocean Fresh scent, it&#x27;s lighter and doesn&#x27;t smell as foreign to the American nose.</li>
            <li> In south Texas, it is not unusual to experience 104°F weather during the Summer months.  It is also not unusual for me to get this bothersome itching all over my skin when starting to sweat - like ants biting me!  It&#x27;s terrible...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of lotions and oatmeal to help soothe my itchiness...  spent hundreds of dollars on them.  Nothing really helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical, but I was desperate and decided to give this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW, within minutes this soothes my skin...  &amp;#34;itchies&amp;#34; are gone.  Relief!  I can&#x27;t tell you how good it feels to have this nagging itch melt away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me with dry or sensitive skin and live in hot parts of the country, then is product is a must-have!</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona and while not humid - it&#x27;s just a tad hot. This stuff keeps you cool - for a little while anyway. I don&#x27;t really like the smell so I want to try to lavender version next time.</li>
            <li> Solves the purpose nicely.. Better than any other product</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> if you live in hot humid weather, this is the best!!! I saw it sold in Thailand, and looked all over for this. I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available via mail. The Jasmine has a pleasant scent, unlike the Gold Bond and similar products that smell medicinal and horrible.  The cooling powder was a life saver in the 90+ degree 80%+ humidity of Asia. Made all the difference in the sweltering heat, the next best thing to an air conditioned room.</li>
            <li> I first bought this powder in Cambodia. I bought all the cans I could find in the open-air market and brought those home. I subsequently tried to find this powder on the internet, but couldn&#x27;t. I bought a knockoff prickly heat powder in India, but it wasn&#x27;t nearly as effective or refreshing. As a wonderful surprise, a friends&#x27; sister brought some home (Los Angeles) to me from Malaysia. I am so thrilled that I can now buy it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Do you get heat rash?  This is the solution.  Used while hiking the Appalachian Trail for a couple months.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I had a really bad heat rash and this is the ONLY thing that cleared it up. I got the antibacterial version and it worked like a charm! I had previously tried everything I could find on google to help, but nothing ever did. It tingles a little but doesn&#x27;t burn like Goldbond and the smell is not overpowering. I am so glad I found this!</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t like the smell of this. I will stick to my arrowroot powder. It worked better and no smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it is not cooling, It&#x27;s not cooling powder. I brought the same product that I felt cooling in China a year ago.</li>
            <li> I like it, however I was under the impression that it would keep me dry for longer. I would not hold it against the product since I do sweat a lot, way more than normal. The powder leaves a great feeling, even if it does not last for too long in my case.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product would recommend to anyone who enjoys comfort. Cooling upon first application is very refreshing, and the dry lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li> Works very well very nice quality very satisfied</li>
            <li> If you have ever lived in the Tropics, which I have for many years, this is indispensable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goodbye bollock rot and a sore ring from too many chillis.</li>
            <li> This powder is very good! I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase. It is a very cooling and effective powder.&lt;br /&gt;It helped with itching from poison ivy, and heat rash. Also put in shoes for a cooling of your feet.&lt;br /&gt;I am considering purchasing the other scents.</li>
            <li> When I have been in Thailand, I always used this powder. It is by far the best I have ever tried in over 50 years. Nothing else prevents chaffing, heat rash, etc, better than this stuff. When a powder will work in the stifling humidity and heat of SE Asia, it will work anywhere. I used to bring 8-10 cans back with me whenever I&#x27;d go there. Now, I see I can buy it on Amazon. I am very happy about this.</li>
            <li> it works to my prickly heat. I like its fresh feel brought to me.</li>
            <li> Think of this as the powder equivalent of Dr. Brunner&#x27;s mint soap.  A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I used as much as I had been using of Gold Bond Medicated Powder, which is to say too much, and my nether region was almost uncomfortably cool for about 20 minutes.  I like that I can use less powder for the same cooling and anti-itch effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be re-ordering when the second tin is running low, but I suspect it will be a long time from now.</li>
            <li> This Prickly Heat Powder is hardly can find outside the Asia Pacific, glad can order from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;In Thailand, masseurs used this powder blend with Tiger Balm for massage, the powder give the cooling feeling and relaxing.</li>
            <li> this stuff works as advertised. keeps the boys nice and dry but most of all adds comfort throughout the day.  the bonus is the intial tingle you get when applying. whoever said it was like 1000 tiny elves blowing icy breath on your balls was 100% correct.</li>
            <li> I searched drug stores and purchased many products to relieve my heat rash and nothing helped. I searched the internet, webmd and sites like that and no answers. On a whim, I searched \\&quot;heat rash\\&quot; on Amazon and lo and behold Prickly Heat was introduced to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It looks like it comes from Thailand. I got it from a distributer in California. I do not know why this product is not available in drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Heat rash simply goes away when this powder is applied. I applied the powder to my rash and the itching stopped the next day. In three days the rash healed. Gold bond and all the rest did nothing. I use it now as a preventive measure and no symptoms of the rash has reappeared. All I can say is once I had a rash and now I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Took a trip to Puerto Vallarta the end of May and I wanted to be prepared for the high humidity and it&#x27;s effect on my skin. This product was recommended to me by a friend and I am now very grateful for her advice. My first day in the sun and I could feel the start of heat rash. I immediately applied the powder and almost instant relief that lasted a long time. Will always have this powder on hand for any kind of heat related rashes.</li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t suffer from Prickly heat, even if you don&#x27;t need an antiseptic powder for itchy skin, if you sweat, feel the heat and want to cool down then a nice shower coupled with a nice rub down with Prickly Heat powder over one&#x27;s torso and arms you will feel so cool it will seem like a miracle.  This product is a must have.</li>
            <li> I sweat profusely. Even in Winter. This powder cools without the \\&quot;burning\\&quot; feeling. It also helps keep me from getting my rashes. Up until now I could only use Mexsana Medicated powder. Nothing else worked. But Mexsana only worked \\&quot;most of the time\\&quot;.  This powder works all the time and I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about a month now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  After using this for several months I have gone back to my old standard: Mexsana Medicated Powder. The prickly heat powder was good for a while, but then dried me out too much, and no longer kept my candida at bay like Mexsana does the majority of the time. Mexsana is still the best for me. However, every body is unique. So what works for one, may not work for another. You will have to try it yourself to know for sure.</li>
            <li> best talc ever invented used in the tropics to help cool down on very hot summers days can recommend and well priced</li>
            <li> Great product I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> this is some of the best powder I have used, if you have a rash problem due to heat, this will help.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I read that it was great for KP but it&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s the same powder I bought at the big box store and i paid 4 bucks for their generic brand. If you have KP i recommend Neutrogena&#x27;s coal tar shampoo.  It smoothed out everything!</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for me. I was so hopefult after all the glorious reviews here on Amazon. I get  a much better result from Sarna, I keep it in the fridge and it feels great to put on. also the powder gets everywhere!</li>
            <li> What topical steroids cream couldn&#x27;t do, this powder did. I&#x27;ve had recurrent obnoxious rash right in front of chest and it&#x27;s always on the same spot. Sometimes it would itch and sometimes it&#x27;s just the red rash no itch. I tried antibiotic cream and other skin oitments, and if I scrape it off, dead cells would come off and it would look more intense afterwards. I would leave it and the skin tone with go back to normal but with visible rash. Steroid cream would do the job, but I read lot about it&#x27;s negative side effects and stopped using it. And then I ran into it, and just happened to use to feel cool during those summer nights. That obnoxious rash was gone next morning. No wonder I rarely had urge to itch there and wasn&#x27;t bacterial/fungus related to my knowledge but heat skin issues which this powder took care of. My skin where rashes appear is now so clean after using this powder intermittently for about a month now. Try it, it may work for you. PS: I&#x27;ve gone through few dermatologists and they even dared to name my symptom as seborrheic dermatitis. Applied creams upon cream which only worsened my skin. I think cream blocks the pores and makes it worse,am not sure about it though. This powder definitely worked for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent , Thailand is Humid , so use your Gold Bond Which does not work or buy this that worx quite well or get jock itch , jungle Rott , awesome cooling powder , I&#x27;ve been using it for 25 yrs now !!!!!</li>
            <li> I was having some strange rash for the LONGEST time -- and this product truly helped. I remember seeing it in Thailand when we visited -- so I had to give it a try. It worked like a charm. I live in AZ where it gets up to 120 degrees,and my sensitive skin relished this powder whenever I got a heat rash. It helped me sleep and not itch my skin constantly in front of my students when I was teaching. It smells good, too.</li>
            <li> Buy this if you have a rash between your legs due to summer heat!  It&#x27;s the very best and it came very quickly.  Thank you</li>
            <li> We recently took a vacation to Las Vegas and did a lot of walking. When we returned home, my fiance developed prickly heat. He tried over the counter products with no luck. We discovered this prosuxt , read other reviews, and though why not? Within a week his condition improved. This stuff is amazing!!</li>
            <li> My boys were covered in heat rash after a recent family trip to Florida.  After hearing about this powder from my mother in law, I ordered it.  It has a wonderfully soothing scent.  I applied it as directed and within 2-3 days, the rash was gone.  I definitely recommend this as treatment for heat rash.</li>
            <li> I put this on after taking a cold shower. It helps the dusting powder to stick.  5 mins later it feels like my body is a shivering candy cane!</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT. I had a buddy tell me about it who had bought some in Thailand years ago and it is wonderfull stuff. I highley recomend this for anybody with heat rash or related probs.</li>
            <li> My wife brought a small tin of this back from Thailand, which was a very nice product.&lt;br /&gt;When it ran out, I ordered more, which came in a large tin that&#x27;s too big to travel with. It works as well as the other one, but it has a rather unpleasant odor. I&#x27;d by the brand again, but would be careful to get the lavender scented.</li>
