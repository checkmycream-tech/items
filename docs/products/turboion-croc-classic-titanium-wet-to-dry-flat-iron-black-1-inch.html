            <li>I love the versatility.  </li>
            <li>I purchased two of these TurboIon&#x27;s and am extremely pleased.  </li>
            <li>and this iron is much better</li>
            <li>and I recommend you get it! :)</li>
            <li>We both love the irons.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you get titanium.  </li>
            <li>the more heat the better</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have had more compliments on my hair since I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Works great, heats up fast and have had it for 2 years.  </li>
            <li>My hair no longer is frizzy on the ends and the style stays much better.  </li>
            <li>Tried to get advice and/or replacement from manufacturer and all they offer is a trade in program that costs more than the cost of an item or repair guys to fix it for possibly more than the cost of the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are better brands that will take care of their customers when their item breaks.</li>
            <li>my friend love it.</li>
            <li>I hopped on Amazon immediately right there in the class, and found it for $66.00, which seemed fair.  </li>
            <li>Best flat iron I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Let me tell you, without a doubt, this is the best flat iron I have ever used!!</li>
            <li>The one inch is  also great for straightening new growth.</li>
            <li>I have fairly fine hair, and it is shoulder length, so it shouldn&#x27;t be too challenging for the iron.</li>
            <li>My hair turns out more smooth and silky that I ever could imagine..</li>
            <li>If you want a true wet2dry hair iron, don&#x27;t get this one!</li>
            <li>You can adjust the heat easily.     </li>
            <li>I bought this over a year ago and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>I was very glad to find it much cheaper online.  </li>
            <li>Im in love with this flat iron and sooo happy i purchased it.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>It works fine.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased and would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with the product-</li>
            <li>If you use it on damp hair your hair makes a sizzling sound as the water is turned to steam - that can be a bit disconcerting, but your hair is not burning if you chose the correct temperature.    </li>
            <li>it gets my hair nice and straight and heats up in no time.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my damp hair and it works fabulous.</li>
            <li>But, also can do my daughters hair and have the same great results I do.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t use it every day because of the super hot plates but that&#x27;s probably why it&#x27;s so effective.</li>
            <li>If you clean it with alcohol occasionally it helps greatly too.</li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job of making my hair look straight</li>
            <li>This flat iron is fantastic!!!</li>
            <li>And the item they are sending doesnt match with the original products at the beauty stores.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a very good flat iron at a pretty good price.</li>
            <li>The quality is amazing and it has lasted a long time. :)</li>
            <li>and I love how fast it heats up.</li>
            <li>Overall a good iron</li>
            <li>It was a very sleek and sexy.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this the Croc2 1-inch to licensed professionals or the layman who&#x27;s been around the block a time or two and feels adept at maneuvering a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>It heats up very fast and runs smoothly through your hair.  </li>
            <li>Hi,    I recently purchased this flat iron and it is AMAZING!!!!  </li>
            <li>It gets very hot but does not work as well as anticipated.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as my original one...</li>
            <li>It is amazingly fast!!  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that the temp is digital and easy to change.</li>
            <li>However, I feel as though the result is not as great now that I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Even for a novice, it is simple and works so nicely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth  every penny</li>
            <li>and I have always felt more comfortable with a one inch flat iron to get a more detailed straighten than a larger iron.</li>
            <li>This one glides right through my frizzy hair and makes it smooth and straight.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and fast and leaves your hair feeling silky soft.  </li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s very hot and might be too hot for your hair.  </li>
            <li>I love the black felt pad that comes with the iron, it is a place to put it safely while in use and not.  </li>
            <li>we had the chi wet to dry before this which did an excellent job</li>
            <li>Anyway, the salons make it look so easy that I must need a class to get my hair looking like it is professionally done.</li>
            <li>Shipped super fast also.  </li>
            <li>It works well and heats up super fast.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron is worth every penny and more.</li>
            <li>You do have to keep it away from your scalp, because the edges get hot.  </li>
            <li>I used it at 380 f. and got great results with my thick, kinky/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>390 to 410 is pleanty hot.  </li>
            <li>It dries my hair so fast!</li>
            <li>The first time my hairdresser used this on me</li>
            <li>It also allows you to lower the temperature from 450 if you don&#x27;t want it so hot.</li>
            <li>And my hair stays straight all week!</li>
            <li>While it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I had meant to order it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased---very much worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have bought this hair straightener twice, thinking the first time is stopped working must have been a fluke.  </li>
            <li>Heats up super quick, straightens my hair like no other.</li>
            <li>Finally I have found a flat iron that heats up very quickly, can do my hair and stay looking great all day in to the next day.</li>
            <li>I have long fine hair and this flat iron works fantastic!!  </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I am done wasting money on Flat Irons.</li>
            <li>i love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>check out my other reviews to get the info on the best products for black hair.</li>
            <li>Initially the product was ok; it managed to straighten my coarse/curly hair very well, though it didn&#x27;t make it shiny at all.  </li>
            <li>The warranty is only good for 1 year - and that&#x27;s only if you register the product with Croc within 30 days of purchase.  </li>
            <li>It heats up very fast (within 30 seconds) and the heat temp display is big, and easy to read.  </li>
            <li>Less is more!  </li>
            <li>it is very light, gets EXTREMELY hot, and does straighten my dry hair very well.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the Croc on my hair it took about 10 mins to get straight with no frizz or flyways.</li>
            <li>I started using my old Chi in the mean time and have realized just how good I had it!</li>
            <li>Not only did it straighten my hair and heat up VERY quickly</li>
            <li>This iron is perfect we get straight hair in much less time than other brands, I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>The wet to dry function is not that great however.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair, my sister and niece have very curly hair and lots of it.  </li>
            <li>This hair iron was really disapointing to me.</li>
            <li>I really like this straightener</li>
            <li>I am very dissapointed at the business.</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t get very close to your scalp without getting burned and</li>
            <li>My hairstylist told me to try it because it really works.</li>
            <li>thanks alot</li>
            <li>straight hair).  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very curly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need as much time to do my hair now.  </li>
            <li>You really can get clost to the scalp with this 1in.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>They always wanna get ready at my house..</li>
            <li>and I was very sorprised by</li>
            <li>so I do have to go over my hair a couple of times to get it straight.</li>
            <li>I did not like this product because i dont think its a real one</li>
            <li>but most comfortable to use for small hands!  </li>
            <li>I love that the temperature is adjustable, how fast it heats up, and that it makes my hair smoother than any other iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li>is, by far, much better than the flat iron I was using.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, I will definitely be getting another one to replace my original.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say that this is a five star product, but so far it is definitely the best flat iron I have ever used!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it on \\&quot;wet\\&quot; hair, I did use it on slightly damp hair which is OK if you don&#x27;t mind all the steam and sizzling noises.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;ve had a better experience with the various Chi &amp; GHD irons I&#x27;ve used and purchased.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and flattens and shines instantly.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t order the croc2 because you wont get it in the mail, you will receive the croc classic.</li>
            <li>I like how this flat iron has a digital temperature display and it gets hot very quickly</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this iron.</li>
            <li>I live in a very humid environment and have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>The only things that I didn&#x27;t like about it were that the steam vents are right on the edge</li>
            <li>The cord is super long, which might be helpful for some people, but I just find it gets in the way.  </li>
            <li>At first, it seemed that the iron was still heating above that temperature, but now it isn&#x27;t getting hot enough to do much of anything.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s really wet to dry, but its the best flat iron Ive ever had, it makes my hair shiny and totally frizz free.</li>
            <li>This new one that I have is even better because I purchased the Wet to Dry.</li>
            <li>I love it and it definitely cuts down on drying time.</li>
            <li>When I first got this flat iron</li>
            <li>I could see a huge difference in the way this flat iron straightened my hair vs. the Bespoke flat iron and it lasts all day!!!  </li>
            <li>My new croc flat iron works very well for me.</li>
            <li>The product is really \\&quot;modern\\&quot; - with a digital readout of the temperature.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li>Great flat iron but got the wrong item twice and returned it twice.</li>
            <li>i ordered the Croc TurboIon 2 and they sent me the Croc Classic twice, same mistakes over and over again.</li>
            <li>works really well on dry hair, but I bought this product b/c I wanted to eliminate the blow drying step.</li>
            <li>I tried this on towel dry hair and it produced so much steam that my hair just curled again.   </li>
            <li>The spring broke (which prevented it from staying open and became a real hassle to use) when I put it in my checked luggage in an outside pouch.  </li>
            <li>I have very long and thick hair so prior to owning my first Croc, it was hard for me to find any straighter that I was completely happy with.</li>
            <li>I had returned this one because I ordered the wrong size, but this brand is amazing and will always buy.</li>
            <li>it does get a funky smell sometimes, especially in the beginning but waaaaaay worth a slight smell..</li>
            <li>However this iron does not dry my hair well at all</li>
            <li>(my hair is very difficult to straighten but it does a good job).</li>
            <li>This Wet to Dry Flat iron does exactly what it is suppose to do.  </li>
            <li>I am african american woman with super thick relaxed waist length hair</li>

            <li> I bought this over a year ago and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> I was very glad to find it much cheaper online.  </li>
            <li> Im in love with this flat iron and sooo happy i purchased it.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> It works fine.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased and would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with the product-</li>
            <li> If you use it on damp hair your hair makes a sizzling sound as the water is turned to steam - that can be a bit disconcerting, but your hair is not burning if you chose the correct temperature.    </li>
            <li> it gets my hair nice and straight and heats up in no time.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my damp hair and it works fabulous.</li>
            <li> But, also can do my daughters hair and have the same great results I do.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use it every day because of the super hot plates but that&#x27;s probably why it&#x27;s so effective.</li>
            <li> If you clean it with alcohol occasionally it helps greatly too.</li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job of making my hair look straight</li>
            <li> This flat iron is fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> And the item they are sending doesnt match with the original products at the beauty stores.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a very good flat iron at a pretty good price.</li>
            <li> The quality is amazing and it has lasted a long time. :)</li>
            <li> and I love how fast it heats up.</li>
            <li> Overall a good iron</li>
            <li> It was a very sleek and sexy.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this the Croc2 1-inch to licensed professionals or the layman who&#x27;s been around the block a time or two and feels adept at maneuvering a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> It heats up very fast and runs smoothly through your hair.  </li>
            <li> Hi,    I recently purchased this flat iron and it is AMAZING!!!!  </li>
            <li> It gets very hot but does not work as well as anticipated.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as my original one...</li>
            <li> It is amazingly fast!!  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that the temp is digital and easy to change.</li>
            <li> However, I feel as though the result is not as great now that I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Even for a novice, it is simple and works so nicely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth  every penny</li>
            <li> and I have always felt more comfortable with a one inch flat iron to get a more detailed straighten than a larger iron.</li>
            <li> This one glides right through my frizzy hair and makes it smooth and straight.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and fast and leaves your hair feeling silky soft.  </li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s very hot and might be too hot for your hair.  </li>
            <li> I love the black felt pad that comes with the iron, it is a place to put it safely while in use and not.  </li>
            <li> we had the chi wet to dry before this which did an excellent job</li>
            <li> Anyway, the salons make it look so easy that I must need a class to get my hair looking like it is professionally done.</li>
            <li> Shipped super fast also.  </li>
            <li> It works well and heats up super fast.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is worth every penny and more.</li>
            <li> You do have to keep it away from your scalp, because the edges get hot.  </li>
            <li> I used it at 380 f. and got great results with my thick, kinky/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> 390 to 410 is pleanty hot.  </li>
            <li> It dries my hair so fast!</li>
            <li> The first time my hairdresser used this on me</li>
            <li> It also allows you to lower the temperature from 450 if you don&#x27;t want it so hot.</li>
            <li> And my hair stays straight all week!</li>
            <li> While it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I had meant to order it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased---very much worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have bought this hair straightener twice, thinking the first time is stopped working must have been a fluke.  </li>
            <li> Heats up super quick, straightens my hair like no other.</li>
            <li> Finally I have found a flat iron that heats up very quickly, can do my hair and stay looking great all day in to the next day.</li>
            <li> I have long fine hair and this flat iron works fantastic!!  </li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I am done wasting money on Flat Irons.</li>
            <li> i love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> check out my other reviews to get the info on the best products for black hair.</li>
            <li> Initially the product was ok; it managed to straighten my coarse/curly hair very well, though it didn&#x27;t make it shiny at all.  </li>
            <li> The warranty is only good for 1 year - and that&#x27;s only if you register the product with Croc within 30 days of purchase.  </li>
            <li> It heats up very fast (within 30 seconds) and the heat temp display is big, and easy to read.  </li>
            <li> Less is more!  </li>
            <li> it is very light, gets EXTREMELY hot, and does straighten my dry hair very well.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the Croc on my hair it took about 10 mins to get straight with no frizz or flyways.</li>
            <li> I started using my old Chi in the mean time and have realized just how good I had it!</li>
            <li> Not only did it straighten my hair and heat up VERY quickly</li>
            <li> This iron is perfect we get straight hair in much less time than other brands, I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> The wet to dry function is not that great however.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, my sister and niece have very curly hair and lots of it.  </li>
            <li> This hair iron was really disapointing to me.</li>
            <li> I really like this straightener</li>
            <li> I am very dissapointed at the business.</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t get very close to your scalp without getting burned and</li>
            <li> My hairstylist told me to try it because it really works.</li>
            <li> thanks alot</li>
            <li> straight hair).  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very curly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need as much time to do my hair now.  </li>
            <li> You really can get clost to the scalp with this 1in.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> They always wanna get ready at my house..</li>
            <li> and I was very sorprised by</li>
            <li> so I do have to go over my hair a couple of times to get it straight.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product because i dont think its a real one</li>
            <li> but most comfortable to use for small hands!  </li>
            <li> I love that the temperature is adjustable, how fast it heats up, and that it makes my hair smoother than any other iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li> is, by far, much better than the flat iron I was using.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, I will definitely be getting another one to replace my original.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say that this is a five star product, but so far it is definitely the best flat iron I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it on \\&quot;wet\\&quot; hair, I did use it on slightly damp hair which is OK if you don&#x27;t mind all the steam and sizzling noises.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;ve had a better experience with the various Chi &amp; GHD irons I&#x27;ve used and purchased.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and flattens and shines instantly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t order the croc2 because you wont get it in the mail, you will receive the croc classic.</li>
            <li> I like how this flat iron has a digital temperature display and it gets hot very quickly</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this iron.</li>
            <li> I live in a very humid environment and have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> The only things that I didn&#x27;t like about it were that the steam vents are right on the edge</li>
            <li> The cord is super long, which might be helpful for some people, but I just find it gets in the way.  </li>
            <li> At first, it seemed that the iron was still heating above that temperature, but now it isn&#x27;t getting hot enough to do much of anything.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s really wet to dry, but its the best flat iron Ive ever had, it makes my hair shiny and totally frizz free.</li>
            <li> This new one that I have is even better because I purchased the Wet to Dry.</li>
            <li> I love it and it definitely cuts down on drying time.</li>
            <li> When I first got this flat iron</li>
            <li> I could see a huge difference in the way this flat iron straightened my hair vs. the Bespoke flat iron and it lasts all day!!!  </li>
            <li> My new croc flat iron works very well for me.</li>
            <li> The product is really \\&quot;modern\\&quot; - with a digital readout of the temperature.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li> Great flat iron but got the wrong item twice and returned it twice.</li>
            <li> i ordered the Croc TurboIon 2 and they sent me the Croc Classic twice, same mistakes over and over again.</li>
            <li> works really well on dry hair, but I bought this product b/c I wanted to eliminate the blow drying step.</li>
            <li> I tried this on towel dry hair and it produced so much steam that my hair just curled again.   </li>
            <li> The spring broke (which prevented it from staying open and became a real hassle to use) when I put it in my checked luggage in an outside pouch.  </li>
            <li> I have very long and thick hair so prior to owning my first Croc, it was hard for me to find any straighter that I was completely happy with.</li>
            <li> I had returned this one because I ordered the wrong size, but this brand is amazing and will always buy.</li>
            <li> it does get a funky smell sometimes, especially in the beginning but waaaaaay worth a slight smell..</li>
            <li> However this iron does not dry my hair well at all</li>
            <li> (my hair is very difficult to straighten but it does a good job).</li>
            <li> This Wet to Dry Flat iron does exactly what it is suppose to do.  </li>
            <li> I am african american woman with super thick relaxed waist length hair</li>
            <li> What I ordered was the croc2 wet and dry flat iron, and when I received the package and opened it, it was the croc classic.</li>
            <li> I have finally found a flat Iron that does what it states..</li>
            <li> I am the last person that should be buying a flat iron, but at the recommendation from my hair stylist, this is the one she uses.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I rated it four instead of five stars is because a five star product needs to last a long time, and although I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever gonna try another brand flat iron.</li>
            <li> I bought the 1 1/2 inch for myself because I have long hair and bought the 1 inch for my mom who has short hair.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to say that is five stars.</li>
            <li> This flat iron was recommended to me by my hair stylist</li>
            <li> Does&#x27;t cutt off flat ironing time!</li>
            <li> I recommend this flat iron to everyone!</li>
            <li> Hair smelled burned and flat!!</li>
            <li> My first Croc was purchased in 2009 and just recently broke in 2013, and not because the technology failed, but because it took a major fall to the tiled ground and the plastic part broke.</li>
            <li> If you have lots of long hair to straighten you might prefer the wider one.</li>
            <li> We have had this iron for a few months now and so far it is still working.  </li>
            <li> My daughters have long hair and it takes about 15 minutes to do the job.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunatly i have no use for a tiny wet to dry iron.i</li>
            <li> This flat iron is intended to be used on damp hair (NOT dripping wet), and you can dry your hair and straighten it, simultaneously.  </li>
            <li> You can use it on dry hair too.  </li>
            <li> I wanted an iron that would dry and flatten.</li>
            <li> I let it dry in a towel for an hour before I use the iron.</li>
            <li> It is mostly dry and it still doesn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair at all so thats why I bought the wet to dry one.</li>
            <li> One pass per lock of hair, and I was finished in less than ten minutes.    </li>
            <li> I was hoping to get the Croc2 wet and dry straightener.</li>
            <li> But if you want a truly \\&quot;wet to dry\\&quot; hair straightener, this is not the product I would recommend.</li>
            <li> It seems as though its only meant to work a few months</li>
            <li> (i usually have to go over the same chunk of hair</li>
            <li> It made my hair extremely silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> This might just be because I haven&#x27;t been treating it with a deep conditioner as I usually do or it might be the hair straightener declining in quality.</li>
            <li> and it made the girl&#x27;s hair extremely luscious.</li>
            <li> This croc gets used every day at work at my salon and It has nevr let me down.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even dropped it quite a few times.</li>
            <li> Monitor your heat carefully and start off slow.  </li>
            <li> and then one day the display is broken and reaches only have the typcial temperature.</li>
            <li> it just  makes it fluffy.</li>
            <li> Also, it heats up in less than 30 seconds!</li>
            <li> I had a Bespoke flat iron that was quite expensive and never really gave me the results I was looking for (ie.</li>
            <li> I was in a continuing education course recently and was aghast when the moderator said we could purchase her flat iron for $199.00.  </li>
            <li> I also have the frizziest hair known to man, but the croc helps keep it tame.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, coarse and curly so very tough to flat iron.</li>
            <li> It usually took awhile to heat up</li>
            <li> but I usually use a shine product in my hair after</li>
            <li> This item broke 2 years in - for an item this expensive, I would expect it to last for at least 5 years.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, and you don&#x27;t have to press hard to close the plates.      </li>
            <li> But for me, it made my hair frizzy and dull.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the results, as I tried it on thick hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick</li>
            <li> I wanted the infrared one, when I realized that I got confused, was to late, I live in M&amp;eacute;xico,  was very complicated for me to ask for a refund or to return it.</li>
            <li> very small 1 inch iron.</li>
            <li> RIDICULOUS and unreasonable!  </li>
            <li> mine makes an annoying creaking noise when you squeeze it closed.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it broke on an overseas trip</li>
            <li> and I have gotten some  breakage when I had bleached highlights in my hair but nothing bad.</li>
            <li> Thoroughly disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Worst of all, the Croc has now died...</li>

            <li> This Wet to Dry Flat iron does exactly what it is suppose to do.  It&#x27;s the person who purchased it that has the problem or perhaps it&#x27;s the hair.  Anyway, the salons make it look so easy that I must need a class to get my hair looking like it is professionally done.</li>
            <li> works really well on dry hair, but I bought this product b/c I wanted to eliminate the blow drying step. I tried this on towel dry hair and it produced so much steam that my hair just curled again.   Overall, I am happy with the product- it is very light, gets EXTREMELY hot, and does straighten my dry hair very well. But if you want a truly \\&quot;wet to dry\\&quot; hair straightener, this is not the product I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  I used to have Revlon one from target that was about $20.  It usually took awhile to heat up and i would always have to re-straighten my hair throughout the day because all the humidity outside would make it frizz up again.  I tried my friend&#x27;s CROC straightener and it was THE BEST! Not only did it straighten my hair and heat up VERY quickly (i usually have to go over the same chunk of hair about 2-3x&#x27;s), my hair was also STATIC FREE!!!  Im in love with this flat iron and sooo happy i purchased it.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is intended to be used on damp hair (NOT dripping wet), and you can dry your hair and straighten it, simultaneously.  It&#x27;s a big time saver!  It works beautifully, and is easy to use.  Lightweight, and you don&#x27;t have to press hard to close the plates.      It heats up very fast (within 30 seconds) and the heat temp display is big, and easy to read.  You can adjust the heat easily.     You do have to keep it away from your scalp, because the edges get hot.  If you use it on damp hair your hair makes a sizzling sound as the water is turned to steam - that can be a bit disconcerting, but your hair is not burning if you chose the correct temperature.    Do not start with the maximum temperature - it&#x27;s very hot and might be too hot for your hair.  I used it at 380 f. and got great results with my thick, kinky/wavy hair.  One pass per lock of hair, and I was finished in less than ten minutes.    You can use it on dry hair too.  I love the versatility.  I bought the one inch size because my hair is fairly short.  If you have lots of long hair to straighten you might prefer the wider one.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these TurboIon&#x27;s and am extremely pleased.  I have curly hair, my sister and niece have very curly hair and lots of it.  This iron is perfect we get straight hair in much less time than other brands, I highly recommend it.  I love the black felt pad that comes with the iron, it is a place to put it safely while in use and not.  The temperature settings are perfect and it heat up fast!</li>
            <li> This iron is absolutely excellent!! I am african american woman with super thick relaxed waist length hair so I put it to the test. Let me tell you, without a doubt, this is the best flat iron I have ever used!! I already had a FHI technique and the instyler and this iron is much better and it leaves it so shiny with no product! It goes to 450 but I use it on 410. I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair at all so thats why I bought the wet to dry one. It goes from kinky to silky in ONE pass!! I only wish I had bought a 1.5 inch so I will be buying a bigger one soon. This flat iron is worth every penny and more. The one inch is  also great for straightening new growth. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever gonna try another brand flat iron. I wish I could give it 10 STARS!!</li>
            <li> This hair iron was really disapointing to me. I wanted an iron that would dry and flatten. However this iron does not dry my hair well at all and it flattens only somewhat well. I had a revlon wet2dry for 7 years or so and it was only about 20 dollars and it worked so much better than this for alot more money! I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money. I have fairly fine hair, and it is shoulder length, so it shouldn&#x27;t be too challenging for the iron. I let it dry in a towel for an hour before I use the iron. It is mostly dry and it still doesn&#x27;t work that well. If you want a true wet2dry hair iron, don&#x27;t get this one!</li>
            <li> When I first got this flat iron I was beyond ecstatic. I ran it through my hair and it was SHINE CITY. It made my hair extremely silky and shiny. However, I feel as though the result is not as great now that I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks. My hair is not as shiny and it doesn&#x27;t feel as silky. This might just be because I haven&#x27;t been treating it with a deep conditioner as I usually do or it might be the hair straightener declining in quality. Overall, this is a very good flat iron at a pretty good price. The wet to dry function is not that great however. It could just be my hair because I saw a review on it and it made the girl&#x27;s hair extremely luscious. But for me, it made my hair frizzy and dull. The temperature setting is awesome since it gets so hot and I love how fast it heats up. I really like this straightener and I recommend you get it! :)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as my original one...but most comfortable to use for small hands!  Have tried others and they are unwieldy!</li>
            <li> Initially the product was ok; it managed to straighten my coarse/curly hair very well, though it didn&#x27;t make it shiny at all.  Overall, I&#x27;ve had a better experience with the various Chi &amp; GHD irons I&#x27;ve used and purchased.  Worst of all, the Croc has now died... I just bought it 7 months ago!  The digital screen will not go above 250.  At first, it seemed that the iron was still heating above that temperature, but now it isn&#x27;t getting hot enough to do much of anything. The warranty is only good for 1 year - and that&#x27;s only if you register the product with Croc within 30 days of purchase.  I neglected to do that, so I&#x27;m likely out of luck there.  Thoroughly disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist uses this and recommended it to me.  I bought the 1 1/2 inch for myself because I have long hair and bought the 1 inch for my mom who has short hair.  We both love the irons.  Don&#x27;t turn the heat all the way up though....390 to 410 is pleanty hot.  It heats up very fast and runs smoothly through your hair.  Make sure you get titanium.  Shipped super fast also.  This is the flatiron to get!</li>
            <li> I have finally found a flat Iron that does what it states.. It heats up quickly and flattens and shines instantly. I am very pleased and would highly recommend this product. I am glad I am done wasting money on Flat Irons.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after my CHI died after years of usage. I like how this flat iron has a digital temperature display and it gets hot very quickly so I don&#x27;t have to wait around to start using it. It does a pretty good job of making my hair look straight but sometimes I feel like it doesn&#x27;t make my hair shine.. but I usually use a shine product in my hair after so it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I have ordered an item twice from this seller. They continued sending me in the incorrect product one after another. I have ended up paying for the return labels every time. I am very dissapointed at the business. The product they send doesnt match with the names on their products online. i ordered the Croc TurboIon 2 and they sent me the Croc Classic twice, same mistakes over and over again. And the item they are sending doesnt match with the original products at the beauty stores.</li>
            <li> This works great! It dries my hair so fast! I also have the frizziest hair known to man, but the croc helps keep it tame. Def. recommend.</li>
            <li> A good choice for the price (around $70).  It works well and heats up super fast.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it on \\&quot;wet\\&quot; hair, I did use it on slightly damp hair which is OK if you don&#x27;t mind all the steam and sizzling noises.  The only things that I didn&#x27;t like about it were that the steam vents are right on the edge so you can&#x27;t get very close to your scalp without getting burned and mine makes an annoying creaking noise when you squeeze it closed.  The cord is super long, which might be helpful for some people, but I just find it gets in the way.  Overall a good iron and I would recommend it (my hair is very difficult to straighten but it does a good job).</li>
            <li> i love this flat iron.  the more heat the better and this gets up to 450. it gets my hair nice and straight and heats up in no time.  very good product.  check out my other reviews to get the info on the best products for black hair.</li>
            <li> very small 1 inch iron. considerably smaller than a chi irons 1 inch. Unfortunatly i have no use for a tiny wet to dry iron.i never used this iron, i sent it back immediately. i cannot comment on quality. p.s. It was a very sleek and sexy.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get the Croc2 wet and dry straightener. My hairstylist told me to try it because it really works. What I ordered was the croc2 wet and dry flat iron, and when I received the package and opened it, it was the croc classic. I don&#x27;t know if the iron is going to work ok, but still learn to SEND THE CORRECT DAMN ITEM!!!!!! UNSATISFIED!!!  Don&#x27;t order the croc2 because you wont get it in the mail, you will receive the croc classic.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say that this is a five star product, but so far it is definitely the best flat iron I have ever used! My hair is mid-back length and I have always felt more comfortable with a one inch flat iron to get a more detailed straighten than a larger iron. This one glides right through my frizzy hair and makes it smooth and straight. I love that the temperature is adjustable, how fast it heats up, and that it makes my hair smoother than any other iron I have ever used. The only reason I rated it four instead of five stars is because a five star product needs to last a long time, and although I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to say that is five stars.</li>
            <li> I bought this over a year ago and it is still going strong. I&#x27;ve even dropped it quite a few times. Still works and flattens out my frizzy hair with no problem. I love the fact that the temp is digital and easy to change. Also, it heats up in less than 30 seconds! I would buy another if this one ever dies. The quality is amazing and it has lasted a long time. :)</li>
            <li> Excellent product, heats up and straightens my hair in no time at all. Unfortunately it broke on an overseas trip eventhough it&#x27;s supposed to be dual voltage as per it&#x27;s label. I had been using it for a couple of years with no problems before it broke and had to get a replacement (not croc) which is ok but not as good as my croc.</li>
            <li> this was a good deal and I love it. it works great. wish I had bought it sooner.  thanks alot</li>
            <li> The first time my hairdresser used this on me I knew I had to have it. He sold them in his shop for $165! I went home and looked on Amazon, $75, sold! Heats up super quick, straightens my hair like no other. Love it.</li>
            <li> I am the last person that should be buying a flat iron, but at the recommendation from my hair stylist, this is the one she uses.  I have used it over a dozen times and it is great.  Even for a novice, it is simple and works so nicely.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is fantastic!!! Love, love, love it! I use it on my damp hair and it works fabulous.</li>
            <li> Great flat iron but got the wrong item twice and returned it twice. Will go to the store to buy.</li>
            <li> This was my January splurge, sorta. it&#x27;s going to end up saving me lots of money because I used to spend about $50 to get my hair straightened the way the Croc2 does it! The product is really \\&quot;modern\\&quot; - with a digital readout of the temperature. And it does as it says. Wouldn&#x27;t use it every day because of the super hot plates but that&#x27;s probably why it&#x27;s so effective. It also allows you to lower the temperature from 450 if you don&#x27;t want it so hot. The Croc rocks!</li>
            <li> Hi,    I recently purchased this flat iron and it is AMAZING!!!!  I had a Bespoke flat iron that was quite expensive and never really gave me the results I was looking for (ie. straight hair).  The second I started using it I could see a huge difference in the way this flat iron straightened my hair vs. the Bespoke flat iron and it lasts all day!!!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Does&#x27;t cutt off flat ironing time! Hair smelled burned and flat!! I don&#x27;t recommend !</li>
            <li> I am so happy to be a Croc owner again! My first Croc was purchased in 2009 and just recently broke in 2013, and not because the technology failed, but because it took a major fall to the tiled ground and the plastic part broke. I have very long and thick hair so prior to owning my first Croc, it was hard for me to find any straighter that I was completely happy with. This new one that I have is even better because I purchased the Wet to Dry. I love it and it definitely cuts down on drying time.</li>
            <li> Licensed in Cosmetology for sixteen years.  I was in a continuing education course recently and was aghast when the moderator said we could purchase her flat iron for $199.00.  RIDICULOUS and unreasonable!  I hopped on Amazon immediately right there in the class, and found it for $66.00, which seemed fair.  After testing the product in the class I was amazed at the results, as I tried it on thick hair.  I strongly recommend this the Croc2 1-inch to licensed professionals or the layman who&#x27;s been around the block a time or two and feels adept at maneuvering a flat iron.  Monitor your heat carefully and start off slow.  Less is more!  Bottom line: A SUPERIOR PRODUCT... Makes the Chi look like a joke!</li>
            <li> I have long fine hair and this flat iron works fantastic!!  I have had more compliments on my hair since I bought it.  It is very easy to use and fast and leaves your hair feeling silky soft.  I would highly recommend this iron.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy a Chi, but after talking to my friend that is a hair stylist she convinced me to get a Croc instead. I am glad she did I LOVE my Croc! My hair is very thick, coarse and curly so very tough to flat iron. My daughters hair is mixed in race so it&#x27;s very curly. The first time I used the Croc on my hair it took about 10 mins to get straight with no frizz or flyways. I then did my daughters hair and it took about 45 mins, also with no frizz or flyaways. Finally I have found a flat iron that heats up very quickly, can do my hair and stay looking great all day in to the next day. But, also can do my daughters hair and have the same great results I do. I recommend this flat iron to everyone! It&#x27;s worth  every penny and it&#x27;s cheaper than a Chi!</li>
            <li> This flatiron works great.  I don&#x27;t need as much time to do my hair now.  I use it on my damp hair.  And my hair stays straight all week!</li>
            <li> we are extremely happy with this iron.  we had the chi wet to dry before this which did an excellent job but twice broke after 2 months.  We have had this iron for a few months now and so far it is still working.  It is amazingly fast!!  My daughters have long hair and it takes about 15 minutes to do the job.  A very good product, well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I had returned this one because I ordered the wrong size, but this brand is amazing and will always buy.</li>
            <li> Works great, heats up fast and have had it for 2 years.  Egronomics are good your hand doesn&#x27;t feel like its gonna cramp up after some use</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by the salon I go to.  While it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I had meant to order it is, by far, much better than the flat iron I was using.  My hair no longer is frizzy on the ends and the style stays much better.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This flat iron was recommended to me by my hair stylist but I balked at the price in the studio ($250).  I was very glad to find it much cheaper online.  I live in a very humid environment and have naturally curly hair but when I use the CROC iron (w/some de-frizz serum, of course), it turns out great!  I&#x27;m very pleased---very much worth the money.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I have ever used.  Hairdressers need reliable tools.  This croc gets used every day at work at my salon and It has nevr let me down. You really can get clost to the scalp with this 1in. model.</li>
            <li> This item broke 2 years in - for an item this expensive, I would expect it to last for at least 5 years. Tried to get advice and/or replacement from manufacturer and all they offer is a trade in program that costs more than the cost of an item or repair guys to fix it for possibly more than the cost of the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are better brands that will take care of their customers when their item breaks.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and I do what I can to prevent breakage.  Once I found a heat setting that wouldn&#x27;t fry it off (390 for me), I was just so happy with this iron.  I bought this March 2012 and it lasted until December 2013.  The spring broke (which prevented it from staying open and became a real hassle to use) when I put it in my checked luggage in an outside pouch.  Can&#x27;t blame the product for breaking when I knew they just throw your bags around.  Should have kept it in my carry on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I will definitely be getting another one to replace my original.  I started using my old Chi in the mean time and have realized just how good I had it! haha</li>
            <li> It gets very hot but does not work as well as anticipated.  It might also be my lack of skills</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter she loves it</li>
            <li> I have bought this hair straightener twice, thinking the first time is stopped working must have been a fluke.  It works great and then one day the display is broken and reaches only have the typcial temperature. It seems as though its only meant to work a few months so you have to buy another one.</li>
            <li> I used to have a Chi and it just wasn&#x27;t doing the trick. My hair is naturally curly but when I try to use a straightener it just  makes it fluffy. Not this baby! My friends that have used it Rave about it! They always wanna get ready at my house..Now it does go up to 450 degrees so you have to judge it on your hair type. I use it 450 all the time and I have gotten some  breakage when I had bleached highlights in my hair but nothing bad. My hair turns out more smooth and silky that I ever could imagine..I have had this for 3 years and not a problem out of it...only thing,  it does get a funky smell sometimes, especially in the beginning but waaaaaay worth a slight smell..It doesn;t make your hair smell. If you clean it with alcohol occasionally it helps greatly too. I would recommend this to anyone! Go for it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy. Immediately got an error message on the display. It didn&#x27;t work. I had to return.</li>
            <li> Delivery was on time and the product is great!</li>
            <li> my friend love it. she used it and it work great.  she has me ordering the 1.5 next.  she said it did great job on her hair</li>
            <li> I wanted the infrared one, when I realized that I got confused, was to late, I live in M&amp;eacute;xico,  was very complicated for me to ask for a refund or to return it. Then I started to use this one and I was very sorprised by it&#x27;s perfomance. It&#x27;s very good, as good as I wonder If I ever needed the infrared feature.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse hair. And a lot of it! My new croc flat iron works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s really wet to dry, but its the best flat iron Ive ever had, it makes my hair shiny and totally frizz free.</li>
            <li> It works fine.  My hair is thick so I do have to go over my hair a couple of times to get it straight.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product because i dont think its a real one i think I got a knock off one.It wasnt what the picture showed</li>
            <li> I loved this straightener, while it lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Broke after 16 months. I turned it on and it said &amp;#34;ERR&amp;#34; and wouldn&#x27;t heat up. Of course they only provide a 12 month warranty. How convenient. I think I&#x27;ll go back to Chi I never had problems with their products breaking.</li>
