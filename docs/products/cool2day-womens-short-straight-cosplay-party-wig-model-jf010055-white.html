            <li>Great fun for the price!  </li>
            <li>High quality and looked beautiful!</li>
            <li>this would look great on a skinny girl,  I am too fat to make this really look good on me</li>
            <li>to brush, very soft, in all, a very great wig.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very easy to style and photographs well.</li>
            <li>easy to style, you can apply heat!</li>
            <li>Smooth hair, good fit!  </li>
            <li>My moms favorite wig</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m not too sure.</li>
            <li>It fits really well and looks great on.</li>
            <li>Yikes, so glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li>It was up to my jaw line, more like a bob.</li>
            <li>It is more chin length.  </li>
            <li>This wig is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Nice one I bought this just for Halloween and for the price it was worth it.</li>
            <li>It is bright white and covers your own hair well.</li>
            <li>so it is easy to style and cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s not because it&#x27;s cheap, since I&#x27;ve bought SO many lovely wigs on Amazon for ridiculously cheap prices, and they were all the right shape, color etc.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The wig arrived in excellent condition, was well packed and had no \\&quot;crimped hair\\&quot; from being squished oddly in packing.  </li>
            <li>Super cute wig</li>
            <li>Super cute and fit all my hair.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t fit my head.</li>
            <li>This wig company is great and I will be placing future orders with them.</li>
            <li>Nicely made &amp; feels like the real thing</li>
            <li>The photo of the wig is dead on and the fit of the wig is perfect.</li>
            <li>Lots of fun for hubby !</li>
            <li>comes with a free wig liner, but it&#x27;s not the right color.  </li>
            <li>It will serve temporary theatrical purposes wonderfully, but don&#x27;t expect a well made wig you can wear every day or looks totally realistic.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That being said, it is very silky and easy to style.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased with the product and it will work just fine for my purposes.</li>
            <li>I bought this wig just for fun.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Good quality, just not what I expected.</li>
            <li>Worth the buy.</li>
            <li>This wig is hot and just made my mannequin look like a true diva.</li>
            <li>Other than that this is a good buy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disappointed because it just doesn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li>I figured that at best it would be more a silvery, sort of greyish white but thick enough to be able to style and trim where need be.</li>
            <li>O yea, I look Hot in this, allows me to look mature sexy.</li>
            <li>I had a bit of confusion at first trying find the right way to put it on (but that&#x27;s probably just me) but other than that it had a good first impression.</li>
            <li>Let me first say that this wig is not at  all what is pictured.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The wig has adjustable straps in the back to make it more secure.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The hairline is absent by the ears so it will not be appropriate for flipping or intense action unless you stretch the cap and pin it down covering it over your own hairline.&lt;br /&gt;The style</li>
            <li>The hair quality felt soft like real hair and was easy to wear even at a night club.</li>
            <li>I could, but it doesn&#x27;t look as nice as the other side.  </li>
            <li>Lots of positive comments about it.</li>
            <li>I feel that the image pretty much represents how it looks, but on me the wig is shorter and is level with my chin and the bangs are not as defined as they are in the image, I had to pin them up</li>
            <li>All the hair is pretty much one length, the bangs are a bit shorter but will probably need trimming no matter what you want to use the wig for.</li>
            <li>It is a bright white chin length bob with long bangs.  </li>
            <li>, I guess I expected better, I really did.</li>
            <li>My daughter wore this for an anime convention cosplay costume and it looked real.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s not layered very well.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to using this for my cosplay.</li>
            <li>It looks relatively real, and moves like real hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to wear, feel like an old timey Vouge model.</li>
            <li>the shipment was fast as well.</li>
            <li>but not so in real life.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silky, true to color, reasonably opaque, skillfully styled, BUT it&#x27;s obviously cut and styled to be a front-part wig.  </li>
            <li>am 5&#x27;10 with an average size head :)</li>
            <li>It is so cute, but i wish i had gotten a nude wig cap to go with it, rather than a black one</li>
            <li>you are considering getting this, I highly reccomend.</li>
            <li>It was a bit hard for me to get the side part styled in, but after a half-bottle of hair glue I managed it.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have a wig cap on under it and it hid my hair nicely, you couldn&#x27;t see any of it.</li>
            <li>Instead, it was the perfect snowy white that I needed, but too thin to really style it any other way then as it comes through the mail.</li>
            <li>A dark colored wig cap will show thru, however my nude one works just fine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up doing the second option and cutting the excess length off as best</li>
            <li>Part of my impulse as an avid cosplayer is to buy a wig anytime I have money to do so and figure it out later.</li>
            <li>but this didn&#x27;t look the same on as modelled - MUCH shorter!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The wig is far too thin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wig arrived with one entire side flipped outwards at the bottom, so it looks ridiculously stupid, not to mention is one of the reasons my own hair makes me have to wear wigs, &amp; I can&#x27;t do hair, nor would I be able to, being in so much pain,</li>
            <li>I should have gotten a professional to do it</li>
            <li>I love A cut wigs and this will be a constant now, was complimented on it by everyone and it was well sized,  at least try o my head.</li>
            <li>and the cap was too small to fit my entire head.</li>
            <li>is shorter than it appears in the picture because I suppose that the mannequin&#x27;s head is smaller than a normal human head.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would essentially be good as is without cutting</li>
            <li>A little hairspray, some pins in the right place, a white stocking cap underneath</li>
            <li>But, on the down side it was much shorter</li>
            <li>It is pretty thick and really soft.</li>

            <li> It is pretty thick and really soft.</li>
            <li> I have found, however, that the netting does show a bit in the back, but that can be fixed by combing the hair a little t othe back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is definitely worth the price not more or less.</li>
            <li> i have had this wig for so long</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes pre-styles as a bob haircut with long bangs.</li>
            <li> only thing I had problems with is even with the wig set on the loosest setting, and with short hair now, it&#x27;s still a little tight and gives me a headache if I wear it for too long.</li>
            <li> I was surprised because I have long thick mexican hair, just a little stereotyping.</li>
            <li> A little too short for me.</li>
            <li> There is no real part at all in the stitching grain of the hair pattern.  </li>
            <li> The band is very loose and it kept falling off my head...</li>
            <li> so I figured I&#x27;d use it as a spoof on hubby and kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wig is a bit shorter than expected</li>
            <li> This happens with a couple of my other wigs, though, so</li>
            <li> My hair is relatively dark, too, and at the time it was long.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It would have been nicer if it was a little thicker.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend for everyday use though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Things to look out for:&lt;br /&gt;It sheds like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;The tan skullcap and sewing tracks can be seen if you are a few feet away.  </li>
            <li> so I will have to attach firmly to prevent my hair from showing.</li>
            <li> It also came at least 5 days (or something like that) before it was due.</li>
            <li> This wig has stood up to three or four washings with laundry detergent and although it sheds a bit, it&#x27;s not more than I would expect to come from any of my wigs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this for cutting and styling for short boy hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At least it fits.</li>
            <li> I mean crappy.</li>
            <li> Length is to my chin and ends at the base of my natural hairline on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The bangs are completely different, too btw, in fact I think the wig in the picture on this page has nothing to do with the wig you receive. :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Awesome buy I bought two. I use eyeshadow to put in colored streaks. It washes out using a baby wipe. Super cute wig</li>
            <li> My daughter wore this for an anime convention cosplay costume and it looked real. Lots of positive comments about it. It is bright white and covers your own hair well.</li>
            <li> Part of my impulse as an avid cosplayer is to buy a wig anytime I have money to do so and figure it out later. However this time I had an idea before hand, as I was planning to go to a convention as Lisanna Strauss from fairytail. I figured that at best it would be more a silvery, sort of greyish white but thick enough to be able to style and trim where need be. Instead, it was the perfect snowy white that I needed, but too thin to really style it any other way then as it comes through the mail. If the hair is moved to the side even in the slightest the netting underneath shows through rather obviously. It may do in a pinch if you use enough hairspray, but hey, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this for cutting and styling for short boy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig is far too thin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would essentially be good as is without cutting</li>
            <li> This is a crappy wig. I mean crappy. I know it&#x27;s not because it&#x27;s cheap, since I&#x27;ve bought SO many lovely wigs on Amazon for ridiculously cheap prices, and they were all the right shape, color etc.&lt;br /&gt;This wig arrived with one entire side flipped outwards at the bottom, so it looks ridiculously stupid, not to mention is one of the reasons my own hair makes me have to wear wigs, &amp; I can&#x27;t do hair, nor would I be able to, being in so much pain, but I don&#x27;t know, I guess I expected better, I really did. This thing isn&#x27;t even wearable. The bangs are completely different, too btw, in fact I think the wig in the picture on this page has nothing to do with the wig you receive. :(</li>
            <li> My moms favorite wig she wore it to a gathering n got lots of complaints about it . She wears it alot</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I took it out of the package and the hair just started falling out all over.</li>
            <li> Let me first say that this wig is not at  all what is pictured.  It is a bright white chin length bob with long bangs.  There is no real part at all in the stitching grain of the hair pattern.  That being said, it is very silky and easy to style.  Without some sort of hair product you will never get the bangs to not hang in your face.  A dark colored wig cap will show thru, however my nude one works just fine.  The wig arrived in excellent condition, was well packed and had no \\&quot;crimped hair\\&quot; from being squished oddly in packing.  Overall, I am pleased with the product and it will work just fine for my purposes.</li>
            <li> perfect for halloween! this was great for my costume. easy to style, you can apply heat! great price, too. very satisfied</li>
            <li> Love it! i have had this wig for so long and it is still in great shape! It whent from soul eater to jack frost to ragyo from kill la kill and it is still in order !</li>
            <li> this would look great on a skinny girl,  I am too fat to make this really look good on me</li>
            <li> It is so cute, but i wish i had gotten a nude wig cap to go with it, rather than a black one</li>
            <li> A little too short for me. My hair shows in the back. Also it&#x27;s not layered very well. You can see the netting in the back. I might have to go find extensions. At least it fits. I was really looking forward to using this for my cosplay. Now I&#x27;m not too sure.</li>
            <li> Great fun for the price!  Smooth hair, good fit!  Came with a cap for hair and a styling tool!  Lots of fun for hubby !</li>
            <li> I bought this wig just for fun. It fits really well and looks great on. Definitely worth the money. I love it!</li>
            <li> This wig is pretty good. I had a bit of confusion at first trying find the right way to put it on (but that&#x27;s probably just me) but other than that it had a good first impression. I have found, however, that the netting does show a bit in the back, but that can be fixed by combing the hair a little t othe back. It looks relatively real, and moves like real hair. It also came at least 5 days (or something like that) before it was due.</li>
            <li> O yea, I look Hot in this, allows me to look mature sexy. Yikes, so glad I ordered it. It&#x27;s fun to wear, feel like an old timey Vouge model. ThankU&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li> It would have been nicer if it was a little thicker.</li>
            <li> The quality, like I said, is amazing.  It&#x27;s silky, true to color, reasonably opaque, skillfully styled, BUT it&#x27;s obviously cut and styled to be a front-part wig.  If you try and part it on the side it&#x27;s going to look like you tried to side-part a center-part hairdo.  If you turn the wig so the part sits to one side, then one side of your hair will be longer than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up doing the second option and cutting the excess length off as best I could, but it doesn&#x27;t look as nice as the other side.  I should have gotten a professional to do it so the ends curled under properly.</li>
            <li> The wig covered my hair fairly well I was surprised because I have long thick mexican hair, just a little stereotyping. But, on the down side it was much shorter then I wanted it to be. It was up to my jaw line, more like a bob. I wanted it to look like the picture displayed on the companies page, it wasn&#x27;t styled at all so be prepared for that. Good quality, just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fit my head. The hair was too short to cover my wig cap if moved up and the cap was too small to fit my entire head.</li>
            <li> For the price, this thing is great. It is pretty thick and really soft. I feel that the image pretty much represents how it looks, but on me the wig is shorter and is level with my chin and the bangs are not as defined as they are in the image, I had to pin them up and I am considering trimming them. Other than that this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> Nice one I bought this just for Halloween and for the price it was worth it. I love A cut wigs and this will be a constant now, was complimented on it by everyone and it was well sized,  at least try o my head. Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> High quality and looked beautiful! The hair quality felt soft like real hair and was easy to wear even at a night club. Was not itchy in anyway.</li>
            <li> This wig is hot and just made my mannequin look like a true diva. Very easy to style and photographs well. The cut is great and for the price you cant beat the quality. TWO BIG TOES !!!!! This wig company is great and I will be placing future orders with them. Would not recommend for everyday use though.</li>
            <li> The band is very loose and it kept falling off my head...i ened up just leaving it off because of this. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> what can I say a sophistticated look that just awwwws people and they cant even tell its a wig awesome showing my age lol&lt;br /&gt;hope your business florishes&lt;br /&gt;dawn</li>
            <li> It will serve temporary theatrical purposes wonderfully, but don&#x27;t expect a well made wig you can wear every day or looks totally realistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to look out for:&lt;br /&gt;It sheds like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;The tan skullcap and sewing tracks can be seen if you are a few feet away.  I took some white hairspray coloring to the exposed areas to hide it.&lt;br /&gt;The hairline is absent by the ears so it will not be appropriate for flipping or intense action unless you stretch the cap and pin it down covering it over your own hairline.&lt;br /&gt;The style is shorter than it appears in the picture because I suppose that the mannequin&#x27;s head is smaller than a normal human head.  It is more chin length.  Fits perfectly on a child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the good side:&lt;br /&gt;The hair quality is good, not frizzy at all so it is easy to style and cut.&lt;br /&gt;The wig has adjustable straps in the back to make it more secure.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a free wig liner, but it&#x27;s not the right color.  You can use it for something else.&lt;br /&gt;The cut is almost layered in the back and sides so it&#x27;s definitely got some panache to it.  A little hairspray, some pins in the right place, a white stocking cap underneath and you&#x27;re in business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely worth the price not more or less.</li>
            <li> Super cute and fit all my hair.  Cant wait to wear it for an upcoming party to show it off.</li>
            <li> Cheap,cheap... &amp; cheappp</li>
            <li> Nicely made &amp; feels like the real thing but this didn&#x27;t look the same on as modelled - MUCH shorter!</li>
            <li> this is a really amazing wig xD I bought it for a friend and styled it today! she will be cosplaying jack frost and this was perfect to style for it.&lt;br /&gt;easy to brush, very soft, in all, a very great wig.&lt;br /&gt;if you are considering getting this, I highly reccomend. the shipment was fast as well.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to be part of costume- didn&#x27;t work out so I figured I&#x27;d use it as a spoof on hubby and kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed because it just doesn&#x27;t look right. In picture there appears to be a part- but not so in real life. I didn&#x27;t send back because I figured it could maybe be used as part of a Halloween costume with a hat maybe...??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend this...</li>
            <li> Very cute wig, cut is nice and I like the side part.  The wig is a bit shorter than expected so I will have to attach firmly to prevent my hair from showing. Length is to my chin and ends at the base of my natural hairline on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 5&#x27;10 with an average size head :)</li>
            <li> Loved the wig! The photo of the wig is dead on and the fit of the wig is perfect. I order with this company in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for a Jack Frost cosplay, so I had to do a lot of trimming/cutting. This wig has stood up to three or four washings with laundry detergent and although it sheds a bit, it&#x27;s not more than I would expect to come from any of my wigs.&lt;br /&gt;It comes pre-styles as a bob haircut with long bangs. All the hair is pretty much one length, the bangs are a bit shorter but will probably need trimming no matter what you want to use the wig for. It was a bit hard for me to get the side part styled in, but after a half-bottle of hair glue I managed it.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have a wig cap on under it and it hid my hair nicely, you couldn&#x27;t see any of it. My hair is relatively dark, too, and at the time it was long.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I had problems with is even with the wig set on the loosest setting, and with short hair now, it&#x27;s still a little tight and gives me a headache if I wear it for too long. This happens with a couple of my other wigs, though, so I think it&#x27;s just my head.</li>
