            <li>Wonderful Product.</li>
            <li>Plus the cream smells great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li>Delivery/Timing Exceptional!</li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t say with any certainty that I can see any differences in my skin, I think my skin looks great</li>
            <li>Love Korres, product works very nicely, smells yummy!</li>
            <li>Having tried just about everything that is touted to be the &amp;#34;Miracle&amp;#34; face cream, I am delighted to say this is one of my all time favorites.  </li>
            <li>But good face cream.</li>
            <li>Really glad I bought this!</li>
            <li>Organic and good for my skin at that :)</li>
            <li>It feels so good, smells wonderful, and gives you soft dewy skin.</li>
            <li>It does have a rose scent</li>
            <li>make it more bearable for overnight use, however it is not as effective</li>
            <li>They seem to be a fine, reputable company,  Well done!</li>
            <li>This product smells amazing, and is quite strong, so if you don&#x27;t like that, don&#x27;t order it.  </li>
            <li>I used it for 2 nights and while I agree that the smell is strong, my skin looked and felt amazing immediately.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have an issue with roses or even rose scent, but this is way too strong for something that goes on your face.  </li>
            <li>the stronger the better.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>There are better products out there</li>
            <li>I do love the scent, consistency and effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t call It overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I feel like the people who have said the scent is too overwhelming</li>
            <li>I am very excited to try more products.  </li>
            <li>A good price and a good product, just maybe not for someone with super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great texture...smells like an old lady.</li>
            <li>I literally could not go to sleep because it was so strong.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me, and like to smell FABulous</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and creamy, and stays on all night....</li>
            <li>Its light and absorbs well.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was worth the hype</li>
            <li>Very delighted with my product, and enjoy the other offerings from Korres as well.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not unpleasant, just too strong.</li>
            <li>and I like how rich and creamy it is.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it only because I LOVE anything wild rose or rose scented...</li>
            <li>And the scent of wild rose is just so soothing.</li>
            <li>It is also good for a quick fix, to get the noticeable results you can leave it on for 30 min, as a regular moisturizing mask.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for two days which may not seem a lot but thus far my chin is starting to look as flawless as it did in middle school and my skin tone is looking better.</li>
            <li>So I figured although a little out of my minimum wage price line I had to give it try because it had great reviews.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.  </li>
            <li>but I decided to jump right in and give it a try.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say this is one of a few products that I am willing to buy again</li>
            <li>First time I purchased it in Sephora 2 years ago, and so far from all nonprofessional skin treatments Ive tried, this one is the most effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also has a strong Rose fragrance that is bearable but a little too much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t typically like fragrances, but this one is nice and dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>I actually noticed a difference the very first night I used this cream!!  </li>
            <li>;) then try this product.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need very much at all.</li>
            <li>I really like this night cream.</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so soft and looked so fresh.</li>
            <li>I just applied to much to their face.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, it was created by a pharmacist in Greece (I LOVE this since I am a pharmacist), and saw what lengths they go to make these products all naturally, and use local farmers to supply ingredients.  </li>
            <li>boyfriend complains every time I wear this because I smell so strongly, but I spent so much money on it</li>
            <li>You wake up with a significantly brighter face, smooth and blemishes seem less marked as well.</li>
            <li>I purchased this mask at Sephora and ultimately returned it due to the overwhelming scent.  </li>
            <li>I am a natural skin care junkie and received a sample of this product from another order.</li>
            <li>Another plus is that I am so far not allergic or having adverse symptoms to it which means it is good for sensitive skin since I can not even use the simply make up remover line making me crazy sensitive to product lines.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it makes my blood vessels swell a bit at first, so that&#x27;s not something I want.</li>
            <li>Then, after I used it once, and woke up with incredibly soft, glowing skin, I decided to research the brand further.  </li>
            <li>&gt; - It visibly improves skin appearance after first use (I personally don&#x27;t like to apply it overnight, the smell is a little too much)&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> You wake up with a significantly brighter face, smooth and blemishes seem less marked as well. Really glad I bought this! Organic and good for my skin at that :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading a blurb about it in one of my Allure or Vogue magazines recently.  I ordered it only because I LOVE anything wild rose or rose scented...the stronger the better.  Then, after I used it once, and woke up with incredibly soft, glowing skin, I decided to research the brand further.  Much to my surprise, it was created by a pharmacist in Greece (I LOVE this since I am a pharmacist), and saw what lengths they go to make these products all naturally, and use local farmers to supply ingredients.  I am very excited to try more products.  This product smells amazing, and is quite strong, so if you don&#x27;t like that, don&#x27;t order it.  If you&#x27;re like me, and like to smell FABulous ;) then try this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Product. It feels so good, smells wonderful, and gives you soft dewy skin. I love it. A must have for every girl&#x27;s beauty products.</li>
            <li> This cream has a very thick and greasy feel to it when you put it on. I only used a small amount and still felt clumpy. It also has a strong Rose fragrance that is bearable but a little too much. There are better products out there</li>
            <li> Having tried just about everything that is touted to be the &amp;#34;Miracle&amp;#34; face cream, I am delighted to say this is one of my all time favorites.  Goes on smooth and creamy, and stays on all night....then when washed away in the morning, your skin will feel exhilarated!  A tad on the pricey side....but well worth it.  The lines and uneven tones seem to vanish, and there is no price for that accomplishment!  Very delighted with my product, and enjoy the other offerings from Korres as well.  They seem to be a fine, reputable company,  Well done!</li>
            <li> I wish the scent was a bit milder.. even though I like it.  I only use it when he&#x27;s not here.  Or I want him to stay away from me. ;)</li>
            <li> I bought this on one of the shopping channels 2 years ago; used it a few times, stored it in the fridge and forgot about it.&lt;br /&gt;I used it again last nite and WOW!&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, what I didn&#x27;t notice before is how well this \\&quot;sleeping mask\\&quot; moisturizes.&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> I use this nightly.  While I can&#x27;t say with any certainty that I can see any differences in my skin, I think my skin looks great and I like how rich and creamy it is.  I don&#x27;t typically like fragrances, but this one is nice and dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> The smell is not unpleasant, just too strong. I do like what it does to my skin, but I won&#x27;t be buying this again</li>
            <li> I never write a review and I tried to write a review where I bought the product which turned into an interrogation and was too time consuming for someone who just woke up. For this product I felt that I had to write a review because it works that well. I have tried everything to cover up or fix the acne scars and hyper pigmentation caused by all the products that I am allergic to. So I figured although a little out of my minimum wage price line I had to give it try because it had great reviews. I&#x27;ve been using this product for two days which may not seem a lot but thus far my chin is starting to look as flawless as it did in middle school and my skin tone is looking better. The fact that this product is doing this well this soon only makes me hopeful for what it does in two weeks. Another plus is that I am so far not allergic or having adverse symptoms to it which means it is good for sensitive skin since I can not even use the simply make up remover line making me crazy sensitive to product lines. I am happy to say this is one of a few products that I am willing to buy again</li>
            <li> I purchased this mask at Sephora and ultimately returned it due to the overwhelming scent.  I literally could not go to sleep because it was so strong.  I don&#x27;t have an issue with roses or even rose scent, but this is way too strong for something that goes on your face.  Not recommended.</li>
            <li> I really like this night cream. Its light and absorbs well. It goes on smoothly. And the scent of wild rose is just so soothing. It moisturizes well. My only gripe is the price is a bit steep.</li>
            <li> I am a natural skin care junkie and received a sample of this product from another order. I used it for 2 nights and while I agree that the smell is strong, my skin looked and felt amazing immediately. Not sure about long term results but if my skin can look moisturized and softer instantly, I can get used to the smell!</li>
            <li> I actually noticed a difference the very first night I used this cream!!  My skin was dramatically brighter and spots lightened.  My harshest critic (18 y.o. daughter) noticed!  Plus the cream smells great!</li>
            <li> I do love the scent, consistency and effectiveness of this product. On the other hand, it makes my blood vessels swell a bit at first, so that&#x27;s not something I want. A good price and a good product, just maybe not for someone with super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> First time I purchased it in Sephora 2 years ago, and so far from all nonprofessional skin treatments Ive tried, this one is the most effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - It visibly improves skin appearance after first use (I personally don&#x27;t like to apply it overnight, the smell is a little too much)&lt;br /&gt; - I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years, and it works every single time.&lt;br /&gt; - It is also good for a quick fix, to get the noticeable results you can leave it on for 30 min, as a regular moisturizing mask.&lt;br /&gt; - I also tried overnight bio peel from Keihls (around $80), scent and texture make it more bearable for overnight use, however it is not as effective</li>
            <li> face cream...didn&#x27;t notice any change. But good face cream.</li>
            <li> Love Korres, product works very nicely, smells yummy! Delivery/Timing Exceptional! Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great texture...smells like an old lady. I also do not feel like my skin is brighter, and I have been using everyday for some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend complains every time I wear this because I smell so strongly, but I spent so much money on it I feel like I need to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have been researching this product for quite a while. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was worth the hype but I decided to jump right in and give it a try. I love this product. It&#x27;s absolutely wonderful. My skin has never felt so soft and looked so fresh. It does have a rose scent but I wouldn&#x27;t call It overwhelming. I feel like the people who have said the scent is too overwhelming I just applied to much to their face. You really don&#x27;t need very much at all. If using thIs daily one bottle will probably last about 6 months. If you use It less frequently you can probably get away with using it for an entire year.</li>
