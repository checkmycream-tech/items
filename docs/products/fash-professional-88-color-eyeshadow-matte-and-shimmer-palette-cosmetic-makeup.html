            <li>This is a really nice pallette.</li>
            <li>I DO recommend it, it&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li>The company didn&#x27;t even respond to my email about changing my review if they were able to make good on this.</li>
            <li>this box has lots of colors\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;She smiled</li>
            <li>So i was really excited to get this!!</li>
            <li>I love the options.</li>
            <li>but all the others were intact and they are lovely.</li>
            <li>Many combinations can be created with this palette...</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I decided to try it because it had ok reviews.</li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x60;t used many of the colors(I just got it today</li>
            <li>I love mixing the colors together</li>
            <li>For the most part, you get what you pay for and I paid under $20.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>and I truly love it.</li>
            <li>This palette is pretty amazing for the amount of money you pay!</li>
            <li>I really love this palette.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>The colors are very true to life unlike many shadows.</li>
            <li>It was also the best eye shadow I have EVER used in a very long time.</li>
            <li>For that price you get a good amount of very pigmented colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>This palette is a nice thing because you will get a beautiful colors and many combinations with less money.  </li>
            <li>The product was shipped promptly and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>It has really pretty, nicely pigmented colors.</li>
            <li>But to my luck everything came out just fine.</li>
            <li>I payed a cheap price for a cheap product and received cheap results.</li>
            <li>the box is huge bt</li>
            <li>The only thing is that I would make sure to have a good eyeshadow brush to make for an easier application.</li>
            <li>88 Bold color, easy to apply.</li>
            <li>and I was soooo excited about playin with all of the colors</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t use all the colors of this palette, I do appreciate the pigment rich brown colors.</li>
            <li>and I also love the wide variety of bright and muted colors.</li>
            <li>You will love it because the colors are intense.</li>
            <li>I love that it was wrapped very securly.</li>
            <li>You definitely have to use a eye shadow primer when using these colors (Coastal Scents Shadow Worx is a good one).</li>
            <li>Super pigmented and had zero fall out,</li>
            <li>They all look the same once you put it on, and may I mention I use Urban Decay eyeshadow primer the best on the market.</li>
            <li>and I bought it because of the one day shipping and its super affordable.</li>
            <li>Overall a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>Each shade is about the size of a penny, but considering how much pay-off they give, I suppose the size is fine.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday, theater, and pros.</li>
            <li>but then once I applied the shadow to my eyes it looked so delicate and soft, very beautiful.</li>
            <li>natural, smokey, and more vibrant combos.</li>
            <li>Save your pretty pennies and invest in a nicer pallet.</li>
            <li>This is my first palette</li>
            <li>My first time purchasing make-up via Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews and decided to order this because they were positive, however, when I got my order the makeup in the box was smashed and the bubble wrap was torn.</li>
            <li>and I must say that the colors on the palette are very vivid, pretty colors.</li>
            <li>My g/f really loves it.</li>
            <li>No broken pieces at all in mine.</li>
            <li>No broken colors or outta place pieces ^_^</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely what I needed for my makeup collection.</li>
            <li>A lot of the colors still aren&#x27;t very pigmented.</li>
            <li>No broken colors and colors were brighter in person.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how the other more playful colors hold up</li>
            <li>I also use the shadow for other stuff since there are SO many colors.</li>
            <li>I had read the other reviews and was even more worried about the delivery.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and long-lasting even without a primer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>ESP if EYE paid for all this shadoobie with my own hard earned</li>
            <li>But wow I really have to cake this on for the colors to show.</li>
            <li>Much better choice ended up throwing this one away after a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Before ordering this product I was a bit hesitant about not knowing how vivid the colors would be on the palette.</li>
            <li>And for this price , you usually don&#x27;t get that many colors.</li>
            <li>Use the pink for a quick blush.</li>
            <li>Completely recommend.</li>
            <li>The case is also very sleek and is the only item I leave out on my counter during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>None of them came out completely</li>
            <li>But again keep in mind that I am only playing around with the nudes so mainly the tans and browns.</li>
            <li>So be prepared to have some broken colors but to be pleasantly surprised how lovely the colors are.</li>
            <li>But I am not satisfied, I wish I would have purchased my original plan to buy [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>At first I was very hesitant to buy this from all of the reviews about how small the colors were, but when I finally got it I realized they&#x27;re about the size you would expect from any eyeshadow you would buy at a department store.</li>
            <li>It was pigmented enough to wear it showed up and looked natural but not overly done to where I looked like a clown.</li>
            <li>but I lost 1/3 to 1/2 of 2 or 3 colors and a little off the top of a few others.</li>
            <li>The lighter colors are not as pigmented as the darker colors (which is expected), and there is fallout of the shadows, but the packaging is of decent quality, and I feel that you get what you pay for.</li>

            <li> I have been looking for matte eyeshadows for so long, and yes you find them, but mostly they come in expensive palettes or only as single colors.</li>
            <li> So long story short the pkging was FAB!</li>
            <li> and I can tell it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> There were only 2 colors that had partial breakage but none of the colors were totally smashed.  </li>
            <li> The pink is white, brown is white, u get the idea....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn and worked with makeup for a long time.</li>
            <li> This wide selection allows you to mix and match and experiment with different colors to suit your mood.</li>
            <li> My expectations for this palette were minimal; even after reading and watching tons of reviews.</li>
            <li> It came in faster then expected</li>
            <li> then i expected, what can i expect for a 88 color.</li>
            <li> I am dark complected(About Bria Myles-Super model Oluchi&#x60;s complexion)</li>
            <li> It seriously has every color you could possibly want or imagine.</li>
            <li> I ordered this I little worried, I had never bought eyeshadow from the internet.</li>
            <li> Other than that this palette recieves 5 stars !!</li>
            <li> The only disappointment I found was that I was expecting them to be bigger.</li>
            <li> Also a few were cracked.</li>
            <li> so I did my usual nude eye--</li>
            <li> for the packaging I was a little nervy because I dint want ANY thing to be broken.</li>
            <li> Seriously, buy it.</li>
            <li> Was a little disappointed with the packaging as it wasn&#x27;t sufficient to keep one of the colors from breaking and depositing that color onto the other colors.</li>
            <li> only thing I am disappointed about was the packaging.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I was going to be disappointed yet again by the palette I bought because it felt and looked like powder to me :(</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> But, to my disappointment, the colors are very dull when applied to the skin</li>
            <li> what so ever so as i feared when i opened the case one of the colors was broken. :(</li>
            <li> I was afraid that the eyeshadow would be all over the box by the time I received the package.  </li>
            <li> I was really disappointed since this was a gift for a friend.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> BUT the packaging was HORRIBLE.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never worn eyeshadow (unless you count prom) so I was nervous to use this. I love the options. It literally goes with ANYTHING i&#x27;m wearing or whatever style I want to display. I have to give it 4 stars though because there are one or two colors that are in metallic (with glitter) that i wish were in matte.</li>
            <li> So i was really excited to get this!! BUT the packaging was HORRIBLE. It was put in a box much to big so it had a lot of room to bang around and there was virtually no padding what so ever so as i feared when i opened the case one of the colors was broken. :( but all the others were intact and they are lovely. So be prepared to have some broken colors but to be pleasantly surprised how lovely the colors are.</li>
            <li> 88 Bold color, easy to apply. Bang for the buck! My g/f really loves it. You should buy it is a must have for ladies. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This palette is a nice thing because you will get a beautiful colors and many combinations with less money.  You will love it because the colors are intense.</li>
            <li> Before ordering this product I was a bit hesitant about not knowing how vivid the colors would be on the palette. The colors just didn&#x27;t look that bright on the pictures. I just received mine and I was soooo excited about playin with all of the colors and I must say that the colors on the palette are very vivid, pretty colors. But, to my disappointment, the colors are very dull when applied to the skin and I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between the purples...they all looked the same on my skin. I payed a cheap price for a cheap product and received cheap results. Overall, I am very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for matte eyeshadows for so long, and yes you find them, but mostly they come in expensive palettes or only as single colors. Although I don&#x27;t use all the colors of this palette, I do appreciate the pigment rich brown colors. And for this price , you usually don&#x27;t get that many colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn and worked with makeup for a long time. More expensive brands of eyeshadow have nothing on this one. Came shipped perfectly, with lots of precautions to prevent breaking. No broken pieces at all in mine. The colors are very true to life unlike many shadows. Nice mix of matte and glimmer. The shimmer in the metallic shadows isn&#x27;t so overpowering that you look like you&#x27;ve gone on a Lisa Frank run. Many combinations can be created with this palette...natural, smokey, and more vibrant combos. Great for everyday, theater, and pros. :) Wonderful. Will definitely buy FASH again. Completely recommend.</li>
            <li> I have never used this type of pallet. I decided to try it because it had ok reviews. They give a lot of fall out. I tried to like it but it was lacking. My eyes kind of were irritated when I wore these too. Also a few were cracked. Save your pretty pennies and invest in a nicer pallet.</li>
            <li> At first I was very hesitant to buy this from all of the reviews about how small the colors were, but when I finally got it I realized they&#x27;re about the size you would expect from any eyeshadow you would buy at a department store. The colors are gorgeous and despite how close they seem to one another they each give a very different look from one another on the skin. The case is also very sleek and is the only item I leave out on my counter during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I am disappointed about was the packaging. There was no padding for the case and when I opened it I saw that a number of my colors had been smashed around. None of them came out completely but I lost 1/3 to 1/2 of 2 or 3 colors and a little off the top of a few others. Considering the vast variety of colors I have and how long this is likely to last me I still think it deserves 4 stars, despite packaging.</li>
            <li> It came EARLIER than the time it said it was gonna take. It was also the best eye shadow I have EVER used in a very long time. Super pigmented and had zero fall out,</li>
            <li> I LOVE this palette ! Although I haven&#x60;t used many of the colors(I just got it today so I did my usual nude eye--I know I Know, booooring) I still like how the product blends so well and shows up beautifully on my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background Info on Me...I am dark complected(About Bria Myles-Super model Oluchi&#x60;s complexion) so powder shadows don&#x60;t look all that great on me. At first I thought I was going to be disappointed yet again by the palette I bought because it felt and looked like powder to me :( *nooot again!* but then once I applied the shadow to my eyes it looked so delicate and soft, very beautiful. It was pigmented enough to wear it showed up and looked natural but not overly done to where I looked like a clown. But again keep in mind that I am only playing around with the nudes so mainly the tans and browns. I don&#x27;t know how the other more playful colors hold up but I will post pics and write another review one I get my laptop wireless router and all that good stuff(so you should hear from me in about a week or so)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as for the packaging I was a little nervy because I dint want ANY thing to be broken. ESP if EYE paid for all this shadoobie with my own hard earned cash.-_-&lt;br /&gt;Yes the box is huge bt they come protected with a lot of bubble wrap lol. So long story short the pkging was FAB! No broken colors or outta place pieces ^_^ *happy dance*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a WONDERFUL palette and I am in love. The only thing is that I would make sure to have a good eyeshadow brush to make for an easier application. Other than that this palette recieves 5 stars !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Cee.</li>
            <li> The lighter colors are not as pigmented as the darker colors (which is expected), and there is fallout of the shadows, but the packaging is of decent quality, and I feel that you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely what I needed for my makeup collection. It seriously has every color you could possibly want or imagine. The product was shipped promptly and arrived very quickly. I use it every day and always receive comments on my eye makeup. I would recommend this product to anyone who want tons of choices when they put on eyeshadow. I also use the shadow for other stuff since there are SO many colors. Put it over a chapstick and you have lipstick. Use the pink for a quick blush. Anything you can imagine, you can use this product for. Seriously, buy it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice pallette. It has really pretty, nicely pigmented colors. I love that it was wrapped very securly. I would recommend this pallette.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eyeshadow palette! I love mixing the colors together and I also love the wide variety of bright and muted colors. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> excellent, the delivery, the product and the price</li>
            <li> The kit came well packaged and in a timely fashion.  There were only 2 colors that had partial breakage but none of the colors were totally smashed.  It was a great investment for a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> My expectations for this palette were minimal; even after reading and watching tons of reviews. You definitely have to use a eye shadow primer when using these colors (Coastal Scents Shadow Worx is a good one). A lot of the colors still aren&#x27;t very pigmented. For the most part, you get what you pay for and I paid under $20. For that price you get a good amount of very pigmented colors to choose from. I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> (Using husbands account) I ordered this I little worried, I had never bought eyeshadow from the internet. I had read the other reviews and was even more worried about the delivery. But to my luck everything came out just fine. I got the box in time. The eye shadows were perfect, no cracks or any damage. This is my first palette and I truly love it. They&#x27;re not chalky and the look great with or without primer. I DO recommend it, it&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li> This product was a gift to my fiance and she was very happy to receive it. The day she used it, she was very satisfied!!!!!</li>
            <li> This palette is pretty amazing for the amount of money you pay! The colors are vibrant and long-lasting even without a primer. The only disappointment I found was that I was expecting them to be bigger. Each shade is about the size of a penny, but considering how much pay-off they give, I suppose the size is fine. Overall a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> I really love this palette. It has a great assortment of colors. The pigment is very good. I have the product for a while now and I can tell it will last for a long time. I love it.</li>
            <li> I am impress with this product. It came in faster then expected and when i opened it, the palette was smaller then i expected, what can i expect for a 88 color. I am currently using this palette verses the ones that i got from another company that only gave me 8 colors for almost the same price as this 88 palette. Great product.</li>
            <li> They shipped well jus a lil powder flaked off. The colors are about the size of a dime but there is a lot of colors!</li>
            <li> I like to match my eyeshadow with colors I am wearing. But wow I really have to cake this on for the colors to show. They all look the same once you put it on, and may I mention I use Urban Decay eyeshadow primer the best on the market. I&#x27;m African American and these colors all look the same. The pink is white, brown is white, u get the idea....basically chalky. I regret buying this one I needed it in a hurry and I bought it because of the one day shipping and its super affordable. But I am not satisfied, I wish I would have purchased my original plan to buy [[ASIN:B001C6H6F8 SHANY Eyeshadow Palette, Boutique, 40 Color]]and I actually did from purchasing before. Much better choice ended up throwing this one away after a few weeks. The company didn&#x27;t even respond to my email about changing my review if they were able to make good on this.</li>
            <li> Awesome colors for a great price!! This wide selection allows you to mix and match and experiment with different colors to suit your mood.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and decided to order this because they were positive, however, when I got my order the makeup in the box was smashed and the bubble wrap was torn. I was really disappointed since this was a gift for a friend. I don&#x27;t think that I will be ordering makeup from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my daughter.  Was a little disappointed with the packaging as it wasn&#x27;t sufficient to keep one of the colors from breaking and depositing that color onto the other colors. Otherwise, I am pleased with this product. Lots of colors for my daugther to experiment with at a great price.</li>
            <li> I received the product in great condition, it is as described in the ad, really good. Very beautiful colors and testura to excellent use, as well as the packaging is very beautiful too.</li>
            <li> My first time purchasing make-up via Amazon.  I was afraid that the eyeshadow would be all over the box by the time I received the package.  No broken colors and colors were brighter in person.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I did not get the box so i did not like it and it say matte and shimmer but it</li>
            <li> I gave her this set and she was like, \\&quot; dang this box has lots of colors\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;She smiled and she was all happy because as I boyfriend, I know what she likes and I got her primer with the gift.&lt;br /&gt;Overall. She loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you FASH :D</li>
