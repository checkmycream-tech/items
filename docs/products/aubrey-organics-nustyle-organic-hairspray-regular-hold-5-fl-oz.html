    <ol>
            <li>Excellent conditioning and no build up.</li>
            <li>Aubrey is the best!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Remember to spray up over the hair and let the spray settle for best results.  </li>
            <li>This is the best Hairspray I have ever used.</li>
            <li>A great product for maintaining wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>So I am happy.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely not thin and this hairspray works great!</li>
            <li>not even sure if the hold stays either... just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spray any more onto my hair!</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this hairspray to everyone!</li>
            <li>A perfectly light effective hold, especially good for soft, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have used many organic hairsprays and I was using another Aubrey Organics hairspray that was not doing the trick.</li>
            <li>More like a scrunch spray than a hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I love the idea</li>
            <li>but I felt compelled here because I love this product and don&#x27;t want Aubrey Organics to stop making it.</li>
            <li>It has a lavender rosemary essence that helps helps in refreshing hair too.  </li>
            <li>No nasty chemicals to inhale.  </li>
            <li>This does the trick and it&#x27;s silicone free, which is important to me.</li>
            <li>The thought of using chemical hairspray on her horrified me (chemicals are inevitable, but I&#x27;m not going to put them on her just for vanity&#x27;s sake), so this was a great compromise.</li>
            <li>If anyone knows of a good, natural, preferably organic hairspray that works and is not sticky or crunchy, please let me know.</li>
            <li>Gives lovely soft waves on my hair, which comb out nicely.  </li>
            <li>I love that this product is natural but it does have a very strong smell.  </li>
            <li>but if you really have a good hairdo that you want kept in place for a reasonable amount of time, you gotta go with the aerosol brands!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to clean it, in case it was clogged, but it did not help.</li>
            <li>Love this organic product and it really keeps my hair in place.</li>
            <li>I bought these hairspray because I didn&#x27;t want to use my aerosol hairspray when I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>It is more on the thicker side, but not thick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a few bottles now, and the pumps aren&#x27;t great on them.</li>
            <li>I love a soft hold and don&#x27;t like it to look or feel like I am using hairspray.</li>
            <li>I love the smell; very natural, so much</li>
            <li>but I am betting I can find a better product with a little more research on the EWG&#x27;s Guide.</li>
            <li>pretty would like this smell...</li>
            <li>I have personally spoken to Aubrey Organics, and they have a strong policy, which they follow, of not using any harmful chemicals in any of their products.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know any woman that wants to do their hair</li>
            <li>so I really haven&#x27;t been using it anymore.  </li>
            <li>It has a light hold with no stickiness or white flakes.</li>
            <li>It is normal hold and even gives my hair some volume.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to order a new bottle though once I&#x27;ve returned this one.</li>
            <li>PS have fine, limp hair.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty long, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for several years and really like it.  </li>
            <li>She is almost three, and wants the \\&quot;big girl\\&quot; hairstyles, but still has that slippery baby hair.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like it because it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li>It might hold a few flyaways in place for the day (if you have your hair pinned or clipped) but it&#x27;s nowhere near strong enough to hold your bangs in a curl or your part in place for even a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>If  I spray a little too much on, it eventually just dries like normal and you cannot tell.</li>
            <li>You do not need to use very much to hold your hair firmly.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I hate to give an organic product a bad review as we have so few alternatives in the beauty department, but this hairspray is worthless. I may as well be spraying water on my hair. Even if I spray a ton of it on, it makes no difference. I feel like I just threw $10 in the trash can.  If anyone knows of a good, natural, preferably organic hairspray that works and is not sticky or crunchy, please let me know. I don&#x27;t need it to hold up to a hurricane, just to maintain my flyaways when my hair is up. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have finally found my hairspray! I have used many organic hairsprays and I was using another Aubrey Organics hairspray that was not doing the trick. This hairspray actually holds my hair (soft hold) and does not weigh it down. I have pretty long, wavy hair. It is more on the thicker side, but not thick. It is definitely not thin and this hairspray works great!</li>
            <li> A perfectly light effective hold, especially good for soft, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and received on time... just cannot get past the smell of this product... smells like bug spray and I don&#x27;t know any woman that wants to do their hair pretty would like this smell... not even sure if the hold stays either... just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spray any more onto my hair!</li>
            <li> I bought these hairspray because I didn&#x27;t want to use my aerosol hairspray when I was pregnant. I utilized this and hoped it would work as well as its chemically counterparts. Unfortunately, its hold leaves a lot to be desired. It might hold a few flyaways in place for the day (if you have your hair pinned or clipped) but it&#x27;s nowhere near strong enough to hold your bangs in a curl or your part in place for even a couple of hours. I hate to say it but if you really have a good hairdo that you want kept in place for a reasonable amount of time, you gotta go with the aerosol brands!</li>
            <li> Love this organic product and it really keeps my hair in place. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this product and it works.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I use in my hair. Excellent conditioning and no build up.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several years and really like it.  It gives my hair a firm hold without the chemical or the smell of aerosols.  The only reason I give it only 4 stars is that the spray nozzle gets clogged.  I either rinse it out with hot water or give it a hard bang with the palm of my hand, which gets the spray moving.</li>
            <li> More like a scrunch spray than a hairspray.  Gives lovely soft waves on my hair, which comb out nicely.  I love the smell; very natural, so much so I cannot wear this in summer or bees buzz around my head.  I also use it to spray my hairbrush and get rid of frizzies for a straighter sleek look.  I have used this for over three years and have only gone through three bottles.  Lasts a long time.  I love the idea it is nontoxic and have no skin or scalp reaction whatsoever. Aubrey is the best!</li>
            <li> I never review anything but I felt compelled here because I love this product and don&#x27;t want Aubrey Organics to stop making it. This is just enough hold to give my hair shape and not be sticky. I love a soft hold and don&#x27;t like it to look or feel like I am using hairspray. This does the trick and it&#x27;s silicone free, which is important to me.</li>
            <li> The pump spray mechanism does not work. I&#x27;ve tried to clean it, in case it was clogged, but it did not help.</li>
            <li> A great product for maintaining wavy hair.  It has a lavender rosemary essence that helps helps in refreshing hair too.  The hold factor is slightly above average and doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling stiff and tangly.</li>
            <li> light/med hold, hair are not crunchy, just tiny bit hardened.  holds the style. no offensive smell</li>
            <li> I love that this product is natural but it does have a very strong smell.  It also made my head tingle a bit so I really haven&#x27;t been using it anymore.  I will give it another chance this winter but I am betting I can find a better product with a little more research on the EWG&#x27;s Guide.</li>
            <li> Great product. I just wish the spray would work properly without having to smash the nozzle to actually spray. So for that reason I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars. I&#x27;d like to order a new bottle though once I&#x27;ve returned this one.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this hairspray, it was like spraying water on my hair.  If there is a stronger hold formula, I might like it, but this one did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I use this for my daughter&#x27;s hair. She is almost three, and wants the \\&quot;big girl\\&quot; hairstyles, but still has that slippery baby hair. The thought of using chemical hairspray on her horrified me (chemicals are inevitable, but I&#x27;m not going to put them on her just for vanity&#x27;s sake), so this was a great compromise. Does it work as well as my chemical-filled stuff? No, but it works well enough to keep her hair in place if she&#x27;s not being too boisterous. It also smells divine (lavender and herbal) - a big plus for me.    I&#x27;ve had a few bottles now, and the pumps aren&#x27;t great on them. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the product that gums up the works, or if the bottles themselves are just poor quality, but it&#x27;s more than a little frustrating.</li>
            <li> After GROWING MY HAIR BACK (yes, you read that correctly - thank you http://robertjamesclinic.com/), I needed some hair spray.  It is essential that all aspects of hair maintenance be organic to not only prevent hair loss but to help promote hair (re)growth.  This spray works well for me as I don&#x27;t have long hair.  It is normal hold and even gives my hair some volume.  So I am happy.  I don&#x27;t think this would work on long hair or people who need a firm to maximum hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to spray up over the hair and let the spray settle for best results.  Not into it towards the roots.</li>
            <li> This is the only organic hairspray out there that actually works.  It has a light hold with no stickiness or white flakes. No nasty chemicals to inhale.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else, I just hope they keep making it!</li>
            <li> unfortunately it didn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair at all.  I tried it a couple times, but nothing.  Boo hoo.  I wanted to like it because it&#x27;s natural.  PS have fine, limp hair.  Looking for volume without distressing my hair with salt sprays etc.</li>
            <li> This is the best Hairspray I have ever used. I know it is Organic and does not contain anything harmful to my hair or scalp.If  I spray a little too much on, it eventually just dries like normal and you cannot tell. It is not sticky and does not make your hair hard and stiff like usual hairspray. You do not need to use very much to hold your hair firmly.I strongly recommend this hairspray to everyone! I have personally spoken to Aubrey Organics, and they have a strong policy, which they follow, of not using any harmful chemicals in any of their products.</li>
