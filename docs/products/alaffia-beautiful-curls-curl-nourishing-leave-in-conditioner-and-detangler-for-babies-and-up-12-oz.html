            <li>and this is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Very impressed &amp; would recommend for babies with curly hair.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful stuff!  </li>
            <li>It smells great, too--like orange creamsicles!</li>
            <li>and then I diffuse my hair and it looks great!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to cut it because its beautiful but to keep it from turning into a frizz ball or &amp;#34;locking up&amp;#34; I searched for a product.</li>
            <li>Does my baby girls hair so beautiful.</li>
            <li>this conditioner is great and lasts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Allafia is all we use in our daughters hair and it has been great.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve been looking for a good conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Given that, it is at best ironic, that phenoxyethanol is used as an anti-bacterial in vaccines.</li>

            <li>this is THE BEST product for naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li>Great product, very light but refreshing smell and a large amount for the price.</li>
            <li>I use a pea-sized amount on their hair—wet or dry—and it makes it much more brushable.</li>
            <li>I really do love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>If many people would complain, they would probably take it out.&lt;br /&gt;See</li>
            <li>The MSDS refers to 100% concentrations, so is it safe at lower doses?</li>
            <li>Phenoxyethanol was in the top 10.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this, but, I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, doesn&#x27;t leave hair gummy, but fuels the curls and even my wiry hair feels soft and behaves.</li>
            <li>It tangles so easily.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are far better than any of the &amp;#34;No more tangles&amp;#34; type products mom used on my own hair when I was a kid</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter who has fine, wavy (used to be curly) hair.  </li>
            <li>her hair is so fine that each morning she wakes up with a tangled mass.  </li>
            <li>My hair is ringlet-curly but fine, and I use this as a conditioner and detangler in the shower, never as a leave-in.</li>
            <li>This stuff, however, washes out easily and leaves my hair frizz free, moisturized, and a breeze to comb through.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken to using it on my own fine, straight hair instead of rinse outs.</li>
            <li>Phenol can disable the immune system&#x27;s primary response mechanism.</li>
            <li>Phenol can disable the immune system&#x27;s primary response mechanism.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic just a quarter size</li>
            <li>My girls&#x27; curls disappeared after age 2 and they now have very fine, straight, easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves his hair still silky smooth, great smell, and makes his curls more defined and less frizzy.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This conditioner has worked great for my toddler aged  daughter&#x27;s curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It really keeps her hair healthy and helps the curls hold instead of friz out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product&#x27;s Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) says that it phenoxyethanol is harmful if swallowed, inhaled or absorbed through the skin and that it can cause reproductive damage.</li>
            <li>After her hair dried it was in these perfect little defined curls/ringlets and looked so adorable.</li>
            <li>But it keeps my hair nice and soft even though I swim nearly every day.</li>
            <li>Using only this conditioner it will hold for most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product better than the regular leave it conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much softer.</li>
            <li>In the beginning, I think I used too much</li>
            <li>I just bought a bottle of this from Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>and I get fly-away hair, too much</li>
            <li>My granddaughter has very curly fine long hair.  </li>
            <li>So far, I am halfway through the bottle and it is working really well!</li>
            <li>The bottle says to apply it to your roots also, but when I did this the top of my hair was greasy and matted down.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine loose curls</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m too quick to review this product since I just received it and have only had a chance to use it once on my daughter&#x27;s hair, but I am already a fan.</li>
            <li>My main concern was finding something that moisturized &amp; nurtured her hair rather than coating it with a greasy product</li>
            <li>I wet my hair each morning in the sink, add some conditioner, run my fingers through and let it air dry - LOVE the product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finally back on Amazon to buy more after using this product (from its old bottle)—in tiny amounts—for over 2 years.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my normally frizzy crazy hair relatively smooth and cute!  </li>
            <li>Rinses odd easily with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, a 1990 article in the Journal of the American College of Toxicology said that it was only a mild irritant to rabbit skin at 2%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>The product appeared to be old and the ingredients was seperated.</li>
            <li>It helps to detangle my hair and makes it soft.  </li>
            <li>We use it mixed with water in a spray bottle as well as straight in her hair.  </li>
            <li>His hair comes out soft and it doesn&#x27;t bother his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult</li>
            <li>I applied about a teaspoon amount to her wet hair right after her bath and just ran it through her hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product after shampooing (with various shampoos) and my hair has honestly never felt better.</li>
            <li>He is only 9 months old with about 4 inches of hair already!</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy to curly hair, but it can get coarse.</li>
            <li>also came across a report written by a medical professional who contracted allergies after coming into contact with phenoxyethanol in a detergent used for cleaning lab equipment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells good and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or artificial.  </li>

            <li> My girls&#x27; curls disappeared after age 2 and they now have very fine, straight, easily tangled hair. I use a pea-sized amount on their hair—wet or dry—and it makes it much more brushable. The ingredients are far better than any of the &amp;#34;No more tangles&amp;#34; type products mom used on my own hair when I was a kid and it works just as well, if not better. I&#x27;ve taken to using it on my own fine, straight hair instead of rinse outs. Keeps my routine simple. I really do love this stuff. I&#x27;m finally back on Amazon to buy more after using this product (from its old bottle)—in tiny amounts—for over 2 years.</li>
            <li> I found this product by accident. I have naturally wavy to curly hair, but it can get coarse. I&#x27;ve been using this product after shampooing (with various shampoos) and my hair has honestly never felt better. It&#x27;s so much softer. You have to be careful with the amount used....just experiment a little. In the beginning, I think I used too much and it weighed my hair down.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m too quick to review this product since I just received it and have only had a chance to use it once on my daughter&#x27;s hair, but I am already a fan. She has tons of curly hair and it&#x27;s a few inches long now at only 9 months so I&#x27;ve been looking for a good conditioner. This one was recommended by someone whose daughter had very similar hair so I gave it a shot and I&#x27;m so glad I did. My main concern was finding something that moisturized &amp; nurtured her hair rather than coating it with a greasy product and this is wonderful. I applied about a teaspoon amount to her wet hair right after her bath and just ran it through her hair. After her hair dried it was in these perfect little defined curls/ringlets and looked so adorable. I could not feel a greasy residue either. I was worried her hair would lose the definition by morning but her curls were still in place (minus the back of her head, so I sprayed some water and re-fluffed). Great product, very light but refreshing smell and a large amount for the price. Very impressed &amp; would recommend for babies with curly hair.</li>
            <li> Something in the ingredients caused my son to have a reaction (skin was red and swelled) The product appeared to be old and the ingredients was seperated.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful stuff!  I put it on every day (even on days I don&#x27;t shampoo) and it keeps my normally frizzy crazy hair relatively smooth and cute!  It smells great, too--like orange creamsicles!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter has very curly fine long hair.  It tangles so easily.  This is the only product her mother has found to keep the tangles at a minimum.  My daughter used to purchase at a health food store, but when they moved, she couldn&#x27;t find a local store that carried it.  I was so excited to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really like this product better than the regular leave it conditioner.  It helps to detangle my hair and makes it soft.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter has loose curly hair, and when it&#x27;s dry it looks like a horrible tumble weed. At the end of her bath, I can add this detangler, and instantly finger comb her hair, and I don&#x27;t have to hear &amp;#34;owww mommy!&amp;#34; Had to recommend this stuff to my sister in law so that she would have the same luck with my nephew. He and my daughter have the same type of hair. LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I just bought a bottle of this from Whole Foods. I noticed that the Alaffia people have added phenoxyethanol to this product. It did not&lt;br /&gt;used to be in curl reviving tonic. I am surprised and disappointed that they put it in. It is known to be toxic. I wrote the company and told&lt;br /&gt;them my feelings about this. If many people would complain, they would probably take it out.&lt;br /&gt;See the following for a commentary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phenoxyethanol is a glycol ether. Glycols are a series of chemicals that find their way into all sorts of things: paint, lacquer, jet fuel..... Phenoxyethanol is used as an anti-bacterial in cosmetics as well as a stabilizer in perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product&#x27;s Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) says that it phenoxyethanol is harmful if swallowed, inhaled or absorbed through the skin and that it can cause reproductive damage. The MSDS refers to 100% concentrations, so is it safe at lower doses? In cosmetics the concentrations are typically 0.5% to 1%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several animal studies that demonstrate that it is toxic - with effects on the brain and the nervous system - at moderate concentrations. In Japan, there is a concentration limit for its use in cosmetics. In Europe, the European Union classifies it as an irritant and there are various studies (on rabbit skin, for example) that demonstrate reactions at low doses. The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) data sheets show chromosomal changes and genetic mutation effects in testing as well as testicular atrophy and interference with reproductivity in mice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also came across a report written by a medical professional who contracted allergies after coming into contact with phenoxyethanol in a detergent used for cleaning lab equipment. It seems he wasn&#x27;t a fluke. There are over 3,000 known allergans and they were studied, along with the data from 9,948 patients, by a research team in Germany. Phenoxyethanol was in the top 10. An Italian study also determined that phenoxyethanol is a contact allergan. However, a 1990 article in the Journal of the American College of Toxicology said that it was only a mild irritant to rabbit skin at 2%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concern that phenoxyethanol is a neurotoxin precedes the FDA.

            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has fine, wavy (used to be curly) hair.  she&#x27;s only two.  her hair is so fine that each morning she wakes up with a tangled mass.  this conditioner is great and lasts.</li>
            <li> Neem is actually not safe for children per webmd.  Don&#x27;t know if the amount used in this conditioner in not harmful.  Too bad it&#x27;s in the ingredients list.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has worked great for my toddler aged  daughter&#x27;s curly hair.  We use it mixed with water in a spray bottle as well as straight in her hair.  It really keeps her hair healthy and helps the curls hold instead of friz out. Using only this conditioner it will hold for most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells good and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or artificial.  Rinses odd easily with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allafia is all we use in our daughters hair and it has been great.</li>
            <li> this is THE BEST product for naturally curly hair! I wet my hair each morning in the sink, add some conditioner, run my fingers through and let it air dry - LOVE the product!</li>
            <li> My son is half black, half white with very thick long curls. He is only 9 months old with about 4 inches of hair already! I don&#x27;t want to cut it because its beautiful but to keep it from turning into a frizz ball or &amp;#34;locking up&amp;#34; I searched for a product. I came across this and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. It leaves his hair still silky smooth, great smell, and makes his curls more defined and less frizzy. It last for several days too. I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, doesn&#x27;t leave hair gummy, but fuels the curls and even my wiry hair feels soft and behaves.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, but, I don&#x27;t. It doesn&#x27;t help detangle my kids&#x27; hair at all. In fact, it seems to exacerbate the tangles in my daughters spiral-curly hair.</li>
            <li> My son has dry, curly hair and this product worked wonders! His hair comes out soft and it doesn&#x27;t bother his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> love this product! Does my baby girls hair so beautiful.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! My hair is ringlet-curly but fine, and I use this as a conditioner and detangler in the shower, never as a leave-in. And I use a lot of it, it has to be said--it&#x27;s not cheap. But it keeps my hair nice and soft even though I swim nearly every day. I also use the matching shampoo, and scrunch in Kiss My Face hair gel, nothing else ever, but I regularly get stopped by strangers who ask what I use in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine loose curls and it&#x27;s really hard to find a balance with this product. Too little and I get fly-away hair, too much and it looks and feels limp and dirty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult but I use this on my wavy hair as a wash out conditioner. So far, I am halfway through the bottle and it is working really well! I had trouble with Alaffia&#x27;s other conditioners being too heavy for my hair. I didn&#x27;t feel like they ever fully washed out. This stuff, however, washes out easily and leaves my hair frizz free, moisturized, and a breeze to comb through. The bottle says to apply it to your roots also, but when I did this the top of my hair was greasy and matted down. Therefore, I just stick to using it on the bottom half of my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this for myself! It is fantastic just a quarter size and then I diffuse my hair and it looks great!</li>
