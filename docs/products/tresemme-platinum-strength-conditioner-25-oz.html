            <li>I have been using this for weeks now and my hair is incredible.</li>
            <li>That sort of put me off as it&#x27;s rather an incredible promise to make.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s THAT good!</li>
            <li>On a whim, I picked this up and as unreal as it sounds it was beautiful and silky after one use.</li>

            <li>Good Product, smells great, rinses well.</li>
            <li>Works for a good price</li>
            <li>so I know what a good hair conditioner should do.</li>
            <li>Fair warning.</li>
            <li>The scent is also very appealing.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never felt or looked better!</li>
            <li>It did feel great on my hair, had nice shine, and was easy to comb through</li>
            <li>The conditioner is amazing.</li>
            <li>MUCH BETTER</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this in the mail and fell in love.</li>
            <li>Would be better if it was a 2 in 1 product though.</li>
            <li>I noticed my hair is softer and my curls are more defined.  </li>
            <li>Granted it costs more</li>
            <li>It may not impress others, but it sure did impress me.</li>
            <li>What I like most about this is the price.</li>
            <li>I Love tresemme products.</li>
            <li>Many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so glad that I got the conditioner as a mistake.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not in love with this product.  </li>
            <li>Within one use, my hair already started feeling more hydrated and softer.</li>
            <li>Really nice, leaves your hair clean and soft n smooth and the fragrance its wonderful</li>
            <li>I tried the tresemme flawless curls but it didn&#x27;t impress me, however the platinum strength does what I expected that to do and more.  </li>
            <li>This is easy on the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This conditioner goes on easy and without a greasy feel to it.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner keeps it strong, frizz-free and tangle-free.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell as good as herbal Essences but leaves my hair feeling far more silky</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best shampoo and conditioner combo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>because I can get it for a great price on Amazon and sometimes at my local VONS store on sale.  </li>
            <li>I am totally in love and find it so worth it.  </li>
            <li>Over the years, I&#x27;ve used Tresemme&#x27;s Anti-Breakage and smooth and silky conditioners.</li>
            <li>The front of the bottle does not indicate whether it is fragrance free or not, but the ingredients does list that there is a \\&quot;parfum\\&quot;  in the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>however i would reccomend the keratin smooth range by tresemme which gives the results without the sticky residue</li>
            <li>I try lots of different shampoos and conditioners, in the hope of finding the one that will give me television-commercial perfect, shining, glossy hair that moves as if I have a gentle breeze.</li>
            <li>I hoped this would restore the original condition of my hair, which it has made it smooth, sleek and shiny.</li>
            <li>Okay, first off:  repairs 2 years of damage with 5 uses?  </li>
            <li>It adds just the right amount of volume, and both the shampoo and conditioner make it easy to comb out my hair in the shower.</li>
            <li>Went through a bottle of this before and it works amazing and makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t even seem to moisturize any better than the Moisture Rich conditioner that TRESemmé already offers</li>
            <li>I have very long blonde hair, which looks like crumpled straw when it&#x27;s not in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>The absolute strongest and best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used,  a repairer of sun, color damaged hair, that feels soft and luxurious after it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I would pay salon prices for this in tiny bottles.</li>
            <li>I am excited to try out the whole platinum strength family.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very reasonable and you will even get 5% off if you subscribe for Amazon.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>And this Treseme Conditioner does the job pretty well.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to pursue.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Washing it off is quite quick and easy (for Pantene Conditioner, it usually takes me a while to wash it off), so this is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>Good shampoo, priced a little high</li>
            <li>I love the product and can&#x27;t rate it high enough.</li>
            <li>I expected better results from Tresemme, as I usually had good experiences with their shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine curly Irish hair, just so you know.</li>
            <li>I really thought it had lots of split ends and</li>
            <li>My split ends are gone (without a haircut!), and the rest of my hair is glossy, bouncy and looks almost as if I have a gentle breeze moving my hair as I walk.</li>
            <li>However, after a shower where she washed her back and did not use the conditioner, the bumps vanished (fortunately).</li>
            <li>Whatever it is, it is very slight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had previously is much tamer.</li>
            <li>Liked it very much as I always try to put more volume to my hair and this one works miracles, my hair is still fluffy and not heavy as after other conditioners I used.</li>
            <li>My hair is much stronger, shinier, softer with less frizz and tangles for a MUCH BETTER VALUE.</li>
            <li>The scent is decent.</li>
            <li>Decent size bottle for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a pretty strong conditioner for everyday use on tough-to-manage and beaten-up hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Smooth and as expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Setting that aside, this is my go to conditioner (and I use the shampoo too normally)</li>
            <li>I have a lot of medium-fine, long, dead-straight hair, and I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds of shampoos and conditioner over the years.</li>
            <li>PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, fine, natural curly hair that is now bouncy and not heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li>or I tend to need a new brush.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a very soft scent and not objectionable.  </li>
            <li>Because long hair lies on your neck and back while soaking in the conditioner for 3 minutes, the exposed skin developed a ton of bumps which originally looked like pimples.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft after.</li>
            <li>Slight fragrance, nothing special.  </li>
            <li>Overall, decent product.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended I switch to Tresemme Platinum Strength Conditioner as I was complaining about my current shampoo/condition routine leaving my hair feeling more brittle than usual.</li>
            <li>Low Quantity for high price( as compared to Sam&#x27;s Club)</li>
            <li>It was an average conditioner, but I don&#x27;t feel it is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>She wanted to see if the conditioner was the culprit, so she used a clip to hold her hair off her back and neck while it absorbed the conditioner, and then gave her back an extra washing after the conditioner residue was rinsed away.</li>
            <li>She tried the conditioner a second time the normal way: A forest of bumps.  </li>
            <li>Received this really quickly, and I have really liked using it everyday for the past few weeks.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make my hair as soft as when I used Loreal total repair 5 conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I felt like I needed glasses in the shower to tell them apart (and wasted product several times for not seeing the right one).  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper at Wal-Mart or other grocery store, but you pay for convenience!</li>
            <li>Ok so let me start off with the fact that I have curly, dry, thick, long hair.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner has provided better results on average for manageability with two weeks of use than the other Tresemme products that she was previously using.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure of the actual claims of repair and strengthening being true but I can attest to the fact that this conditioner helps smooth and tame my daughter&#x27;s wild, curly and thick mane.  </li>
            <li>After washing my hair normally, I worked this conditioner through my hair, covered with a shower cap and left it on until the end of my shower as I do with any other conditioner.</li>

            <li> Both of those were fantastic, but this one was not remotely as good as those two, which was odd considering that this was more expensive.</li>
            <li> I have hair long enough to sit on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black with natural hair.</li>

            <li> By long</li>
            <li> Leave it in for a few minutes, comb it through your hair, and it will completely de-tangle and soften your hair.    </li>
            <li> Within a week of use, I could brush my hair dry.  </li>
            <li> and I like it even though it makes my hair a bit dry.</li>
            <li> Lap swimming turns my hair into dry sticks of straw.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tresemme for about a week or two now and my hair is unbelievable soft and</li>
            <li> I like that the bottle is white for conditioner and black for shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I mean it about touches the back of my upper thighs long.  </li>
            <li> (I keep a wide tooth comb in my shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had to brush my hair wet</li>
            <li> my hair dried, there was an obvious residue on the underside which would coat my fingers if I ran them through my hair.</li>
            <li> I use Tresemme products regularly but this one both dried out my ends and made my crown area feel like I poured a melted candle over my head.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff with high hopes and was seriously let down.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, wavy hair and this conditioner made my hair dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s an urban legend or not,</li>
            <li> Also feel like hair is hard to get wet the next time you try to shampoo.</li>
            <li> i recently purchased this conditioner for my damaged split-endy hair which is thick and coarse due to excessive straightening which i was generally everyday.</li>
            <li> Um, not possible really, at least for my colored hair.  </li>
            <li> Oddly, my sister and I both had this issue and one day realized we were both using this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend if you have dry thick hair that is unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> I went through a stage where I bleached my hair everyday for 6 days trying to have hair like Daenerys...</li>
            <li> It is a bit difficult to find this product at our local supermarket compared to the other lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use very little styling product.</li>
            <li> The only think I dislike about Tresemme products is that I recently found out that they are owned by Unilever and they test on animals :(</li>
            <li> However it has left this residue on my hair which makes my hair feel \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; and difficult to style despite trying to washing it out.</li>

            <li> It smells alright, but not great.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, my hair was destroyed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Its very good... But the bottle is not tightly packed and little conditioner got squeezed out when I took out of the pack...</li>
            <li> My hair is much stronger, shinier, softer with less frizz and tangles for a MUCH BETTER VALUE. MUCH BETTER PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, fine, natural curly hair that is now bouncy and not heavy or greasy.  I use very little styling product. Honestly, I would pay salon prices for this in tiny bottles. It&#x27;s THAT good!</li>
            <li> I went through a stage where I bleached my hair everyday for 6 days trying to have hair like Daenerys... Needless to say, my hair was destroyed. It felt itchy against my skin. I purchased a $30 conditioner with the matching leave in and shampoo with zero results. On a whim, I picked this up and as unreal as it sounds it was beautiful and silky after one use. I didn&#x27;t shampoo or condition for three days after to see if it was just a gloss over the hair but it stayed in the same state. I have been using this for weeks now and my hair is incredible. I am excited to try out the whole platinum strength family. And unfortunately, my hair is not like Daenerys. ;)</li>
            <li> Low Quantity for high price( as compared to Sam&#x27;s Club)</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in the mail and fell in love. My hair has never felt or looked better!</li>
            <li> The absolute strongest and best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used,  a repairer of sun, color damaged hair, that feels soft and luxurious after it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> I expected better results from Tresemme, as I usually had good experiences with their shampoos.  It was an average conditioner, but I don&#x27;t feel it is worth the money.  It didn&#x27;t make my hair as soft as when I used Loreal total repair 5 conditioner.  It smells alright, but not great.  Would be better if it was a 2 in 1 product though.</li>
            <li> I am not sure of the actual claims of repair and strengthening being true but I can attest to the fact that this conditioner helps smooth and tame my daughter&#x27;s wild, curly and thick mane.  This conditioner has provided better results on average for manageability with two weeks of use than the other Tresemme products that she was previously using.  It is a bit difficult to find this product at our local supermarket compared to the other lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend if you have dry thick hair that is unmanageable.  You will see a different with this creme conditioner.  The scent is also very appealing.  It has made it a bit easier on both of us when it comes to styling; which is a plus when that happens.</li>
            <li> Okay, first off:  repairs 2 years of damage with 5 uses?  Um, not possible really, at least for my colored hair.  That sort of put me off as it&#x27;s rather an incredible promise to make.  It took off a star just for being preposterous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Setting that aside, this is my go to conditioner (and I use the shampoo too normally) because I can get it for a great price on Amazon and sometimes at my local VONS store on sale.  It just depends on when I run out.  It did feel great on my hair, had nice shine, and was easy to comb through (I keep a wide tooth comb in my shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite feature is sort of silly: I like that the bottle is white for conditioner and black for shampoo.  My eyesight is not what it used to be and the last product I tried had both shampoo and conditioner in matching bottles.  I felt like I needed glasses in the shower to tell them apart (and wasted product several times for not seeing the right one).  This is easy on the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago Oprah had an episode that claimed Tresemme helped regrow hair.  Not sure if that&#x27;s an urban legend or not, but it can&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> Works for a good price</li>
            <li> Ok so let me start off with the fact that I have curly, dry, thick, long hair.  By long I mean it about touches the back of my upper thighs long.  I&#x27;ve always had to brush my hair wet or I tend to need a new brush.  Within a week of use, I could brush my hair dry.  I noticed my hair is softer and my curls are more defined.  I tried the tresemme flawless curls but it didn&#x27;t impress me, however the platinum strength does what I expected that to do and more.  Granted it costs more and I use about a bottle a week, ( I said I have alot of hair lol) I am totally in love and find it so worth it.  Only problem is I did notice a lot of dandruff but I think I took care of that too.  It may not impress others, but it sure did impress me.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve used Tresemme&#x27;s Anti-Breakage and smooth and silky conditioners. Both of those were fantastic, but this one was not remotely as good as those two, which was odd considering that this was more expensive. I would recommend trying a different conditioner from Tresemme. This one is just sitting in my closet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that it had a rather drying effect on my hair. I&#x27;m black with natural hair.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo, priced a little high</li>
            <li> Received this really quickly, and I have really liked using it everyday for the past few weeks.  It&#x27;s a very smooth shampoo, and it smells great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Head and Shoulder Shampoo for years and I like it even though it makes my hair a bit dry. I also used hair conditioner sometimes so I know what a good hair conditioner should do. And this Treseme Conditioner does the job pretty well. It makes my hair soft and smooth. Washing it off is quite quick and easy (for Pantene Conditioner, it usually takes me a while to wash it off), so this is a huge plus for me. The scent is decent. What I like most about this is the price. It&#x27;s very reasonable and you will even get 5% off if you subscribe for Amazon. Overall, decent product. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Decent size bottle for the price. This shampoo Smells great. I Love tresemme products. Works great on my curly hair.</li>
            <li> In a word, NASTY! I bought this stuff with high hopes and was seriously let down. After washing my hair normally, I worked this conditioner through my hair, covered with a shower cap and left it on until the end of my shower as I do with any other conditioner. When I got around to rinsing this crap out, it left the most disgusting coating on the entire underside of my hair - like I had greased it with Vaseline or something! I even tried soaping it out and didn&#x27;t even get it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my hair dried, there was an obvious residue on the underside which would coat my fingers if I ran them through my hair. Nasty, nasty, NASTY! Won&#x27;t be buying this again. It didn&#x27;t even seem to moisturize any better than the Moisture Rich conditioner that TRESemmé already offers so I&#x27;d pass on this stuff if I were you. Fair warning.</li>
            <li> I have hair long enough to sit on.  This conditioner keeps it strong, frizz-free and tangle-free.  The scent isn&#x27;t the greatest but it&#x27;s a very soft scent and not objectionable.  I&#x27;m always getting compliments on my hair and this conditioner is one of the reasons why!  I tell everyone about it.</li>
            <li> It does the job. Doesn&#x27;t smell as good as herbal Essences but leaves my hair feeling far more silky</li>
            <li> Went through a bottle of this before and it works amazing and makes my hair so soft. Plus, this one just came with a coupon, so I got this entire bottle for $1.79!!!! Couldn&#x27;t resist that.</li>
            <li> excellent seller, item as described</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft after. I am african american with 4a and 3c hair.</li>
            <li> I use Tresemme products regularly but this one both dried out my ends and made my crown area feel like I poured a melted candle over my head. I assume there&#x27;s a lot of silicone in this product to coat hair strands for the appearance of reducing splits. Oddly, my sister and I both had this issue and one day realized we were both using this product.</li>
            <li> I have very long blonde hair, which looks like crumpled straw when it&#x27;s not in perfect condition. I really thought it had lots of split ends and that the only cure for that is to cut off the split ends. Then I got this conditioner. I try lots of different shampoos and conditioners, in the hope of finding the one that will give me television-commercial perfect, shining, glossy hair that moves as if I have a gentle breeze. (Yeah, I know I&#x27;m dreaming. But it&#x27;s a dream I&#x27;m willing to pursue.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the shampoo that goes with this conditioner, and I was sent conditioner by mistake. The conditioner is amazing. It has my hair as close to television perfect as anything I&#x27;ve ever tried. My split ends are gone (without a haircut!), and the rest of my hair is glossy, bouncy and looks almost as if I have a gentle breeze moving my hair as I walk. It&#x27;s the prettiest that my hair has been in years. Many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad that I got the conditioner as a mistake. It&#x27;s a mistake that has my hair nicer than it has been in forever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: One of the members of my family can no loner use this conditioner. Because long hair lies on your neck and back while soaking in the conditioner for 3 minutes, the exposed skin developed a ton of bumps which originally looked like pimples. However, after a shower where she washed her back and did not use the conditioner, the bumps vanished (fortunately). She wanted to see if the conditioner was the culprit, so she used a clip to hold her hair off her back and neck while it absorbed the conditioner, and then gave her back an extra washing after the conditioner residue was rinsed away. No bumps. She tried the conditioner a second time the normal way: A forest of bumps.  So, although she loves the effect this conditioner has on her hair, she can no longer use it.</li>
            <li> Good Product, smells great, rinses well. My wife says she is a fan and likes having this on S&amp;S. Word.</li>
            <li> Incredible conditioner! Leave it in for a few minutes, comb it through your hair, and it will completely de-tangle and soften your hair.    The only think I dislike about Tresemme products is that I recently found out that they are owned by Unilever and they test on animals :(</li>
            <li> Liked it very much as I always try to put more volume to my hair and this one works miracles, my hair is still fluffy and not heavy as after other conditioners I used.</li>
            <li> Lap swimming turns my hair into dry sticks of straw.  This conditioner makes my hair human again by smoothing it out and making it light-to-the touch and manageable.  This conditioner goes on easy and without a greasy feel to it.  The front of the bottle does not indicate whether it is fragrance free or not, but the ingredients does list that there is a \\&quot;parfum\\&quot;  in the conditioner.  Whatever it is, it is very slight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a pretty strong conditioner for everyday use on tough-to-manage and beaten-up hair.</li>
            <li> this works like the Wen product. Work it into your hair using your fingers as a comb in the shower. I use it every time I wash my hair. I have a lot of fine curly Irish hair, just so you know.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not in love with this product.  Yes, it conditions my hair but that&#x27;s about it.  Slight fragrance, nothing special.  The shampoo, about the same.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of medium-fine, long, dead-straight hair, and I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds of shampoos and conditioner over the years. This is hands down the best shampoo and conditioner combo I&#x27;ve ever used. It adds just the right amount of volume, and both the shampoo and conditioner make it easy to comb out my hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended I switch to Tresemme Platinum Strength Conditioner as I was complaining about my current shampoo/condition routine leaving my hair feeling more brittle than usual. Within one use, my hair already started feeling more hydrated and softer. I&#x27;ve been using Tresemme for about a week or two now and my hair is unbelievable soft and the frizz I had previously is much tamer. I love the product and can&#x27;t rate it high enough.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper at Wal-Mart or other grocery store, but you pay for convenience! Smooth and as expected.</li>
            <li> Really nice, leaves your hair clean and soft n smooth and the fragrance its wonderful</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, wavy hair and this conditioner made my hair dry and frizzy. I also got dandruff after using this conditioner. Also feel like hair is hard to get wet the next time you try to shampoo. This conditioner is not moisturizing.</li>
            <li> i recently purchased this conditioner for my damaged split-endy hair which is thick and coarse due to excessive straightening which i was generally everyday. I hoped this would restore the original condition of my hair, which it has made it smooth, sleek and shiny. However it has left this residue on my hair which makes my hair feel \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; and difficult to style despite trying to washing it out. with  the texture and look which sometimes appears greasy instead of shiny, i doubt i will be buying this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also if you touch the hair where the hair is \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; the hair ends up separating as if you hadn&#x27;t washed it in a while. however i would reccomend the keratin smooth range by tresemme which gives the results without the sticky residue</li>
