            <li> This product works well with my thinly textured hair.  I like the look that it gives to my hair and it conditions it.  Since I use such a small amount, it lasts a long time and I think it is a good value from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is now all the rage, but before all the \\&quot;new\\&quot; products there was Moroccan Oil.  This is a very reliable product that protects and inproves your hair.  It is easily absorbed without leaving that oily feel and look some products leave. If you have fine or thin hair I reccomend the light version.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used Moroccanoil Light for quite a while.  Ordering from Amazon frees me from trying to get to the salon before it closes.  Morroccanoil Light prevents frizz and adds shine.  It makes styling easier.  Nice product.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my hair, isn&#x27;t greasy or oily. I have fine curly blonde hair and this works perfectly to reduce dryness and frizz,</li>

            <li> Been using product for some time and Will order again when run out.&lt;br /&gt;All Moroccan oil products are good.&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo and conditioner especially</li>
            <li> co-worker got me this fo Christmas ever since that Christmas I purchase this for myself it does wonders fo your hair. It is worth that money you pay it lasts a long time and the results you get are remarkable</li>
            <li> This product is one that is worth it&#x27;s weight. It gives ultimate shine as well as moisturization to my dry hair.</li>
            <li> Ships quickly and&lt;br /&gt;Using this product was becoming good&lt;br /&gt;Discount price but more would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;Also want to buy in the following</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! I will never use anything else again! Worth every penny! Moroccan oil is the best brand out there.</li>
            <li> I have thin curly hair that gets knotty and frizzy and gross when I put nothing in it. I found this product when I was going on a back-packing trip through SE Asia and was going to be without hot showers and mirrors at times and didn&#x27;t know what to do b/c I didn&#x27;t want to have to trek a bunch of product with me for the whole time. I asked a salesperson at a beauty store what to do and she suggested the moroccan oil. I thought it was awesome because you can carry a little bit and it will last a really long time. I was just hoping it worked but I decided to take the risk! It is awesome!!! You need the littlest bit and it just tames the frizz and keeps your hair shiny and manageable. A mini bottle lasted me over a month and it definitely made my hair much easier to deal with on my trip! Since then, I haven&#x27;t gone without it. It is great to use by itself when I don&#x27;t want to do anything to my hair or when I want to straighten it and it is also great before adding a curling product when I go curly. Also, I absolutely love the smell. I have tried both the light and the regular. I think the light is better for thin hair.</li>
