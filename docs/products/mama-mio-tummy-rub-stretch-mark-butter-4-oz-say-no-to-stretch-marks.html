            <li>From what I heard from reviews on YouTube the scent is supposed to be really good, but when I took a whiff of this cream/butter it did not please me at all.</li>
            <li>My husband thinks it smells good</li>
            <li>Everyone told me I was probably going to get stretch marks as my mother did, but I was convinced if I found a good cream</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s a nice indulgence and it hydrates well with great ingredients.</li>
            <li>Good Luck &amp; do nt be foooooool.</li>

            <li>Otherwise, this is good stuff</li>
            <li>Okay .... I know this product has a good rating and it seems to be working for some pp but not for me!  </li>
            <li>For best results, make sure to drink lots and lots of water and have healthy weight gain as well.</li>

            <li>It smells great and leaves my skin so smooth!</li>

            <li>Outstanding !!!!!  This product was exactly what I needed to fight off that itchy pregnancy skin on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>Love this mama mio tummy rub ...!</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, BUT plastic surgery or laser is so much more!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love the stuff!  </li>
            <li>Using this product combined with the Mama Mio Tummy Rub Stretch Mark Oil is much better!</li>
            <li>and so now I need more!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I used Mama Mio for my first pregnancy and it was excellent.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>This butter is by far the BEST I have found - smells great, no nasties, doesn&#x27;t get on clothes and it is super moisturizing so bye-bye itching!!  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing</li>
            <li>It feels light and smells great.</li>
            <li>and I am happy it is still available.</li>
            <li>This tummy butter is amazing.</li>
            <li>(btw, it smells amazing and eliminates itchiness!).&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>I use the oil in the morning to get a nice glow on my skin</li>
            <li>If you prefer the texture of the cream, it will work great for you, but just plan on spending more to get more.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not so itchy, this is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>Kind</li>
            <li>I used this SC nice week 22 of pregnancy and no stretch marks or itching.</li>
            <li>This is pricy but effective.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it smells really nice.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and calming, I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of some of the cocoa butter products out there.  </li>
            <li>Nice feeling.</li>
            <li>, that is how nice the smelll is.</li>
            <li>sure if it was the lotion or just good luck</li>
            <li>- but I have seen plenty of people not use lotion of any kind</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice cream to apply</li>
            <li>and my wife really liked it.</li>
            <li>Very rich, excellent scent, worth it</li>
            <li>Excellent product - I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>On a good note.... it does smell very good and leaves your skin so soft and mosturized!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to any pregnant mommas and it would also be a great gift for an expectant mother.</li>
            <li>It smells great and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It leaves you skin smooth all day, and have a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>My cousin used it while pregnant and had great results.  </li>
            <li>There also is a very strong smell of citrus.</li>
            <li>With a baby on the way there are many more uses for it!</li>
            <li>I first tried the Mama Mio Tummy Rub Stretch Mark Oil and loved it!  </li>
            <li>a really nice consistency to the touch, and a mild, pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The perfume is very mild and pleasant. :)</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft all day and has a delicious scent.</li>
            <li>Liked this much better and used it all.</li>
            <li>smooth and nice skin when I wake up! :)</li>
            <li>So if you are looking for the purest formulas, you will find our Tummy Rub Oil to have less ingredients than our Tummy Rub Butter although both are equally wonderful at taking great care of your skin throughout your pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>My skin is clean and gorgeous and not crepey at all.</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good and its nice to know it has nothing in it that can hurt the baby.  </li>
            <li>The cream rubs in quickly and smells good.  </li>
            <li>I loved this stuff when I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my pregnant sister and she absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li>Mild smell and good texture</li>
            <li>I love how it feels on  my skin, it absorbs right away and feels amazing!</li>
            <li>huge cons:&lt;br /&gt;IT DOESN&amp;#34;T ABSORB!</li>
            <li>I bought this product as a sample at a maternity store and felt in love.</li>
            <li>So i bought more;  </li>
            <li>so I obviously really love the product.</li>
            <li>I ordered this after reading many reviews.  </li>
            <li>I hope I can get use to the smell because I do love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I use Boob Tube and I LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I also like the way the oil feels on my skin much better.  </li>
            <li>When I need to buy more Mama Mio, I&#x27;m going to buy the oil instead of the tummy butter.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>you get the more you use</li>
            <li>&amp; I have to say I like it better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I cannot say for sure that Mama Mio was the trick to all this, but I&#x27;m sure it played a role.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think I valued that more than the lotion itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the feel but the smell makes me nauseous.</li>
            <li>The interesting thing is I dont have any marks on my stomach - just thighs, butt, and boobs</li>
            <li>That being said, keeping your skin moisturized DOES help your skin feel better while it is stretching and growing.</li>
            <li>I have used it a bit afterward and they have mostly faded (I&#x27;m 4 mos postpartum).</li>
            <li>so i need one more jar.</li>
            <li>I love this butter.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure this stuff is helping a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit</li>
            <li>works great and is at a reasonable price unlike Mama Mio tummy</li>
            <li>If you want a pregnancy safe, grest-smelling, moisturizer, then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves the skin feeling absolutely buttery.  </li>
            <li>I just absolutely love this cream.</li>
            <li>I use the cream now as I am still losing baby weight, and I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>I just recently started using the oil with this product in my 7th month and am very happy with both!</li>
            <li>and I enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>Smells great and absorbs really well.  </li>
            <li>I love the results, feel, and smell of this lotion.</li>
            <li>This product is pricey and felt that vaseline was a better contender.</li>
            <li>Smells great and loved it, but for what it cost I probably won&#x27;t get during next pregnancy.</li>
            <li>Love the way it smells</li>
            <li>and I fell in love.</li>
            <li>For me, I can&#x27;t understand why anything of this purpose has to have this many chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent, love the feel, and love the results.  </li>
            <li>Love to apply before bedtime.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>would love for it to come in a jar like container rather then</li>
            <li>This smell is light and nice.</li>
            <li>I would recommend for sure, it&#x27;s a treat.</li>
            <li>Competitive price and fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I am also a bit of a skeptic :)</li>
            <li>Given the whopping price tag, you&#x27;re better off just using shea butter.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this this product,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Buy it :)</li>
            <li>For me this worked fabulously!</li>
            <li>and I still have more.  </li>
            <li>love this stuff</li>
            <li>and I am 100% satisfied</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I love using it.</li>
            <li>I love it for me.</li>
            <li>GET IT!! :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell of this cream is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tolerable, and not nasty, I just think it could be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I heard such wonderful things on this tummy butter</li>
            <li>I think it does an OK job, but it doesn&#x27;t penetrate to help the skin get rid of the post pregnancy marks.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing and well worth the money!</li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the baby yet, but so far so good!</li>
            <li>This cream is nice but nothing special.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly, has a pleasant clean scent.  </li>
            <li>Now I have a beautiful 4 week old son and no stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Spend the money and get the best, it goes a long way if you use it sparingly.</li>
            <li>I had to buy three containers during my pregnancy, well worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>SO worth the money!!</li>
            <li>Too soon to tell for sure, but great product so far.</li>
            <li>This cream also smells nice, but for $35 I can buy some super yummy stuff at Bath and Body Works.</li>
            <li>highly, highly recommend this stuff - and it smells really nice!</li>
            <li>My 62 year old husband tells me how great I look all the time.</li>
            <li>, this product has made my pregnancy more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I use this with the oil &amp; so far, the results are great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a shot, it&#x27;s nicely packaged</li>
            <li>I started with the Mama Mio oil and loved it so much I had to try the belly butter.  </li>
            <li>Then I would use a good amount of cream and really massage in circular motion for 10 min.  </li>
            <li>I gained 1Lb per week during my pregnancy, and my doctor said I am a fine and healthy pregnant women and no creams will help a women if you have the gene and hormone to produce the damn stretch mark!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of different products to combat skin drying and stretching on my pregnant belly, and this is one of the best.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week (am 6 months pregnant, no marks yet), so I can&#x27;t comment on its long-term effectiveness, but it has a wonderful smell and absorbs well into the skin.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice and is easy to be absorbed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more than worth the price tag, and I tend to be on the thrifty side!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks yet, but the true test of time will be at the end of 40 weeks!  </li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about it, it works!</li>
            <li>I love how rich it is.</li>
            <li>I know that doesn&#x27;t sound great, but this stuff has kept her skin incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>I have marks from my adolescent years, so I know I can easily develop them.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it particularly easy to apply, and I didn&#x27;t care for the scent.  </li>
            <li>I still have a couple more months to go, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>I do not like the smell as it is way too strong for me.</li>
            <li>The last one is found in Ylang Ylang oil, which is included in our beautiful Gravida (which means Pregnancy in latin) fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I am not crazy about the smell (slightly strong), but it worked so well!</li>
            <li>I did not develop any stretch marks, however, I still experienced a good deal of itchiness, particularly in the 3rd trimester.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was fine till my 28th weeks of pregnancy</li>
            <li>My wife brought this home and once I looked at the fine print</li>
            <li>Seemed to work just fine.</li>
            <li>and I lived up to they hype from pregnant Kim!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently pregnant w/ twins and rub this in every night and most mornings.</li>
            <li>She went through 3 or 4 of these while pregnant and whenever #2 is on the way we will surely be reordering this item.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 24 weeks pregnant, and have gone through 1.5 tubes of this stuff - not a stretch mark in sight!</li>
            <li>Such a nice smell, and lovely product!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe that any non-invasive product can protect from a genetic predisposition and that&#x27;s certainly why none of these treatments and creams offer any kind of guarantees against the dreaded marks.</li>
            <li>Of course we will never know how much this products really contributed... but it is of great quality and also helped with itching a lot.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s so great that I just bought my 2nd jar.</li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s so great, why only four stars?\\&quot; you ask?</li>
            <li>like I said it was fantastic on my itchy skin...</li>
            <li>and it smells fabulous.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t buy into the sales pitch that you will escape pregnancy road-map free.</li>
            <li>Not greasy- really smooth and makes a difference on the skin.</li>
            <li>I would also use it if I felt itchy (which was multiple times a day) and it worked great.</li>
            <li>I feel like it definitely did great things for my skin.</li>
            <li>I think I needed to buy two more containers to get through the remainder of my pregnancy, but I feel it was worth it</li>
            <li>so far so good, ive used it since 3 months</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>now using it again with #2 on the way, and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any stretch marks and so far have been doing good..</li>
            <li>Most reviews say that stretch marks are inevitable regardless of the amount of lotion you use, but keeping your skin hydrated is always a good idea.</li>
            <li>So maybe coconut oil or olive oil are all natural but they aren&#x27;t good for your clothes.</li>
            <li>it has a citrus scent which is not my favorite right now (especialy since i started with Cocoa butter</li>
            <li>I did the tummy oil for the first child and had no stretch marks, anywhere!!  </li>
            <li>I use Mama Mio Tummy Rub every day and have had so many compliments on its fresh, clean scent.</li>
            <li>So easy to work with, super moisturizing, and smells just as fantastic as the oil.  </li>
            <li>My stomach also when back to normal about 2 weeks postpartum and my skin looks great!</li>
            <li>When I got this in the mail I was so excited.</li>
            <li>I thought, &#x27;great, as long as it&#x27;s two, thats</li>
            <li>then it is well worth the money to me!</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it was from loosing weight so quickly though.</li>
            <li>Pregnancy is a time when you have to be so very careful because you are taking care of both you and your beautiful baby.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to be anything special</li>
            <li>Right now I am 24 weeks and NO stretch marks!</li>
            <li>While the cream might have been effective , I haven&#x27;t been able to use it due to its strong scent .</li>
            <li>Product smells nice and helps keeping skin moisturized, but that&#x27;s pretty much all it can do.  </li>
            <li>Am really loving this stretch mark cream so far.  </li>
            <li>it smells good is the only thing i can come up with.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to those who in search of a good stretch mark prevention cream.</li>
            <li>but this one actually smelled good.</li>
            <li>Aqua (Water), Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond)</li>
            <li>maybe it&#x27;s genetics, maybe it&#x27;s the product; It&#x27;s just far too pricey for a nice smelling lotion.</li>
            <li>I love the smell &amp; it moisturizes my skin really well.</li>
            <li>Since it lasts so much longer, it is a much better value for the money paid.</li>
            <li>So far, my skin looks great, my skin is soft, and not itchy!</li>
            <li>This butter is great, it melts in your skin, doesn&#x27;t layer on and feel sticky like cocoa butter or other creams.</li>
            <li>This worked great and it smelled nice, but it didn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>I was pregnant or breast feeding for 4 years.</li>
            <li>I was pregnant until the day each were born.  </li>
            <li>I used this with my 1st pregnancy and it did wonders for my itchy belly, my OB said I had the softest pregnant belly she had ever seen.  </li>
            <li>I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>but my pregnant \\&quot;supernose\\&quot; cannot handle it.</li>
            <li>To all those lucky ppl out there who didnt get any after using this cream, I bet they wouldnt of gotten any even if they havent used it.</li>
            <li>This was recommended to me by a family member when I was pregnant with my son two years ago.  </li>
            <li>Currently pregnant with #2 and plan to use again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve start using it since I was 8 weeks pregnant</li>
            <li>I am now 29 weeks pregnant</li>
            <li>I started getting my stretch marks when I was around 6 months pregnant, then my friend recommended this to me.</li>
            <li>I was 3-months pregnant with twins</li>
            <li>will use again when pregnant with baby number 2.</li>
            <li>A quick search on the web found some things that convinced me that I don&#x27;t want her to risk it.</li>
            <li>so I figured I wold get some while pregnant.</li>
            <li>It really works if you use it every day you would like to buy a bigger one, but it is great moisturizer...</li>
            <li>so I feel lucky about that.</li>
            <li>mos pregnant and she loves.it.</li>
            <li>6 months pregnant and still no stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this twice a day since I found out I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Mama Mio Tummy rub since I was 8 weeks pregnant, I use the cream in the morning &amp; oil at night.</li>
            <li>Pregnancy strengthens your sense of smell, having produced this product for pregnant women , one would assume they would take that into consideration but \\&quot; NO\\</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to any pregnant woman who has a heightened sense of smell .</li>
            <li>I am now 8 months pregnant and have no signs of stretchmarks.</li>
            <li>pregnant.</li>
            <li>As soon as I found out I was pregnant</li>
            <li>It was one of their very first products.</li>
            <li>this lotion smelled really good, and it soothed my itchy skin as it stretched.</li>
            <li>As soon as I tried hers, I just loved how it felt on my skin, how it smelled and how long it lasted.</li>
            <li>Hi, this product is good, however, it doesn&#x27;t really go a long way.</li>
            <li>The most important part of this product is the moisturizing, and it does not moisturize better than other cheaper products you can find at any grocery store.</li>
            <li>The good news is no new ones have come out since I started using this product again.</li>
            <li>This cream really works!!  </li>
            <li>The smell is light and pleasant which was a concern for me because I can get migraines from smells and am extra sensitive to it when I&#x27;m pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I knew before I went into my pregnancy that I didn&#x27;t have much hope of emerging stretch mark free -</li>
            <li>Kind of pricey and the bigger</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>Actually make me kind of nautious.</li>
            <li>but I figure it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>and I feel money best spent when the belly is bigger.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>I used almost every product Mama Mio offers, and was 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like powerful smells at all.</li>
            <li>Worth getting at this price.</li>
            <li>product- well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far better than the perfumey body butters out there and doesn&#x27;t irritate my allergies.</li>
            <li>For the cost, it may not be worth it to some, but for me, the effectiveness against the itching alone was worth it.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews on Amazon, even considering that I order something almost weekly</li>
            <li>but this is worth it.  </li>
            <li>This is lovely and I&#x27;ve actually finished the whole container!!!</li>
            <li>It was recommended to me by my cousins when I first got pregnant</li>
            <li>First off, I have to say that I was lucky not to get any stretchmarks.</li>
            <li>I was  going through it pretty quickly</li>
            <li>HIGHLY suggest every pregnant woman purchases this!</li>
            <li>So after the baby I&#x27;ll right another review.</li>
            <li>but when I stopped using it stretch marks attacked... just make sure you use it for your entire pregnancy (or why ever ur using it) for the full benefit.</li>
            <li>The smell for both products is light and the feel/quality is high.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different belly creams and stretch mark prevention products and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I now need to put it on 2-3x a day, but that is because my skin is so stretched and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helps amazingly with itchyness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been putting it on bust down for months and so far so good!</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this because it smells amazing and was super thick and lush but my non-sensitive skin broke out in a huge rash using this bottle.  </li>
            <li>I love the texture its very creamy but its not heavy on your skin or greasy</li>
            <li>Good old fashion generic cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I haven&#x27;t seen a single stretch mark on my body and I&#x27;m now 8months pregnant</li>
            <li>/&gt;First let me preface this review by stating that stetch marks during pregnancy are most likely not preventable for those women who happen to develop them.</li>
            <li>I used palmer&#x27;s Organic (higher concentation of cocoa butter)</li>
            <li>We felt it is important to have a &#x27;No Nasties&#x27; policy which clearly states our policy on ingredients (no Parabens, No Petrolatum, No Colours, No synthetic Fragrance, No Sulphates, zenoestrogen, or pthalates).  </li>
            <li>I got my first stretch mark on my belly</li>
            <li>(when I noticed the first sign of a stretch mark).  </li>
            <li>the consistency is great and its thick.</li>
            <li>During my first pregnancy my friend who worked at a maternity store, gave me this product</li>
            <li>You may want to order 4 pieces for the entire pregnancy period and avoid paying for shipment more than once.</li>
            <li>I tried first the Bella B tummy honey butter, but it was too sticky and it did&#x27;t absorb, so all my clothes got it instead of my skin.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly on my belly and chest and lower back.  </li>
            <li>definitely worth the money - my skin is doing so much bette.r</li>
            <li>I love this product and have ordered it numerous times before.</li>
            <li>I used this throughout my first pregnancy</li>
            <li>(first I applied the oil, then the butter over it).  </li>
            <li>I used this for the first part of my pregnancy, and did not get stretch marks...</li>
            <li>I mixed this with vitamin E, I went thru 6 1/2 jars total, and am thrilled!</li>
            <li>just wished that I had used this during my first pregnancy</li>
            <li>I really like this product and will be buying it again!</li>
            <li>I am still working on my first 4 oz.</li>
            <li>Not a mark with my first pregnancy</li>
            <li>This is my first pregnancy, and I have been using the Mama Mio Tummy Rub Butter since week 7.</li>
            <li>She used it with her first child.</li>
            <li>I first started using this lotion after a surgery to reduce scarring.</li>
            <li>, these are pretty pricey</li>
            <li>I bought this product early on in my pregnancy as I read staying well moisturized from the jump is important.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product, and to be fair, I will say that out of the 5 preventative stretch mark creams I tried, I didn&#x27;t find this one to be any better or worse at preventing stretch marks.</li>
            <li>My skin is so stretched and gets red, but this cream is super moisturizing and makes it feel good</li>
            <li>It does last me about 4 weeks per tube- very worth it!</li>
            <li>In terms of how many bottles you&#x27;ll be using (it is pricey), these small bottles last 4 months (and that&#x27;s applying liberally every morning and night), so it is a good value.</li>
            <li>and I went back to using my Palmer&#x27;s coco butter which is much more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>The smell is so nice and the lotion is so smooth and thick.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much Mama Mio!</li>
            <li>so not sure how good it is.</li>
            <li>I am 20 weeks pregnant and so far, no stretch marks on my bust or tummy.</li>
            <li>With the Mama Mio I did apply it twice per day every day as directed, and sometimes a bit more if I was dry.</li>
            <li>far as preventing stretch marks goes, I am almost 6 months pregnant and still without stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Ours is extremely pure and It is derived from coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>Why not just use pure coconut oil and aloe vera?</li>
            <li>, I think stretch marks are largely genetic.</li>
            <li>Love this product, but do miss the old packaging (the previous tub was better than the new tube at getting all the product out).</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin very quickly and there isn&#x27;t much of a residue left.</li>
            <li>The belly so far is free and clear (knock on wood for me!).</li>
            <li>Very thick and smells great.  </li>
            <li>The butter goes on really smooth, soaks in pretty quickly, and does not upset my supersensitive very dry skin (no small feat in my world).</li>
            <li>For some reason I never paid much attention to any that remarked about the scent.  </li>
            <li>Smells very musky and makes me want to remove it.  </li>
            <li>it is a bit pricey, but it really worked for me.</li>
            <li>I would also like to add that our oils always have a much shorter ingredient list than creams.  </li>
            <li>, she said it really works.</li>
            <li>For my whole pregnancy, i used up 4 jars.</li>
            <li>no wonder it didn&#x27;t work on them cuz you have to rub the cream around the whole belly, one jar can&#x27;t be used for your whole pregnancy.</li>
            <li>but is mamma mio really the reason for that?   </li>
            <li>if you really wanna care for yourself just apply olive oil/almond oil.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream!</li>
            <li>I started to use this tummy butter at the very beginning of my pregnancy and added the tummy rub oil to tummy care routine around 21 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product though</li>
            <li>I used it through out my whole pregnancy, I went through 2 jars.</li>
            <li>The product is very goopy though and doesn&#x27;t absorb into your skin...</li>
            <li>and I feel like it really does moisturize my belly and chest area.  </li>
            <li>At the end of the day these types of lotions help with preventing or treating stretch-related itchiness, but if you&#x27;re like me and you are genetically predisposed to getting stretch marks, then nothing is really going to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am ready for baby #2</li>
            <li>I heard so much about this product that I bought it.</li>
            <li>I also had a really itchy belly.</li>
            <li>and it really helped with the itchy sensation of stretching.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>very buttery texture, and feels very luxurious.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing even after leaving it for hours on the skin.  </li>
            <li>It really work .</li>
            <li>so I would&#x27;ve ended up with so much stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I used this every morning and night throughout my whole pregnancy.</li>
            <li>but before I really started to show.</li>
            <li>I really slather it on after my shower</li>
            <li>I used this throughout my whole pregnancy.</li>
            <li>Going to be about a $500-600 dollar run for the whole 9 months so lets hope it keeps working.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>technically we&#x27;re still early to see stretch marks on my wife, but so far this is nice lotion.  </li>
            <li>I have used almost the whole jar (mine did not come in a tube).</li>
            <li>my whole pregnancy.</li>
            <li>and I used this during my whole pregnancy.</li>
            <li>Proof that this is really a miracle product:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>I used this cream every day since the beginning of my 2nd trimester (needed 2 tubs total), and really liked it.</li>
            <li>You want to be loyal to it and apply it regularly through out the pregnancy and afterwards as well for many months ( as long as the marks are visible)</li>
            <li>I think mostly stretch marks are due to genetics, and how much weight you gain (too much, too fast).</li>
            <li>I am pregnant for the second time and this was the first item I ordered.  </li>
            <li>Funny for me to use a stretch mark cream as a regular cream since I haven&#x27;t been pregnant in 17 years</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the other products simply because i loved this one.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, but didn&#x27;t use long enough to tell if it really worked.</li>
            <li>Apparently, those are more related to genetics than to product use anyway.  </li>
            <li>I started slacking off at the end and did not notice a difference at all - so I am not sure if it is effective or not....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: I went full term with my baby boy (40 weeks) gained 25 pounds total and not ONE stretch mark!</li>
            <li>Helped me not get any more stretch marks than I got in my previous pregnancy where I did not use this product.</li>
            <li>Like most pregnancy and baby related products, the price seems grossly inflated.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying this for friends when they become pregnant.</li>
            <li>Polysorbate 80 is used as an emulsifier in foods, particularly in ice cream, and in creams.</li>
            <li>I am not big, i am 5&#x27;3\\&quot; and about 115 lb before i got pregnant.  </li>
            <li>I guess for now, i am currently almost 37 weeks, i can say i am lucky because I have no stretch marks on my stomach or anywwhere else</li>
            <li>Now I am pregnant with my second child and I will be using this cream again!!</li>
            <li>it was so oily and only provided mild relief.</li>
            <li>From the moment I found out that I was pregnant, I used regular cocoa butter cream.</li>
            <li>Currently I am seventeen weeks pregnant and started showing around nine weeks.</li>
            <li>I have been pregnant three times, and I tried this cream during my last pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>I am 23 weeks pregnant with my second child.</li>
            <li>and I am only 27 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li>but ive been using it since im 8 months pregnant not one stretch mark and just recieved my second order in the mail today.</li>
            <li>I was a little weary since $35 is kind of a lot of money to spend on a small bottle of cream, I went against my better judgement and bought it anyways.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend it instead...</li>
            <li>My wife loves it and highly recommends it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for expectant mothers experiencing the itches of a growing belly.</li>
            <li>I bought this with high hopes.</li>
            <li>I do wish the price was lower as it is a bit high, however for what it has done to my belly</li>
            <li>HIghly recommend.</li>
            <li>It worked far better than any of the other butters and oils out there.</li>
            <li>They last in the beginning but the more my stomach stretched the more I used, and I now use up a jar in much less than a month.</li>
            <li>I was very sensitive to smells when I was pregnant since I was constantly nauseous.  </li>
            <li>So even though my 23 weeks pregnant wife, who is showing quite a bit, has been using this product for a while now and does not yet have any stretch marks (knock on wood), I will not base this review on its effectiveness in prevention of the marks, but rather on its other qualities such as its moisturization properties and scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do like how it absorbs fast in to my skin and makes it feel really soft.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t write this product off completely because it did keep me very well moisturized</li>
            <li>On days when I really want to make my belly soft</li>
            <li>I really like the soft scent</li>
            <li>Although expensive, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>No stretch marks (so far) and really helps with the belly itching.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d describe the scent as citrus and/or pine floor cleaner mixed with diapers fresh out of the package.</li>
            <li>My husband really disliked the smell of Palmer&#x27;s, and said this one was way better.</li>
            <li>instead I just use a heavy moisturizing lotion most of the time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no expert on the matter, but I do know enough that often what goes on the skin gets absorbed by the body and with something like</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>I gained 48 pounds (and started out thin), so it was surprising to me to not have gotten stretch marks.</li>
            <li>This one was nice and thick and lotiony.</li>
            <li>I am currently 33 weeks pregnant and so far (fingers crossed)</li>
            <li>I still use it after delivery to hydrate and help the skin return to normal; i&#x27;m giving it three stars because it smells great, goes on smooth, absorbs well; i didn&#x27;t HATE the product.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for all new or expecting moms if they can afford. @</li>
            <li>Helped with the existing strech marks and the prevention of new ones.</li>
            <li>There have been a couple of incidents with the new stretch mark but all seems to disappear!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My belly wasn&#x27;t outrageously huge, in fact, I had a pretty small belly throughout the duration of my pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Mama Mio is quite expensive though, for a product that doesn&#x27;t work any better than the cheap options (Palmer&#x27;s is about $6/bottle, Mama Mio oil and butter came to $70).</li>
            <li>It was probably a combination of things, lots of water, I didn&#x27;t gain too much or too fast, etc, however, I was a likely candidate for them because my mom (and lots of relatives) have them.  </li>
            <li>I cannot give it 5 stars because I do not know whether it really worked or if if my skin had already stretched out from my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought the green tube version it was great but the second time the cream turned into little balls when rubbing it against my belly.</li>
            <li>When you first put it on it smells like citrus peels (orange mixed with lemon) or lemon starburst.  </li>
            <li>I first heard of the brand on a recent episode of Keeping up with the Kardashian&#x27;s</li>
            <li>With my first child I used the standard stretch mark lotion you can find at any store.</li>
            <li>I used this stuff religiously during my first pregnancy and it worked.  </li>
            <li>No stretch marks so far!</li>
            <li>This is my first pregnancy and my second purchase of this product</li>
            <li>Wife used it during pregnancy pretty much religiously and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because I&#x27;m not sure that if I would&#x27;ve not use this product I might&#x27;ve had more stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I was willing to try anything to trick what was inevitably hereditary (my mother got stretch marks from all 3 of her births).</li>
            <li>My first purchase of the butter came in a tub, and I found that easier to use simply because of ease of access.  </li>
            <li>(I now have a 3-week old baby) with ZERO stretch marks on my belly!</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and absorbs quickly so it doesn&#x27;t slow me down in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Whether it is genetics or this product, my wife swore by it her whole pregnancy and not a single stretch mark appeared.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not super cheap.</li>
            <li>Either way, I enjoyed using the cream, it kept my skin nice and soft and it helped with the uncomfortable itchy feeling due to stretching of the skin.</li>
            <li>Starting at 4 months pregnant I religiously used the Mama Mio stretch mark butter and the Mama Mio stretch mark oil twice a day</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even mind putting it on for her because its absorbancy doesn&#x27;t leave my fingers and hands feeling greasy for long, like most other lotions she uses.</li>
            <li>Skincare  Limonene, Linalool, Citral, Citronellol, Benzyl Benzoate - are all found in the pure, pregnancy-safe essential oils we use in Mama Mio.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been worried about stretch marks because my mom has them extensively and they are largely genetic.  </li>
            <li>I only purchased one tube while pregnant, I can&#x27;t really say whether it helped with stretch marks or not since I used a regular daily moisturizer once this ran out.</li>
            <li>For the last months or so, as I am starting to gaining more weight going to into my third trimester, I would see red or new stretch marks on the sides of my abdominal.  </li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s still too early to tell, but it makes my growing belly super soft and cures any itchiness due to stretching.    </li>
            <li>I bought it because the smell of cocoa butter made me nauseated and this smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Even at the end of my pregnancy they were only a light pink.  </li>
            <li>As a medical professional I can tell you there is nothing that will really prevent stretch marks from occurring.</li>
            <li>Because of this I faithfully applied lotions and creams, including this one, several times a day for my whole pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>so far it&#x27;s supposedly doing its job preventing stetch marks and has given us no reason to doubt its claims.</li>
            <li>It completely absorbs into your skin with no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Towards the end I used in combination with an oil bar from Lush.</li>
            <li>Because we care so much, we wanted to address each of the ingredient concerns expressed in the one star amazon customer review individually.</li>
            <li>We do not add these ingredients in separately - they exist within the oils naturally.  </li>
            <li>My skin stays soft.</li>
            <li>Much nicer smell than anything else I&#x27;ve tried - only the Basq belly butter can compare.  </li>
            <li>I purchased three of these during the nearly 20 weeks</li>
            <li>i have since given birth and my child is now 2 months old....and...i got 1 tiny stretch mark on my bellybutton but that was because i kept my metal ring in the whole time</li>
            <li>and so far haven&#x27;t noticed any stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any stretch mark so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 8 months and have no stretch marks so far (knock on wood).</li>
            <li>My wife has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So far no stretch marks at 32 weeks.</li>
            <li>I bought this early in my pregnancy to prevent stretch marks -</li>
            <li>So far no stretch marks.</li>
            <li>After using this for the last 3 months I think it&#x27;s time for me to write a review that this cream really deserved.  </li>
            <li>My tummy is so soft after applying this.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any yet</li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks so far in my pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>This is by far a quality</li>
            <li>You can totally tell your skin is getting much needed moisture though.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll probably only need 3 during your whole pregnancy including post partum when your belly starts shrinking.    </li>
            <li>Bella b and Burt&#x27;s bees didn&#x27;t really feel to have the lasting moisture I like.</li>
            <li>I started applying this cream at the beginning of my second trimester because I wasn;t showing much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream since early pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I had my baby in early May</li>
            <li>I like this so far.</li>
            <li>I am 4.5 months prego and no stretchmarks so far....</li>
            <li>I found out this was the old version, which means the cream I was putting in was probably turning into balls because it was old.</li>
            <li>At $35 or so, the price I have paid for it, that&#x27;s a big deal, considering how much of it I use.  </li>
            <li>then I probably would of had more than a few tiny stretch marks</li>
            <li>maybe I broke out due to more hormones later on, but I was definitely bummed out.  </li>
            <li>We take your safety very very seriously and go above and beyond the European and US regulations to keep you safe and sound during your pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>Belly lotions are supposed to be used fairly liberally during pregnancy, but even when I decreased the amount of product I put on my freshly showered (and dried) belly, this lotion would start to flake off!</li>
            <li>the first four are all found in citrus based essential oils such as Mandarin.  </li>
            <li>Overall decent product.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m starting to think that the cheaper and older alternative would&#x27;ve probably worked as well.</li>
            <li>I used Palmers religiously throughout my pregnancy, but decided to get something a little better quality for the last trimester.  </li>
            <li>I am definitely someone who was predestined to have stretch marks, as I have them on hips from puberty, but zero from this pregnancy, I will definitely be using on my next pregnancy, I can&#x27;t sing higher praises from this product!</li>
            <li>I was stretch mark free for 35 weeks but then began to get small purple dots on my sides around week 32...</li>
            <li>I ended up going back to my basic Aveeno everyday lotion and no stretch marks in sight with 5 more weeks to go.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use the product until my belly goes back to normal.</li>
            <li>I started applying it to my lower abdomen as the stretch marks started to appear, and the marks are noticeably less intense than the marks on my upper abdomen where the marks I got first started to appear</li>
            <li>I bought a few of these while I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s different than the others in that it seems to be a looser cream and has a very strange, off-putting at first, fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have been through 3 or 4 jars so far with 6 weeks left to go (I got my first one at probably 12-14 weeks) and am about to need to order another one, so they don&#x27;t last too long (or maybe I apply too</li>
            <li>it goes, but at the risk of sounding vain, not having stretch marks is worth a little $$ to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And guess what, not a single stretch mark!!</li>
            <li>I switched to bio oil and haven&#x27;t gotten a single new stretch mark and the old ones are fading.</li>
            <li>Does not last very long either though which stinks since it smells so good!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it that long, but I hope that I can continue this pregnancy with zero to little stretch marks b/c of this product!! :)</li>
            <li>They are deep and therefore have \\&quot;textured\\&quot; my skin, but by 6 months after my daughter was born the color had completely disappeared.  </li>
            <li>Please read these through and if you have any further worries please email me directly at tanya@mamamio.com.  </li>
            <li>and I am 6 months into the second with soft tummy skin.  </li>
            <li>Long story short, I applied this stuff religiously (see exact process below) and came away from pregnancy</li>
            <li>Smells nice but useless at preventing stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I was given this as a gift from my MIL when I was about 13 weeks pregnant, and started using it with little faith because I got stretch marks from growing in puberty on my upper thighs and hips.  </li>
            <li>I received this Tummy Rub a few weeks ago and used it right away.</li>
            <li>So, if you were to break down a drop of pure Ylang Ylang Oil you would find a tiny percentage of Benzyl Benzoate within the natural componentry of the oil.    </li>
            <li>I was pretty happy with the smell and texture of the product itself, however, for the money, I was extremely disappointed that it was gone within 3 weeks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it heavily for a little over a month now, and just ordered more, but I&#x27;m still getting the dreaded stretch marks, though I believe this product is reducing the severity of them, so it helps</li>
            <li>I use this product stilll , just in case along with some bio oil to help make sure my stretch marks dont get worse... but only time will tell.     </li>
            <li>She has tried several stretch mark creams/lotions during this, our first pregnancy, and this product is the hands down winner.</li>
            <li>At first i used a stretch mark butter from down to earth because i was starting to get itchy all over my abdomen.</li>
            <li>, this is much more minor issues, but I should mention: the packaging makes it difficult to squeeze out every last drop (which at this price you really want)</li>
            <li>When buying it in the tube, I had to cut the tube open to get the full use of the product, which was irritating (I wanted every last drop since I was paying so much per ounce).</li>
            <li>This product was nothing special just a thick lotion that clumped when i tried to rub it in.</li>
            <li>My expectant gf absolutely loves when I rub this on her tummy and other areas of potential skin stretching.  </li>
            <li>One other thing to note, the oil does last much longer and if you purchase the butter/cream, try and get the stuff in the jar.</li>
            <li>tub of the tummy butter, but so far, it has lasted twice as long</li>
            <li>Tried to use a cheaper product the first few months with this one</li>
            <li>decent price, compared to other websites.</li>
            <li>A little gypped on how much product I got</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s with me only applying the bio oil once a day or every other day (pretty forgetful sometimes).</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Okay .... I know this product has a good rating and it seems to be working for some pp but not for me!  </li>
            <li> For best results, make sure to drink lots and lots of water and have healthy weight gain as well.</li>
            <li> I stumbled on this cream during research while Imwas pregnant, it seemed to have the best reviews</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves my skin so smooth!</li>
            <li> Very glad to have this for our daughter expecting twins.  </li>
            <li> The tummy rub is great, it&#x27;s organic and when you apply it you can tell it makes the skin more elastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no greasy or sticky at all, the citric fragrance is perfect and most important.....</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this!  </li>
            <li> Outstanding !!!!!  This product was exactly what I needed to fight off that itchy pregnancy skin on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> Love this mama mio tummy rub ...!</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, BUT plastic surgery or laser is so much more!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love the stuff!  </li>
            <li> Using this product combined with the Mama Mio Tummy Rub Stretch Mark Oil is much better!</li>
            <li> and so now I need more!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I used Mama Mio for my first pregnancy and it was excellent.</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> This butter is by far the BEST I have found - smells great, no nasties, doesn&#x27;t get on clothes and it is super moisturizing so bye-bye itching!!  </li>
            <li> It smells amazing</li>
            <li> It feels light and smells great.</li>
            <li> and I am happy it is still available.</li>
            <li> This tummy butter is amazing.</li>
            <li> (btw, it smells amazing and eliminates itchiness!).&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> I use the oil in the morning to get a nice glow on my skin</li>
            <li> If you prefer the texture of the cream, it will work great for you, but just plan on spending more to get more.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not so itchy, this is a nice product.  </li>
            <li> Kind</li>
            <li> I used this SC nice week 22 of pregnancy and no stretch marks or itching.</li>
            <li> This is pricy but effective.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it smells really nice.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and calming, I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of some of the cocoa butter products out there.  </li>
            <li> Nice feeling.</li>
            <li> , that is how nice the smelll is.</li>
            <li> sure if it was the lotion or just good luck</li>
            <li> - but I have seen plenty of people not use lotion of any kind</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice cream to apply</li>
            <li> and my wife really liked it.</li>
            <li> Very rich, excellent scent, worth it</li>
            <li> Excellent product - I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> On a good note.... it does smell very good and leaves your skin so soft and mosturized!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any pregnant mommas and it would also be a great gift for an expectant mother.</li>
            <li> It smells great and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It leaves you skin smooth all day, and have a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> My cousin used it while pregnant and had great results.  </li>
            <li> There also is a very strong smell of citrus.</li>
            <li> With a baby on the way there are many more uses for it!</li>
            <li> I first tried the Mama Mio Tummy Rub Stretch Mark Oil and loved it!  </li>
            <li> a really nice consistency to the touch, and a mild, pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The perfume is very mild and pleasant. :)</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft all day and has a delicious scent.</li>
            <li> Liked this much better and used it all.</li>
            <li> smooth and nice skin when I wake up! :)</li>
            <li> So if you are looking for the purest formulas, you will find our Tummy Rub Oil to have less ingredients than our Tummy Rub Butter although both are equally wonderful at taking great care of your skin throughout your pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> My skin is clean and gorgeous and not crepey at all.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good and its nice to know it has nothing in it that can hurt the baby.  </li>
            <li> The cream rubs in quickly and smells good.  </li>
            <li> I loved this stuff when I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my pregnant sister and she absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li> Mild smell and good texture</li>
            <li> I love how it feels on  my skin, it absorbs right away and feels amazing!</li>
            <li> huge cons:&lt;br /&gt;IT DOESN&amp;#34;T ABSORB!</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a sample at a maternity store and felt in love.</li>
            <li> So i bought more;  </li>
            <li> so I obviously really love the product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading many reviews.  </li>
            <li> I hope I can get use to the smell because I do love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I use Boob Tube and I LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I also like the way the oil feels on my skin much better.  </li>
            <li> When I need to buy more Mama Mio, I&#x27;m going to buy the oil instead of the tummy butter.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> you get the more you use</li>
            <li> &amp; I have to say I like it better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I cannot say for sure that Mama Mio was the trick to all this, but I&#x27;m sure it played a role.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I valued that more than the lotion itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the feel but the smell makes me nauseous.</li>
            <li> The interesting thing is I dont have any marks on my stomach - just thighs, butt, and boobs</li>
            <li> That being said, keeping your skin moisturized DOES help your skin feel better while it is stretching and growing.</li>
            <li> I have used it a bit afterward and they have mostly faded (I&#x27;m 4 mos postpartum).</li>
            <li> so i need one more jar.</li>
            <li> I love this butter.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure this stuff is helping a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit</li>
            <li> works great and is at a reasonable price unlike Mama Mio tummy</li>
            <li> If you want a pregnancy safe, grest-smelling, moisturizer, then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves the skin feeling absolutely buttery.  </li>
            <li> I just absolutely love this cream.</li>
            <li> I use the cream now as I am still losing baby weight, and I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I just recently started using the oil with this product in my 7th month and am very happy with both!</li>
            <li> and I enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> Smells great and absorbs really well.  </li>
            <li> I love the results, feel, and smell of this lotion.</li>
            <li> This product is pricey and felt that vaseline was a better contender.</li>
            <li> Smells great and loved it, but for what it cost I probably won&#x27;t get during next pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells</li>
            <li> and I fell in love.</li>
            <li> For me, I can&#x27;t understand why anything of this purpose has to have this many chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent, love the feel, and love the results.  </li>
            <li> Love to apply before bedtime.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> would love for it to come in a jar like container rather then</li>
            <li> This smell is light and nice.</li>
            <li> I would recommend for sure, it&#x27;s a treat.</li>
            <li> Competitive price and fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I am also a bit of a skeptic :)</li>
            <li> Given the whopping price tag, you&#x27;re better off just using shea butter.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this this product,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Buy it :)</li>
            <li> For me this worked fabulously!</li>
            <li> and I still have more.  </li>
            <li> love this stuff</li>
            <li> and I am 100% satisfied</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I love using it.</li>
            <li> I love it for me.</li>
            <li> GET IT!! :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell of this cream is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tolerable, and not nasty, I just think it could be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I heard such wonderful things on this tummy butter</li>
            <li> I think it does an OK job, but it doesn&#x27;t penetrate to help the skin get rid of the post pregnancy marks.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and well worth the money!</li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the baby yet, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> This cream is nice but nothing special.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, has a pleasant clean scent.  </li>
            <li> Now I have a beautiful 4 week old son and no stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Spend the money and get the best, it goes a long way if you use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> I had to buy three containers during my pregnancy, well worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> SO worth the money!!</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell for sure, but great product so far.</li>
            <li> This cream also smells nice, but for $35 I can buy some super yummy stuff at Bath and Body Works.</li>
            <li> highly, highly recommend this stuff - and it smells really nice!</li>
            <li> My 62 year old husband tells me how great I look all the time.</li>
            <li> , this product has made my pregnancy more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I use this with the oil &amp; so far, the results are great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a shot, it&#x27;s nicely packaged</li>
            <li> I started with the Mama Mio oil and loved it so much I had to try the belly butter.  </li>
            <li> Then I would use a good amount of cream and really massage in circular motion for 10 min.  </li>
            <li> I gained 1Lb per week during my pregnancy, and my doctor said I am a fine and healthy pregnant women and no creams will help a women if you have the gene and hormone to produce the damn stretch mark!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different products to combat skin drying and stretching on my pregnant belly, and this is one of the best.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week (am 6 months pregnant, no marks yet), so I can&#x27;t comment on its long-term effectiveness, but it has a wonderful smell and absorbs well into the skin.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice and is easy to be absorbed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more than worth the price tag, and I tend to be on the thrifty side!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks yet, but the true test of time will be at the end of 40 weeks!  </li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about it, it works!</li>
            <li> I love how rich it is.</li>
            <li> I know that doesn&#x27;t sound great, but this stuff has kept her skin incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> I have marks from my adolescent years, so I know I can easily develop them.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it particularly easy to apply, and I didn&#x27;t care for the scent.  </li>
            <li> I still have a couple more months to go, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> I do not like the smell as it is way too strong for me.</li>
            <li> The last one is found in Ylang Ylang oil, which is included in our beautiful Gravida (which means Pregnancy in latin) fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I am not crazy about the smell (slightly strong), but it worked so well!</li>
            <li> I did not develop any stretch marks, however, I still experienced a good deal of itchiness, particularly in the 3rd trimester.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was fine till my 28th weeks of pregnancy</li>
            <li> My wife brought this home and once I looked at the fine print</li>
            <li> Seemed to work just fine.</li>
            <li> and I lived up to they hype from pregnant Kim!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently pregnant w/ twins and rub this in every night and most mornings.</li>
            <li> She went through 3 or 4 of these while pregnant and whenever #2 is on the way we will surely be reordering this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24 weeks pregnant, and have gone through 1.5 tubes of this stuff - not a stretch mark in sight!</li>
            <li> Such a nice smell, and lovely product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe that any non-invasive product can protect from a genetic predisposition and that&#x27;s certainly why none of these treatments and creams offer any kind of guarantees against the dreaded marks.</li>
            <li> Of course we will never know how much this products really contributed... but it is of great quality and also helped with itching a lot.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s so great that I just bought my 2nd jar.</li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s so great, why only four stars?\\&quot; you ask?</li>
            <li> like I said it was fantastic on my itchy skin...</li>
            <li> and it smells fabulous.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t buy into the sales pitch that you will escape pregnancy road-map free.</li>
            <li> Not greasy- really smooth and makes a difference on the skin.</li>
            <li> I would also use it if I felt itchy (which was multiple times a day) and it worked great.</li>
            <li> I feel like it definitely did great things for my skin.</li>
            <li> I think I needed to buy two more containers to get through the remainder of my pregnancy, but I feel it was worth it</li>
            <li> so far so good, ive used it since 3 months</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> now using it again with #2 on the way, and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any stretch marks and so far have been doing good..</li>
            <li> Most reviews say that stretch marks are inevitable regardless of the amount of lotion you use, but keeping your skin hydrated is always a good idea.</li>
            <li> So maybe coconut oil or olive oil are all natural but they aren&#x27;t good for your clothes.</li>
            <li> it has a citrus scent which is not my favorite right now (especialy since i started with Cocoa butter</li>
            <li> I did the tummy oil for the first child and had no stretch marks, anywhere!!  </li>
            <li> I use Mama Mio Tummy Rub every day and have had so many compliments on its fresh, clean scent.</li>
            <li> So easy to work with, super moisturizing, and smells just as fantastic as the oil.  </li>
            <li> My stomach also when back to normal about 2 weeks postpartum and my skin looks great!</li>
            <li> When I got this in the mail I was so excited.</li>
            <li> I thought, &#x27;great, as long as it&#x27;s two, thats</li>
            <li> then it is well worth the money to me!</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it was from loosing weight so quickly though.</li>
            <li> Pregnancy is a time when you have to be so very careful because you are taking care of both you and your beautiful baby.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to be anything special</li>
            <li> Right now I am 24 weeks and NO stretch marks!</li>
            <li> While the cream might have been effective , I haven&#x27;t been able to use it due to its strong scent .</li>
            <li> Product smells nice and helps keeping skin moisturized, but that&#x27;s pretty much all it can do.  </li>
            <li> Am really loving this stretch mark cream so far.  </li>
            <li> it smells good is the only thing i can come up with.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to those who in search of a good stretch mark prevention cream.</li>
            <li> but this one actually smelled good.</li>
            <li> Aqua (Water), Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond)</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s genetics, maybe it&#x27;s the product; It&#x27;s just far too pricey for a nice smelling lotion.</li>
            <li> I love the smell &amp; it moisturizes my skin really well.</li>
            <li> Since it lasts so much longer, it is a much better value for the money paid.</li>
            <li> So far, my skin looks great, my skin is soft, and not itchy!</li>
            <li> This butter is great, it melts in your skin, doesn&#x27;t layer on and feel sticky like cocoa butter or other creams.</li>
            <li> This worked great and it smelled nice, but it didn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> I was pregnant or breast feeding for 4 years.</li>
            <li> I was pregnant until the day each were born.  </li>
            <li> I used this with my 1st pregnancy and it did wonders for my itchy belly, my OB said I had the softest pregnant belly she had ever seen.  </li>
            <li> I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> but my pregnant \\&quot;supernose\\&quot; cannot handle it.</li>
            <li> To all those lucky ppl out there who didnt get any after using this cream, I bet they wouldnt of gotten any even if they havent used it.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a family member when I was pregnant with my son two years ago.  </li>
            <li> Currently pregnant with #2 and plan to use again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve start using it since I was 8 weeks pregnant</li>
            <li> I am now 29 weeks pregnant</li>
            <li> I started getting my stretch marks when I was around 6 months pregnant, then my friend recommended this to me.</li>
            <li> I was 3-months pregnant with twins</li>
            <li> will use again when pregnant with baby number 2.</li>
            <li> A quick search on the web found some things that convinced me that I don&#x27;t want her to risk it.</li>
            <li> so I figured I wold get some while pregnant.</li>
            <li> It really works if you use it every day you would like to buy a bigger one, but it is great moisturizer...</li>
            <li> so I feel lucky about that.</li>
            <li> mos pregnant and she loves.it.</li>
            <li> 6 months pregnant and still no stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice a day since I found out I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mama Mio Tummy rub since I was 8 weeks pregnant, I use the cream in the morning &amp; oil at night.</li>
            <li> Pregnancy strengthens your sense of smell, having produced this product for pregnant women , one would assume they would take that into consideration but \\&quot; NO\\</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to any pregnant woman who has a heightened sense of smell .</li>
            <li> I am now 8 months pregnant and have no signs of stretchmarks.</li>
            <li> pregnant.</li>
            <li> As soon as I found out I was pregnant</li>
            <li> It was one of their very first products.</li>
            <li> this lotion smelled really good, and it soothed my itchy skin as it stretched.</li>
            <li> As soon as I tried hers, I just loved how it felt on my skin, how it smelled and how long it lasted.</li>
            <li> Hi, this product is good, however, it doesn&#x27;t really go a long way.</li>
            <li> The most important part of this product is the moisturizing, and it does not moisturize better than other cheaper products you can find at any grocery store.</li>
            <li> The good news is no new ones have come out since I started using this product again.</li>
            <li> This cream really works!!  </li>
            <li> The smell is light and pleasant which was a concern for me because I can get migraines from smells and am extra sensitive to it when I&#x27;m pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I knew before I went into my pregnancy that I didn&#x27;t have much hope of emerging stretch mark free -</li>
            <li> Kind of pricey and the bigger</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Actually make me kind of nautious.</li>
            <li> but I figure it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> and I feel money best spent when the belly is bigger.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> I used almost every product Mama Mio offers, and was 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like powerful smells at all.</li>
            <li> Worth getting at this price.</li>
            <li> product- well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far better than the perfumey body butters out there and doesn&#x27;t irritate my allergies.</li>
            <li> For the cost, it may not be worth it to some, but for me, the effectiveness against the itching alone was worth it.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews on Amazon, even considering that I order something almost weekly</li>
            <li> but this is worth it.  </li>
            <li> This is lovely and I&#x27;ve actually finished the whole container!!!</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by my cousins when I first got pregnant</li>
            <li> First off, I have to say that I was lucky not to get any stretchmarks.</li>
            <li> I was  going through it pretty quickly</li>
            <li> HIGHLY suggest every pregnant woman purchases this!</li>
            <li> So after the baby I&#x27;ll right another review.</li>
            <li> but when I stopped using it stretch marks attacked... just make sure you use it for your entire pregnancy (or why ever ur using it) for the full benefit.</li>
            <li> The smell for both products is light and the feel/quality is high.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different belly creams and stretch mark prevention products and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I now need to put it on 2-3x a day, but that is because my skin is so stretched and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helps amazingly with itchyness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been putting it on bust down for months and so far so good!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this because it smells amazing and was super thick and lush but my non-sensitive skin broke out in a huge rash using this bottle.  </li>
            <li> I love the texture its very creamy but its not heavy on your skin or greasy</li>
            <li> Good old fashion generic cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I haven&#x27;t seen a single stretch mark on my body and I&#x27;m now 8months pregnant</li>
            <li> /&gt;First let me preface this review by stating that stetch marks during pregnancy are most likely not preventable for those women who happen to develop them.</li>
            <li> I used palmer&#x27;s Organic (higher concentation of cocoa butter)</li>
            <li> We felt it is important to have a &#x27;No Nasties&#x27; policy which clearly states our policy on ingredients (no Parabens, No Petrolatum, No Colours, No synthetic Fragrance, No Sulphates, zenoestrogen, or pthalates).  </li>
            <li> I got my first stretch mark on my belly</li>
            <li> (when I noticed the first sign of a stretch mark).  </li>
            <li> the consistency is great and its thick.</li>
            <li> During my first pregnancy my friend who worked at a maternity store, gave me this product</li>
            <li> You may want to order 4 pieces for the entire pregnancy period and avoid paying for shipment more than once.</li>
            <li> I tried first the Bella B tummy honey butter, but it was too sticky and it did&#x27;t absorb, so all my clothes got it instead of my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly on my belly and chest and lower back.  </li>
            <li> definitely worth the money - my skin is doing so much bette.r</li>
            <li> I love this product and have ordered it numerous times before.</li>
            <li> I used this throughout my first pregnancy</li>
            <li> (first I applied the oil, then the butter over it).  </li>
            <li> I used this for the first part of my pregnancy, and did not get stretch marks...</li>
            <li> I mixed this with vitamin E, I went thru 6 1/2 jars total, and am thrilled!</li>
            <li> just wished that I had used this during my first pregnancy</li>
            <li> I really like this product and will be buying it again!</li>
            <li> I am still working on my first 4 oz.</li>
            <li> Not a mark with my first pregnancy</li>
            <li> This is my first pregnancy, and I have been using the Mama Mio Tummy Rub Butter since week 7.</li>
            <li> She used it with her first child.</li>
            <li> I first started using this lotion after a surgery to reduce scarring.</li>
            <li> , these are pretty pricey</li>
            <li> I bought this product early on in my pregnancy as I read staying well moisturized from the jump is important.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, and to be fair, I will say that out of the 5 preventative stretch mark creams I tried, I didn&#x27;t find this one to be any better or worse at preventing stretch marks.</li>
            <li> My skin is so stretched and gets red, but this cream is super moisturizing and makes it feel good</li>
            <li> It does last me about 4 weeks per tube- very worth it!</li>
            <li> In terms of how many bottles you&#x27;ll be using (it is pricey), these small bottles last 4 months (and that&#x27;s applying liberally every morning and night), so it is a good value.</li>
            <li> and I went back to using my Palmer&#x27;s coco butter which is much more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> The smell is so nice and the lotion is so smooth and thick.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much Mama Mio!</li>
            <li> so not sure how good it is.</li>
            <li> I am 20 weeks pregnant and so far, no stretch marks on my bust or tummy.</li>
            <li> With the Mama Mio I did apply it twice per day every day as directed, and sometimes a bit more if I was dry.</li>
            <li> far as preventing stretch marks goes, I am almost 6 months pregnant and still without stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Ours is extremely pure and It is derived from coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> Why not just use pure coconut oil and aloe vera?</li>
            <li> , I think stretch marks are largely genetic.</li>
            <li> Love this product, but do miss the old packaging (the previous tub was better than the new tube at getting all the product out).</li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin very quickly and there isn&#x27;t much of a residue left.</li>
            <li> The belly so far is free and clear (knock on wood for me!).</li>
            <li> Very thick and smells great.  </li>
            <li> The butter goes on really smooth, soaks in pretty quickly, and does not upset my supersensitive very dry skin (no small feat in my world).</li>
            <li> For some reason I never paid much attention to any that remarked about the scent.  </li>
            <li> Smells very musky and makes me want to remove it.  </li>
            <li> it is a bit pricey, but it really worked for me.</li>
            <li> I would also like to add that our oils always have a much shorter ingredient list than creams.  </li>
            <li> , she said it really works.</li>
            <li> For my whole pregnancy, i used up 4 jars.</li>
            <li> no wonder it didn&#x27;t work on them cuz you have to rub the cream around the whole belly, one jar can&#x27;t be used for your whole pregnancy.</li>
            <li> but is mamma mio really the reason for that?   </li>
            <li> if you really wanna care for yourself just apply olive oil/almond oil.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream!</li>
            <li> I started to use this tummy butter at the very beginning of my pregnancy and added the tummy rub oil to tummy care routine around 21 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product though</li>
            <li> I used it through out my whole pregnancy, I went through 2 jars.</li>
            <li> The product is very goopy though and doesn&#x27;t absorb into your skin...</li>
            <li> and I feel like it really does moisturize my belly and chest area.  </li>
            <li> At the end of the day these types of lotions help with preventing or treating stretch-related itchiness, but if you&#x27;re like me and you are genetically predisposed to getting stretch marks, then nothing is really going to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am ready for baby #2</li>
            <li> I heard so much about this product that I bought it.</li>
            <li> I also had a really itchy belly.</li>
            <li> and it really helped with the itchy sensation of stretching.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> very buttery texture, and feels very luxurious.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing even after leaving it for hours on the skin.  </li>
            <li> It really work .</li>
            <li> so I would&#x27;ve ended up with so much stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I used this every morning and night throughout my whole pregnancy.</li>
            <li> but before I really started to show.</li>
            <li> I really slather it on after my shower</li>
            <li> I used this throughout my whole pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Going to be about a $500-600 dollar run for the whole 9 months so lets hope it keeps working.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> technically we&#x27;re still early to see stretch marks on my wife, but so far this is nice lotion.  </li>
            <li> I have used almost the whole jar (mine did not come in a tube).</li>
            <li> my whole pregnancy.</li>
            <li> and I used this during my whole pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Proof that this is really a miracle product:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> I used this cream every day since the beginning of my 2nd trimester (needed 2 tubs total), and really liked it.</li>
            <li> You want to be loyal to it and apply it regularly through out the pregnancy and afterwards as well for many months ( as long as the marks are visible)</li>
            <li> I think mostly stretch marks are due to genetics, and how much weight you gain (too much, too fast).</li>
            <li> I am pregnant for the second time and this was the first item I ordered.  </li>
            <li> Funny for me to use a stretch mark cream as a regular cream since I haven&#x27;t been pregnant in 17 years</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the other products simply because i loved this one.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but didn&#x27;t use long enough to tell if it really worked.</li>
            <li> Apparently, those are more related to genetics than to product use anyway.  </li>
            <li> I started slacking off at the end and did not notice a difference at all - so I am not sure if it is effective or not....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I went full term with my baby boy (40 weeks) gained 25 pounds total and not ONE stretch mark!</li>
            <li> Helped me not get any more stretch marks than I got in my previous pregnancy where I did not use this product.</li>
            <li> Like most pregnancy and baby related products, the price seems grossly inflated.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying this for friends when they become pregnant.</li>
            <li> Polysorbate 80 is used as an emulsifier in foods, particularly in ice cream, and in creams.</li>
            <li> I am not big, i am 5&#x27;3\\&quot; and about 115 lb before i got pregnant.  </li>
            <li> I guess for now, i am currently almost 37 weeks, i can say i am lucky because I have no stretch marks on my stomach or anywwhere else</li>
            <li> Now I am pregnant with my second child and I will be using this cream again!!</li>
            <li> it was so oily and only provided mild relief.</li>
            <li> From the moment I found out that I was pregnant, I used regular cocoa butter cream.</li>
            <li> Currently I am seventeen weeks pregnant and started showing around nine weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been pregnant three times, and I tried this cream during my last pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> I am 23 weeks pregnant with my second child.</li>
            <li> and I am only 27 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li> but ive been using it since im 8 months pregnant not one stretch mark and just recieved my second order in the mail today.</li>
            <li> I was a little weary since $35 is kind of a lot of money to spend on a small bottle of cream, I went against my better judgement and bought it anyways.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend it instead...</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and highly recommends it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for expectant mothers experiencing the itches of a growing belly.</li>
            <li> I bought this with high hopes.</li>
            <li> I do wish the price was lower as it is a bit high, however for what it has done to my belly</li>
            <li> HIghly recommend.</li>
            <li> It worked far better than any of the other butters and oils out there.</li>
            <li> They last in the beginning but the more my stomach stretched the more I used, and I now use up a jar in much less than a month.</li>
            <li> I was very sensitive to smells when I was pregnant since I was constantly nauseous.  </li>
            <li> So even though my 23 weeks pregnant wife, who is showing quite a bit, has been using this product for a while now and does not yet have any stretch marks (knock on wood), I will not base this review on its effectiveness in prevention of the marks, but rather on its other qualities such as its moisturization properties and scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do like how it absorbs fast in to my skin and makes it feel really soft.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t write this product off completely because it did keep me very well moisturized</li>
            <li> On days when I really want to make my belly soft</li>
            <li> I really like the soft scent</li>
            <li> Although expensive, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> No stretch marks (so far) and really helps with the belly itching.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d describe the scent as citrus and/or pine floor cleaner mixed with diapers fresh out of the package.</li>
            <li> My husband really disliked the smell of Palmer&#x27;s, and said this one was way better.</li>
            <li> instead I just use a heavy moisturizing lotion most of the time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no expert on the matter, but I do know enough that often what goes on the skin gets absorbed by the body and with something like</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I gained 48 pounds (and started out thin), so it was surprising to me to not have gotten stretch marks.</li>
            <li> This one was nice and thick and lotiony.</li>
            <li> I am currently 33 weeks pregnant and so far (fingers crossed)</li>
            <li> I still use it after delivery to hydrate and help the skin return to normal; i&#x27;m giving it three stars because it smells great, goes on smooth, absorbs well; i didn&#x27;t HATE the product.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for all new or expecting moms if they can afford. @</li>
            <li> Helped with the existing strech marks and the prevention of new ones.</li>
            <li> There have been a couple of incidents with the new stretch mark but all seems to disappear!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My belly wasn&#x27;t outrageously huge, in fact, I had a pretty small belly throughout the duration of my pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Mama Mio is quite expensive though, for a product that doesn&#x27;t work any better than the cheap options (Palmer&#x27;s is about $6/bottle, Mama Mio oil and butter came to $70).</li>
            <li> It was probably a combination of things, lots of water, I didn&#x27;t gain too much or too fast, etc, however, I was a likely candidate for them because my mom (and lots of relatives) have them.  </li>
            <li> I cannot give it 5 stars because I do not know whether it really worked or if if my skin had already stretched out from my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought the green tube version it was great but the second time the cream turned into little balls when rubbing it against my belly.</li>
            <li> When you first put it on it smells like citrus peels (orange mixed with lemon) or lemon starburst.  </li>
            <li> I first heard of the brand on a recent episode of Keeping up with the Kardashian&#x27;s</li>
            <li> With my first child I used the standard stretch mark lotion you can find at any store.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff religiously during my first pregnancy and it worked.  </li>
            <li> No stretch marks so far!</li>
            <li> This is my first pregnancy and my second purchase of this product</li>
            <li> Wife used it during pregnancy pretty much religiously and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because I&#x27;m not sure that if I would&#x27;ve not use this product I might&#x27;ve had more stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I was willing to try anything to trick what was inevitably hereditary (my mother got stretch marks from all 3 of her births).</li>
            <li> My first purchase of the butter came in a tub, and I found that easier to use simply because of ease of access.  </li>
            <li> (I now have a 3-week old baby) with ZERO stretch marks on my belly!</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and absorbs quickly so it doesn&#x27;t slow me down in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Whether it is genetics or this product, my wife swore by it her whole pregnancy and not a single stretch mark appeared.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not super cheap.</li>
            <li> Either way, I enjoyed using the cream, it kept my skin nice and soft and it helped with the uncomfortable itchy feeling due to stretching of the skin.</li>
            <li> Starting at 4 months pregnant I religiously used the Mama Mio stretch mark butter and the Mama Mio stretch mark oil twice a day</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even mind putting it on for her because its absorbancy doesn&#x27;t leave my fingers and hands feeling greasy for long, like most other lotions she uses.</li>
            <li> Skincare  Limonene, Linalool, Citral, Citronellol, Benzyl Benzoate - are all found in the pure, pregnancy-safe essential oils we use in Mama Mio.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been worried about stretch marks because my mom has them extensively and they are largely genetic.  </li>
            <li> I only purchased one tube while pregnant, I can&#x27;t really say whether it helped with stretch marks or not since I used a regular daily moisturizer once this ran out.</li>
            <li> For the last months or so, as I am starting to gaining more weight going to into my third trimester, I would see red or new stretch marks on the sides of my abdominal.  </li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s still too early to tell, but it makes my growing belly super soft and cures any itchiness due to stretching.    </li>
            <li> I bought it because the smell of cocoa butter made me nauseated and this smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Even at the end of my pregnancy they were only a light pink.  </li>
            <li> As a medical professional I can tell you there is nothing that will really prevent stretch marks from occurring.</li>
            <li> Because of this I faithfully applied lotions and creams, including this one, several times a day for my whole pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> so far it&#x27;s supposedly doing its job preventing stetch marks and has given us no reason to doubt its claims.</li>
            <li> It completely absorbs into your skin with no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Towards the end I used in combination with an oil bar from Lush.</li>
            <li> Because we care so much, we wanted to address each of the ingredient concerns expressed in the one star amazon customer review individually.</li>
            <li> We do not add these ingredients in separately - they exist within the oils naturally.  </li>
            <li> My skin stays soft.</li>
            <li> Much nicer smell than anything else I&#x27;ve tried - only the Basq belly butter can compare.  </li>
            <li> I purchased three of these during the nearly 20 weeks</li>
            <li> i have since given birth and my child is now 2 months old....and...i got 1 tiny stretch mark on my bellybutton but that was because i kept my metal ring in the whole time</li>
            <li> and so far haven&#x27;t noticed any stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any stretch mark so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 8 months and have no stretch marks so far (knock on wood).</li>
            <li> My wife has sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So far no stretch marks at 32 weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought this early in my pregnancy to prevent stretch marks -</li>
            <li> So far no stretch marks.</li>
            <li> After using this for the last 3 months I think it&#x27;s time for me to write a review that this cream really deserved.  </li>
            <li> My tummy is so soft after applying this.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any yet</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks so far in my pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is by far a quality</li>
            <li> You can totally tell your skin is getting much needed moisture though.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll probably only need 3 during your whole pregnancy including post partum when your belly starts shrinking.    </li>
            <li> Bella b and Burt&#x27;s bees didn&#x27;t really feel to have the lasting moisture I like.</li>
            <li> I started applying this cream at the beginning of my second trimester because I wasn;t showing much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream since early pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I had my baby in early May</li>
            <li> I like this so far.</li>
            <li> I am 4.5 months prego and no stretchmarks so far....</li>
            <li> I found out this was the old version, which means the cream I was putting in was probably turning into balls because it was old.</li>
            <li> At $35 or so, the price I have paid for it, that&#x27;s a big deal, considering how much of it I use.  </li>
            <li> then I probably would of had more than a few tiny stretch marks</li>
            <li> maybe I broke out due to more hormones later on, but I was definitely bummed out.  </li>
            <li> We take your safety very very seriously and go above and beyond the European and US regulations to keep you safe and sound during your pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> Belly lotions are supposed to be used fairly liberally during pregnancy, but even when I decreased the amount of product I put on my freshly showered (and dried) belly, this lotion would start to flake off!</li>
            <li> the first four are all found in citrus based essential oils such as Mandarin.  </li>
            <li> Overall decent product.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m starting to think that the cheaper and older alternative would&#x27;ve probably worked as well.</li>
            <li> I used Palmers religiously throughout my pregnancy, but decided to get something a little better quality for the last trimester.  </li>
            <li> I am definitely someone who was predestined to have stretch marks, as I have them on hips from puberty, but zero from this pregnancy, I will definitely be using on my next pregnancy, I can&#x27;t sing higher praises from this product!</li>
            <li> I was stretch mark free for 35 weeks but then began to get small purple dots on my sides around week 32...</li>
            <li> I ended up going back to my basic Aveeno everyday lotion and no stretch marks in sight with 5 more weeks to go.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use the product until my belly goes back to normal.</li>
            <li> I started applying it to my lower abdomen as the stretch marks started to appear, and the marks are noticeably less intense than the marks on my upper abdomen where the marks I got first started to appear</li>
            <li> I bought a few of these while I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different than the others in that it seems to be a looser cream and has a very strange, off-putting at first, fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have been through 3 or 4 jars so far with 6 weeks left to go (I got my first one at probably 12-14 weeks) and am about to need to order another one, so they don&#x27;t last too long (or maybe I apply too</li>
            <li> it goes, but at the risk of sounding vain, not having stretch marks is worth a little $$ to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And guess what, not a single stretch mark!!</li>
            <li> I switched to bio oil and haven&#x27;t gotten a single new stretch mark and the old ones are fading.</li>
            <li> Does not last very long either though which stinks since it smells so good!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it that long, but I hope that I can continue this pregnancy with zero to little stretch marks b/c of this product!! :)</li>
            <li> They are deep and therefore have \\&quot;textured\\&quot; my skin, but by 6 months after my daughter was born the color had completely disappeared.  </li>
            <li> Please read these through and if you have any further worries please email me directly at tanya@mamamio.com.  </li>
            <li> and I am 6 months into the second with soft tummy skin.  </li>
            <li> Long story short, I applied this stuff religiously (see exact process below) and came away from pregnancy</li>
            <li> Smells nice but useless at preventing stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I was given this as a gift from my MIL when I was about 13 weeks pregnant, and started using it with little faith because I got stretch marks from growing in puberty on my upper thighs and hips.  </li>
            <li> I received this Tummy Rub a few weeks ago and used it right away.</li>
            <li> So, if you were to break down a drop of pure Ylang Ylang Oil you would find a tiny percentage of Benzyl Benzoate within the natural componentry of the oil.    </li>
            <li> I was pretty happy with the smell and texture of the product itself, however, for the money, I was extremely disappointed that it was gone within 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it heavily for a little over a month now, and just ordered more, but I&#x27;m still getting the dreaded stretch marks, though I believe this product is reducing the severity of them, so it helps</li>
            <li> I use this product stilll , just in case along with some bio oil to help make sure my stretch marks dont get worse... but only time will tell.     </li>
            <li> She has tried several stretch mark creams/lotions during this, our first pregnancy, and this product is the hands down winner.</li>
            <li> At first i used a stretch mark butter from down to earth because i was starting to get itchy all over my abdomen.</li>
            <li> , this is much more minor issues, but I should mention: the packaging makes it difficult to squeeze out every last drop (which at this price you really want)</li>
            <li> When buying it in the tube, I had to cut the tube open to get the full use of the product, which was irritating (I wanted every last drop since I was paying so much per ounce).</li>
            <li> This product was nothing special just a thick lotion that clumped when i tried to rub it in.</li>
            <li> My expectant gf absolutely loves when I rub this on her tummy and other areas of potential skin stretching.  </li>
            <li> One other thing to note, the oil does last much longer and if you purchase the butter/cream, try and get the stuff in the jar.</li>
            <li> tub of the tummy butter, but so far, it has lasted twice as long</li>
            <li> Tried to use a cheaper product the first few months with this one</li>
            <li> decent price, compared to other websites.</li>
            <li> A little gypped on how much product I got</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s with me only applying the bio oil once a day or every other day (pretty forgetful sometimes).</li>
            <li> And when I say strong smell, I mean other people can smell it on you when you have it on.</li>
            <li> Definitely less in the tube for the same high</li>
            <li> wife is multiracial and, in general, has pretty dry skin that she keeps in check by constantly moisturizing with the usual, Dove, Eucerin, etc.</li>
            <li> and while it may be due to luck or genetics, but so far not one stretch mark.</li>
            <li> Strech marks are still growing and I am not sure if the product really have any effects on easing the development of strech marks.</li>
            <li> I bought this during my pregnancy as I was told by the salesperson that it absolutely worked miracles and after she told me some unbelievable story about how she had stretch marks and started using this product AFTER</li>
            <li> As long as I apply it daily</li>
            <li> I know it doesn&#x27;t last long &amp; is spendy, but if it prevents even one stretch mark</li>
            <li> Next time I order, I just plan to buy just the oil instead, as it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It feels very thick and nourishing, but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> used this and in a few days the skin was like new.  </li>
            <li> Ithink I spent about $200 on this cream total and had about 3/4 of a jar left over....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh and FYI, a jar will last you a single trimester.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks and used one container of this lotion, the oil this company makes, and later, plain old shea butter.</li>
            <li> So far I have no stretch marks although have a few weeks to go....  </li>
            <li> Spent over $800 dollars buying them from different vendors and applied 3 times a day</li>
            <li> I am giving it two stars because this packaging (green tube) is the old packaging.</li>
            <li> She is now 6 weeks and my stomach has completely shrunk down, and I have absolutely no stretchmarks.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t smell gross like all the other leading brands.</li>
            <li> Mio was my evening moisturizer (I used regular lotion for the day time and every other day almond oil to the tummy before an evening</li>
            <li> throughout the pregnancy and delivering an 8 lb. 4 oz little girl, I didn&#x27;t bother open the last jar and use post partum...</li>
            <li> I decided to go with the tummy rub cream first on this second pregnancy (11 weeks along) and ill keep with it until I grow and will add in oil (just for back up).  </li>
            <li> that no matter how hard you try and how much money is spent.... if you are meant to get stretch marks.... you will.</li>
            <li> I was horrified to wake up with dry, rice-sized pieces of lotion all over my belly and sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> We use it for the baby, too, for dry skin, or redness in his diaper area.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Currently, I have no new stretch marks...</li>
            <li> Our No Nasties policy applies to every single product we ever make at Mama Mio.    </li>
            <li> I did not develop one single stretch mark during my pregnancy or after.  </li>
            <li> I used this cream from month 3-9 and did not get a single stretch mark.</li>
            <li> I did not get a single stretch-mark.</li>
            <li> I had a belly, for sure...but not ONE SINGLE STRETCH MARK.  </li>
            <li> i ended up with a c section and a lot of loose dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The downside was the bottle lasted just a little more than a month, and the oil was a little hard to control, messy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty expensive though, considering the tub doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just the tub I recieved, but maybe I got an old one.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this will do anything for you if you have above average weight gain</li>
            <li> I used this for two months and used up almost the whole bottle, and I have the most horrible looking deep red/purple stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I wound up with a stomach full of stretch marks</li>
            <li> So, although  it may seem unusual to see it (And maybe even a little scary) - each of these will be a very common ingredient in many US beauty and food products - but it is not required to be included on the ingredients listings.    </li>
            <li> I bought the oil at the same time, and that bottle is still going after a month and a half.  </li>
            <li> 4oz of cream does not last very long and by the time we&#x27;re done, we&#x27;ll probably have spent close to $400 on this product considering it is recommended that you continue using it for a few months after delivery.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll only need a little bit.  </li>
            <li> After every shower (which for me was every other day), liberally apply stretch mark OIL, let dry, and then liberally apply butter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells great, but expensive!!!!</li>
            <li> Slightly expensive but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a few months and only used it about 4 times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not cheap and the bigger</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s in the genes, and partially the diet.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks until the last week, where I got a few.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not really visible anymore because they have faded over time.</li>
            <li> I mix it with really heavy vitamin e oil (32,000) and rub it on religiously morning and night...</li>
            <li> and I did get a few tiny stretch marks</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend who swore by it because she only ended up with a few stretch marks.</li>
            <li> The tube makes it harder to get to all the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not experienced any of the usual &amp;#34;itchy belly syndrome&amp;#34; that pregnant women experience.</li>
            <li> I did notice that this product dried out faster than any other cream I used that included regular coco butter.</li>
            <li> It was such a comfort for her tight, tight skin.</li>
            <li> I have heard other friends rave about them, however they broke me out into an itchy rash all over my stomach.    </li>
            <li> All of my other mommy friends cant believe it.</li>
            <li> I will also continue to buy other Mamma Mio products.</li>
            <li> She claimed to not have any stretch marks during her pregnancy due to this product.  </li>
            <li> I gained the average amount of weight expected for a pregnancy</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use a lot of other creams because the smell bothered me</li>
            <li> and i stopped because it is pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> Pretty expensive for the amount you have to use it, I used a jar a month...</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy like the other products I was using before</li>
            <li> I had some stretch marks from when I was using the other products but not since using this.</li>
            <li> and I wished I&#x27;d listened to the other reviewers instead of purchasing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because I had already gotten stretch marks in the past from weigh gain (non-pregnancy related), I knew I&#x27;d get stretch marks all over my belly during pregnancy if I didn&#x27;t do anything about it.</li>
            <li> I am 4 wks post partum, and other than having a little belly, there is not any stretch marks or loose skin...</li>
            <li> did not have a single stretchmark until about 34-ish weeks when I noticed two very small ones next to my belly button.</li>
            <li> Within a few hours it felt dry again.  </li>
            <li> So I haven&#x27;t been using it everyday since it&#x27;s kind of annoying to have a goopy stomach....</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this product when I first bought it because of the price.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, I bought 3 jars of this Mama Mio and feel like a silly girl who waste my money and who knows what is really inside this cream!  </li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;m a bit skeptical that there is really ANY stretch mark cream that is guaranteed to work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li> But, it was relatively inexpensive, so at least there&#x27;s that.</li>
            <li> I neglected to put it on my rear and upper thighs, and I got dark red stretch marks on my upper back thighs :(.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> On the down side, even with use of both the oil and the butter in the morning and night, I couldn&#x27;t seem to keep my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the oil, I am 2 weeks away from my due date and no stretch marks (knock on wood!).</li>
            <li> tummy butter absorbs quickly, is not greasy, and smells light.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I may even buy another tub even though I am not pregnant</li>
            <li> I use it once a day and went through it in a month or less.</li>
            <li> I used this for my previous pregnancy</li>
            <li> She has moved on to the jars because she feels she can actually get every last expensive drop out.  </li>
            <li> and I used it everyday and didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark!!!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not bright red</li>
            <li> Just to give you a little perspective Benzyl Benzoate makes up less than one one hundredth of a percentage point.</li>
            <li> For my 1st pregnancy, I used Palmer&#x27;s and hated it - mainly because it was really greasy, stained my clothes, and the cocoa butter smell was over powering for me.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste time with any of the other products!</li>
            <li> I gave birth to a 7lb little boy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> I became a little concerned about some of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> The amount is little</li>
            <li> I do wish it was a little cheaper though.</li>
            <li> I started using it when I had a little pooch and all the way until after I had my son.</li>
            <li> I did have 2 or 3 little ones show up about 2 weeks post partum.</li>
            <li> Other, less expensive products we&#x27;ve tried have left her skin feeling tight and almost non-skid - when I&#x27;d run my hand over the treated area, it catches like it would when rubbing an inflated balloon.</li>
            <li> The lotion is very thick and stays on almost all day or night, so I only have to apply twice a day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap</li>
            <li> This stuff makes her skin so soft, I&#x27;ve told her until it fails us, we&#x27;re not trying any others.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time buying the cheaper products.</li>
            <li> I saw some comments saying they wasted $35,</li>
            <li> (I already had gotten a few on my thighs) within a few days of switching over from Palmer&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This was definitely a waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I applied it everyday</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS A WASTE OF MONEY...</li>
            <li> but i really disliked this product and want to save people their time and money.</li>
            <li> so I will update after a few months of delivery to remark on the stretch mark</li>
            <li> Everyone told me lotions were a waste of money - if it&#x27;s in your genes, you&#x27;re screwed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> After a few days I tossed it out</li>
            <li> , I was not comfortable with its use.</li>
            <li> The oil didn&#x27;t stain my clothes but it is heavy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m still using it everyday at 27 weeks.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t appear until my last month, but alas they appeared.</li>
            <li> I KNOW that I can get stretch marks, as I have a few from my preteen growth spurt on my hips.</li>
            <li> and so I ordered it and used it almost everyday of my pregnancy</li>
            <li> The butter is very thick and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was not spared from a gazillion stretch marks, however whether it was this product or not, they were never dark.  </li>
            <li> I had one small mark when my son was born, and kept using the Mama Mio a few months after his birth.</li>
            <li> Hmm, not sure if it prevent strechmarks either.</li>
            <li> I ended up getting three small stretch marks.</li>
            <li> but there is no magic cure cream to get rid of these buggers on my belly,</li>
            <li> oh well I hear our children are worth the grief they put our bodies through.</li>
            <li> usually don&#x27;t leave reviews</li>
            <li> not sure of it&#x27;s effect yet</li>
            <li> the squeeze tube (could get everything out of it if it came in a different container, too expensive to through away some butter in the container).</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff but after using 6 of these Tummy Rub tubes, she claims it is difficult to get every last drop out of these bottles.  </li>
            <li> And as far as being itch relieving to a growing belly, it helps for a few minutes only and then your itching again :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying Bella B Tummy Honey Butter, and no stretch marks!</li>
            <li> Way too expensive for how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> I had to at least try.  </li>
            <li> But it is a slow process.</li>
            <li> Has a thick, luxurious feel.  </li>
            <li> Too thick.</li>
            <li> But this lotion felt so luscious and thick going on.</li>
            <li> how thick it is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still giving this product 3 stars though because it did work wonders against all of the other uncomfortable issues that arise from a growing belly - the burning and itching sensations that come about from the stretching skin.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s very small.</li>
            <li> It also has a subtle, soothing scent.</li>
            <li> With the other stretch mark creams I was generally disgusted by their smells and found myself scratching my itchy belly by the afternoon while Mama Mio keeps my skin soft and hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> I would wear this everyday if it was not so expensive.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, i hate to pay $35 when i see other products that do the same for $7.</li>
            <li> The lotion is very thick.</li>
            <li> The stretch marks did not listen when i said no to them with this product, but it could have been worse.</li>
            <li> With hand on heart, Mama Mio stands behind each and every product in the line for it&#x27;s safety during pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> , my mom said her stretch marks were worse when she was at my stage in pregnancy</li>
            <li> and they kept getting worse.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money for me unfortunately!</li>
            <li> Expensive product, but a very thick lotion.</li>
            <li> I did try some other things, but the smells and absorbency were annoying.</li>
            <li> At the very least, I won&#x27;t have itchy skin!</li>
            <li> it is very thick and sticky!</li>
            <li> I still got marks and am very unhappy that I wasted $35 on this cream.</li>
            <li> Hard to spread and smells bad.</li>
            <li> I bought the tube for the boobs and did not work, I got stretch marks over my boobs, but i did not apply it twice per day as recomende and it was too expensive</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t so darn expensive, she&#x27;d use it every day for the rest of her life.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this product could prove  me wrong that it is  based on genetics...</li>
            <li> Sad thing is that the price of it keeps going up.</li>
            <li> &quot; I was wrong after delivery</li>
            <li> Unfortunately if stretch marks are genetics, odds are that you will get them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I started getting them all over my hips</li>
            <li> Sadly it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> and I was so sad I did not find this lotion</li>
            <li> I used this product 3 times a day, unfortunately it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> You still can feel it on your skin when you shower the next day, but it&#x27;s not greasy or nasty.</li>
            <li> Only thing- wish it was unscented, but scent isn&#x27;t terrible.</li>
            <li> It was an expensive, yet unsuccessful attempt at staying stretch mark free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think is very expensive and doesn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li> but I received the squeeze tube instead which I do not like because it is impossible to get all the lotion out of that container.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have too bad of stretch marks, but I did have some.</li>
            <li> Everything said i should expect them, and BAD.  </li>
            <li> but nothing too bad</li>
            <li> Never made me sick.</li>
            <li> came in when Boom I got plenty of stretch marks around my lower belly and even on my sides :(  </li>
            <li> I bought my 1st tub at $28 and now it&#x27;s $35. :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that it was not received as ordered.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I just wish is wasn&#x27;t so dang expensive!!</li>
            <li> I hate the smell and it never worked.</li>
            <li> My mother and all of my aunts had awful stretch marks through out their pregnancies</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible and this cream does not hydrate the skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent lotion. I had virtually no stretch marks after a 10lb baby.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my doctor and I can say it totally works. Thanks so much Mama Mio!</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a sample at a maternity store and felt in love. So i bought more;  I am in my third one now. It is expensive, i hate to pay $35 when i see other products that do the same for $7. I haven&#x27;t tried the other products simply because i loved this one. It smells really good. I apply it every day, morning and night, and had not stretch marks at all, I am 7 months now. I bought the tube for the boobs and did not work, I got stretch marks over my boobs, but i did not apply it twice per day as recomende and it was too expensive</li>
            <li> I knew before I went into my pregnancy that I didn&#x27;t have much hope of emerging stretch mark free - I got stretch marks growing up just from growing, and both of my parents are cursed with them.  Because of this I faithfully applied lotions and creams, including this one, several times a day for my whole pregnancy.  Unfortunately, I was not spared from a gazillion stretch marks, however whether it was this product or not, they were never dark.  Even at the end of my pregnancy they were only a light pink.  They are deep and therefore have \\&quot;textured\\&quot; my skin, but by 6 months after my daughter was born the color had completely disappeared.  The stretch marks did not listen when i said no to them with this product, but it could have been worse.</li>
            <li> The cream is AMAZING!! It was recommended to me by my cousins when I first got pregnant and now I can&#x27;t go a day without wearing it! I think it&#x27;s so great that I just bought my 2nd jar. It&#x27;s not cheap so I obviously really love the product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading many reviews.  For some reason I never paid much attention to any that remarked about the scent.  When you first put it on it smells like citrus peels (orange mixed with lemon) or lemon starburst.  After its had a while to soak in to my skin I feel like I have a teenage boy following me around.  Smells very musky and makes me want to remove it.  If I was still had morning sickness I do not think I could use it.  I do like how it absorbs fast in to my skin and makes it feel really soft.  The butter is very thick and a little goes a long way but it doesn&#x27;t seem to clog my pores.  I use the stretch mark oil with this at the same time.  I hope I can get use to the smell because I do love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> This product was not for me. I have heard other friends rave about them, however they broke me out into an itchy rash all over my stomach.    I ended up going back to my basic Aveeno everyday lotion and no stretch marks in sight with 5 more weeks to go.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for all new or expecting moms if they can afford. @ about $40 it is a bit pricey, but it really worked for me. I missed some spots during pregnancy where I got stretch marks, but wherever I applied this product, I didn&#x27;t have any marks. The stretch marks have diminished as I used it after delivery. But it is a slow process. You want to be loyal to it and apply it regularly through out the pregnancy and afterwards as well for many months ( as long as the marks are visible) I think its the same with any stretch marks product.</li>
            <li> AUTHOR&#x27;S NOTE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First let me preface this review by stating that stetch marks during pregnancy are most likely not preventable for those women who happen to develop them. People&#x27;s skin types are very different. Some skin types can handle the stretching of pregnancy, some can&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t believe that any non-invasive product can protect from a genetic predisposition and that&#x27;s certainly why none of these treatments and creams offer any kind of guarantees against the dreaded marks. So even though my 23 weeks pregnant wife, who is showing quite a bit, has been using this product for a while now and does not yet have any stretch marks (knock on wood), I will not base this review on its effectiveness in prevention of the marks, but rather on its other qualities such as its moisturization properties and scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is multiracial and, in general, has pretty dry skin that she keeps in check by constantly moisturizing with the usual, Dove, Eucerin, etc. She has tried several stretch mark creams/lotions during this, our first pregnancy, and this product is the hands down winner. It&#x27;s different than the others in that it seems to be a looser cream and has a very strange, off-putting at first, fragrance. I&#x27;d describe the scent as citrus and/or pine floor cleaner mixed with diapers fresh out of the package. I know that doesn&#x27;t sound great, but this stuff has kept her skin incredibly soft. It absorbs into the skin very quickly and there isn&#x27;t much of a residue left. I don&#x27;t even mind putting it on for her because its absorbancy doesn&#x27;t leave my fingers and hands feeling greasy for long, like most other lotions she uses. If it wasn&#x27;t so darn expensive, she&#x27;d use it every day for the rest of her life. Other, less expensive products we&#x27;ve tried have left her skin feeling tight and almost non-skid - when I&#x27;d run my hand over the treated area, it catches like it would when rubbing an inflated balloon. This stuff makes her skin so soft, I&#x27;ve told her until it fails us, we&#x27;re not trying any others. Yes, we recommend this product to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;So if it&#x27;s so great, why only four stars?\\&quot; you ask? Price. We&#x27;re going to keep buying it because it&#x27;s the best moisturizer we&#x27;ve tried and (again, knock on wood) so far it&#x27;s supposedly doing its job preventing stetch marks and has given us no reason to doubt its claims. But that doesn&#x27;t spare it from losing a star for lack of value. Like most pregnancy and baby related products, the price seems grossly inflated. 4oz of cream does not last very long and by the time we&#x27;re done, we&#x27;ll probably have spent close to $400 on this product considering it is recommended that you continue using it for a few months after delivery. I guess in the end, it&#x27;s cheaper than a tummy tuck.</li>
            <li> I was pregnant or breast feeding for 4 years. I used Mama Mio&#x27;s Tummy Oil ALL THROUGH my pregnancies. It was one of their very first products. My last two children are going off to college next year and I DON&#x27;T HAVE ONE STRETCH MARK!!! Not even a tiny one. Nothing. My skin is clean and gorgeous and not crepey at all. My 62 year old husband tells me how great I look all the time. At my age, it makes me very happy. Thank goodness I used Mama Mio.&lt;br /&gt;I am a walking testimony.&lt;br /&gt;Now I use Boob Tube and I LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love YOU Mama Mio!&lt;br /&gt;xox Bobbi</li>
            <li> I used palmer&#x27;s Organic (higher concentation of cocoa butter) cocoa butter for stretch marks with each of my pregnancies from the moment I found out I was pregnant until the day each were born.  I did not develop any stretch marks, however, I still experienced a good deal of itchiness, particularly in the 3rd trimester.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for this pregnancy I traded up to the Tummy Rub and I&#x27;m SOOOO glad I did!! As long as I apply it daily I have not had any itchiness on my bellie!! It&#x27;s heavier and creamier than Palmers and rubs on like a lux lotion! The smell is light and pleasant which was a concern for me because I can get migraines from smells and am extra sensitive to it when I&#x27;m pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Presently I&#x27;m 37 weeks, my bellie measures 35\\&quot; around (I was petite to begin with) with no signs of stretch marks at all...I&#x27;ll try and remember to update this after baby is born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product!! It&#x27;s more than worth the price tag, and I tend to be on the thrifty side!</li>
            <li> This worked great and it smelled nice, but it didn&#x27;t last long.  I think it lasted about a month using it every day from my chest to my thighs.  You&#x27;ll only need a little bit.  The consistency reminds me of Crisco, only thicker.  I bought the oil at the same time, and that bottle is still going after a month and a half.  I also like the way the oil feels on my skin much better.  I use the oil in the morning to get a nice glow on my skin and I still feel moisturized by the end of the day.  When I need to buy more Mama Mio, I&#x27;m going to buy the oil instead of the tummy butter.  If you prefer the texture of the cream, it will work great for you, but just plan on spending more to get more.</li>
            <li> I was pretty happy with the smell and texture of the product itself, however, for the money, I was extremely disappointed that it was gone within 3 weeks! I only used it once a day and occassionally a second time at night. Way too expensive for how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I has a great texture and scent. It completely absorbs into your skin with no greasy feeling. I am 20 weeks pregnant and so far, no stretch marks on my bust or tummy. My skin feels great. Slightly expensive but totally worth it. Don&#x27;t waste your time buying the cheaper products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different products to combat skin drying and stretching on my pregnant belly, and this is one of the best.  The lotion is very thick and stays on almost all day or night, so I only have to apply twice a day.  I&#x27;ve noticed a definite reduction in itchiness.  It&#x27;s too soon to say if this product works to combat stretch marks.  Apparently, those are more related to genetics than to product use anyway.  Stretch marks or no, this product has made my pregnancy more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Ladies, there is no miracle cream -- if your mother had stretch marks, you&#x27;ll probably get them too!  That being said, if you want a nice-smelling belly cream that has NO greasy after-feel, or if you just want something to moisturize your belly so it&#x27;s not so itchy, this is a nice product.  It&#x27;s pretty expensive though, considering the tub doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  I&#x27;d rather spend $3 on Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter lotion and put up with the greasiness, because it moisturizes just as well at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I used this product throughout my pregnancy. A week after delivery my tummy has no stretch marks! I will continue to use the product until my belly goes back to normal.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this product when I first bought it because of the price. After a lot of research this seemed to be what people thought was the best anti stretch mark cream for pregnancy. I started using around 12 weeks about 2- 3 times a day. Towards the end I used in combination with an oil bar from Lush. I love how it feels on  my skin, it absorbs right away and feels amazing! My mother and all of my aunts had awful stretch marks through out their pregnancies so I was convinced I was doomed too. I weighed 112 at the beginning of my pregnancy and 152 by the end. I gave birth to a 7lb little boy. And guess what, not a single stretch mark!! My stomach also when back to normal about 2 weeks postpartum and my skin looks great! All of my other mommy friends cant believe it. I will definitely be buying this for friends when they become pregnant. I recommend this product to any one who will listen. I had to buy three containers during my pregnancy, well worth every penny!! I will also continue to buy other Mamma Mio products.</li>
            <li> I used this product  as directed, once in the morning and at night. It did not work at all. I still got marks and am very unhappy that I wasted $35 on this cream. I would not recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> Dear Amazon Customers  We understand the pressures that go along with making tiny miracles.  Pregnancy is a time when you have to be so very careful because you are taking care of both you and your beautiful baby.  We are very proud of our safety standards at Mama Mio.  We take your safety very very seriously and go above and beyond the European and US regulations to keep you safe and sound during your pregnancy.  We produce all of our products in The US in an FDA-approved lab which maintains the highest of safety standards.  We felt it is important to have a &#x27;No Nasties&#x27; policy which clearly states our policy on ingredients (no Parabens, No Petrolatum, No Colours, No synthetic Fragrance, No Sulphates, zenoestrogen, or pthalates).  Our No Nasties policy applies to every single product we ever make at Mama Mio.    Because we care so much, we wanted to address each of the ingredient concerns expressed in the one star amazon customer review individually. Please read these through and if you have any further worries please email me directly at tanya@mamamio.com.  With hand on heart, Mama Mio stands behind each and every product in the line for it&#x27;s safety during pregnancy.  I would also like to add that our oils always have a much shorter ingredient list than creams.  So if you are looking for the purest formulas, you will find our Tummy Rub Oil to have less ingredients than our Tummy Rub Butter although both are equally wonderful at taking great care of your skin throughout your pregnancy.  And finally, if you are reading this I am assuming that we should also be saying Congratulations!  Kind Regards  Tanya Mackay  Founding Partner   Mama MIo Skincare  Limonene, Linalool, Citral, Citronellol, Benzyl Benzoate - are all found in the pure, pregnancy-safe essential oils we use in Mama Mio.  the first four are all found in citrus based essential oils such as Mandarin.  The last one is found in Ylang Ylang oil, which is included in our beautiful Gravida (which means Pregnancy in latin) fragrance.  We do not add these ingredients in separately - they exist within the oils naturally.  So, if you were to break down a drop of pure Ylang Ylang Oil you would find a tiny percentage of Benzyl Benzoate within the natural componentry of the oil.    We are required by European law to list it in our ingredients, it is not a requirement of US regulations. So, although  it may seem unusual to see it (And maybe even a little scary) - each of these will be a very common ingredient in many US beauty and food products - but it is not required to be included on the ingredients listings.    Just to give you a little perspective Benzyl Benzoate makes up less than one one hundredth of a percentage point. It is %.007 of Tummy Rub.  Polysorbate 80 is used as an emulsifier in foods, particularly in ice cream, and in creams. It is vegetable derived ingredient that helps bind oil and water together and keep them from separating.  Ceteareth-20  is an emulsifier used in oil-in-water emulsions.  Ours is extremely pure and It is derived from coconut oil.  PEG-100 Stearate - Derived from palm oil this is a water-soluble ester - used as a thickener and emulsifier.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I haven&#x27;t seen a single stretch mark on my body and I&#x27;m now 8months pregnant and it doesn&#x27;t smell gross like all the other leading brands.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the oil, I am 2 weeks away from my due date and no stretch marks (knock on wood!). Kind of pricey and the bigger you get the more you use but well worth it. Smells nice and feels great on the skin. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple weeks so not sure how good it is. I do like that it&#x27;s not greasy. I&#x27;ve been using the Mama Mio tummy rub stretch mark oil as well for a couple months &amp; I have to say I like it better. I will be ordering another bottle.</li>
            <li> Just had my baby 3 weeks ago. I used this SC nice week 22 of pregnancy and no stretch marks or itching.</li>
            <li> Strech marks are still growing and I am not sure if the product really have any effects on easing the development of strech marks.</li>
            <li> My friend used it during pregnancy and she has no stretch mark, she said it really works. I ordered one recently and hope it will work for me.</li>
            <li> I used this with my 1st pregnancy and it did wonders for my itchy belly, my OB said I had the softest pregnant belly she had ever seen.  I only gained 16 lbs during my pregnancy, but unfortionally I still got stretch marks in the last month.  I&#x27;m totally going to use it with this pregnancy, like I said it was fantastic on my itchy skin...no cream can prevent stretch marks, but this one def. did the job with itchy skin!</li>
            <li> It worked on me, i didn&#x27;t get any stretch mark. I had my baby girl on end of July 2011 and she weighted 9lb 2 ozs, I gained almost 50 lbs. I am not big, i am 5&#x27;3\\&quot; and about 115 lb before i got pregnant.  I started to use it the moment I found out I was pregnant. For my whole pregnancy, i used up 4 jars. I saw some comments saying they wasted $35, no wonder it didn&#x27;t work on them cuz you have to rub the cream around the whole belly, one jar can&#x27;t be used for your whole pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel oily. I don&#x27;t break out. My skin stays soft. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is pricy but effective. Smells and fells good. Helped with the existing strech marks and the prevention of new ones. I  Love it!</li>
            <li> Am really loving this stretch mark cream so far.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week (am 6 months pregnant, no marks yet), so I can&#x27;t comment on its long-term effectiveness, but it has a wonderful smell and absorbs well into the skin.  Much nicer smell than anything else I&#x27;ve tried - only the Basq belly butter can compare.  Has a thick, luxurious feel.  Would definitely buy again, although I think I&#x27;ll try alternating this in the morning and the Stretch Mark Oil at night now that I&#x27;m getting into the third trimester.</li>
            <li> I used Palmers religiously throughout my pregnancy, but decided to get something a little better quality for the last trimester.  I chose Mama Mio Tummy Rub Stretch Mark Oil and Butter because of all the great reviews I&#x27;ve read.  On the plus side, it smells really nice. My husband really disliked the smell of Palmer&#x27;s, and said this one was way better. On the down side, even with use of both the oil and the butter in the morning and night, I couldn&#x27;t seem to keep my skin hydrated. Within a few hours it felt dry again.  I got my first stretch mark on my belly (I already had gotten a few on my thighs) within a few days of switching over from Palmer&#x27;s. My doctor told me no cream in the world is going to prevent them if they&#x27;re in your genes, so it might not be Mama Mio&#x27;s fault.  Mama Mio is quite expensive though, for a product that doesn&#x27;t work any better than the cheap options (Palmer&#x27;s is about $6/bottle, Mama Mio oil and butter came to $70). The oil and butter both lasted me about 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> When I got this in the mail I was so excited. From what I heard from reviews on YouTube the scent is supposed to be really good, but when I took a whiff of this cream/butter it did not please me at all. Actually make me kind of nautious. That just might be my hormones though. The consistency is not creamy at all. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just the tub I recieved, but maybe I got an old one. Hmm, not sure if it prevent strechmarks either. I&#x27;m only 2 months in and it might be too soon to tell. The smell just prevents me from even wanting to use this.</li>
            <li> Too thick. Hard to spread and smells bad.</li>
            <li> I was convinced this product worked and hoped to give GREAT reviews on it.... but I am not 100% happy with it.   I was stretch mark free for 35 weeks but then began to get small purple dots on my sides around week 32... finally by week 35 they formed into stretch marks on BOTH my side hips. I guess for now, i am currently almost 37 weeks, i can say i am lucky because I have no stretch marks on my stomach or anywwhere else but is mamma mio really the reason for that?   I was hoping this product could prove  me wrong that it is  based on genetics... but i believe NOW that no matter how hard you try and how much money is spent.... if you are meant to get stretch marks.... you will. I use this product stilll , just in case along with some bio oil to help make sure my stretch marks dont get worse... but only time will tell.     On a good note.... it does smell very good and leaves your skin so soft and mosturized!</li>
            <li> it smells good is the only thing i can come up with.</li>
            <li> First off, I have to say that I was lucky not to get any stretchmarks. I started using Mama Mio at 20 weeks and am just wrapping up week 39.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attribute the lack of stretchmarks (which do run in my family) to a combination of moderate weight gain (I started with some extra cushion), hydration, exercise, AND routine moisturizing of the belly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mama Mio was my evening moisturizer (I used regular lotion for the day time and every other day almond oil to the tummy before an evening shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say for sure that Mama Mio was the trick to all this, but I&#x27;m sure it played a role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond the stretchmark issue, it was my husband who applied this each night. It was a great time to chat, relax and bond as a family. I think I valued that more than the lotion itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True, for $35 it is on the pricey side. And, the bigger your belly gets, the shorter it lasts. I purchased three of these during the nearly 20 weeks I used it. But I do like the way it feels and smells...I did try some other things, but the smells and absorbency were annoying.</li>
            <li> I am in my third trimester and have used different lotions, oils etc to relieve belly itching and hopefully delay/reduce stretch marks.  This butter is by far the BEST I have found - smells great, no nasties, doesn&#x27;t get on clothes and it is super moisturizing so bye-bye itching!!  So far I have no stretch marks although have a few weeks to go....  The doctor commented on how nice my stomach looked so I plan to keep it up and hope for the best.</li>
            <li> The butter goes on really smooth, soaks in pretty quickly, and does not upset my supersensitive very dry skin (no small feat in my world). I have had this for a few months and only used it about 4 times. I love the feel but the smell makes me nauseous. My husband thinks it smells good but my pregnant \\&quot;supernose\\&quot; cannot handle it. I even waited until my 2nd trimester to see if it would grow on me but no luck.</li>
            <li> This was definitely a waste of money. Everyone told me I was probably going to get stretch marks as my mother did, but I was convinced if I found a good cream I wouldnt. I used this for two months and used up almost the whole bottle, and I have the most horrible looking deep red/purple stretch marks. This did not work one bit, maybe it moisturized my skin a bit. The interesting thing is I dont have any marks on my stomach - just thighs, butt, and boobs - i think this goes to show that if your prone to get them, you will. To all those lucky ppl out there who didnt get any after using this cream, I bet they wouldnt of gotten any even if they havent used it. Save your money! With a baby on the way there are many more uses for it!</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a family member when I was pregnant with my son two years ago.  I used it starting about halfway through - twice a day - and I have no stretchmarks.  It was probably a combination of things, lots of water, I didn&#x27;t gain too much or too fast, etc, however, I was a likely candidate for them because my mom (and lots of relatives) have them.  I already had (have!) some on my chest and hips from my teen years!  Currently pregnant with #2 and plan to use again.  It&#x27;s definitely not cheap and the bigger you get the faster it goes, but at the risk of sounding vain, not having stretch marks is worth a little $$ to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Figured I should update this. I had baby #3 three months ago and I have zero stretch marks from my pregnancies. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I used this cream every day since the beginning of my 2nd trimester (needed 2 tubs total), and really liked it. Now I have a beautiful 4 week old son and no stretch marks. However, stretch marks are supposed to be genetic, so I don&#x27;t know if I was not going to get them anyway. Either way, I enjoyed using the cream, it kept my skin nice and soft and it helped with the uncomfortable itchy feeling due to stretching of the skin.</li>
            <li> Great! Not a fan of the smell</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as recommended by my friend who gained 40+ lbs. during her pregnancy.  She claimed to not have any stretch marks during her pregnancy due to this product.  I figure, if this product worked for her, then maybe it can for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was helpful in minimizing the itch that come along with stretching, but it did NOT prevent stretch marks.  No product out there can prevent stretch marks....it&#x27;s in the genes, and partially the diet.  I was being hopeful with this product...expecting a miracle.  LOL!  Well, that hope lead to wasting all that $$$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased 3 jars of this to last me the last 5.5 months of my pregnancy (when I noticed the first sign of a stretch mark).  Product smells nice and helps keeping skin moisturized, but that&#x27;s pretty much all it can do.  Gaining just 26 lbs. throughout the pregnancy and delivering an 8 lb. 4 oz little girl, I didn&#x27;t bother open the last jar and use post partum...I just re-sold it online.</li>
            <li> As a medical professional I can tell you there is nothing that will really prevent stretch marks from occurring. They are genetic, and some people are just luckier than others. That being said, keeping your skin moisturized DOES help your skin feel better while it is stretching and growing. This cream had a pleasant smell, and no greasy after-feeling at all. It kept the itchies away and I used it probably from month 4-9 of my pregnancy. I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks until the last week, where I got a few. I have used it a bit afterward and they have mostly faded (I&#x27;m 4 mos postpartum). It&#x27;s not a miracle cream, there just isn&#x27;t one out there because it&#x27;s not possible. However, it&#x27;s a nice indulgence and it hydrates well with great ingredients.</li>
            <li> so far so good, ive used it since 3 months and im now over 7 months and no stretch marks. i am already out of it (i apply 2x&#x27;s daily) so i need one more jar. the consistency is great and its thick. it has a citrus scent which is not my favorite right now (especialy since i started with Cocoa butter first)but i can deal with it if this product helps not give me stretch marks.  UPDATE: i have since given birth and my child is now 2 months old....and...i got 1 tiny stretch mark on my bellybutton but that was because i kept my metal ring in the whole time so my fault. But this stuff was amazing! and i must say..my mother has a lot of stretch marks so i thought i was doomed. im VERY happy.</li>
            <li> Okay .... I know this product has a good rating and it seems to be working for some pp but not for me!  I&#x27;ve start using it since I was 8 weeks pregnant and I applied it everyday and I was fine till my 28th weeks of pregnancy came in when Boom I got plenty of stretch marks around my lower belly and even on my sides :(  I gained 1Lb per week during my pregnancy, and my doctor said I am a fine and healthy pregnant women and no creams will help a women if you have the gene and hormone to produce the damn stretch mark!  Anyhow, I bought 3 jars of this Mama Mio and feel like a silly girl who waste my money and who knows what is really inside this cream!  So bottom line, do not buy it ... if you really wanna care for yourself just apply olive oil/almond oil.  Good Luck &amp; do nt be foooooool.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream! During my first pregnancy my friend who worked at a maternity store, gave me this product and I used it everyday and didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark!!! Also I LOVED the smell, it didn&#x27;t make me nausea like the coco butter. Now I am pregnant with my second child and I will be using this cream again!!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and feels great. It does a nice job moisturizing! I still have a couple months to go, but no stretch marks yet!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!!! I would wear this everyday if it was not so expensive. I ended up getting three small stretch marks. But this lotion felt so luscious and thick going on. I ended up buying two tubes of it.</li>
            <li> I started to use this tummy butter at the very beginning of my pregnancy and added the tummy rub oil to tummy care routine around 21 weeks.  I love this butter.  It smells nice and is easy to be absorbed.  I am now 29 weeks pregnant and I don&#x27;t see any sign of stretch mark.  I would definitely recommend this to those who in search of a good stretch mark prevention cream.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my friend recommended it during her pregnancy and swears by it. I am on my 2nd tub of it and I like the smell and how thick it is. I haven&#x27;t had any stretch marks as of yet and I&#x27;m entering my 7th month. Sad thing is that the price of it keeps going up. I bought my 1st tub at $28 and now it&#x27;s $35. :(</li>
            <li> This butter is great, it melts in your skin, doesn&#x27;t layer on and feel sticky like cocoa butter or other creams. I started getting my stretch marks when I was around 6 months pregnant, then my friend recommended this to me. I&#x27;ve been using it heavily for a little over a month now, and just ordered more, but I&#x27;m still getting the dreaded stretch marks, though I believe this product is reducing the severity of them, so it helps but there is no magic cure cream to get rid of these buggers on my belly, oh well I hear our children are worth the grief they put our bodies through. Good luck to the rest of you I really like this product though, my mom said her stretch marks were worse when she was at my stage in pregnancy so I&#x27;m sure this stuff is helping a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit: I am about 5 months post partum my one child and this butter definately helped. I started applying it to my lower abdomen as the stretch marks started to appear, and the marks are noticeably less intense than the marks on my upper abdomen where the marks I got first started to appear and I didn&#x27;t have the chance to apply this product to before hand. So, i&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> At first i used a stretch mark butter from down to earth because i was starting to get itchy all over my abdomen. it was so oily and only provided mild relief. I switched to Mama Mio and the next day the itching stopped. The Mama Mio Tummy rub doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky/oily feeling after applying. the smell isn&#x27;t offensive which is a plus. i&#x27;m in my second trimester and so far haven&#x27;t noticed any stretch marks.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS A WASTE OF MONEY...&lt;br /&gt;I usually don&#x27;t leave reviews but i really disliked this product and want to save people their time and money. This product was nothing special just a thick lotion that clumped when i tried to rub it in. And as far as being itch relieving to a growing belly, it helps for a few minutes only and then your itching again :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying Bella B Tummy Honey Butter, and no stretch marks! I HIGHLY recommend it instead... works great and is at a reasonable price unlike Mama Mio tummy rub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good luck with the choice u make!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and highly recommends it. You may want to order 4 pieces for the entire pregnancy period and avoid paying for shipment more than once.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 17 weeks along in my pregnancy and have been using this in conjunction with the oil, twice a day.  I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks yet, but the true test of time will be at the end of 40 weeks!  So far so good.</li>
            <li> Expensive product, but a very thick lotion. I only purchased one tube while pregnant, I can&#x27;t really say whether it helped with stretch marks or not since I used a regular daily moisturizer once this ran out.</li>
            <li> I bought this during my pregnancy as I was told by the salesperson that it absolutely worked miracles and after she told me some unbelievable story about how she had stretch marks and started using this product AFTER and her stretch marks faded. I was a little weary since $35 is kind of a lot of money to spend on a small bottle of cream, I went against my better judgement and bought it anyways. I used it through out my whole pregnancy, I went through 2 jars. I gained the average amount of weight expected for a pregnancy and I moisturized, moisturized, moisturized to hopefully escape the stretch-mark fate that comes with pregnancy and genetics. My belly wasn&#x27;t outrageously huge, in fact, I had a pretty small belly throughout the duration of my pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not have a single stretchmark until about 34-ish weeks when I noticed two very small ones next to my belly button. I thought, &#x27;great, as long as it&#x27;s two, thats fine.\\&quot; I was wrong after delivery I looked like a Los Angeles street map. Religiously using this product, even AFTER pregnancy, did not prevent the occurance of stretch marks. Unfortunately if stretch marks are genetics, odds are that you will get them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t write this product off completely because it did keep me very well moisturized and it smells fabulous. It just didn&#x27;t do what it claims it is supposed to do. If you want a pregnancy safe, grest-smelling, moisturizer, then this is the product for you. Just don&#x27;t buy into the sales pitch that you will escape pregnancy road-map free.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I first heard of the brand on a recent episode of Keeping up with the Kardashian&#x27;s and I lived up to they hype from pregnant Kim!  Only downside is quantity received for the cost is off but I&#x27;ll probably buy again.</li>
            <li> Just when you think this stuff is based on just marketing hype you actually use the product and notice the difference.  My expectant gf absolutely loves when I rub this on her tummy and other areas of potential skin stretching.  It just may be the penultimate highlight of the night (grin) It smells great and leaves the skin feeling absolutely buttery.  It it can ward off stretch marks it&#x27;ll deserve the 5 blue stars i&#x27;ve given it.</li>
            <li> So far so good!  No stretch marks here...but I&#x27;m only on my 19th week.  The product is very goopy though and doesn&#x27;t absorb into your skin...still sticky the next day even.  So I haven&#x27;t been using it everyday since it&#x27;s kind of annoying to have a goopy stomach....instead I just use a heavy moisturizing lotion most of the time.  Smells pretty good and its nice to know it has nothing in it that can hurt the baby.  Overall decent product.</li>
            <li> I use the tummy butter with the tummy oil from Mama Mio for my 2nd pregnancy. For my 1st pregnancy, I used Palmer&#x27;s and hated it - mainly because it was really greasy, stained my clothes, and the cocoa butter smell was over powering for me.&lt;br /&gt;The tummy butter absorbs quickly, is not greasy, and smells light.&lt;br /&gt;I am midway through my pregnancy so I will update after a few months of delivery to remark on the stretch mark prevention.&lt;br /&gt;Currently, I have no new stretch marks...</li>
            <li> smells good, works well- I have no stretchmarks, so either its all me or this helped a lot.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone even to just replace lotion.  Not greasy- really smooth and makes a difference on the skin.</li>
            <li> I just absolutely love this cream. From the moment I found out that I was pregnant, I used regular cocoa butter cream. Then someone at a maternity store told me about this cream. I was 3-months pregnant with twins and I immediately started using this cream. I used it every day. I also used the oil toward the end of the pregnancy. Although stretch marks run in my my family, I do not have 1 stretch mark. Go figure. I use the cream now as I am still losing baby weight, and I love the smell of it. It takes me back to my pregnancy days.</li>
            <li> I am currently 33 weeks pregnant and so far (fingers crossed) no stretch marks! I bought this product because of all of the great reviews. I have been through 3 or 4 jars so far with 6 weeks left to go (I got my first one at probably 12-14 weeks) and am about to need to order another one, so they don&#x27;t last too long (or maybe I apply too liberally)...BUT if I do make it through my pregnancy without stretch marks then it is well worth the money to me! Too soon to tell for sure, but great product so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mama Mio Tummy Rub throughout my entire pregnancy.  It feels so good when you put it on and I feel like it really does moisturize my belly and chest area.  The smell is nice and calming, I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of some of the cocoa butter products out there.  My skin is moisturized, hasn&#x27;t discolored, hasn&#x27;t itched, and I haven&#x27;t experienced any stretch marks.  I just recently started using the oil with this product in my 7th month and am very happy with both!</li>
            <li> I bought a few of these while I was pregnant. I loved the texture and the scent of this belly cream. The jury is still out on whether it works or not. I didn&#x27;t have too bad of stretch marks, but I did have some. They&#x27;re not really visible anymore because they have faded over time. It&#x27;s worth a shot, it&#x27;s nicely packaged and I enjoyed using it. Though I&#x27;m a bit skeptical that there is really ANY stretch mark cream that is guaranteed to work. I think mostly stretch marks are due to genetics, and how much weight you gain (too much, too fast). I&#x27;d consider using again for baby number two.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, and to be fair, I will say that out of the 5 preventative stretch mark creams I tried, I didn&#x27;t find this one to be any better or worse at preventing stretch marks. At the end of the day these types of lotions help with preventing or treating stretch-related itchiness, but if you&#x27;re like me and you are genetically predisposed to getting stretch marks, then nothing is really going to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big pro:&lt;br /&gt;Has a really nice consistency to the touch, and a mild, pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The huge cons:&lt;br /&gt;IT DOESN&amp;#34;T ABSORB! Belly lotions are supposed to be used fairly liberally during pregnancy, but even when I decreased the amount of product I put on my freshly showered (and dried) belly, this lotion would start to flake off! I was horrified to wake up with dry, rice-sized pieces of lotion all over my belly and sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is much more minor issues, but I should mention: the packaging makes it difficult to squeeze out every last drop (which at this price you really want)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since my 4th month of pregnancy (i&#x27;m 30 weeks now) and I love it! It&#x27;s no greasy or sticky at all, the citric fragrance is perfect and most important.....it works! I don&#x27;t have any stretch mark so far. I have marks from my adolescent years, so I know I can easily develop them. I tried first the Bella B tummy honey butter, but it was too sticky and it did&#x27;t absorb, so all my clothes got it instead of my skin. So I definitively recommend the Mama Mio products.</li>
            <li> I started with the Mama Mio oil and loved it so much I had to try the belly butter.  It&#x27;s wonderful.  Smells great and absorbs really well.  On days when I really want to make my belly soft I use the oil followed by the belly butter.  I&#x27;ve tried several on the market and this is the best.  Wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey...but that&#x27;s my only beef with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been worried about stretch marks because my mom has them extensively and they are largely genetic.  Everyone told me lotions were a waste of money - if it&#x27;s in your genes, you&#x27;re screwed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I had to at least try.  So I did my research, found Mama Mio and used it daily from 12 weeks until delivery.  I delivered at 40 weeks, gained 42 lbs and have ZERO stretch marks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I am ready for baby #2 I will immediately purchase a 9 month supply of this lotion.  I consider it my miracle worker.</li>
            <li> I received this Tummy Rub a few weeks ago and used it right away. Currently I am seventeen weeks pregnant and started showing around nine weeks. It makes my skin so soft all day and has a delicious scent. I would recommend this to any pregnant mommas and it would also be a great gift for an expectant mother. My husband loves it too. I am already hoping to order another batch in case this runs out.</li>
            <li> Love this!  I continued using it years after my child.  I love the results, feel, and smell of this lotion.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but expensive!!!! Makes my tummy feel so moisturized! Does not last very long either though which stinks since it smells so good!</li>
            <li> i got this cream based on a recommendation from a friend and it is great.  Very thick and smells great.  i am on my second tub and am in my 7th month of pregnancy.  I dont have any stretch marks yet, but am waiting to see after baby is born.  I use it mostly on my belly and chest and lower back.  I use regular cream elsewhere.  definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update - post baby:  i am using this post baby and it has been great.  i ended up with a c section and a lot of loose dry skin.  used this and in a few days the skin was like new.  definitely worth the money - my skin is doing so much bette.r</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different belly creams and stretch mark prevention products and this is by far my favorite. It&#x27;s a little pricey but I figure it&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;m currently pregnant w/ twins and rub this in every night and most mornings. I also use the belly oil. It smells great and absorbs quickly. No greasy feeling. I&#x27;m almost 8 months and have no stretch marks so far (knock on wood).</li>
            <li> I used Vaseline as an alternative and found the same results. This product is pricey and felt that vaseline was a better contender. I did avoid stretch marks...</li>
            <li> I heard so much about this product that I bought it. It didn&#x27;t seem to be anything special and I went back to using my Palmer&#x27;s coco butter which is much more reasonably priced. So I advise all you future Mom&#x27;s to save the $.</li>
            <li> this lotion smelled really good, and it soothed my itchy skin as it stretched. will use again when pregnant with baby number 2.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff!! I highly recommend this product for expectant mothers experiencing the itches of a growing belly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks during my pregnancy so I think this cream is great!  The cream rubs in quickly and smells good.  I was very sensitive to smells when I was pregnant since I was constantly nauseous.  I couldn&#x27;t use a lot of other creams because the smell bothered me but this one actually smelled good.</li>
            <li> I bought this with high hopes. I applied it religiously hoping to avoid stretch marks. Unfortunately I started getting them all over my hips and this wasn&#x27;t helping. I was  going through it pretty quickly and it&#x27;s not super cheap. I also had a really itchy belly. I switched to bio oil and haven&#x27;t gotten a single new stretch mark and the old ones are fading. And that&#x27;s with me only applying the bio oil once a day or every other day (pretty forgetful sometimes). With the Mama Mio I did apply it twice per day every day as directed, and sometimes a bit more if I was dry. Also, since switching my itchy belly and skin sensitivity are gone. The bio oil also lasts way longer. My advice, save your money and go buy bio oil instead.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have ordered it numerous times before. The reason for the one star rating this time is because I ordered the lotion in the tub, as shown but I received the squeeze tube instead which I do not like because it is impossible to get all the lotion out of that container. I was disappointed that it was not received as ordered.</li>
            <li> Nice feeling. A little gypped on how much product I got</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.  I don&#x27;t have stretch marks, but a rash on my belly.  The cream took care of the it.</li>
            <li> Got stretch marks regardless. Spent over $800 dollars buying them from different vendors and applied 3 times a day but it didn&#x27;t help. Waste of money</li>
            <li> Smells great and loved it, but for what it cost I probably won&#x27;t get during next pregnancy. (Especially since I got stretch marks anyway!)</li>
            <li> Be diligent about this cream and it will work.  I bought it because the smell of cocoa butter made me nauseated and this smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Never got any stretch marks with my 10lb., 3 oz. baby!! I am not crazy about the smell (slightly strong), but it worked so well!</li>
            <li> I was terrified of stretch marks.  Terrified.  I used this with baby #1, no stretch marks at all!! This, despite the fact they run in my family and I got them during adolescence.  Everything said i should expect them, and BAD.  Nope, not at all.  now using it again with #2 on the way, and so far so good.  Love the way it smells and it really helped with the itchy sensation of stretching.&lt;br /&gt; For best results, make sure to drink lots and lots of water and have healthy weight gain as well.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd pregnancy. I used this throughout my first pregnancy and I didn&#x27;t have one stretch mark!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it! it is very thick and sticky! not sure of it&#x27;s effect yet cuz i just started using it</li>
            <li> I used this during my pregnancy and I still got stretch marks. Sadly it didn&#x27;t work for me. It&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I loved it! It feels very thick and nourishing, but absorbs quickly. The perfume is very mild and pleasant. :)</li>
            <li> I used this throughout my pregnancy from about 4 months and I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks.  During my pregnancy I gained about 28 pounds and lost all the weight within 6 weeks of giving birth.  I was so happy with this tummy rub, I just bought it for my sister-in-law.  Great product!</li>
            <li> With my first child I used the standard stretch mark lotion you can find at any store. I hate the smell and it never worked. After a few days I tossed it out and I was so sad I did not find this lotion before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my second child someone suggested it and I fell in love. The smell is so nice and the lotion is so smooth and thick. I ended up buying 2 tubs of it and still had plenty of it after I gave birth. I may even buy another tub even though I am not pregnant, that is how nice the smelll is. I do wish the price was lower as it is a bit high, however for what it has done to my belly I cannot complain. Not one stretch mark!&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it was the lotion or just good luck - but I have seen plenty of people not use lotion of any kind and well they are stretch mark city.&lt;br /&gt;I used the lotion every morning and night. I would also use it if I felt itchy (which was multiple times a day) and it worked great.</li>
            <li> My wife has sensitive skin and she&#x27;s very small. Concerned about the impact of pregnancy on her skin we ordered this product. So far no stretch marks at 32 weeks.</li>
            <li> My wife brought this home and once I looked at the fine print I became a little concerned about some of the ingredients. A quick search on the web found some things that convinced me that I don&#x27;t want her to risk it. I&#x27;m no expert on the matter, but I do know enough that often what goes on the skin gets absorbed by the body and with something like this being so close to a developing baby, I was not comfortable with its use. Before you purchase and use this product, decide for yourself. For me, I can&#x27;t understand why anything of this purpose has to have this many chemicals in it. Why not just use pure coconut oil and aloe vera? The following is a cut and paste from the actual ingredients used in this product. In your research pay close attention to PEG 100 Sterate, Polysorbate 80 and anything with \\&quot;eth\\&quot; in the name...for starts.

            <li> Love this product.  But did not come in a tub but a tube, rather.  Overpriced.  Wish I had known! Boo.</li>
            <li> Starting at 4 months pregnant I religiously used the Mama Mio stretch mark butter and the Mama Mio stretch mark oil twice a day (first I applied the oil, then the butter over it).  I did not develop one single stretch mark during my pregnancy or after.  I love the scent, love the feel, and love the results.  Excellent product - I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Outstanding !!!!!  This product was exactly what I needed to fight off that itchy pregnancy skin on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff religiously during my first pregnancy and it worked.  Not a stretch mark in sight!</li>
            <li> THE BEST!! I am pregnant for the second time and this was the first item I ordered.  I did the tummy oil for the first child and had no stretch marks, anywhere!!  I used the oil twice a day on belly and dab/once around boobs, butt and hips.  I decided to go with the tummy rub cream first on this second pregnancy (11 weeks along) and ill keep with it until I grow and will add in oil (just for back up).  The oil didn&#x27;t stain my clothes but it is heavy and I feel money best spent when the belly is bigger.  The smell for both products is light and the feel/quality is high.  I&#x27;m a firm believer you get what you pay for.  The amount is little but it&#x27;s worth it.  HIGHLY suggest every pregnant woman purchases this!</li>
            <li> I used this for the first part of my pregnancy, and did not get stretch marks... I started slacking off at the end and did not notice a difference at all - so I am not sure if it is effective or not.... Gave it three stars because I did not have and adverse reactions, but IMHO, I think stretch marks are largely genetic.</li>
            <li> I have been pregnant three times, and I tried this cream during my last pregnancy.  I didn&#x27;t find it particularly easy to apply, and I didn&#x27;t care for the scent.  I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks -- but then again, I didn&#x27;t get them with any of the pregnancies.  If I was to buy another one, this is probably not the brand I&#x27;d settle for. But, it was relatively inexpensive, so at least there&#x27;s that.</li>
            <li> Best product I have found for helping with stretch marks. I have had some since puberty so I figured I wold get some while pregnant. You can definitely tell a difference in the texture of your skin and the visibility of stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Such a nice smell, and lovely product! very buttery texture, and feels very luxurious. Love to apply before bedtime. smooth and nice skin when I wake up! :)</li>
            <li> I used this product with the Mamma Mio oil all 9 months of pregnancy and had no stretch marks. Smells and works great!</li>
            <li> I bought this early in my pregnancy to prevent stretch marks - didn&#x27;t work. I still use it after delivery to hydrate and help the skin return to normal; i&#x27;m giving it three stars because it smells great, goes on smooth, absorbs well; i didn&#x27;t HATE the product. Didn&#x27;t do what i hoped it would: maybe it&#x27;s genetics, maybe it&#x27;s the product; It&#x27;s just far too pricey for a nice smelling lotion.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE this product. I have been using this lotion twice a day for my entire pregnancy. I am now 7 1/2 months along and have no stretch marks. Some say its genetics, some say its lotion, I don&#x27;t care -- I am not going to risk it and stray from this product. Plus it smells wonderful! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Mama Mio products are the best I have ever used.  If you are expecting, you need to try this product.  You will not be disappointed.  I used almost every product Mama Mio offers, and was 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> Who knows if this helped, but I used it during my pregnancy on my stomach and breasts, and have had no stretch marks. I gained 48 pounds (and started out thin), so it was surprising to me to not have gotten stretch marks. The tub of cream lasted 4 months.</li>
            <li> The product is great but I would have to buy one for each month. I use it once a day and went through it in a month or less.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing even after leaving it for hours on the skin.  Does not have a sticky feeling on skin. It also has a subtle, soothing scent.</li>
            <li> decent price, compared to other websites. would love for it to come in a jar like container rather then the squeeze tube (could get everything out of it if it came in a different container, too expensive to through away some butter in the container).</li>
            <li> It really works if you use it every day you would like to buy a bigger one, but it is great moisturizer...</li>
            <li> Whether it is genetics or this product, my wife swore by it her whole pregnancy and not a single stretch mark appeared. It helped her with the itchiness and stretching and didn&#x27;t leave an oily or sticky feel on the skin. She went through 3 or 4 of these while pregnant and whenever #2 is on the way we will surely be reordering this item.</li>
            <li> i only purchased one and i stopped because it is pretty expensive. so i stared using vaseline and that did it for me i have zero stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Love! Smells great &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. I use this with the oil &amp; so far, the results are great. I started using at 22 weeks &amp; I&#x27;m still using it everyday at 27 weeks. I know it doesn&#x27;t last long &amp; is spendy, but if it prevents even one stretch mark then it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I gained 55 lb and did start using this until my 2 trimester. Not one mark and mother has stretch marks</li>
            <li> Love this mama mio tummy rub ...! It really work .</li>
            <li> I used this regularly from week 20-41 and I have tons of stretch marks. They didn&#x27;t appear until my last month, but alas they appeared. They&#x27;re not bright red so I feel lucky about that. This cream also smells nice, but for $35 I can buy some super yummy stuff at Bath and Body Works.</li>
            <li> I wish this came in a larger oz. I&#x27;ve given it to all my friends who were expecting and also used it myself. It leaves you skin smooth all day, and have a pleasant smell. No stretch marks so far! I just wish is wasn&#x27;t so dang expensive!!</li>
            <li> I have used this every pregnancy! So far no stretch marks. So it must work and it smells great too!</li>
            <li> Been using since 12 wks along, gained 23 lbs, no stretch marks yet! I have already gone thru 5 jars though, so I would definitely order ahead! I mix it with really heavy vitamin e oil (32,000) and rub it on religiously morning and night...&lt;br /&gt;weight gain is all belly - and no marks yet! Fingers crossed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I went full term with my baby boy (40 weeks) gained 25 pounds total and not ONE stretch mark! I mixed this with vitamin E, I went thru 6 1/2 jars total, and am thrilled! I am 4 wks post partum, and other than having a little belly, there is not any stretch marks or loose skin...I am definitely someone who was predestined to have stretch marks, as I have them on hips from puberty, but zero from this pregnancy, I will definitely be using on my next pregnancy, I can&#x27;t sing higher praises from this product! Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, BUT plastic surgery or laser is so much more! Ithink I spent about $200 on this cream total and had about 3/4 of a jar left over....&lt;br /&gt;Good luck ladies, definitely use this one!</li>
            <li> After using this for the last 3 months I think it&#x27;s time for me to write a review that this cream really deserved.  This cream really works!!  I use it once a day every day for the last 3 months.  For the last months or so, as I am starting to gaining more weight going to into my third trimester, I would see red or new stretch marks on the sides of my abdominal.  Then I would use a good amount of cream and really massage in circular motion for 10 min.  Then the next day the red or deep colored stretch mark lines would disappeared!!  There have been a couple of incidents with the new stretch mark but all seems to disappear!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best part, this product smells the best (to me) comparing to The spoiled mama and Angel mama which I&#x27;ve used both of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wished that I had used this during my first pregnancy so I would&#x27;ve ended up with so much stretch marks.</li>
            <li> The best prego belly product on the market. Used with my entire last pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get ANY stretch marks. Tried to use a cheaper product the first few months with this one and they started popping out. I switched back to this product and am trying to do double-duty with it to see if it can make those go away. The good news is no new ones have come out since I started using this product again. Don&#x27;t waste time with any of the other products!</li>
            <li> I love it! I don&#x27;t like powerful smells at all. This smell is light and nice. My tummy is so soft after applying this. I apply it once, after I shower. As I continue to grow I will apply it twice daily. I would recommend for sure, it&#x27;s a treat.</li>
            <li> I used this every morning and night throughout my whole pregnancy. I noticed stretch marks appear around 36 weeks and they kept getting worse. Smells nice but useless at preventing stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I use Mama Mio Tummy Rub every day and have had so many compliments on its fresh, clean scent. My husband even likes it! My cousin used it while pregnant and had great results.  As soon as I tried hers, I just loved how it felt on my skin, how it smelled and how long it lasted. I immediately went online and bought two containers for myself. Funny for me to use a stretch mark cream as a regular cream since I haven&#x27;t been pregnant in 17 years but I do! I love the stuff!  Competitive price and fantastic product!</li>
            <li> This.butter I.ordered.for.my wife&lt;br /&gt; She is.6 mos pregnant and she loves.it. Very.much.. She loves the way it smells.and.feels. So if my wife is happy. I am too. Thnaks</li>
            <li> I have been prone to stretchmarks since I was a child. I have them all over my legs and backside from when I gained weight in college. I am also a bit of a skeptic :) After reading several review I figured I&#x27;d try this. At the very least, I won&#x27;t have itchy skin! I used this cream from month 3-9 and did not get a single stretch mark. I gained 25 pounds during my pregnancy and maxed out at 180lb. I can&#x27;t say this will do anything for you if you have above average weight gain but it worked for me! It also made my skin feel so good, and I never got itchy. If you are going to spoil yourself at any point during your pregnancy, buy this! It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> This cream is nice but nothing special. Given the whopping price tag, you&#x27;re better off just using shea butter. I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks and used one container of this lotion, the oil this company makes, and later, plain old shea butter. I didn&#x27;t feel a difference in my skin elasticity between the three approaches.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells amazing and I haven&#x27;t seen a stretch mark yet. I&#x27;m about to start 3rd trimester.</li>
            <li> Hi, this product is good, however, it doesn&#x27;t really go a long way. The lotion is very thick. Using this product combined with the Mama Mio Tummy Rub Stretch Mark Oil is much better! Next time I order, I just plan to buy just the oil instead, as it goes a long way. 6 months pregnant and still no stretch marks. Been using this product for over a month.</li>
            <li> I bought this because a friend recommended it. She gave birth about 6 weeks ago and had no stretch marks. They say that there is nothing you can do to prevent them but I beg to differ. I KNOW that I can get stretch marks, as I have a few from my preteen growth spurt on my hips. I started using the Tummy Rub Stretch Mark Butter when I was just starting to grow but before I really started to show. I really slather it on after my shower and so now I need more! I&#x27;m about 6 1/2 months and I have no evidence of stretch marks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice cream to apply but I don&#x27;t know if it prevents stretch marks. So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any yet and I&#x27;m 25 weeks in to my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice a day since I found out I was pregnant. Smells great. I&#x27;ve not experienced any of the usual &amp;#34;itchy belly syndrome&amp;#34; that pregnant women experience. At 30 weeks still no stretch marks. I have repurchased and will keep repurchasing this product. HIghly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product feels great and smells great too!  I love it!  I only wish it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a ton of moms! I haven&#x27;t had the baby yet, but so far so good! (30 weeks) if nothing else it smells good and helps with itchy, stretching skin!</li>
            <li> Pretty expensive for the amount you have to use it, I used a jar a month... but when I stopped using it stretch marks attacked... just make sure you use it for your entire pregnancy (or why ever ur using it) for the full benefit.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!!!! Helped me not get any more stretch marks than I got in my previous pregnancy where I did not use this product. Would recommend to others</li>
            <li> I love this this product,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;despite the price it did what it was supposed to do. This is my second pregnancy and I had no &amp;#34;New&amp;#34; stretchmarks&amp;#34; from this.  I love the texture its very creamy but its not heavy on your skin or greasy it just perfect and it smell REALLY good.  Definitely recommend it.  Buy it :)</li>
            <li> This is my first pregnancy and my second purchase of this product lol. I like it alot and I will continue to use it with the oil throughout my pregnancy to the birth of my daughter.  It isn&#x27;t greasy like the other products I was using before and I like how the oil soaks into your skin immediately.  I really like this product and will be buying it again!</li>
            <li> I am 23 weeks pregnant with my second child. I used Mama Mio for my first pregnancy and it was excellent. I didn&#x27;t have any stretch marks and so far have been doing good..</li>
            <li> I bought this to try and prevent stretch marks, didn&#x27;t happen. I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s just hereditary.</li>
            <li> I used this throughout my whole pregnancy. I put it on every day and night along with the oil rub. I put it on my thighs, butt, and stomach. However, I still got tons of stretch marks all over my body. Save your money for something else!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this because it smells amazing and was super thick and lush but my non-sensitive skin broke out in a huge rash using this bottle.  I&#x27;d used it before in my pregnancy, so maybe I broke out due to more hormones later on, but I was definitely bummed out.  Cleared up once I started using something else for about a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mama Mio Tummy rub since I was 8 weeks pregnant, I use the cream in the morning &amp; oil at night. I love the smell &amp; it moisturizes my skin really well. Overall no stretch marks but I&#x27;ve used a lot of cream. Saturate my boobs, tummy, back, butt &amp; thighs.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been through 6 tummy rubs &amp; 3 Bottles of oil and I am only 27 weeks pregnant. Going to be about a $500-600 dollar run for the whole 9 months so lets hope it keeps working.</li>
            <li> For me this worked fabulously! I have used the butter every night before bed together with the oil every morning after shower since about 4-5 months of pregnancy. I did not get a single stretch-mark. Of course we will never know how much this products really contributed... but it is of great quality and also helped with itching a lot. I feel like it definitely did great things for my skin.</li>
            <li> I first tried the Mama Mio Tummy Rub Stretch Mark Oil and loved it!  Wonderfully moisturizing, beautiful scent.  The downside was the bottle lasted just a little more than a month, and the oil was a little hard to control, messy.  Then I tried the Mama Mio Tummy Rub Stretch Mark Butter and love it that much more!!!!  I am still working on my first 4 oz. tub of the tummy butter, but so far, it has lasted twice as long and I still have more.  So easy to work with, super moisturizing, and smells just as fantastic as the oil.  Since it lasts so much longer, it is a much better value for the money paid. Also, I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks so far in my pregnancy.  I still have a couple more months to go, but so far so good.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> love this stuff it goes on perfect not to greasy and smells great. unfortunatly i learned about it when i was 7 months but ive been using it since im 8 months pregnant not one stretch mark and just recieved my second order in the mail today. great stuff. will be using after pregnacy as recommened also. i use the tummy OIL and the tummy butter from mama mio &lt;3</li>
            <li> I stumbled on this cream during research while Imwas pregnant, it seemed to have the best reviews so I figured I would try it. I cannot say enough good things about it, it works! I had one small mark when my son was born, and kept using the Mama Mio a few months after his birth. It&#x27;s gone!! Totally amazing, smells wonderful, too. We use it for the baby, too, for dry skin, or redness in his diaper area. Redness dissapears within a day or so! Spend the money and get the best, it goes a long way if you use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> Right now I am 24 weeks and NO stretch marks! I still have 3 months to go before I can say this is a miracle worker. So after the baby I&#x27;ll right another review. It smells great and leaves my skin so smooth! I also love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals. I also just ordered the oil to add on.</li>
            <li> This body butter is incredible! I am already on my second one and no stretch marks and no skin irritation.</li>
            <li> While the cream might have been effective , I haven&#x27;t been able to use it due to its strong scent . Pregnancy strengthens your sense of smell, having produced this product for pregnant women , one would assume they would take that into consideration but \\&quot; NO\\&quot; they haven&#x27;t . I tried using it twice , both times the smell made me nauseous and I couldn&#x27;t stand myself . I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to any pregnant woman who has a heightened sense of smell . It was a waste of money for me unfortunately!</li>
            <li> I used this along with the stretch mark oil. Liked this much better and used it all. I am giving it 4 stars because I am comparing it to the oil. I cannot give it 5 stars because I do not know whether it really worked or if if my skin had already stretched out from my first pregnancy. I gained 41 lbs and no stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to use during the pregnancy to help with stretch marks, etc.  This product seemed to do the trick and my wife really liked it.</li>
            <li> Wife used it during pregnancy pretty much religiously and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks. This may be dependent on the person but it worked for her. Worth getting at this price.</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible and this cream does not hydrate the skin. I use Eucerin Stretch Marks body Oil cream and I am 100% satisfied (and it cost 1/2 price). Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I know everyone says that strech marks will come whether you use cream or not but this belly butter is awesome.  Not a mark with my first pregnancy and I am 6 months into the second with soft tummy skin.  It is work the three tubes you will need for a pregnancy.  Started using around 18-20 weeks</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as a gift since the second trimester.  Very moisturizing.  I use it after the stretch mark oil.  So far, my skin looks great, my skin is soft, and not itchy!</li>
            <li> I used this product 3 times a day, unfortunately it did nothing for me. I did notice that this product dried out faster than any other cream I used that included regular coco butter. There also is a very strong smell of citrus. And when I say strong smell, I mean other people can smell it on you when you have it on. I do not like the smell as it is way too strong for me. The most important part of this product is the moisturizing, and it does not moisturize better than other cheaper products you can find at any grocery store. I wish I could send this back and get a refund, but that’s not going to happen.  I should have listened to the numerous doctors that told me there is no cream that will make you not get stretch marks. I was told stretch marks are hereditary and some people just get them others just do not.  Next time I will not spend my money on a cream like this.</li>
            <li> I really like the soft scent and it is not greasy so it does not leave marks on your clothes.  I would recomend this product to others.</li>
            <li> technically we&#x27;re still early to see stretch marks on my wife, but so far this is nice lotion.  Most reviews say that stretch marks are inevitable regardless of the amount of lotion you use, but keeping your skin hydrated is always a good idea.</li>
            <li> This is by far a quality product- well worth the money. During my second pregnancy I lathered it on after I showered, not only did it provide moisture but it smelled sooo divine my husband would look forward to rubbing it on me just for the aromatheraphy! It&#x27;s a must in every mommy to be gift basket!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. Mine came in a tube as opposed to a tube, but it&#x27;s all the same. I am only 14 weeks, but I have been using it since week 10. I&#x27;ll have to come back and let you know how the stretch marks work out. You can totally tell your skin is getting much needed moisture though. I love using it.</li>
            <li> This is my first pregnancy, and I have been using the Mama Mio Tummy Rub Butter since week 7. When my belly started showing at month 5, I used the Tummy Rub Butter in combination with the Tummy Rub Oil every morning and every night. I am now 8 months pregnant and have no signs of stretchmarks. I guess it&#x27;s still too early to tell, but it makes my growing belly super soft and cures any itchiness due to stretching.    In terms of how many bottles you&#x27;ll be using (it is pricey), these small bottles last 4 months (and that&#x27;s applying liberally every morning and night), so it is a good value. You&#x27;ll probably only need 3 during your whole pregnancy including post partum when your belly starts shrinking.    *UPDATE*  I gave birth to a 7 lb 4 oz baby girl on the 15th of July. She is now 6 weeks and my stomach has completely shrunk down, and I have absolutely no stretchmarks. This product is amazing and well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I know everyone thinks that it&#x27;s in your genes to get stretch marks and there&#x27;s no way to avoid them.  I was given this as a gift from my MIL when I was about 13 weeks pregnant, and started using it with little faith because I got stretch marks from growing in puberty on my upper thighs and hips.  They are so so faded now, but there you go - I get stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I used this religiously once a day for the entirety of my pregnancy.  I had a belly, for sure...but not ONE SINGLE STRETCH MARK.  I think I needed to buy two more containers to get through the remainder of my pregnancy, but I feel it was worth it considering I&#x27;m not going to be searching for cosmetic procedures to be removing stretch marks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly, highly recommend this stuff - and it smells really nice!</li>
            <li> I did not use this, it was for my daughter. Seemed to work just fine. She used it with her first child.</li>
            <li> Although expensive, this is a great product. I love how rich it is. I&#x27;m 24 weeks pregnant, and have gone through 1.5 tubes of this stuff - not a stretch mark in sight! I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I first started using this lotion after a surgery to reduce scarring. It&#x27;s helped quite a bit! I have virtually no incision marks! It feels light and smells great.</li>
            <li> I used this product with the stretch mark oil. I used it twice a day, morning and night. I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks on my tummy. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very glad to have this for our daughter expecting twins.  It was such a comfort for her tight, tight skin.</li>
            <li> I tried the Bella b and the Burt&#x27;s bees momma bee lotions. I also tried earth mamma lotion. This one was nice and thick and lotiony. Bella b and Burt&#x27;s bees didn&#x27;t really feel to have the lasting moisture I like. I prefer this in the oils but oil isn&#x27;t practical when you put clothes over it. So maybe coconut oil or olive oil are all natural but they aren&#x27;t good for your clothes. One reviewer said use aloe Vera instead. However for whatever reason aloe even 100% irritates my skin. This is lovely and I&#x27;ve actually finished the whole container!!! I had some stretch marks from when I was using the other products but not since using this. It&#x27;s far better than the perfumey body butters out there and doesn&#x27;t irritate my allergies. I gave this as a gift to someone and I will continue to give it as gifts I. The future. I love it for me. It&#x27;s a must have of pregnancy!!!!</li>
            <li> I started applying this cream at the beginning of my second trimester because I wasn;t showing much. WELL, let me tell you; I applied on my torso, thighs, and boobs after each shower and I have ZERO stretch marks!! ZERO!!&lt;br /&gt;Oh and FYI, a jar will last you a single trimester. GET IT!! :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!! I&#x27;ve only been using it about a month, I&#x27;m 17wks. pregnant. It feels so good on your skin and smells great, so much better than coco butter!!  I&#x27;m not showing yet, I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks. I only gave it 4 stars b/c I haven&#x27;t been using it that long, but I hope that I can continue this pregnancy with zero to little stretch marks b/c of this product!! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream since early pregnancy. I&#x27;m 34 weeks now and have gained 40 lbs so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 38 weeks, gained 50 lbs, and no stretch marks on my tummy yet!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this cream is not my favorite. It&#x27;s tolerable, and not nasty, I just think it could be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes:&lt;br /&gt;Long-lasting. You still can feel it on your skin when you shower the next day, but it&#x27;s not greasy or nasty. I now need to put it on 2-3x a day, but that is because my skin is so stretched and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helps amazingly with itchyness. My skin is so stretched and gets red, but this cream is super moisturizing and makes it feel good immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No stretch marks yet. I&#x27;ve been putting it on bust down for months and so far so good! I neglected to put it on my rear and upper thighs, and I got dark red stretch marks on my upper back thighs :(. The belly so far is free and clear (knock on wood for me!). I only have ~2wks to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last note, these are pretty pricey and I&#x27;ve had to buy about 8 jars of this stuff, but everyone is different. They last in the beginning but the more my stomach stretched the more I used, and I now use up a jar in much less than a month.</li>
            <li> I heard such wonderful things on this tummy butter and so I ordered it and used it almost everyday of my pregnancy and I did get a few tiny stretch marks but nothing too bad and I think if I would of used nothing then I probably would of had more than a few tiny stretch marks but I think I would buy it again unless I found a cheaper product that was about the same because this is a tad pricey.</li>
            <li> This was my best friend during my 9 months of pregnancy i loved it</li>
            <li> I used this for my previous pregnancy and I am happy it is still available. Absorbs quickly, has a pleasant clean scent.  Will continue to purchase this until 6 months after giving birth.</li>
            <li> Ordered the tub, got the tube. Definitely less in the tube for the same high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s good stuff</li>
            <li> I loved this stuff when I was pregnant.  I do wish it was a little cheaper though.</li>
            <li> The tummy rub is great, it&#x27;s organic and when you apply it you can tell it makes the skin more elastic. The rub is not oily but it also does stay in skin for a while, it smells great</li>
            <li> Very rich, excellent scent, worth it</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but didn&#x27;t use long enough to tell if it really worked. Moved on to coconut oil.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, I thought this could be the miracle cream. I think it does an OK job, but it doesn&#x27;t penetrate to help the skin get rid of the post pregnancy marks. I think is very expensive and doesn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li> I used this product religiously. I had my baby in early May and I have stretch marks on my waist and my belly. I gave it 3 stars because I&#x27;m not sure that if I would&#x27;ve not use this product I might&#x27;ve had more stretch marks. However, I&#x27;m starting to think that the cheaper and older alternative would&#x27;ve probably worked as well. Good old fashion generic cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my pregnant sister and she absolutely loved it.  Had zero stretch marks.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff but after using 6 of these Tummy Rub tubes, she claims it is difficult to get every last drop out of these bottles.  For that reason, I am giving it 4 stars rather than 5.  She has moved on to the jars because she feels she can actually get every last expensive drop out.  Otherwise, this is good stuff and I am asked to keep ordering it.</li>
            <li> Mild smell and good texture</li>
            <li> I like this so far. I have used almost the whole jar (mine did not come in a tube). It smells like citrus and was not nauseating to me as some others have. I am 4.5 months prego and no stretchmarks so far....</li>
            <li> I am giving it two stars because this packaging (green tube) is the old packaging. It now comes in a tub. I didn&#x27;t think this would make a difference but it did. The first time I bought the green tube version it was great but the second time the cream turned into little balls when rubbing it against my belly. I found out this was the old version, which means the cream I was putting in was probably turning into balls because it was old. I returned it.</li>
            <li> This tummy butter is amazing. I started using it when I had a little pooch and all the way until after I had my son. Never got one stretch&lt;br /&gt;Mark my whole pregnancy. I did have 2 or 3 little ones show up about 2 weeks post partum. I&#x27;m pretty sure it was from loosing weight so quickly though. Also, the smell is wonderful. Never made me sick.</li>
            <li> I bought this product early on in my pregnancy as I read staying well moisturized from the jump is important. This Tummy Butter smells great and leaves your skin glowing and happy.  I will probably use this product even after the baby is delivered!</li>
            <li> My wife has 2 kids and no stretch marks. I think that says everything you need to know.</li>
            <li> Mom of twins here and I used this during my whole pregnancy. I used it all over my belly, hips, flanks, and breasts and not 1 stretch mark. This is a miracle in a tube!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Using it with my second pregnancy. No stretch marks (so far) and really helps with the belly itching. Only thing- wish it was unscented, but scent isn&#x27;t terrible.</li>
            <li> Love this product, but do miss the old packaging (the previous tub was better than the new tube at getting all the product out). I am in baby no. 3 and while it may be due to luck or genetics, but so far not one stretch mark.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend who swore by it because she only ended up with a few stretch marks. I was willing to try anything to trick what was inevitably hereditary (my mother got stretch marks from all 3 of her births). Unfortunately, I wound up with a stomach full of stretch marks and I used both the butter and the oil (oil twice a day and the butter every 3 hours). It was an expensive, yet unsuccessful attempt at staying stretch mark free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still giving this product 3 stars though because it did work wonders against all of the other uncomfortable issues that arise from a growing belly - the burning and itching sensations that come about from the stretching skin. It worked far better than any of the other butters and oils out there. I used it from month 3 all the way to the day my baby was born. For the cost, it may not be worth it to some, but for me, the effectiveness against the itching alone was worth it. One other thing to note, the oil does last much longer and if you purchase the butter/cream, try and get the stuff in the jar. When buying it in the tube, I had to cut the tube open to get the full use of the product, which was irritating (I wanted every last drop since I was paying so much per ounce).</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews on Amazon, even considering that I order something almost weekly but this is worth it.  As soon as I found out I was pregnant I ordered 4 different stretch mark creams. Mama Mio, Mustela, Philosophy Mommy and organic cocoa butter. There is truly no comparison between Mama Mio and the others. Not only is it thicker but is still absorbs faster and keeps your skin hydrated all day. With the other stretch mark creams I was generally disgusted by their smells and found myself scratching my itchy belly by the afternoon while Mama Mio keeps my skin soft and hydrated all day. Even Mustela which gets great reviews paled in comparison to this cream.&lt;br /&gt;As far as preventing stretch marks goes, I am almost 6 months pregnant and still without stretch marks. Although I&#x27;m convinced genetics ultimately decides whether you get stretch marks, I believe that the hydration provided by Mama Mio definitely helps. Only downside is that this runs $35/ 4 0z. It does last me about 4 weeks per tube- very worth it!</li>
            <li> I did not like the way this product smelled and I wished I&#x27;d listened to the other reviewers instead of purchasing. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product which I have been using since Month 2.  It has a nice smell and absorbs quickly so it doesn&#x27;t slow me down in the morning.  And it doesn&#x27;t appear to affect my clothes at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with this version of the product is the packaging.  My first purchase of the butter came in a tub, and I found that easier to use simply because of ease of access.  The tube makes it harder to get to all the product.  At $35 or so, the price I have paid for it, that&#x27;s a big deal, considering how much of it I use.  I will look for the tub version from now on.</li>
            <li> Proof that this is really a miracle product:&lt;br /&gt;1) In college, I got stretch marks all over my inner thighs from gaining weight. However, with Mama Mio--NONE from pregnancy!!!&lt;br /&gt;2) The ONE stretch mark I did get in my 9 months of pregnancy was on my side, where I never once applied cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I had already gotten stretch marks in the past from weigh gain (non-pregnancy related), I knew I&#x27;d get stretch marks all over my belly during pregnancy if I didn&#x27;t do anything about it. So I researched. A ton. Long story short, I applied this stuff religiously (see exact process below) and came away from pregnancy (I now have a 3-week old baby) with ZERO stretch marks on my belly! I am one happy mama now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my regimen:&lt;br /&gt;1) Once a day, liberally apply stretch mark butter all over belly (btw, it smells amazing and eliminates itchiness!).&lt;br /&gt;2) After every shower (which for me was every other day), liberally apply stretch mark OIL, let dry, and then liberally apply butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s IT! Good luck to all! I simply can&#x27;t recommend this product enough. SO worth the money!!</li>
