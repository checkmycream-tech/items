            <li>It&#x27;s slightly wider than I expected, but still is very nice.</li>
            <li>I really like these cute little shoes .</li>

            <li>and they arrived much quicker than I expected.</li>
            <li>I would give 4 stars, but the shoes were not pink, they were off white!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not worth to purchase this.</li>
            <li> but we can use the little shoes</li>
            <li> Darling little booties</li>
            <li> Shoes were cuteee, but uneven, stiching were all lob sided, I guess I got what I payed for 3 dollars</li>
            <li> poor quality, made too wide.</li>

            <li> poor quality, made too wide. made for child with chunky feet. color is off, more of a dirty or dingy samon color</li>

            <li> So cute!! Exactly as in the picture!!</li>
            <li> The crib shoes are adorable. However, because the fabric is of a lower quality, you will have to work with them after unpacking in order to get them back to the shoe shape.</li>
            <li> Took quite a while to arrive, came from China I believe, but oh my goodness are these adorable!!!! They are perfect for a precious little princess. They are well made with nice stitching, evenly spaced with lite pink thread that isn&#x27;t visible unless you really look and only at the bottom of the bootie. The details, like the little rosettes, are lovely. These are special booties for a special little girl. Just make sure you give several weeks time for delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly wider than I expected, but still is very nice.</li>
            <li> cute but will not fit a newborn as stated .. will fit maybe 6 months to a year</li>
            <li> Cheaply made. The lace is torn. It&#x27;s not worth to purchase this.</li>
            <li> They are more like 6 month size shoes and are very wide. Not sure if they&#x27;ll ever be able to actually wear.</li>
            <li> PRETTY FLIMSY BUT CUTE SHOES FOR BABY GIRLS.  They don&#x27;t stay in them too long so don&#x27;t need a quality shoe, anyway.</li>
            <li> very cute and will go well with the onsie and the the crcheted hat I also ordered</li>
            <li> Super cute! Exactly what I expected :) the lace around the sides might not stay because it&#x27;s cheaply made but still so cute and if they do fall apart its nothing I can&#x27;t fix myself. Perfect little princess shoes for an adorable little baby girl!</li>
            <li> These are so adorable. The picture doesn&#x27;t do justice for them . Great price also.</li>
            <li> They are ok, not as cute as I thought they would be</li>
            <li> So precious!  Can&#x27;t wait to have baby and put the on her!</li>
            <li> very cute with little pink ribbon roses</li>
            <li> Cute shoes can&#x27;t wait for my lil girl to wear them</li>
            <li> Darling little booties</li>
            <li> Cute but not the quality I expected</li>
            <li> Very cute shoes! Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> The shoes were very cute.  They were a big hit. I would recommend them as nice for show.  Probably not a real durable product.</li>
            <li> The picture shows pale pink slippers, what I received was ten shades of hot pink. This does not at all meet my expectations or work for what I had intended.</li>
            <li> These shoes are just precious! They are even prettier &amp;#34;in-person&amp;#34; than what you see! Love them!</li>
            <li> very pretty! well pleased.</li>
            <li> Too large for newborn...too stiff</li>
            <li> Super delicate and adorable slippers-However, the packaging is very cheap and there are no tags to show they are new/un-used. I wrapped them in a beautiful box with colored tissue paper to make up for the lack of presentation</li>
            <li> It looks very nice.  Good price.</li>
            <li> Ordered these for my newborn grand daughter, but when they arrived they looked nothing like the photo--cheaper-quality construction than shown and are much larger than newborn sized.  I&#x27;m not a fan, but maybe someone else will enjoy them so I&#x27;ll save them for a gift bag decoration on a future baby shower gift.</li>
            <li> I really like these cute little shoes . I would agree it&#x27;s best for a baby under 3 months of age. Very attractive and they arrived much quicker than I expected. I bought 6 pair to match with some outfits I make, to give as shower gifts. they are not meant for a child to walk in, shoes like these are totally for looks...as all shoes would be for a newborn baby..</li>
