            <li> By far my favorite moisturizer. It&#x27;s unscented and just thick enough. I use it when my skin is still damp from the shower. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent cream, non-greasy and stays on the skin.</li>
            <li> It cost more than I expected.</li>
            <li> I think it is a very good product worth the money a good mosterizer for yoyr face hands etc that works really well without paying the high prices of other brands i will recomend it as good product that by the way here at amazon i found it after been looking all over and coyldnt find it anywhere in miami after i used it once and coyldnt find it anyplace i bought three jars i really love it</li>
            <li> I have skin prone to allergic reactions and live where the weather gets cold. This cream, though thick, does keep my skin more moist than any other I&#x27;ve found for the price and doesn&#x27;t affect my sensitive skin. It has very little smell and doens&#x27;t stain PJ&#x27;s or clothes, even though it looks like it isn&#x27;t soaking in immediately..As a nurse I recommend it</li>
            <li> All kind of ingredients are included to protect and feed my sensitive skin for ever. Great quality, affordable and always have enough to refresh my day!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for more than 10 years and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> An excellent moisturizing creme.  I haven&#x27;t been without it for over 10 years.  Excellent for summer sun and winter chapping.  More effective than any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Overall quality cream for men and women&#x27;s face and/or body - not oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for over a decade now.  I have eczema, which can be quite severe, and this stuff is the only thing that gives me relief and even heals long-term.  If you have skin issues, I sing this product&#x27;s praises LOUDLY.  I won&#x27;t use anything else, and when I couldn&#x27;t find it in a local store, I panicked.  Thankfully, the internet came to my rescue and Amazon has a great deal on it!  I&#x27;m also really sensitive to scented lotions, and this one doesn&#x27;t have any kind of strong smell, which I love.</li>
            <li> I have this sent to my elderly mother, but I have used it myself.  It&#x27;s great vitamin E cream!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT AFTER SHAVE AND POST WASH DAILY MOISTURIZING CREME.HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR OVER 7 YEARS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years now and have enjoyed the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> Very good for dry skin</li>
            <li> This product is great. I am very happy with it and would recommend it highly.  It is great all over body moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Fabulous cream.  It feels so good when applied to your skin.  I could not believe how big the containers were as I thought that they looked small in the picture but they are not small, they are good size.</li>
            <li> Amazing creme that I have used since this is what my mother used and we love it.&lt;br /&gt;I tried finding it at different stores and couldn&#x27;t even locate this product.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> OH MY GOSH !!!  This stuff is wonderful.  I have just ordered and received my second round of this amazing Vitamin E Cream.  You do not need anything else for dry skin, almost a healing effect.  Lasts all day, very pleasing smell, great value...need I say more?</li>
            <li> I use it after taking shower it absorbs fairly quickly and keeps my skin from drying out. It also does not break the bank.</li>
            <li> I have used nothing else as a skin moisturizer for the past 15 - 20 years and, so far, my face hasn&#x27;t fallen off yet.  Why change if what you are using works?</li>
            <li> A random do-gooder sent this to me in  care package while i was in Iraq...10 years later I am still using the same product...this stuff is AMAZING....AND they don&#x27;t test on animals!!!!</li>
            <li> Best cream we have found. Really works.</li>
