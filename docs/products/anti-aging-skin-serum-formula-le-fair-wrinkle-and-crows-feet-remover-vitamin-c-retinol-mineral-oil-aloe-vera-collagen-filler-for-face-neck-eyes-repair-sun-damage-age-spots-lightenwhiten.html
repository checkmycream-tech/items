    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is an amazing product! It has left my skin smooth and soft while reducing the appearance of fine lines in just a few days!</li>
            <li> Pretty good product. Worth the try. You get what you pay for, thumbs up</li>
            <li> I like this product for the most part. I was expecting it to be a little less watery, but it still feels like it tightens my face after I apply it. My face feels smoother overall. I&#x27;m excited to see my progress in another month or so. I think this product is good for the price.</li>
            <li> Great product! Easy to apply and can see a difference in my skin already.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin; therefore, I have to be watchful when using serums to make sure it doesn&#x27;t make my skin look even more oily.  This Anti Aging Skin Serum from Le Fair worked great for my skin type.  It left my skin feeling soft and fresh. No irritation and no oily appearance.  I am 40 years old, thus important to keep my skin maintained!  I received this bottle factory wrapped.  It has a squirt style pump that started working after pumping a few times to get the product up through the pump.  This is something important to me, as I want to ensure my product is not contaminated.  I love the packaging too.  It is more attractive to use with the packaging has a modern appeal to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for review, and my opinions are not based on receiving it at free or reduced cost.  My review are my honest opinions.</li>
            <li> This serum is very light weight, non greasy to skin. It leaves my skin feeling refreshed when i wake up in the morning. Used it only for 2 nights now but i can tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I really like how this makes my skin feel! My skin feels softer and smoother when using it. It also has improved my skins appearance. I try to put it on at night before bed but it also is lightweight enough that it works well under makeup.</li>
            <li> I received the Le Fair Anti Aging Skin Serum very quickly after ordering. It came sealed in a clear plastic wrap. Once opened, it took a few pumps to get it primed but the pump works great. I love the pump because it&#x27;s more sterile than taking it out of a jar or regular bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used different anti aging skin serums in the past and this is definitely up at the top of my list. The lotion has a light pleasant fragrance and the serum goes on smoothly. A little of the serum goes a long way. It took two small squirts onto my finger to get a thin layer covering my face. Once it dries it leaves my skin feeling absolutely amazing. I&#x27;ve been using this on my hands as well and they definitely are looking much softer and younger with less scaley skin and wrinkles..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum takes a minute to dry and then I apply my makeup. My makeup goes on very smooth over it and it seems like I use much less makeup this way. My facial lines and wrinkles seem less noticeable and my skin feels fabulous. I have not seen any fading of an age spot I have but I&#x27;m hopeful with longterm use that it will fade.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend Le Fair Anti Aging Skin Serum. It makes your skin feel silky soft.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free or at a discount to test and give my opinion in a review. The opinion is completely my own.</li>
            <li> Great product.  My wife really loves using this product. It works really well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve almost finished my first bottle and I really love how it makes my skin feel.  It appears to be smoother &amp; brighter.  So, I&#x27;ve ordered another bottle and have made this part of my beauty routine.  Thanks much.</li>
            <li> very awesome !! I really love it</li>
            <li> Very light! I like the consistency and how smooth your skin gets. Hoping for results</li>
            <li> I started using this serum about a week ago and it is great! it isn&#x27;t oily at all which I love. It feels so light and it smells good.My face feels softer already!</li>

            <li> Love this product! Makes your skin feel silky soft &amp; hydrates so well. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really write a review because I had a reaction to something in this product.  It was just itching , but I tried twice with the same outcome.</li>
            <li> line is less visible. great product. will buy again.</li>
            <li> using this and its working a little but not like i expected it to other brands work alot better than this is for me. but it may work better on someone else like most products work with different people just got to find the right product for your skin type.</li>
            <li> I like the the way the product makes my skin feel. It smooths out my fine lines my smile lines could use some  help but I smile and laugh to much lol</li>
            <li> Has some ingredients that I can not use.</li>
            <li> STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.  WORKS GREAT</li>
            <li> I received this product at a greatly reduced price because I was willing to give my honest opinion about it. I have used this for 4 days and my skin feels so hydrated and very smooth. I will have to give another review later to see if the wrinkles get reduced.</li>
            <li> My skin is brighter, clearer, and less blotchy.</li>
            <li> Non greasy collagen... Absorbs to my skin easily</li>
            <li> I like how this makes my face  look and feel.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! The combo of Vitamin C, Retinol, Peptides,Mineral Oil, Aloe Vera, and Collagen are awesome to have in ONE formula! I have been a fan of the Le Fair brand and have used several of their products before, so when I saw this I was excited to get it! So far so good! I have used it for a few days, and while of course I have not seen any results yet, it does smell nice (that is pretty important) and it goes on smoothly with no clumps or lumps. It absorbs fairly quickly into the skin, and then I can apply my primer and makeup over it with no issues. I haven&#x27;t had any reactions to it that are bad, such as break outs or rashes. So far I like it, really hope to see some results and after I give it a good 6 week trial, I will update my results!</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin - leaves my face looking fresh and youthful.</li>
            <li> Le Fair offers an excellent facial skin cream with many of the ingredients that will bring a healthy glow to any face.  Ingredients include aloe, vitamin C, peptides, and more – ingredients known to improve skin appearance and diminish wrinkles and fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick with this or any other skin serum is consistency and patience.  T pump gives you just about the right amount to massage into your face once; a little goes a long way. However, you won’t see much in the way of results from just one use.  You need to use it twice a day and keep on using it for weeks or even months to get the results you want.  Just keep at it.  You’ll have beautiful skin in return for your consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIVE STARS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discounted sample provided for unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I got the opportunity to purchase this anti-aging serum at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest opinion. I have spent a lot of money trying to find product to get rid of wrinkles, lines, and dark spots. And every time they don&#x27;t work, but I finally found this serum that does. It has no strong over bearing aromas, it absorbs into your skin really quickly, and most importantly....it works! It also feels great while your are applying it. You only have to use a little bit to cover your face and neck so just one bottle will last a long time. In no time I noticed my neck area began to tighten up and I no linger had the look of bags under my eyes. This is the only product I have found that actually works. If you are trying to get rid of wrinkles, lines, and dark spots, this is the serum for you!</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin but didn&#x27;t really noice much difference as far as fine lines. Major softness and hydration. Absorbs easily</li>

            <li> Oh this is so silky and applies so easy with no effort. My face sucked in the serum as if it was thirsty. I applied it then went to bed. When I woke up my face is smooth. I use it quite a bit and its also a great make up remover. Just use a tiny bit on a cotton ball to remove your make up. Not only does it leave your face feeling smooth it removes your make up in 1 swipe and its healthy for your face.</li>
            <li> This serum has transformed my winter dry skin in my first application it&#x27;s very moisturizing without being heavy and oily it&#x27;s delicate on my sensitive skin as well which is a great bonus! I truly love this stuff! Also works great under foundation.</li>
            <li> Smells great not oily by any means, however.... my face did break out. I am 30 and I have always thought it was never to early to help prolong wrinkles.  :)  Anywho... I applied it to my face and neck. I did notice my smile lines not as deep. I applied it every morning and right before bed AFTER I washed my face. My face didn&#x27;t break out too bad, but it was like &amp;#34;monthly breakout&amp;#34; if you know what I am saying. ;)  I say give it a try. :)</li>
