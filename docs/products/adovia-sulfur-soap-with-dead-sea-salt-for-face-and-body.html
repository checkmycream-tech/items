            <li>I used it 2 days ago i really liked it</li>
            <li>It is a nice smelling soap.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;These are my honest opinions after having tried this product&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and we own a salt water pool</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a real fragrance to it, so that was awesome.</li>
            <li>I received this product in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>All views and opinions are 100% my own and have neither been paid for nor sponsored.</li>
            <li>I did receive a discount to try it  and give my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>and it is nice.</li>
            <li>Sulfur has Antiseptic, Anti-Fungal and Antibacterial properties and this soap is most known for treating acne, but also has good results with treating cases of Scabies(sulfur is toxic to the mites), Seborrheic Dermatitis(kills</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are my honest opinions after having tried this product</li>

            <li>Disclosure, Adovia sent me this product for review, however my opinion is 100% my own.</li>
            <li>I also liked that it had antiseptic and antibacterial properties.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say I didn’t get either feeling with this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thanks so much to Adovia for another great product!</li>
            <li>It lathers very well and feels great!</li>
            <li>After using them both I can honestly say I did not see any improvement of the acne on my chest reducing.</li>
            <li>my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
            <li>While I find it effective for my breakouts, I am not qualified to comment on how effective it is for chronic acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>I use it on my body and am loving it.</li>
            <li>Lathers very easily, which I also liked.</li>

            <li>Pretty good!</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft, looks youthful, and feels great when using this soap!!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a perfect combination of ingredients to provide natural feeling skin.</li>
            <li>It is a nice size bar, that produces a good lather and doesn&#x27;t dissolve too quickly, wasting the bar of soap.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love!</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite soap ever!!!</li>
            <li>I think this is a great soap for people who have severe or constant breakouts as I feel the sulfur would aid greatly in these cases.</li>
            <li>I received this product free for review purposes and I am very glad I did.</li>
            <li>it has a very mild pleasant smell as a bar, but it truly is fragrance free on your skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>However, it helped me to get rid of most blackheads.</li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>I am very happy and relieved to find a soap I can actually</li>

            <li>I broke out more too.</li>
            <li>Most cleansers I have used were in a foam soap.</li>
            <li>Just be sure you are not allergic to sulfur</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t look more radiant.  </li>
            <li>I am being told by family members that I must be drinking more water.</li>
            <li>I received mine free or at a promotional discount for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and honest opinions after using this soap myself.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin nice and smooth by removing oils off skin.</li>

            <li>We have been using the Adovia Sulfur Soap and enjoying the benefits from it.</li>
            <li>I had to update my review, because after continued use of this soap I have noticed that my skin is considerably better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this soap.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I had the chance to review this.</li>
            <li>When I showered with Adovia Sulfur Soap I made sure to wash my face and my body with that, just to see how it would affect my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have not had any acne breakouts since using this soap either, which I am very excited about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling nice and clean.</li>
            <li>My face always felt nice and clean after every use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this leaves my skin feeling very clean</li>
            <li>but it also felt very clean.</li>
            <li>I am willing to try anything that is good for my skin and may help it though.</li>
            <li>I used this soap every morning for seven days because I wanted to have a true and honest result, and the truth is this:  </li>
            <li>My face was in good shape the morning after the first use of the Adovia Sulfur Soap.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love using this soap specially during &amp;#34;that time of the month&amp;#34; when all my &amp;#34;face demons&amp;#34; come out to play!</li>
            <li>I had to opportunity to try out this product by the company and was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>I think, I haven&#x27;t experienced any New breakouts and my skin feels moisturized but not greasy.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it does not over dry my face or irritate it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells pleasant and lathers up really well.</li>

            <li>however, where my skin was oily (T-Zone) it was shiny and squeaky clean!</li>
            <li>My face feels nice, smooth and clean</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing oil face washes and for my skin type that works okay, but I&#x27;ve found that sulfur soap like this works pretty nicely.</li>
            <li>My face is more smooth now.</li>
            <li>This soap works great on my sensitive skin as it doesn&#x27;t irritate or harm my skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff worked great on my not so clear skin.  </li>
            <li>It works great on any blemishes I have and also helps clear up any eczema that shows up.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free.</li>
            <li>However, it smelled nothing like Sulfer and had a really nice fresh soapy scent</li>

            <li>I have a full review at http://beautybymitchypoo.com</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>This is a good soap,with continued use,you will definitely see results...........</li>
            <li>but there is no bad smell at all.  </li>
            <li>The soap does not leave her skin feeling dry nor oily so it’s a perfect combination of ingredients to provide natural feeling skin.  </li>
            <li>In bar form, this soap has a nice clean, fresh scent, not chemical or overly natural, as some products can be, it does not at all smell like sulfur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to wait to use the soap because of a medical procedure, but so far it is very good.</li>
            <li>It leaves me feeling clean and fresh without overdrying my skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see a difference in my acne, but my face felt so clean and fresh after using this soap.</li>
            <li>I love that it is 100% natural and its also fragrance free with somethings</li>
            <li>but luckily my skin took well to the soap</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before I continue on though I must say that I don&#x27;t have super acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have used many soaps with labels that I adore from absolutely sassy and fresh to something that looks like it jumped out of the 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Mild and has caused no irritation up to this point.</li>
            <li>I am hoping their overall success is as good.</li>
            <li>I have to say for a bar of soap my expectations weren&#x27;t high, but after using this soap I expect so much more from soaps now and was blown</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty light smelling.</li>
            <li>I am one of those that has to be very consistent about washing with this soap after sweating.</li>
            <li>The smell is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>and it actually left my face feeling nice and clean.</li>
            <li>i wanted to know if it was going to be easy to rinse off it really was.</li>
            <li>The bar is pretty big, and you will get a good month or so out of it.</li>
            <li>When I first open the box I noticed that the soap is unscented, which is good.</li>
            <li>Helps your skin to stay healthy and soft!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you try this if you haven&#x27;t already done so!!!</li>
            <li>It left my skin healthy and glowing!</li>
            <li>I love all of the Adovia products that I have tried so far!</li>
            <li>Even in high humidity my face stayed clean and shine free for hours.</li>
            <li>works great but leaves a little bit of a residue on my face that i have to scrub off with another cleanser</li>
            <li>Received it in the mail a few days ago and my face looks great, nose pores aren&#x27;t as noticeable</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so happy I found Adovia&#x27;s Sulfur Soap with Dead Sea Salt for Face &amp; Body.  </li>

            <li>Once I started switching to as many natural products as I could it did help some</li>
            <li>Love its natural.</li>
            <li>now if they could just make this in shampoo form my life would be complete :)</li>

            <li>I write only my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I have been seeking products that I can use for myself and feel confident in their safety as well as their claims of being natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These things, along with my desire to find a product that is safe and natural for my skin, made me eager to try.  </li>

            <li>The bar is enriched with natural oils and leaves my skin feeling healthy and happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>think for anyone, of any age, this would be a product that is worthwhile, to see if it can help clear up problem skin conditions.</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.</li>
            <li>So far I have been using this soap for two days and have just fallen in love with it.</li>
            <li>Overall, I liked this product</li>
            <li>My face felt clean, smooth, and soft!</li>
            <li>It is always important to read all the details before trying a new skin care regime regardless of its natural claims, it might not be suitable for all skin types.</li>
            <li>It does not melt down or get soft easily which is pretty impressive and there is no waste.</li>
            <li>During various times of the month and year, my skin tends to become more oily in spots, and I notice that I always get more acne breakouts than normal.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin so most products that claim to help with acne tend to dry out my skin a great deal , but was pleasantly surprised that this wasn&#x27;t the case with adovia&#x27;s sulfur soap.</li>
            <li>very well making me feel clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I love the incredibly mild scent that the soap has and feel confident that it can be used daily, if necessary, to clean my skin without drying it out.</li>
            <li>The soap lathers well and rinses clean leaving the skin feeling really soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I let it dry and put it back in the box, which isn&#x27;t ideal but worked for me.</li>
            <li>yet my skin had felt super smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive this to review for my blog and I am in love with it.</li>
            <li>She wants to add to this review after completing a full bar of the Adovia.  </li>
            <li>My girls haven&#x27;t really had the time to get the full results, so we&#x27;ll hold off on that, but</li>
            <li>I can pronounce all the ingredients and it made my skin feel so soft and smooth after just the first wash!</li>
            <li>it will be an amazing product it does dry out your face</li>
            <li>Most of all, I&#x27;m glad it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>I strongly suggest ordering from goPure Naturals or Professional Beauty Group.    </li>
            <li>It is not always easy to find products that thoroughly cleanse our face without stripping it from the natural moisture</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>After cleaning my face and neck with the soap, my skin is very soft and smooth feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>I really liked it at first, but after continued use, my face is really dry and has cystic acne.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s actually very gentle.</li>
            <li>This soap is very gentle on my sometimes-sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, first time I used this soap and rinsed with water what a difference!</li>
            <li>it has a funny smell when you use it on your body</li>
            <li>that is exactly what my skin needs.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product when I first received it</li>
            <li>I am completely sulfate free.</li>
            <li>No weird fragrances.</li>
            <li>Immediately, when I took the soap out of the box the first thing I did was sniff it.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my skin after the first use.</li>
            <li>Lets face it, heat plus bra straps rubbing on your skin can create a pretty sore rash.</li>
            <li>but I would not attest to it&#x27;s benefits without fully trying it first.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>The only thing I found that I want not totally in love with was the scent or lack of, but over all I was really impressed by this, I would recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried facials and many different over-the-counter products.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;ve used Adovia skin care products before, so before I received this</li>
            <li>I tried the soap on my face first.</li>
            <li>so I was pretty iffy about it.</li>
            <li>Who knew you could have breakouts and hot flashes....</li>
            <li>MY PERSONAL REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have reviewed so many of Adovia&#x27;s products and I will say-</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to use this soap at first, because it has sulfur in it after all.</li>
            <li>I really like this soap!</li>
            <li>This is an expensive but excellent product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer:  I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>It really clears my face up and also get rid of fungal infections!</li>
            <li>definitely need to be sure to exfoliate after using for a while.</li>
            <li>but this has revealed to me that sulfur is good for my acne prone skin plus the dead sea salt</li>
            <li>I was excited to try Adovia 100% Natural Sulfur Soap for Acne, Blackheads and Oily Skin.</li>
            <li>Some other sulfur soap are cheaper and may be as effective.</li>
            <li>have been using it for a few days now, and have been really happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>your face will be clean and clear of pimples.</li>
            <li>After use, I felt really clean and the soap didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This sulfur soap helps to regulate the oils in my skin and leave my face feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>but it will leave your skin feeling clean and soft for hours.</li>
            <li>Very deep cleaning, all natural ingredients, and effective.</li>
            <li>The positive results people were getting made me feel that this soap might help me.  </li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li>After a week of using everyday my skin had fewer breakouts and best of all no redness or irritation like other acne products I have tried.</li>
            <li>It is soft and clean my face really well.</li>
            <li>Just like i said make sure to use the moisturizer after it encase your skin goes from oily to dry like mine!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many soaps dry out my skin, but not Adovia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have also found that it&#x27;s improved many of my dry patches I have along with soften any acne prone areas I have.</li>
            <li>It did a great job of cleansing and getting deep down in the pores getting all the dirt out while not drying her face out.</li>
            <li>love that my face feels clean and moisturized while at the same time I don&#x27;t feel any kind of film that some soaps leave behind.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin, leaves soft and healthy feeling, cleans the pores well.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I could tell immediately during the first use that it was made of high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>The Dead Sea Salt part of the soap is amazing.</li>
            <li>i will just use it to wash my face its very creamy</li>
            <li>It really cleanses my face, and helps heal my acne.</li>
            <li>and I noticed anything with salt/ saltwater would get rid my acne fairly fast.</li>
            <li>He continues to use it on his face and seems to really like it.</li>
            <li>Hubby has a skin condition that makes his face get really irritated and peel.  </li>
            <li>I like this product, I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve never been much for directions)</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>

            <li>I am a very oily person.</li>
            <li>Soap is very slippery with water.</li>
            <li>This really works for stubborn body acne.</li>

            <li>I really like this soap.</li>

            <li>It worked well on my face and that  left absolutely fabulous  results.</li>
            <li>thanks aunt flo</li>
            <li>and it hasn&#x27;t really helped my face that I can notice.</li>
            <li>soap thoroughly cleanses your face and body and leaves your skin gentle and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Our</li>
            <li>and it lathered really well.</li>
            <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t care for the sulphur smell, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, and I am normally very averse to scented soaps and lotions.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it!</li>
            <li>Really reduces the oil, shine, and blackheads over time.</li>
            <li>It also made my skin really red.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I really had nothing to lose by trying this product.</li>
            <li>but now I don&#x27;t have to say anything because he loves how it&#x27;s helping his skin and WANTS to use it.</li>
            <li>Rinses clean and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>and this really cures the inflammation immediately after the bath.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>think it is important to know the ingredients in personal care products, so here is a list of the ingredients (according to the label):</li>
            <li>This soap thoroughly cleanses your face and body and leaves your skin gentle and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>10/10!&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free.</li>
            <li>10/10!&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free.</li>
            <li>But THIS soap didn&#x27;t do that at all, in fact after just two days of use the condition of my skin is much improved.</li>
            <li>I really like this soap</li>
            <li>and it really really calms my rosacea.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Tomoson.com</li>
            <li>I no longer break out as much as I used it.</li>
            <li>I use it to wash off my makeup (also tried removing makeup with facial wipes followed by using the soap and did not see any difference compared to using the soap alone) at night followed by applying an oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li>, they are known to have many different therapeutic qualities and the soap is derived from all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Last month Adovia Mineral Skin care was nice enough to send me a bar of their Sulfer Soap for Acne to review.</li>
            <li>I am very pleasantly surprised and pleased with this soap overall.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>As someone with sensitive skin I really loved this Sulfur Soap with Dead Sea salt by Adovia Mineral Skin Care.</li>
            <li>I will admit that while it did not live up to my high standards I did see a decease in my acne breakouts and my blackheads, I just wanted to see more.</li>
            <li>You can still see them but they&#x27;re getting more and more faint (right before my eyes...</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and this soap leaves my face feeling not only clean but pure.</li>
            <li>I have purchased other Adovia products and have had nothing but good experiences and this soap is no different.  </li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself.</li>
            <li>I have purchased other Adovia products and were pleased with their products as well.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>But the first day I used it I could feel a complete difference in my skin!</li>
            <li>From a seller I trust due to other products I have tried and liked, I can feel secure that this soap is what it claims to</li>
            <li>I had used this soap everyday love it makes my skin soft not dry out my skin like most soaps</li>
            <li>This soap left me feeling clean after use</li>
            <li>My skin can dry out so easily</li>
            <li>read the many positive reviews about Adovia Mneral Skin Care &amp;#34;Sulfur Soap with Dead Seas Salt for Face &amp; Body.  </li>
            <li>I promise to report back with my findings, but so far I only have amazing things to</li>
            <li>Before I tried this line I have never had good luck with skin products simply because they either dried my skin too much, or made it too oily.</li>
            <li>Soap is nice but the bar is really small and WAY overpriced</li>
            <li>This is the first natural skin product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>They were extremely friendly and sent out a new soap on the same day..</li>
            <li>I love that I have a very minimal regimen now!  </li>
            <li>Adovia Sulfur Soap for Acne, Blackheads and Oily Skin with Dead Sea Salt - 100% Natural is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>This one has lasted over 2 months with more than half to go.</li>
            <li>I have been using it daily for four weeks now, and my face is almost completely cleared, free of acne.</li>
            <li>to the point where I have to blot several times a day but with this soap I can wash my face in the morning and be almost completely oil free by the time i wash my face at night...</li>
            <li>I used it for hand washing mainly.</li>
            <li>Works so good, on the skin, gets that dead skin gone in a instant.</li>
            <li>Classic design is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>The main reason why I wanted to try this soap was because I suffer from acne.</li>
            <li>The soap is infused with moisturizing ingredients such as olive oil and Aloe Vera to keep skin soft and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I have had positive results with the soap so far</li>
            <li>She has had positive results with the soap so far and has plans to continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this soap for those who workout a lot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed that this soap works and it is high quality</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I always have some seriously high expectations.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it has a high reviews.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations of quality.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>never used a bar soap for my face though, so my skepticism was at an all time high.</li>
            <li>high reccomend this item with Aztec Clay Mask.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend it</li>
            <li>It does not have a strong smell either, like other sulfur soaps.  </li>
            <li>I love that this soap is highly enriched with minerals and sulfur from the Dead Sea.  </li>
            <li>Rinses clean, doesn&#x27;t leave skin dry.</li>
            <li>I was searching for a product to help clear up my body breakouts that occur during the warmer months, and to get ready for my upcoming wedding.</li>
            <li>I used this bar soap in the shower, and I was pleasantly surprised that it didn&#x27;t really have a fragrance.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or anything</li>
            <li>The scent is also very subtle--this pleasantly surprised me since it contains sulfur.</li>
            <li>You would never know sulfur is the soap as there is no negative scent.</li>
            <li>I love that it has dead sea salts and</li>
            <li>I love how my skin feels after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li>I rarely use bars of soap during shower or hand washing, only because all the boys make messes in and around the bathroom, and when I get another chance to use it, water washed it all away, so I store them in a ziplock.</li>
            <li>I love Adovia products and have had the opportunity to review a few.</li>
            <li>I have what you would label normal skin.</li>
            <li>I love the Olive Oil, Dead Sea minerals, and Aloe Vera extract it has in it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s firm and not crumbly like many hand wash bars of this size.</li>
            <li>but it has many beneficial ingredients infused in it including the Dead Sea minerals.</li>
            <li>I think I need a few more bars to give as gifts.</li>
            <li>Some of the ingredients include olive oil, the famous Dead Sea Minerals, and Aloe Vera extract.</li>
            <li>but I’m being honest at least.</li>
            <li>My quest is taking me down the natural path, as it is many others.</li>
            <li>What I love about this product is the natural Adovia soap is highly enriched with minerals and sulfur from the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li>I have combination to oily skin and with the warmer months ahead, I was looking for a new face soap and came across this bar.</li>
            <li>For those who are new to using sulfur on their skin, you should work your way up to using it.</li>
            <li>I have never in my life heard of &amp;#34;Sulfer Soap&amp;#34; so this was a new concept for me.</li>
            <li>I live Adovia soap and products from Adovia.</li>
            <li>Well, it ended up looking like a New England snow storm in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>I have been using the bar 2 twice for about a month and the bar still looks like a brand new bar.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have oily or dry spots, it is just evenly clean and clear.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care if it&#x27;s natural fragrance, because any time I use a product with natural fragrance, unnatural fragrance, any fragrance, I break out and get itchy.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I have Very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The soap made my skin very soft and there was a visible difference in the way it looked.</li>
            <li>and I must say it leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels very soft, not stripped of oils, after using.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend this soap to anyone who in in the market to try a natural skin product.</li>
            <li>Very good, but very expensive for a bar of soap.</li>
            <li>This soap helps to clear up my whiteheads, blackheads, and oiliness!</li>
            <li>The salts and sulfur from this sea are supposed to work wonders on skin and are, according to legend, what Cleopatra used when she was alive!</li>
            <li>Any time I get a chance to try a natural product, I take it!</li>
            <li>Adovia Natural Sulfur Soap is a quality made product infused with ingredients that will keep your acne at bay.&lt;br /&gt;Every time I use Adovia on my face, I notice that my skin feels, and looks smoother!</li>
            <li>It won’t irritate your skin because it’s made with all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>If you have acne on your face or body the Adovia Natural Sulfur Soap is for you!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given the opportunity to try Adovia Natural Sulfur Soap, and I jumped on it!</li>
            <li>An added plus is that this soap doesn’t irritate your skin because it’s made with all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unscented and a really pretty yellow colored bar.</li>
            <li>I found this and am now excited to try some other products from this line.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and the product hasn&#x27;t made my face more dry .</li>
            <li>I am usually pretty hesitant to try new facial cleansing products because I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I like using this soap as it is very gentle and the Aloe Vera and Olive Oil moisturize and heal skin while the 3% sulfur helps clear up skin conditions such as Eczema and Acne.</li>
            <li>Looks like I found me a new all natural body soap.</li>
            <li>I got to try it out right after a long day at the beach.</li>
            <li>think the Adovia Natural Sulfur Soap is perfect for anyone that suffers from acne prone skin!</li>
            <li>I like how it completely removes the oil on my skin particularly on my back where i get breakouts while at the same time keeping it moisturized and looking clean.</li>
            <li>I started washing my face with this soap immediately at the first side of a red bump, and I was surprised at the results over 3 days.</li>
            <li>I have nothing to gain by leaving a positive review, this is simply my opinion from how it worked for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little put-off by the smell of the soap (smells are HUGE for me.</li>
            <li>I significantly have noticed less of them, when I use this</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I read a little more about this soap and decided to use it on my hands, legs, arms and back.</li>
            <li>Love his aroma, I was expecting a hard odor but not.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make my skin feel dry, like many other bar soaps do to my hands and body.</li>
            <li>The Adovia Natural Sulfar soap is enriched with Olive oil, Aloe Vera, Palm Oil, Dead Sea Minerals and Sulfar; to deeply clean down into your pores and draw out those impurities and yet still leaves your skin beautifully soft, balanced, and oil free all day.</li>
            <li>It did clear up my cheeks *</li>
            <li>Hopefully this will continue until I have the clear skin I have always had.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After 2 weeks my skin is clear again.  </li>
            <li>I do believe that it has helped clear up my acne prone skin</li>
            <li>really did like the soap but was unaware it shouldn&#x27;t be used on sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It cleans my face really well--when I use an astringent afterwards there&#x27;s not a lot of extra dirt that comes off.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive and oily combination skin and have been using this soap for my face over a month now</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m surprised with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna continue to use it and see if it can clear my skin up completely.</li>
            <li>I have horribly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Switching to natural products for my skin, like the use of sulfur soap, has reduced dryness and the irritation of my psoriasis.</li>
            <li>product contains 3% sulfur, which removes old skin cells, removes impurities and unclogs pores.</li>
            <li>After 1 week, my adult acne has minimized by 80%.</li>
            <li>My skin is looking far healthier and am no longer using the vitamin C face soap for &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>and it leaves a soft feeling on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This soap didn&#x27;t give me any type of side effect for using it so far</li>
            <li>I decided to try out all natural soaps for the face and body.</li>
            <li>I know this may seem strange, but I had wondered since I first ordered it rather or not it would smell like Sulfur.</li>
            <li>I washed with this, and in about 4 days time, the rash was completely gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin remained soft use after use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have used it almost completely up.</li>
            <li>I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have used this soap as a facial cleanser as well as a whole body wash in the shower.  </li>
            <li>and I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>All of the symptoms are completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still have acne marks, but as far as acne I don&#x27;t have them.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin on my face and my face did not like this soap.</li>
            <li>Another plus was when my mail carrier managed to lose my package I decided to contact the seller directly about my issue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is the Adovia Natural Sulfur Soap.</li>
            <li>its taken about three weeks (its natural not drugs)</li>
            <li>but his face is just about completely cleared definetely recommend.</li>
            <li>soap creates a creamy lather that feels soft, and has no scent at all.</li>
            <li>No heavy fragrances</li>
            <li>my face was nearly pimple, blackhead, and bump</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and rosacea.  </li>
            <li>Fits my skin and soft</li>
            <li>The Adovia Natural Sulfur Soap doesn’t have a scent either.</li>
            <li>It all natural</li>
            <li>The bar itself and very dense and seems like it will last quite a while, unlike some softer soap bars that seem to melt away quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I wanted to find a natural sulfur soap.</li>
            <li>I have cycstic acne prone, oily, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Not as drying as my old soaps</li>
            <li>It is not harsh at all.  </li>
            <li>Their is no harsh smell and</li>
            <li>Most soaps and cleansers either leave my face completely dried out or feeling like there’s some waxy residue left on my skin</li>
            <li>At least as effective as the $75 dollar prescription acne cleanser I used to get with about the same ingredients in it, except in a cream/gel form.</li>
            <li>I’m supper excited to try and share with you my “Adovia Sulfur Soap for Acne, Blackheads and Oily Skin with Dead Sea Salt - 100% Natural Review!”  </li>
            <li>It cleans nicely, removes dirt and unclogs pores, all without irritating or drying out my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I can actually leave the house without make-up because my skin is so clear!!!</li>
            <li>This soap is great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other bar soaps have done in the past.</li>
            <li>I clean my face everyday using Adovia Day time and Night time.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and the oily parts felt squeaky clean while the dry/sensitive parts did not get irritated or dried out.</li>
            <li>It just absorbed all the oil off of my skin, within the first 3 days I started to see a difference with my acne, it was clearing it up and the blackheads were disappearing slowly.</li>
            <li>This made my skin vibrant and made my pores look smaller.</li>
            <li>I try not to be high maintenance, But, eh, its just  something that comes with womanly nature.</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because I think that the price is a bit high considering the size of the actual bar.  </li>
            <li>After using the soap for about a week I could already see his back starting to clear up and blackheads not getting to be as large.</li>
            <li>Because it only happens on various occasions I don&#x27;t really have any sort of products I use to help clear it up.</li>
            <li>so I tried many things in the last two months that ended up leaving my skin dried out, still breaking out or left me smelling like the perfume counter at Macys.  </li>
            <li>One of the things I like about it, it is affordable and not expensive like other natural soaps or acne face washes.</li>
            <li>After about a week of using it, I started following up with a oil free moisturizer afterwards because my skin was feeling a little dry/tight.</li>
            <li>It has really helped my dry skin.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling soft, and seemed to help clear up some spots that I had on my face, but time will tell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>bar is very large and will likely last a LONG time.</li>
            <li>I am 35 year old guy who has always washed head to toe with my trusty bar of Irish Spring.  </li>
            <li>not really my toes, but my whole body basically).</li>
            <li>not only is it soft now</li>
            <li>My pimples arent completely gone but you can see the big difference compare to before.</li>
            <li>using this Adovia Natural Sulfar Soap and start seeing your skin transform with daily use.</li>
            <li>The Natural Sulfur Soap is not different.</li>
            <li>We wanted to try this soap for its claims on Acne and Blackheads and Eczema, what we didn&#x27;t realize is that it wasn&#x27;t necessarily &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; for my sensitive skin, but I had to try it anyway.</li>
            <li>Obviously a soap made out of natural ingredients shouldn’t smell like perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It left her face feeling soft and supple.</li>
            <li>My acne hasn&#x27;t got any better or worse.</li>
            <li>I noticed that my skin looks a little more radiant and less patchy.</li>
            <li>it makes my face feel very soft after rinsing the soap off i used very little water when i first applied the soap so i can work the soap into my skin</li>
            <li>honestly this soap made me worse and made my skin so dry.</li>
            <li>and I remember how bad that smelled in high school, but there is hardly any scent at all to this wonderful soap!</li>
            <li>this product has not made my face anymore dry than what it normally is.</li>
            <li>It may be too drying for those with normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>I used this soap on my face and it didn&#x27;t dry my skin and make it look ashy like most products that have all those harsh chemicals!!</li>
            <li>and this doesn&#x27;t smell so much like a volcano as the other ones did.</li>
            <li>This product is fairly inexpensive but cuts down on my facial redness without irritating it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it morning and night on my face for the last 4 days and have been pleasantly surprised how the soap has left me feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>, well I have sensitive facial skin after reading the box, I had discovered it wasn&#x27;t just a facial soap it can be used on the body as well.</li>
            <li>It does work and does not dry out her skin.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin and it is keeping me</li>
            <li>it does work on pimples and it does not dry out my face  will reorder</li>
            <li>i definitely recommend this if u are looking for major oil control....</li>
            <li>have slight acne issues and after first use the next morning</li>
            <li>There are other facial bars that don&#x27;t really lather</li>
            <li>i have been using grandpa&#x27;s sulfur and it takes out the itch and the skin problems but is pretty drying, harsh etc...</li>
            <li>It works for my overly sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li>I got this soap to try to wean myself off of Avar (very expensive), and so far, it does seem to be effective.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry me out like some reviews have stated, but I don&#x27;t really have very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I really wished that it would maintain it&#x27;s salt and sulfur composition a little longer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin like other sulfur soaps.</li>

            <li> I use it morning and at night, with warm water, and a wash rag, and that&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li> say!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, customer service is amazing and incredibly helpful(I had an issue with shipping—</li>

            <li> It is a nice smelling soap.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;These are my honest opinions after having tried this product&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and we own a salt water pool</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a real fragrance to it, so that was awesome.</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> All views and opinions are 100% my own and have neither been paid for nor sponsored.</li>
            <li> I did receive a discount to try it  and give my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> and it is nice.</li>
            <li> Sulfur has Antiseptic, Anti-Fungal and Antibacterial properties and this soap is most known for treating acne, but also has good results with treating cases of Scabies(sulfur is toxic to the mites), Seborrheic Dermatitis(kills</li>

            <li> Disclosure, Adovia sent me this product for review, however my opinion is 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I also liked that it had antiseptic and antibacterial properties.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say I didn’t get either feeling with this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thanks so much to Adovia for another great product!</li>
            <li> It lathers very well and feels great!</li>
            <li> After using them both I can honestly say I did not see any improvement of the acne on my chest reducing.</li>
            <li> my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
            <li> While I find it effective for my breakouts, I am not qualified to comment on how effective it is for chronic acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I use it on my body and am loving it.</li>

            <li> Pretty good!</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft, looks youthful, and feels great when using this soap!!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a perfect combination of ingredients to provide natural feeling skin.</li>
            <li> It is a nice size bar, that produces a good lather and doesn&#x27;t dissolve too quickly, wasting the bar of soap.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite soap ever!!!</li>
            <li> I think this is a great soap for people who have severe or constant breakouts as I feel the sulfur would aid greatly in these cases.</li>
            <li> I received this product free for review purposes and I am very glad I did.</li>
            <li> it has a very mild pleasant smell as a bar, but it truly is fragrance free on your skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> However, it helped me to get rid of most blackheads.</li>
            <li> Fabulous!</li>
            <li> I am very happy and relieved to find a soap I can actually</li>

            <li> I love this soap</li>
            <li> I broke out more too.</li>
            <li> Most cleansers I have used were in a foam soap.</li>
            <li> Just be sure you are not allergic to sulfur</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t look more radiant.  </li>
            <li> I am being told by family members that I must be drinking more water.</li>
            <li> I received mine free or at a promotional discount for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and honest opinions after using this soap myself.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin nice and smooth by removing oils off skin.</li>

            <li> I was so impressed I purchased a second bar!</li>

            <li> sure helped a bunch.</li>
            <li> We have been using the Adovia Sulfur Soap and enjoying the benefits from it.</li>
            <li> I had to update my review, because after continued use of this soap I have noticed that my skin is considerably better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this soap.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I had the chance to review this.</li>
            <li> When I showered with Adovia Sulfur Soap I made sure to wash my face and my body with that, just to see how it would affect my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have not had any acne breakouts since using this soap either, which I am very excited about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just nice and clean.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling nice and clean.</li>
            <li> My face always felt nice and clean after every use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this leaves my skin feeling very clean</li>
            <li> but it also felt very clean.</li>
            <li> I am willing to try anything that is good for my skin and may help it though.</li>
            <li> I used this soap every morning for seven days because I wanted to have a true and honest result, and the truth is this:  </li>
            <li> My face was in good shape the morning after the first use of the Adovia Sulfur Soap.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love using this soap specially during &amp;#34;that time of the month&amp;#34; when all my &amp;#34;face demons&amp;#34; come out to play!</li>
            <li> I had to opportunity to try out this product by the company and was not disappointed!</li>
            <li> I think, I haven&#x27;t experienced any New breakouts and my skin feels moisturized but not greasy.</li>
            <li> The best part is that it does not over dry my face or irritate it</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells pleasant and lathers up really well.</li>
            <li> One of the great things about Adovia Natural Sulfur Soap is that it’s affordable!</li>
            <li> Leaves me feeling clean!</li>
            <li> however, where my skin was oily (T-Zone) it was shiny and squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> My face feels nice, smooth and clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing oil face washes and for my skin type that works okay, but I&#x27;ve found that sulfur soap like this works pretty nicely.</li>
            <li> My face is more smooth now.</li>
            <li> This soap works great on my sensitive skin as it doesn&#x27;t irritate or harm my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked great on my not so clear skin.  </li>
            <li> It works great on any blemishes I have and also helps clear up any eczema that shows up.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free.</li>
            <li> However, it smelled nothing like Sulfer and had a really nice fresh soapy scent</li>

            <li> Since becoming sulfate free, I use my sulfur spot cream about once every 4-6 months.</li>
            <li> Great soap for anyone with oily skin, blackheads, or just fights with acne in general.</li>

            <li> I have a full review at http://beautybymitchypoo.com</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> This is a good soap,with continued use,you will definitely see results...........</li>
            <li> but there is no bad smell at all.  </li>
            <li> The soap does not leave her skin feeling dry nor oily so it’s a perfect combination of ingredients to provide natural feeling skin.  </li>
            <li> In bar form, this soap has a nice clean, fresh scent, not chemical or overly natural, as some products can be, it does not at all smell like sulfur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to wait to use the soap because of a medical procedure, but so far it is very good.</li>
            <li> It leaves me feeling clean and fresh without overdrying my skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference in my acne, but my face felt so clean and fresh after using this soap.</li>
            <li> I love that it is 100% natural and its also fragrance free with somethings</li>
            <li> but luckily my skin took well to the soap</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I continue on though I must say that I don&#x27;t have super acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have used many soaps with labels that I adore from absolutely sassy and fresh to something that looks like it jumped out of the 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Mild and has caused no irritation up to this point.</li>
            <li> I am hoping their overall success is as good.</li>
            <li> I have to say for a bar of soap my expectations weren&#x27;t high, but after using this soap I expect so much more from soaps now and was blown</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty light smelling.</li>
            <li> I am one of those that has to be very consistent about washing with this soap after sweating.</li>
            <li> The smell is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> and it actually left my face feeling nice and clean.</li>
            <li> i wanted to know if it was going to be easy to rinse off it really was.</li>
            <li> The bar is pretty big, and you will get a good month or so out of it.</li>
            <li> When I first open the box I noticed that the soap is unscented, which is good.</li>
            <li> Helps your skin to stay healthy and soft!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you try this if you haven&#x27;t already done so!!!</li>
            <li> It left my skin healthy and glowing!</li>
            <li> I love all of the Adovia products that I have tried so far!</li>
            <li> Even in high humidity my face stayed clean and shine free for hours.</li>
            <li> works great but leaves a little bit of a residue on my face that i have to scrub off with another cleanser</li>
            <li> Received it in the mail a few days ago and my face looks great, nose pores aren&#x27;t as noticeable</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so happy I found Adovia&#x27;s Sulfur Soap with Dead Sea Salt for Face &amp; Body.  </li>
            <li> Leaving your skin gentle and smooth this soap with thoroughly cleanse your face and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once I started switching to as many natural products as I could it did help some</li>
            <li> Love its natural.</li>
            <li> now if they could just make this in shampoo form my life would be complete :)</li>
            <li> This soap is pretty sweet.</li>
            <li> I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using an online site.</li>
            <li> Also, I love that is 100% natural.</li>

            <li> I was able to try this for review and I have to admit, it was better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I write only my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I have been seeking products that I can use for myself and feel confident in their safety as well as their claims of being natural.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These things, along with my desire to find a product that is safe and natural for my skin, made me eager to try.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;</li>

            <li> This is a plus, because it makes it totally worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy that she has gained even an ounce of her confidence back with the results she&#x27;s seen so far.</li>

            <li> The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and wasn&#x27;t sure this would make a difference</li>
            <li> But, I can’t wait for Summer to come back again so that I can show off how nice my skin is.</li>
            <li> The bar is enriched with natural oils and leaves my skin feeling healthy and happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> think for anyone, of any age, this would be a product that is worthwhile, to see if it can help clear up problem skin conditions.</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.</li>
            <li> So far I have been using this soap for two days and have just fallen in love with it.</li>
            <li> Overall, I liked this product</li>
            <li> My face felt clean, smooth, and soft!</li>
            <li> It is always important to read all the details before trying a new skin care regime regardless of its natural claims, it might not be suitable for all skin types.</li>
            <li> It does not melt down or get soft easily which is pretty impressive and there is no waste.</li>
            <li> During various times of the month and year, my skin tends to become more oily in spots, and I notice that I always get more acne breakouts than normal.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so most products that claim to help with acne tend to dry out my skin a great deal , but was pleasantly surprised that this wasn&#x27;t the case with adovia&#x27;s sulfur soap.</li>
            <li> very well making me feel clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> I love the incredibly mild scent that the soap has and feel confident that it can be used daily, if necessary, to clean my skin without drying it out.</li>
            <li> The soap lathers well and rinses clean leaving the skin feeling really soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I let it dry and put it back in the box, which isn&#x27;t ideal but worked for me.</li>
            <li> yet my skin had felt super smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this to review for my blog and I am in love with it.</li>
            <li> She wants to add to this review after completing a full bar of the Adovia.  </li>
            <li> My girls haven&#x27;t really had the time to get the full results, so we&#x27;ll hold off on that, but</li>
            <li> I can pronounce all the ingredients and it made my skin feel so soft and smooth after just the first wash!</li>
            <li> it will be an amazing product it does dry out your face</li>
            <li> Most of all, I&#x27;m glad it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I strongly suggest ordering from goPure Naturals or Professional Beauty Group.    </li>
            <li> It is not always easy to find products that thoroughly cleanse our face without stripping it from the natural moisture</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> After cleaning my face and neck with the soap, my skin is very soft and smooth feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> I really liked it at first, but after continued use, my face is really dry and has cystic acne.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s actually very gentle.</li>
            <li> This soap is very gentle on my sometimes-sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, first time I used this soap and rinsed with water what a difference!</li>
            <li> it has a funny smell when you use it on your body</li>
            <li> that is exactly what my skin needs.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product when I first received it</li>
            <li> I am completely sulfate free.</li>
            <li> No weird fragrances.</li>
            <li> Immediately, when I took the soap out of the box the first thing I did was sniff it.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin after the first use.</li>
            <li> Lets face it, heat plus bra straps rubbing on your skin can create a pretty sore rash.</li>
            <li> but I would not attest to it&#x27;s benefits without fully trying it first.</li>
            <li> It also leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> The only thing I found that I want not totally in love with was the scent or lack of, but over all I was really impressed by this, I would recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried facials and many different over-the-counter products.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;ve used Adovia skin care products before, so before I received this</li>
            <li> I tried the soap on my face first.</li>
            <li> so I was pretty iffy about it.</li>
            <li> Who knew you could have breakouts and hot flashes....</li>
            <li> MY PERSONAL REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have reviewed so many of Adovia&#x27;s products and I will say-</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to use this soap at first, because it has sulfur in it after all.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap!</li>
            <li> This is an expensive but excellent product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer:  I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> It really clears my face up and also get rid of fungal infections!</li>
            <li> definitely need to be sure to exfoliate after using for a while.</li>
            <li> but this has revealed to me that sulfur is good for my acne prone skin plus the dead sea salt</li>
            <li> I was excited to try Adovia 100% Natural Sulfur Soap for Acne, Blackheads and Oily Skin.</li>
            <li> Some other sulfur soap are cheaper and may be as effective.</li>
            <li> have been using it for a few days now, and have been really happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> your face will be clean and clear of pimples.</li>
            <li> After use, I felt really clean and the soap didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This sulfur soap helps to regulate the oils in my skin and leave my face feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> but it will leave your skin feeling clean and soft for hours.</li>
            <li> Very deep cleaning, all natural ingredients, and effective.</li>
            <li> The positive results people were getting made me feel that this soap might help me.  </li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li> After a week of using everyday my skin had fewer breakouts and best of all no redness or irritation like other acne products I have tried.</li>
            <li> It is soft and clean my face really well.</li>
            <li> Just like i said make sure to use the moisturizer after it encase your skin goes from oily to dry like mine!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many soaps dry out my skin, but not Adovia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have also found that it&#x27;s improved many of my dry patches I have along with soften any acne prone areas I have.</li>
            <li> It did a great job of cleansing and getting deep down in the pores getting all the dirt out while not drying her face out.</li>
            <li> love that my face feels clean and moisturized while at the same time I don&#x27;t feel any kind of film that some soaps leave behind.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin, leaves soft and healthy feeling, cleans the pores well.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I could tell immediately during the first use that it was made of high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Salt part of the soap is amazing.</li>
            <li> i will just use it to wash my face its very creamy</li>
            <li> It really cleanses my face, and helps heal my acne.</li>
            <li> and I noticed anything with salt/ saltwater would get rid my acne fairly fast.</li>
            <li> He continues to use it on his face and seems to really like it.</li>
            <li> Hubby has a skin condition that makes his face get really irritated and peel.  </li>
            <li> I like this product, I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve never been much for directions)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t see much difference with my acne.</li>
            <li> I am a very oily person.</li>
            <li> Soap is very slippery with water.</li>
            <li> This really works for stubborn body acne.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my face as well as my body, both worked really well.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap.</li>
            <li> This soap has a really vintage appeal going on.</li>
            <li> It worked well on my face and that  left absolutely fabulous  results.</li>

            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t really helped my face that I can notice.</li>
            <li> soap thoroughly cleanses your face and body and leaves your skin gentle and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Our</li>
            <li> and it lathered really well.</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t care for the sulphur smell, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, and I am normally very averse to scented soaps and lotions.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it!</li>
            <li> Really reduces the oil, shine, and blackheads over time.</li>
            <li> It also made my skin really red.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I really had nothing to lose by trying this product.</li>
            <li> but now I don&#x27;t have to say anything because he loves how it&#x27;s helping his skin and WANTS to use it.</li>
            <li> Rinses clean and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> and this really cures the inflammation immediately after the bath.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> think it is important to know the ingredients in personal care products, so here is a list of the ingredients (according to the label):</li>
            <li> This soap thoroughly cleanses your face and body and leaves your skin gentle and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> 10/10!&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free.</li>
            <li> 10/10!&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free.</li>
            <li> But THIS soap didn&#x27;t do that at all, in fact after just two days of use the condition of my skin is much improved.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap</li>
            <li> and it really really calms my rosacea.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Tomoson.com</li>
            <li> I no longer break out as much as I used it.</li>
            <li> I use it to wash off my makeup (also tried removing makeup with facial wipes followed by using the soap and did not see any difference compared to using the soap alone) at night followed by applying an oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li> , they are known to have many different therapeutic qualities and the soap is derived from all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Last month Adovia Mineral Skin care was nice enough to send me a bar of their Sulfer Soap for Acne to review.</li>
            <li> I am very pleasantly surprised and pleased with this soap overall.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> As someone with sensitive skin I really loved this Sulfur Soap with Dead Sea salt by Adovia Mineral Skin Care.</li>
            <li> I will admit that while it did not live up to my high standards I did see a decease in my acne breakouts and my blackheads, I just wanted to see more.</li>
            <li> You can still see them but they&#x27;re getting more and more faint (right before my eyes...</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this soap leaves my face feeling not only clean but pure.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other Adovia products and have had nothing but good experiences and this soap is no different.  </li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other Adovia products and were pleased with their products as well.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> But the first day I used it I could feel a complete difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> From a seller I trust due to other products I have tried and liked, I can feel secure that this soap is what it claims to</li>
            <li> I had used this soap everyday love it makes my skin soft not dry out my skin like most soaps</li>
            <li> This soap left me feeling clean after use</li>
            <li> My skin can dry out so easily</li>
            <li> read the many positive reviews about Adovia Mneral Skin Care &amp;#34;Sulfur Soap with Dead Seas Salt for Face &amp; Body.  </li>
            <li> I promise to report back with my findings, but so far I only have amazing things to</li>
            <li> Before I tried this line I have never had good luck with skin products simply because they either dried my skin too much, or made it too oily.</li>
            <li> Soap is nice but the bar is really small and WAY overpriced</li>
            <li> This is the first natural skin product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> They were extremely friendly and sent out a new soap on the same day..</li>
            <li> I love that I have a very minimal regimen now!  </li>
            <li> Adovia Sulfur Soap for Acne, Blackheads and Oily Skin with Dead Sea Salt - 100% Natural is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> This one has lasted over 2 months with more than half to go.</li>
            <li> I have been using it daily for four weeks now, and my face is almost completely cleared, free of acne.</li>
            <li> to the point where I have to blot several times a day but with this soap I can wash my face in the morning and be almost completely oil free by the time i wash my face at night...</li>
            <li> I used it for hand washing mainly.</li>
            <li> Works so good, on the skin, gets that dead skin gone in a instant.</li>
            <li> Classic design is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> The main reason why I wanted to try this soap was because I suffer from acne.</li>
            <li> The soap is infused with moisturizing ingredients such as olive oil and Aloe Vera to keep skin soft and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I have had positive results with the soap so far</li>
            <li> She has had positive results with the soap so far and has plans to continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this soap for those who workout a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed that this soap works and it is high quality</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I always have some seriously high expectations.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it has a high reviews.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations of quality.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> never used a bar soap for my face though, so my skepticism was at an all time high.</li>
            <li> high reccomend this item with Aztec Clay Mask.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend it</li>
            <li> It does not have a strong smell either, like other sulfur soaps.  </li>
            <li> I love that this soap is highly enriched with minerals and sulfur from the Dead Sea.  </li>
            <li> Rinses clean, doesn&#x27;t leave skin dry.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a product to help clear up my body breakouts that occur during the warmer months, and to get ready for my upcoming wedding.</li>
            <li> I used this bar soap in the shower, and I was pleasantly surprised that it didn&#x27;t really have a fragrance.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or anything</li>
            <li> The scent is also very subtle--this pleasantly surprised me since it contains sulfur.</li>
            <li> You would never know sulfur is the soap as there is no negative scent.</li>
            <li> I love that it has dead sea salts and</li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I rarely use bars of soap during shower or hand washing, only because all the boys make messes in and around the bathroom, and when I get another chance to use it, water washed it all away, so I store them in a ziplock.</li>
            <li> I love Adovia products and have had the opportunity to review a few.</li>
            <li> I have what you would label normal skin.</li>
            <li> I love the Olive Oil, Dead Sea minerals, and Aloe Vera extract it has in it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s firm and not crumbly like many hand wash bars of this size.</li>
            <li> but it has many beneficial ingredients infused in it including the Dead Sea minerals.</li>
            <li> I think I need a few more bars to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> Some of the ingredients include olive oil, the famous Dead Sea Minerals, and Aloe Vera extract.</li>
            <li> but I’m being honest at least.</li>
            <li> My quest is taking me down the natural path, as it is many others.</li>
            <li> What I love about this product is the natural Adovia soap is highly enriched with minerals and sulfur from the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> I have combination to oily skin and with the warmer months ahead, I was looking for a new face soap and came across this bar.</li>
            <li> For those who are new to using sulfur on their skin, you should work your way up to using it.</li>
            <li> I have never in my life heard of &amp;#34;Sulfer Soap&amp;#34; so this was a new concept for me.</li>
            <li> I live Adovia soap and products from Adovia.</li>
            <li> Well, it ended up looking like a New England snow storm in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I have been using the bar 2 twice for about a month and the bar still looks like a brand new bar.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have oily or dry spots, it is just evenly clean and clear.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care if it&#x27;s natural fragrance, because any time I use a product with natural fragrance, unnatural fragrance, any fragrance, I break out and get itchy.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I have Very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The soap made my skin very soft and there was a visible difference in the way it looked.</li>
            <li> and I must say it leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels very soft, not stripped of oils, after using.</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend this soap to anyone who in in the market to try a natural skin product.</li>
            <li> Very good, but very expensive for a bar of soap.</li>
            <li> This soap helps to clear up my whiteheads, blackheads, and oiliness!</li>
            <li> The salts and sulfur from this sea are supposed to work wonders on skin and are, according to legend, what Cleopatra used when she was alive!</li>
            <li> Any time I get a chance to try a natural product, I take it!</li>
            <li> Adovia Natural Sulfur Soap is a quality made product infused with ingredients that will keep your acne at bay.&lt;br /&gt;Every time I use Adovia on my face, I notice that my skin feels, and looks smoother!</li>
            <li> It won’t irritate your skin because it’s made with all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> If you have acne on your face or body the Adovia Natural Sulfur Soap is for you!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given the opportunity to try Adovia Natural Sulfur Soap, and I jumped on it!</li>
            <li> An added plus is that this soap doesn’t irritate your skin because it’s made with all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unscented and a really pretty yellow colored bar.</li>
            <li> I found this and am now excited to try some other products from this line.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and the product hasn&#x27;t made my face more dry .</li>
            <li> I am usually pretty hesitant to try new facial cleansing products because I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I like using this soap as it is very gentle and the Aloe Vera and Olive Oil moisturize and heal skin while the 3% sulfur helps clear up skin conditions such as Eczema and Acne.</li>
            <li> Looks like I found me a new all natural body soap.</li>
            <li> I got to try it out right after a long day at the beach.</li>
            <li> think the Adovia Natural Sulfur Soap is perfect for anyone that suffers from acne prone skin!</li>
            <li> I like how it completely removes the oil on my skin particularly on my back where i get breakouts while at the same time keeping it moisturized and looking clean.</li>
            <li> I started washing my face with this soap immediately at the first side of a red bump, and I was surprised at the results over 3 days.</li>
            <li> I have nothing to gain by leaving a positive review, this is simply my opinion from how it worked for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little put-off by the smell of the soap (smells are HUGE for me.</li>
            <li> I significantly have noticed less of them, when I use this</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I read a little more about this soap and decided to use it on my hands, legs, arms and back.</li>
            <li> Love his aroma, I was expecting a hard odor but not.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my skin feel dry, like many other bar soaps do to my hands and body.</li>
            <li> The Adovia Natural Sulfar soap is enriched with Olive oil, Aloe Vera, Palm Oil, Dead Sea Minerals and Sulfar; to deeply clean down into your pores and draw out those impurities and yet still leaves your skin beautifully soft, balanced, and oil free all day.</li>
            <li> It did clear up my cheeks *</li>
            <li> Hopefully this will continue until I have the clear skin I have always had.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After 2 weeks my skin is clear again.  </li>
            <li> I do believe that it has helped clear up my acne prone skin</li>
            <li> really did like the soap but was unaware it shouldn&#x27;t be used on sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It cleans my face really well--when I use an astringent afterwards there&#x27;s not a lot of extra dirt that comes off.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and oily combination skin and have been using this soap for my face over a month now</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m surprised with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna continue to use it and see if it can clear my skin up completely.</li>
            <li> I have horribly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Switching to natural products for my skin, like the use of sulfur soap, has reduced dryness and the irritation of my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> product contains 3% sulfur, which removes old skin cells, removes impurities and unclogs pores.</li>
            <li> After 1 week, my adult acne has minimized by 80%.</li>
            <li> My skin is looking far healthier and am no longer using the vitamin C face soap for &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> and it leaves a soft feeling on my skin.  </li>
            <li> This soap didn&#x27;t give me any type of side effect for using it so far</li>
            <li> I decided to try out all natural soaps for the face and body.</li>
            <li> I know this may seem strange, but I had wondered since I first ordered it rather or not it would smell like Sulfur.</li>
            <li> I washed with this, and in about 4 days time, the rash was completely gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin remained soft use after use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have used it almost completely up.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have used this soap as a facial cleanser as well as a whole body wash in the shower.  </li>
            <li> and I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> All of the symptoms are completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still have acne marks, but as far as acne I don&#x27;t have them.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin on my face and my face did not like this soap.</li>
            <li> Another plus was when my mail carrier managed to lose my package I decided to contact the seller directly about my issue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is the Adovia Natural Sulfur Soap.</li>
            <li> its taken about three weeks (its natural not drugs)</li>
            <li> but his face is just about completely cleared definetely recommend.</li>
            <li> soap creates a creamy lather that feels soft, and has no scent at all.</li>
            <li> No heavy fragrances</li>
            <li> my face was nearly pimple, blackhead, and bump</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and rosacea.  </li>
            <li> Fits my skin and soft</li>
            <li> The Adovia Natural Sulfur Soap doesn’t have a scent either.</li>
            <li> It all natural</li>
            <li> The bar itself and very dense and seems like it will last quite a while, unlike some softer soap bars that seem to melt away quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far so good!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I wanted to find a natural sulfur soap.</li>
            <li> I have cycstic acne prone, oily, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Not as drying as my old soaps</li>
            <li> It is not harsh at all.  </li>
            <li> Their is no harsh smell and</li>
            <li> Most soaps and cleansers either leave my face completely dried out or feeling like there’s some waxy residue left on my skin</li>
            <li> At least as effective as the $75 dollar prescription acne cleanser I used to get with about the same ingredients in it, except in a cream/gel form.</li>
            <li> I’m supper excited to try and share with you my “Adovia Sulfur Soap for Acne, Blackheads and Oily Skin with Dead Sea Salt - 100% Natural Review!”  </li>
            <li> It cleans nicely, removes dirt and unclogs pores, all without irritating or drying out my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I can actually leave the house without make-up because my skin is so clear!!!</li>
            <li> This soap is great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other bar soaps have done in the past.</li>
            <li> I clean my face everyday using Adovia Day time and Night time.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and the oily parts felt squeaky clean while the dry/sensitive parts did not get irritated or dried out.</li>
            <li> It just absorbed all the oil off of my skin, within the first 3 days I started to see a difference with my acne, it was clearing it up and the blackheads were disappearing slowly.</li>
            <li> This made my skin vibrant and made my pores look smaller.</li>
            <li> I try not to be high maintenance, But, eh, its just  something that comes with womanly nature.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because I think that the price is a bit high considering the size of the actual bar.  </li>
            <li> After using the soap for about a week I could already see his back starting to clear up and blackheads not getting to be as large.</li>
            <li> Because it only happens on various occasions I don&#x27;t really have any sort of products I use to help clear it up.</li>
            <li> so I tried many things in the last two months that ended up leaving my skin dried out, still breaking out or left me smelling like the perfume counter at Macys.  </li>
            <li> One of the things I like about it, it is affordable and not expensive like other natural soaps or acne face washes.</li>
            <li> After about a week of using it, I started following up with a oil free moisturizer afterwards because my skin was feeling a little dry/tight.</li>
            <li> It has really helped my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling soft, and seemed to help clear up some spots that I had on my face, but time will tell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> bar is very large and will likely last a LONG time.</li>
            <li> I am 35 year old guy who has always washed head to toe with my trusty bar of Irish Spring.  </li>
            <li> not really my toes, but my whole body basically).</li>
            <li> not only is it soft now</li>
            <li> My pimples arent completely gone but you can see the big difference compare to before.</li>
            <li> using this Adovia Natural Sulfar Soap and start seeing your skin transform with daily use.</li>
            <li> The Natural Sulfur Soap is not different.</li>
            <li> We wanted to try this soap for its claims on Acne and Blackheads and Eczema, what we didn&#x27;t realize is that it wasn&#x27;t necessarily &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; for my sensitive skin, but I had to try it anyway.</li>
            <li> Obviously a soap made out of natural ingredients shouldn’t smell like perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It left her face feeling soft and supple.</li>
            <li> My acne hasn&#x27;t got any better or worse.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my skin looks a little more radiant and less patchy.</li>
            <li> it makes my face feel very soft after rinsing the soap off i used very little water when i first applied the soap so i can work the soap into my skin</li>
            <li> honestly this soap made me worse and made my skin so dry.</li>
            <li> and I remember how bad that smelled in high school, but there is hardly any scent at all to this wonderful soap!</li>
            <li> this product has not made my face anymore dry than what it normally is.</li>
            <li> It may be too drying for those with normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> I used this soap on my face and it didn&#x27;t dry my skin and make it look ashy like most products that have all those harsh chemicals!!</li>
            <li> and this doesn&#x27;t smell so much like a volcano as the other ones did.</li>
            <li> This product is fairly inexpensive but cuts down on my facial redness without irritating it.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it morning and night on my face for the last 4 days and have been pleasantly surprised how the soap has left me feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> , well I have sensitive facial skin after reading the box, I had discovered it wasn&#x27;t just a facial soap it can be used on the body as well.</li>
            <li> It does work and does not dry out her skin.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin and it is keeping me</li>
            <li> it does work on pimples and it does not dry out my face  will reorder</li>
            <li> i definitely recommend this if u are looking for major oil control....</li>
            <li> have slight acne issues and after first use the next morning</li>
            <li> There are other facial bars that don&#x27;t really lather</li>
            <li> i have been using grandpa&#x27;s sulfur and it takes out the itch and the skin problems but is pretty drying, harsh etc...</li>
            <li> It works for my overly sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I got this soap to try to wean myself off of Avar (very expensive), and so far, it does seem to be effective.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry me out like some reviews have stated, but I don&#x27;t really have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I really wished that it would maintain it&#x27;s salt and sulfur composition a little longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin like other sulfur soaps.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a week or so, but by now a lot of soaps would actually be so harsh they make my face worse - and this one is still nice and works well.</li>
            <li> For the first week or so using it, it left my face feeling a little dry</li>
            <li> This soap cleared it right up without irritating my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So, while not necessarily for me, I do think this is a good bar soap and will help other suffers of acne.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous lengthy regimens for treating my acne but for the past 3 weeks I have only used 2 products: this soap (morning and nightly) and Bragg&#x27;s pure apple cider vinegar as a toner (only at night).  </li>
            <li> It is very drying and makes my face raw red and feel and looks burned.  </li>
            <li> The sent isn&#x27;t bad, it smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I use it with cold water to clean my face and it&#x27;s helped so much with my acne.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used any facial soap in all long time since it always dried out my skin.  </li>
            <li> Adovia’s Sulfur Soap took the excess oil from my face, without leaving it feel dry and tight, which is absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As an adult with cystic acne, and sensitive skin, there are not many soaps I can use with out breaking out, or making me itchy and drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot of money for bar soap, but it does seem to last a long time, even in the shower with daily use by 2 people.</li>
            <li> the seller:&lt;br /&gt;Adovia sulfur soap, is highly enriched with minerals and sulfur from the Dead Sea.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> what the box says:&lt;br /&gt;“ADOVIA’s Sulfur Soap is highly enriched with minerals and sulfur from the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> Also all the black heads i was trying to figure out how to get rid of around my nose opposite of my nose ring all gone, my face is so completely soft.</li>
            <li> The soap itself foams very well, has very little to no scent, and the bar is long lasting.</li>
            <li> However, it does last a long time.</li>
            <li> and i have only used it for a day in the long run</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every day for about a month now and the bar is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I generally do not go towards bar soap but the sulfur in this soap intrigued me.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s starting to clear up the little bit of acne I had on my shoulders.</li>
            <li> Have used other kinds of sulfur soap which did help with my chronic adult acne, but left my skin rough and irritated.</li>
            <li> probably helps.(I have adult acne that has been targeting the lower half of my face)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is for all skin types, even with a dry skin type such as mine.</li>
            <li> Therefore, my recent opportunity to try and review  Adovia Natural Sulfur Soap for Acne, Blackheads and Oily Skin with Dead Sea Salt was one I was eager to undertake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> skin has remained soft despite daily use--it is one of the few soaps I would use on my face.</li>
            <li> It has olive oil that hydrates and moisturizes my skin naturally, aloe vera that soothes my skin, dead sea minerals that adds nutrients back into the skin and sulfur that keeps bacteria from forming which causes acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within two days she had no new breakouts and all the lesions were starting to heal.  </li>
            <li> The sulfur soap decreased the oil production for me after it&#x27;s very first use.</li>
            <li> I estimate this bar will last me several months comparable to other face washes/bars.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has helped clear me up a little faster</li>
            <li> It did nothing to help my skin tone or clear up the little bit of acne</li>
            <li> And after using this soap for a little over a week, I saw a complete difference in my complexion.</li>
            <li> I agree with a review that someone else said that they should include a case for this, because for $10 I think they can afford a little sleeve for it, soap is super hard to store once it&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li> This soap truly does make your skins natural moisture levels balanced and optimized with Olive Oil, Dead Sea minerals and Aloe Vera extract.</li>
            <li> I will be using this for now on as long as they keep the price where it is.</li>
            <li> how soft my skin is after using it a few days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless different products and had been looking for something different than benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and the harsh prescriptions.  </li>
            <li> skin&#x27;s natural moisture levels are balanced and optimized with Olive Oil, Dead Sea minerals and Aloe Vera extract.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your skin’s natural moisture levels are balanced and optimized with Olive Oil, Dead Sea minerals and Aloe Vera.</li>
            <li> With Olive Oil, Dead Sea minerals and Aloe Vera extract your skin’s natural moisture levels are balanced as well as optimized.</li>
            <li> The bar lasts a long long time.</li>
            <li> This is just plain old soap, nothing fru fru about it.</li>
            <li> The soap very lightly scented, so I was disappointed at first, but then I thought &#x27;maybe its the perfumes in the soaps I’ve used for my acne in the past that rendered them ineffective.’</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to see what the long term effects are, but so far, after few days, my acne seems to be clearing up with no new ones in sight!</li>
            <li> Sulfur generally has an unpleasant smell, but this was fine.</li>
            <li> My teenage son won&#x27;t use any other soap.</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t wait that long!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough on oil and acne skin, but gentle enough on my challenge skin.</li>
            <li> all my dry spots on my face went away</li>
            <li> When I used it, I noticed it dry the oil out of my skin.</li>
            <li> It does leave my cheeks feeling dry</li>
            <li> This soap doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all</li>
            <li> It does sometimes dry out skin that is not used to it.</li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face I would recommend to still continue to use a moisturizer if your skin is drying, because this will not help with that problem.</li>
            <li> I have dry, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Even though it says this is not recommended for dry skin</li>
            <li> The soap does not leave my skin feeling dry nor oily</li>
            <li> It says that is not recommended  for dry skin.</li>
            <li> biggest surprise I had while using this is that it didn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> but this made my skin sooo dry and patchy as well as blotchy.  </li>
            <li> I have found it works wonders on my face since I tend to have dry or oily skin during the summer months.</li>
            <li> the bar does not leave my skin feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> Where my skin was sensitive/dry it showed nothing extraordinary (nothing like Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap), but it did make it feel a lot dryer (had to follow up with some serious moisture)</li>
            <li> It helps clear up my face with that little of effort!</li>
            <li> ,I have also previously heard about many of the benefits that can come from Dead Sea minerals (seriously, look them up!)</li>
            <li> but my oil skin has definitely toned down a lot since I started washing with this soap.  </li>
            <li> The soap has a little scent and the soap last long.  </li>
            <li> so be warned on that and use a non oil based moisturizer or a toner after it so you don&#x27;t get the dry patches!</li>
            <li> I do still have break outs of white heads and black heads though.  </li>
            <li> (Only facial soap i can use everyday without irritation or having allergy  is ivory bar soap or unscented Dove).I like this stuff a lot!</li>
            <li> * and left my skin less shiny through out the day.</li>
            <li> I started using Adovia&#x27;s Sulfur Soap, I had a several small, but persistent pimples on my face and back.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry; my legs get so ashy that it looks like I have cracks in my skin.</li>
            <li> Like I said, my skin is usually very dry.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time buying soaps and creams because my skin is so sensitive.</li>
            <li> My skin is naturally sensitive and this soap was way too hard on it.</li>
            <li> Probably not for use on all skin types, husband used it for a month or two and experienced terrible acne.</li>
            <li> While it seems small in size, I am thinking that this soap will last a really long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spent two years going to the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> We used the whole bar, but there was no great improvement in my tone or texture.</li>
            <li> I actually expected it to stink because I have never used a sulfur soap before but had to try it out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this soap for a few days</li>
            <li> looking up the benefits of such soap it was noted that it contains minerals and sulfur from the Dead Sea, which help to balance your skin through the addition of the Olive Oil and Aloe Vera extract.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but overall it is cheaper than the Aveeno I have been using as it lasts far longer and easier to use over the upper part of my body.</li>
            <li> Not really fond of the smell, but that&#x27;s just my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expected wonders with one wash.</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times to insure that I can properly review It.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too harsh or abrasive, but i do follow with a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The next morning, the breakouts that I did have were dried up and almost gone.</li>
            <li> Using those on my hands left my hands soft and also decreased the look of age in my hands.</li>
            <li> Usually I put lotion on after every shower, my skin is just not dry.</li>
            <li> the way, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and it doesn&#x27;t leave a waxy film like the typical bar soap can!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I typically don’t like to stray from what I know won’t completely dry out my skin and cause me problems.</li>
            <li> I plan on continuing to use this soap in place of my usual cleanser with the hopes of keeping my face clear without all the harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li> 80% Palm/ 20% Palm Kernel oil, Dead Sea Salts Magnesium, Sodium, Potassium, Deionized Water (Aqua), Sulphur, Olive Oil, Aloe Vera, Sodium Chloride, Natural extract (fragrance), Dead Sea Black Mud (</li>
            <li> In the last few weeks it has helped cut down on the healing time of the few breakouts that I got and also helped dry up some of the excess oil that I was dealing with.</li>
            <li> My skin has become less oily and the veins in my cheeks seem to have become smaller and less noticeable!</li>
            <li> and i gave her the information to recommend to her other patients.</li>
            <li> but around my pms time things flares back up and takes me almost a month or more to recover sometimes because they get so big and nasty.</li>
            <li> I Reccomend this product along with other adovia soap products.</li>
            <li> We have tried other sulfur soaps and they stink and don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Now I can go several hours longer without excessive oil showing up.  </li>
            <li> Now I do get an occasional small blemish sometimes once or twice in a 2 week period, however, they usually are gone the next day.</li>
            <li> you are in the market for something to help aid you in your acne or other skin issues, I&#x27;d recommend giving this a</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do a skin patch test like I usually do and just lathered up and washed my entire body.</li>
            <li> I found that this soap did leave me feeling cleansed but not stripped of moisture, like other bar soaps</li>
            <li> so I’ll report back in a few weeks on that!</li>
            <li> Will be looking into their other products now.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because of the sulfur</li>
            <li> He said it mad his face feel clean and not oily.</li>
            <li> I am in my late thirties and suddenly developed acne a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered for years with red, bumpy, scaly, itchy, broken out and irritated skin on my forehead, nose, cheeks, upper lip and patches around my lips.  </li>
            <li> Using this soap I have noticed that my skin has been less itchy than using other soaps.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always had a hard time trying to find products that my skin can agree with, Especially my oily face.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s there for me to use it when I feel like my skin needs that extra little something to heal a breakout or help with any excessive oiliness.  </li>
            <li> Finally, all the hard pimples are leaving.</li>
            <li> I have very high expectations for this line, and the soap didn&#x27;t fail me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad back acne</li>
            <li> Having acne prone, oily skin, being late 20ish (30) is quite embarrassing but after using this I can tell it is helping to balance it out overall.</li>
            <li> Lately it has been in the middle.</li>
            <li> not worth spending 10 bucks on 😡</li>
            <li> It loses it potency after about a month of daily use.  </li>
            <li> It tames down my breakouts without drying my skin out.</li>
            <li> Usually bar soap makes my face appear to be dry.</li>
            <li> Usually whenever my skin is dry</li>
            <li> So sensitive that I have to use natural EVERYTHING or deal with really bad breakouts.</li>
            <li> Although I have used it for less than a week</li>
            <li> I notice I have less breakouts.</li>
            <li> but it also doesn’t have your typical face soap fragrance.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a serious acne problem, though I do experience occasional hormonal breakouts and backne.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the blackheads on my chin area seem to have cleared and it looks like there are less of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also found my face to be softer and less flaky.</li>
            <li> Before using my hair and face would be extremely shiny or greasy before noon everyday (sooner if it was hot and muggy).  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m a little annoyed that I spent the money on this only to have it arrive and find out I can&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> First product EVER that cleared my skin without some crazy rash or hives or drying it out.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on your skin, and it doesn&#x27;t over strip your face so it feels tight and oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a little over a week and have noticed some acne clearing up.</li>
            <li> a little tight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have finally had the chance to use the adovia natural sulfur soap and of course i used it on my face where because of going out i was breaking out like crazy and needed a soap that wasn&#x27;t going to irritate my face or my nose ring, as you know i put my nose ring back in and was having issues with break outs by it and needed a soap badly or something that wouldn&#x27;t irritate it or make it infected, after trying a few products this one i decided to try next</li>
            <li> It does seem to make my skin feel softer - I&#x27;ve been using it on my face for a few days now.  </li>
            <li> All the ingredients are natural and nothing scary in there.  </li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> I guess the dead sea salt removes dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I like that it has sulfur and dead sea minerals in it</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Kills my dead skin in a beat.</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on this soap.</li>
            <li> is that they use ingredients from the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> have combination skin on my face, and have trouble with some products being too drying while others make it too oily.  </li>
            <li> I was having to remind him everyday to use it</li>
            <li> have a harsh reaction to it.</li>
            <li> it moisturized my skin as it it killed all the bacteria and got rid of all the oil in my skin.</li>
            <li> Adovia Sulfur Soap with Dead Sea Salt has helped with my oily forehead and the blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li> and I am 43 years old, and yes, we both have acne, blackheads and troubled skin.</li>
            <li> Also, doesn&#x27;t fall apart when the bar gets very thin, so I can use it until it&#x27;s nearly gone.</li>
            <li> and I read the ingredients, there it was, plain as day - &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Since he&#x27;s been using it, for the past couple of weeks, his facial acne and oiliness has decreased.</li>
            <li> It really helps keep acne under control, which can be very difficult for a teenager.</li>
            <li> I will admit I was nervous to try this product, because I have combination oily/dry skin, and every product that I have tried in the past has dried out my skin to the point that it peels and hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> My skin&#x27;s main concern is blackheads as I have extremely lard pores. :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, made me break out more than usual</li>
            <li> but it don&#x27;t look so dull, dried out</li>
            <li> Errr, I&#x27;m afraid to go this far.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if it helps for acne problem..</li>
            <li> I wanted my oldest daughter to try Adovia 100% Natural Sulfur Soap for Acne, Blackheads and Oily Skin, because she suffers from acne and has from the day she hit puberty.  </li>
            <li> so it’s not overwhelming</li>
            <li> no more break outs around my nose</li>
            <li> i gave it a chance because I thought that it was gonna get worst before it gets better</li>
            <li> I was usually ordering bars like this from out of the country</li>
            <li> My body felt a little dry, but it wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Naturally, I was very skeptical about this soap, but at this point I figured I had nothing to lose by trying it.</li>
            <li> He has used my sulfur spot treatment creams in the past, however always complained about the smell.</li>
            <li> Though $10 is expensive for a bar of soap,  it holds up if you put it in a container or tray and keep it relatively dry.</li>
            <li> I am normally super leery of soap as they have all dried my skin out horribly.</li>
            <li> I do wish there was a little different fragrance to it though, but it did smell bad</li>
            <li> Well my Irish Spring wasn&#x27;t cutting it for the pores on my nose</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t noticed any negative side affects at least.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t follow the instructions and start slowly</li>
            <li> and so far I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> They have significantly decreased in size quicker than usual after using this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I expected a nasty sulfur smell, but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I expected a nasty sulfur smell, but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about a soap with Sulfur....</li>
            <li> My daughter has really bad acne on her face, chest, and back.  </li>
            <li> plus it doesn’t leave an icky film behind.</li>
            <li> A mineral enriched dead sea soap that thoroughly cleanses your face, removing all your makeup and grim, unclogging your pores and this while keeping your skin soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have smelled Sulfur before and it is not pleasant.</li>
            <li> so he breaks out pretty bad and gets really bad blackheads.</li>
            <li> If anything, it&#x27;s made it worse.</li>
            <li> Instead of preventing breakouts, I think it made them worse.</li>
            <li> Before my acne on my forehead was getting worse and i couldnt get some pimples to leave.</li>
            <li> My breakout have decreased, and I no longer have a shine on my face through out the day.</li>
            <li> Made my acne even worse</li>
            <li> my acne got even worse</li>

            <li> I used it 2 days ago i really liked it all my dry spots on my face went away i will just use it to wash my face its very creamy it makes my face feel very soft after rinsing the soap off i used very little water when i first applied the soap so i can work the soap into my skin i wanted to know if it was going to be easy to rinse off it really was.</li>
            <li> Great soap!  I have very sensitive and oily skin.  My skin has become less oily and the veins in my cheeks seem to have become smaller and less noticeable!</li>
            <li> This soap arrived and the entire box smelled pleasant.  It is a nice smelling soap.  It does seem to make my skin feel softer - I&#x27;ve been using it on my face for a few days now.  I haven&#x27;t seen a difference clearing up my skin, but maybe that will come. It doesn&#x27;t dry me out like some reviews have stated, but I don&#x27;t really have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Lo compre para mi hna y ella esta muy contenta muchos de los Barros se le han desaparecido y dice ella q comprara más de estos</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing oil face washes and for my skin type that works okay, but I&#x27;ve found that sulfur soap like this works pretty nicely. I think I need a stronger sulfur concentration but this has revealed to me that sulfur is good for my acne prone skin plus the dead sea salt probably helps.(I have adult acne that has been targeting the lower half of my face)</li>
            <li> I have very bad dry skin. I have a hard time buying soaps and creams because my skin is so sensitive. I bought this product and it works amazing. I&#x27;m not allergic to it. It leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth. It&#x27;s been moisturizing my skin too. Love, love, love! &amp;#34;These are my honest opinions after having tried this product&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff love what I does to my skin</li>
            <li> my pores on my face enlarged after i used this stuff. It was enlarged after one time used. I am stopping using this product. However, it helped me to get rid of most blackheads.</li>
            <li> I saw no difference in my skin with this soap.</li>
            <li> I had used this soap everyday love it makes my skin soft not dry out my skin like most soaps so I would recommend this soap</li>
            <li> This soap is great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other bar soaps have done in the past. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the soap and enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://sapphiresfamilyfriendlyreviews.weebly.com/home/sulfur-soap-with-dead-sea-salt</li>
            <li> Fabulous! Love the feel on your skin! Helps your skin to stay healthy and soft!</li>
            <li> I am in my late thirties and suddenly developed acne a few years ago. I spent two years going to the dermatologist. I used prescription medication, including pills to treat my acne, but nothing seemed to work. Naturally, I was very skeptical about this soap, but at this point I figured I had nothing to lose by trying it. I have been using it daily for four weeks now, and my face is almost completely cleared, free of acne. The best part is that it does not over dry my face or irritate it, it&#x27;s actually very gentle. I strongly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> Reading the instructions has me terrified of getting it in my eyes. It works well and it also doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I have normal/oily skin. It cleans my face really well--when I use an astringent afterwards there&#x27;s not a lot of extra dirt that comes off.</li>
            <li> As an adult with cystic acne, and sensitive skin, there are not many soaps I can use with out breaking out, or making me itchy and drying out my skin. This, does neither. It really cleanses my face, and helps heal my acne. There isnt a scent to it either, which is particularly best for someone in my position.  I am very happy and relieved to find a soap I can actually use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;product received for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I am 35 year old guy who has always washed head to toe with my trusty bar of Irish Spring.  Well my Irish Spring wasn&#x27;t cutting it for the pores on my nose and  the occasional breakout on my body so I tried many things in the last two months that ended up leaving my skin dried out, still breaking out or left me smelling like the perfume counter at Macys.  Finally my search led me Adovia Sulfur Soap.  Received it in the mail a few days ago and my face looks great, nose pores aren&#x27;t as noticeable and I don&#x27;t smell like Macys perfume counter anymore.</li>
            <li> So far, I love this soap! I never write reviews but I&#x27;ve tried so many soaps in my lifetime and haven&#x27;t had an effect like this. I&#x27;ll have to see what the long term effects are, but so far, after few days, my acne seems to be clearing up with no new ones in sight! And also it seems to give me an amazing glow and makes my skin soft. Most of all, I&#x27;m glad it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad back acne and I need something to get rid of it and we own a salt water pool and I noticed anything with salt/ saltwater would get rid my acne fairly fast. It took me away to do this review and I am glad to say my acne has  significantly improved.</li>
            <li> I found this soap to be just as advertised.  Works great to clean my skin and it feels great to use these minerals on my skin.  The soap seems unscented and has no bothersome smell.  Just nice and clean.  Good solid product.</li>
            <li> You definitely need to moisturize, and only use oncea day</li>
            <li> This soap is great for people with oily skin. When I used it, I noticed it dry the oil out of my skin. I don&#x27;t have oily skin so it wasn&#x27;t the best fit for me. I have drier skin. After realizing this, I had my brother who has oily skin try it. He said it mad his face feel clean and not oily. It doesn&#x27;t have a real fragrance to it, so that was awesome. He continues to use it on his face and seems to really like it. My experience is not the same as others would have. If you have oily skin, you should totally try this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion. All views and opinions are 100% my own and have neither been paid for nor sponsored.</li>
            <li> My daughter has really bad acne on her face, chest, and back.  Everyone in the family has oily skin.  Within two days she had no new breakouts and all the lesions were starting to heal.  I bought a bar for my niece it was working so well.  May I also recommend the Adovia shampoo for oily hair with dandruff.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This was ok. We used the whole bar, but there was no great improvement in my tone or texture.</li>
            <li> It works. My face is more smooth now.</li>
            <li> love the feel(and the smell) of my face after using this soap.  My skin looks cleaner and clearer...I love this soap</li>
            <li> excellent! i have been using grandpa&#x27;s sulfur and it takes out the itch and the skin problems but is pretty drying, harsh etc...it is good though if you want to feel really clean and don&#x27;t use it too much and it&#x27;s the summer or whatevs....BUT, adovia does the trick and is MOISTURIZING. trust me, i was afraid bc of the oils that the sulphur wouldn&#x27;t&#x27; do what i needed but it has...no redness....try this one...or alternate with grandpa&#x27;s if too pricey  to use all the time....</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
            <li> This soap smells like egg-farts and is not an efficient exfoliator, but I&#x27;ll be damned if my zits have fled my face! Probably not for use on all skin types, husband used it for a month or two and experienced terrible acne. It all depends on how well you know your skin and what it needs.</li>
            <li> This soap makes my skin feel crisp and squeaky clean!  I can&#x27;t confirm that it get rid of my acne but my oil skin has definitely toned down a lot since I started washing with this soap.  I do still have break outs of white heads and black heads though.  I would definitely reccommend this soap for oily skin.</li>
            <li> As someone with sensitive skin I really loved this Sulfur Soap with Dead Sea salt by Adovia Mineral Skin Care. This soap works great on my sensitive skin as it doesn&#x27;t irritate or harm my skin. I love that it is 100% natural and its also fragrance free with somethings I do prefer unscented soap. I love that this soap is highly enriched with minerals and sulfur from the Dead Sea.  This soap truly does make your skins natural moisture levels balanced and optimized with Olive Oil, Dead Sea minerals and Aloe Vera extract.Sulfur has Antiseptic, Anti-Fungal and Antibacterial properties which is great. I love this soap and recommend it to everyone it leaves your skin gentle and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and oily combination skin and have been using this soap for my face over a month now and it has not irritated my skin or have I had any break outs. I will be using this for now on as long as they keep the price where it is. One of the things I like about it, it is affordable and not expensive like other natural soaps or acne face washes.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other Adovia products and have had nothing but good experiences and this soap is no different.  I actually expected it to stink because I have never used a sulfur soap before but had to try it out.  You would never know sulfur is the soap as there is no negative scent. I did receive a discount to try it  and give my honest opinion.  After use, I felt really clean and the soap didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  All the ingredients are natural and nothing scary in there.  No parabens and isn&#x27;t tested on animals. I love that it has dead sea salts and how soft my skin is after using it a few days.  Excellent and would recommend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this soap....it has a funny smell when you use it on your body it doesn&#x27;t latter well...and I wouldn&#x27;t use it again but this is only my experience</li>
            <li> My skin is naturally sensitive and this soap was way too hard on it. I broke out more too.</li>
            <li> Hubby has a skin condition that makes his face get really irritated and peel.  Since he has been using this soap it is almost non existent.  It doesn&#x27;t smell the best but great for irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I like this product, I have very oily skin and this leaves my skin feeling very clean</li>
            <li> Look, if you&#x27;re going to market a product as &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; then it should be fragrance free.  I was excited to get this product based on reviews, and when it showed up at my house and I read the ingredients, there it was, plain as day - &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;.  I don&#x27;t really care if it&#x27;s natural fragrance, because any time I use a product with natural fragrance, unnatural fragrance, any fragrance, I break out and get itchy.  So I&#x27;m a little annoyed that I spent the money on this only to have it arrive and find out I can&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels after a few weeks of use. I use it twice a day (morning and night). Very happy I purchased this even though I had reservations because of it being in a bar soap form. Most cleansers I have used were in a foam soap.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help my horrible acne at all. What a waste.</li>
            <li> This is my must have soap. I cant be without... i have a skin condition and it has greatly improved, my dermatologist even asled and i gave her the information to recommend to her other patients. Just be sure you are not allergic to sulfur</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, first time I used this soap and rinsed with water what a difference! It just absorbed all the oil off of my skin, within the first 3 days I started to see a difference with my acne, it was clearing it up and the blackheads were disappearing slowly. Ive only had this soap for one week now and I&#x27;m surprised with the results. I&#x27;m gonna continue to use it and see if it can clear my skin up completely.</li>
            <li> I use it with cold water to clean my face and it&#x27;s helped so much with my acne. It does leave my cheeks feeling dry but I just put on some moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Adovia Bar Soap is my favorite soap I&#x27;ve ever used!! Every time I use their bar soap my family and friends comment on how well my skin looks!!! My skin feels soft, looks youthful, and feels great when using this soap!! This is by far my favorite soap ever!!! I used to use Dove but this beats Dove Bar Soap!!! I highly recommend you try this if you haven&#x27;t already done so!!!</li>
            <li> This soap is great for dry, lifeless skin.  It does what having a facial peal would do to your skin on a smaller scale. I guess the dead sea salt removes dead skin.  I don&#x27;t know but I couldn&#x27;t look more radiant.  I am being told by family members that I must be drinking more water. Buy a bar and try it.  It works for me.</li>
            <li> I have horribly sensitive skin. So sensitive that I have to use natural EVERYTHING or deal with really bad breakouts. Not just on my face, it affects my entire body. If its not a breakout its tiny bumps. Once I started switching to as many natural products as I could it did help some but around my pms time things flares back up and takes me almost a month or more to recover sometimes because they get so big and nasty. The sulfur soap is my newest attempt at managing my breakouts. I didn&#x27;t follow the instructions and start slowly (I&#x27;ve never been much for directions) but luckily my skin took well to the soap and I haven&#x27;t noticed any negative side affects at least. It has helped clear me up a little faster I think, I haven&#x27;t experienced any New breakouts and my skin feels moisturized but not greasy. I personally do like this soap and intend to continue use. I received mine free or at a promotional discount for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and honest opinions after using this soap myself. I have nothing to gain by leaving a positive review, this is simply my opinion from how it worked for me.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Leaves my skin feeling nice and clean. I have oily skin so I follow it up with an oil control moisturizer and my skin looks great all day!</li>
            <li> Switching to natural products for my skin, like the use of sulfur soap, has reduced dryness and the irritation of my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Working great... Rinses clean, doesn&#x27;t leave skin dry. I have cystic acne that has left channels under my skin that are prone to bacteria and inflammation. Routine use has helped reduce red irritated areas.</li>
            <li> I workout several days a week and noticed some exercise induced blemishes on my shoulders.  This soap cleared it right up without irritating my sensitive skin. I highly recommend this soap for those who workout a lot.</li>
            <li> I bout this product in hopes to help with acne but it didn&#x27;t seem to help. The soap didn&#x27;t have a strong smell and does leave skin feeling clean though.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin nice and smooth by removing oils off skin. I use it for my bacne and as a facial wash and it is nice. I Reccomend this product along with other adovia soap products.</li>
            <li> Love its natural. Doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent. Waiting to see more results from my baby acne though. So I&#x27;ll be leaving another review!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this soap for a few days but i already love it! It works great and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry like most bar soaps. When i step out of the shower after using adovia&#x27;s sulfur soap my skin feels nourished and looks great. I like that it has sulfur and dead sea minerals in it , i feel likes that is exactly what my skin needs. I also like that it can be used on your body and your face.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for about 3-4 weeks and I love it. I cannot say it is a miracle fix for my recently acne prone skin, but it definitely does not attribute to it. The soap lathers well and rinses clean leaving the skin feeling really soft and clean. I have started using it on my body as well as my face. There is no scent as stated. I thought it was a bit pricey and was hesitant to purchase, but I am very happy with the product and will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I have combination to oily skin and with the warmer months ahead, I was looking for a new face soap and came across this bar. I have purchased other Adovia products and were pleased with their products as well.&lt;br /&gt;When looking up the benefits of such soap it was noted that it contains minerals and sulfur from the Dead Sea, which help to balance your skin through the addition of the Olive Oil and Aloe Vera extract. Sulfur has Antiseptic, Anti-Fungal and Antibacterial properties and this soap is most known for treating acne, but also has good results with treating cases of Scabies(sulfur is toxic to the mites), Seborrheic Dermatitis(kills the fungus that causes this) and Rosacea(utilizing its drying properties).&lt;br /&gt;This product contains 3% sulfur, which removes old skin cells, removes impurities and unclogs pores. It is important to gradually increase the frequency you use the soap and not at every face washing.  It is a nice size bar, that produces a good lather and doesn&#x27;t dissolve too quickly, wasting the bar of soap. I estimate this bar will last me several months comparable to other face washes/bars.&lt;br /&gt;You need to determine your level of acceptable drying properties. I have just begun using this product but am grateful for the opportunity to be able to share my opinion on this product for a reduction in price, for the purpose of testing. The product is not too drying and leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth, which means a winner in my book. Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> This soap is the only thing that helps my teenage son&#x27;s chest and back acne. It works better than any prescription. We have tried other sulfur soaps and they stink and don&#x27;t work. This product is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Great product fast delivery. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Must try if you have problem skin. After 1 week, my adult acne has minimized by 80%. 1 week!! I have tried prescriptions and everything else, but this soap is my answer. I wish I had found it sooner!! Thank you adovia!</li>
            <li> It works ok. Was expecting more from this soap for $10.</li>
            <li> Face feels super clean! Finally.</li>
            <li> Update:  I just tried reordering this soap (my third bar) and I was not sent the proper item.  I received 10% sulfur bar of soap rather than the 3% suffer and sea salt.  BEWARE if you order from Dashing beauty!  I strongly suggest ordering from goPure Naturals or Professional Beauty Group.    I ordered this after reading some article about sulfur soap for people with Roseaca/acne.  Before using my hair and face would be extremely shiny or greasy before noon everyday (sooner if it was hot and muggy).  Now I can go several hours longer without excessive oil showing up.  My skin is looking far healthier and am no longer using the vitamin C face soap for &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34;.  Expensive, but overall it is cheaper than the Aveeno I have been using as it lasts far longer and easier to use over the upper part of my body. AND easier to travel with since it is a solid.  Wish they would offer smaller size for travel, but I guess I can always cut the soap.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product when I first received it and I really like it.  I haven&#x27;t really used any facial soap in all long time since it always dried out my skin.  This soap doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all and it leaves a soft feeling on my skin.  This soap didn&#x27;t give me any type of side effect for using it so far so I am enjoying it thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  This product was bought at a promotional price for the purpose of a product review.  This is also an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Ok so i have VERY oily skin...to the point where I have to blot several times a day but with this soap I can wash my face in the morning and be almost completely oil free by the time i wash my face at night...it is amazing...it does require that i use mosturizer (which is fine since it doesnt make me oily anymore)...i definitely recommend this if u are looking for major oil control....now if they could just make this in shampoo form my life would be complete :)</li>
            <li> This soap left me feeling clean after use but I didn&#x27;t see much difference with my acne. Overall it was a good product and would purchase again!</li>
            <li> I like using this soap as it is very gentle and the Aloe Vera and Olive Oil moisturize and heal skin while the 3% sulfur helps clear up skin conditions such as Eczema and Acne. For those who are new to using sulfur on their skin, you should work your way up to using it. It does sometimes dry out skin that is not used to it. I like to use this 1-2 days a week. I use a Konjac sponge daily in the shower for exfoliation and deep cleaning (no soap or cleanser). At night I oil cleanse my face. I am completely sulfate free. This soap thoroughly cleanses my skin and does irritate me. My husband has used this as well and he likes it too. He has used my sulfur spot treatment creams in the past, however always complained about the smell. Since becoming sulfate free, I use my sulfur spot cream about once every 4-6 months. Now I do get an occasional small blemish sometimes once or twice in a 2 week period, however, they usually are gone the next day. My skin&#x27;s main concern is blackheads as I have extremely lard pores. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a great product but i can&#x27;t handle the smell.</li>
            <li> I wash my face with this soap at the end of the day, to wash away makeup, love the way it leaves my skin feeling!</li>
            <li> I am a very oily person. From my face to my toes...(okay not really my toes, but my whole body basically). I used this soap to help decrease the oily skin I have all over my body. It really actually helps me get rid of them. Not really fond of the smell, but that&#x27;s just my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Gets rid of oiliness on my skin&lt;br /&gt;- Does the cleaning job well done&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Soap is very slippery with water. So, remember don&#x27;t drop the soap in your bathtub.</li>
            <li> I decided to try out all natural soaps for the face and body. I only use this on my body and I use it daily. But the first day I used it I could feel a complete difference in my skin! It is sooooo smooth!! It&#x27;s been about a week now and I can see a difference in my skin not only is it soft now but it don&#x27;t look so dull, dried out and it&#x27;s starting to clear up the little bit of acne I had on my shoulders. Looks like I found me a new all natural body soap. Best choice I made very happy with his product!</li>
            <li> No weird fragrances. Feels great on the skin! No leftover residue. Washes off great. I have suffered from acne for 17 years when I heard about this soap. I&#x27;ve been using it a little over a week and have noticed some acne clearing up. I also know my diet/water intake needs to be better. I think the combination just may be what my skin needed!</li>
            <li> This really works for stubborn body acne.</li>
            <li> I have Very sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve always had a hard time trying to find products that my skin can agree with, Especially my oily face. I used this soap on my face and it didn&#x27;t dry my skin and make it look ashy like most products that have all those harsh chemicals!! My face actually looks brighter  and it&#x27;s very smooth feeling. I got this product as a free sample to review and it&#x27;s awesome!!</li>
            <li> I have never in my life heard of &amp;#34;Sulfer Soap&amp;#34; so this was a new concept for me. I am willing to try anything that is good for my skin and may help it though. Immediately, when I took the soap out of the box the first thing I did was sniff it. I know this may seem strange, but I had wondered since I first ordered it rather or not it would smell like Sulfur. However, it smelled nothing like Sulfer and had a really nice fresh soapy scent instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my face as well as my body, both worked really well. However, I was most impressed with how it has worked for my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a few days now, and have been really happy with the results so far. Let me first say how much I love the tingling I get all over my face, after washing with the soap. I am by no means a soap person, but found this product to be different, because it works so well with all parts of the body. I don&#x27;t have a lot of problems with regular acne, but I do with blackheads. I significantly have noticed less of them, when I use this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is for all skin types, even with a dry skin type such as mine. While it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face I would recommend to still continue to use a moisturizer if your skin is drying, because this will not help with that problem. I have to say for a bar of soap my expectations weren&#x27;t high, but after using this soap I expect so much more from soaps now and was blown away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: While I did receive this product complimentary through the company, this is my 100% my honest opinion and in no way shape or form change my opinion or alter it in any way.</li>
            <li> I had to opportunity to try out this product by the company and was not disappointed! I was searching for a product to help clear up my body breakouts that occur during the warmer months, and to get ready for my upcoming wedding. I have been using the soap for a week and it has cleared up my skin. I have sensitive skin so most products that claim to help with acne tend to dry out my skin a great deal , but was pleasantly surprised that this wasn&#x27;t the case with adovia&#x27;s sulfur soap. Very pleased with the results, and love the fact that this is an all natural product</li>
            <li> This soap is pretty sweet. I rarely use bars of soap during shower or hand washing, only because all the boys make messes in and around the bathroom, and when I get another chance to use it, water washed it all away, so I store them in a ziplock. I love this bar of soap. I used it for hand washing mainly. The Dead Sea Salt part of the soap is amazing. Works so good, on the skin, gets that dead skin gone in a instant. The smell is pretty light smelling. But boy does this soap work great on the skin. Kills my dead skin in a beat. The bar is pretty big, and you will get a good month or so out of it.</li>
            <li> I am normally super leery of soap as they have all dried my skin out horribly. I do however like to try products that help with acne, and blackheads. I agree with a review that someone else said that they should include a case for this, because for $10 I think they can afford a little sleeve for it, soap is super hard to store once it&#x27;s used. I let it dry and put it back in the box, which isn&#x27;t ideal but worked for me. It left my skin feeling soft, and seemed to help clear up some spots that I had on my face, but time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;These are my honest opinions after having tried this product</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on this soap. It clogged my pores and made me break out terribly</li>
            <li> I love Adovia products and have had the opportunity to review a few. When this one came up for review of course I was excited to get the chance to try it. I have dry, acne prone skin. Even though it says this is not recommended for dry skin this product has not made my face anymore dry than what it normally is. I love this bar. It lathers on my face so easily. It definitely feels as if it is thoroughly cleansing my face. I like products that I can see where I have cleaned. There are other facial bars that don&#x27;t really lather so I end up cleansing the same spot about ten times. I like the lather on this bar, it works great for me. My face feels nice, smooth and clean when I am finished cleansing my face. I use this with my nightly beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try Adovia 100% Natural Sulfur Soap for Acne, Blackheads and Oily Skin. Since having my youngest daughter I have occasional acne breakouts/blackheads. The soap does not leave my skin feeling dry nor oily so it&#x27;s a perfect combination of ingredients to provide natural feeling skin. I have had positive results with the soap so far and I plan to continue to use it. I&#x27;m happy that I am able to have gained even an ounce of my confidence back with the results I&#x27;ve seen from using this soap so far. I will continue to use this soap from now on. I absolutely LOVE this soap, &amp; wish I would have discovered it sooner!    *Disclaimer*  I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using an online site. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I really love this soap. I love the feeling of it how it cleans your face and you see a difference. I clean my face everyday using Adovia Day time and Night time. Also, I love that is 100% natural. It says that is not recommended  for dry skin. I have dry skin and the product hasn&#x27;t made my face more dry . The soap has a little scent and the soap last long.  Using this product for a week I have fewer breakouts. My skin feels amazing. It is soft and clean my face really well. I have never tried soap bar for Acne because I thought that the soap bar wouldn&#x27;t work for me but I thought wrong it did work and I love this product and when I&#x27;m done with this soap I&#x27;m going to be buying more of this soap. I&#x27;m amazed that this soap works and it is high quality the soap is $ 9 dollars at Amazon and free shiping, its worth the $9 dollars. I live Adovia soap and products from Adovia. I recommended this product you well love it too.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked great on my not so clear skin.  Did not have an overpowering smell.  My face always felt nice and clean after every use.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! I noticed a difference in my skin after the first use. It lathers nicely, leaves your skin feeling fresh and moisturized which is awesome since it helps oily skin. The sent isn&#x27;t bad, it smells fresh and clean. I am so happy I have found this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I loved it! My face felt clean, smooth, and soft! From the word Sulfur in its title, I thought that there would be an odor, but it smells nice! I would highly recommend it. I did receive free product in order to facilitate a review, and the opinions expressed are my own!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s work perfect, really this soap control the oil level.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap. it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on your skin, and it doesn&#x27;t over strip your face so it feels tight and oily. it has a very mild pleasant smell as a bar, but it truly is fragrance free on your skin. I have only used it a week or so, but by now a lot of soaps would actually be so harsh they make my face worse - and this one is still nice and works well. I really like it a lot and will probably buy more when the time comes. it seems like it will last awhile it doesn&#x27;t turn to mush in water.</li>
            <li> During various times of the month and year, my skin tends to become more oily in spots, and I notice that I always get more acne breakouts than normal. Because it only happens on various occasions I don&#x27;t really have any sort of products I use to help clear it up. Until now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I continue on though I must say that I don&#x27;t have super acne prone skin. I have what you would label normal skin. Breakouts happen when they happen. Not regular or severe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this soap for about a month and saved using it until I noticed a breakout coming. I started washing my face with this soap immediately at the first side of a red bump, and I was surprised at the results over 3 days. Using this twice a day, morning and night, helped get rid of any acne that was coming. Within 3 days the redness subsided, was no longer sore to the touch, and wasn&#x27;t raised. I also used this soap on a heat rash that I got around the bust area. Lets face it, heat plus bra straps rubbing on your skin can create a pretty sore rash. I washed with this, and in about 4 days time, the rash was completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest surprise I had while using this is that it didn&#x27;t dry my skin out. My skin can dry out so easily, I thought for sure that it would happen while using this. But it didn&#x27;t. My skin remained soft use after use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in the market for something to help aid you in your acne or other skin issues, I&#x27;d recommend giving this a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> I already need more of this. It&#x27;s a great daily face soap and I have used it almost completely up. I was given one to review but I would not attest to it&#x27;s benefits without fully trying it first. I can definitely say it is one I could always have on hand. Having acne prone, oily skin, being late 20ish (30) is quite embarrassing but after using this I can tell it is helping to balance it out overall. I would recommend it to anyone though because it isn&#x27;t drying, the Olive Oil is moisturizing yet it does not leave your face feeling like it has a residue.</li>
            <li> Adovia sent me this soap to test out for my blog, GlamRiver and it works awesome!  I keep the Adovia Sulfur Soap for Acne, Blackheads and Oily Skin in my shower so it&#x27;s there for me to use it when I feel like my skin needs that extra little something to heal a breakout or help with any excessive oiliness.  I even use it with my Clarisonic,  I just turn it on and run it over the bar of soap a few times, works perfect!  In the last few weeks it has helped cut down on the healing time of the few breakouts that I got and also helped dry up some of the excess oil that I was dealing with.</li>
            <li> Here we go again with more Skin Care! This soap has a really vintage appeal going on. And, well I just love that! I have used many soaps with labels that I adore from absolutely sassy and fresh to something that looks like it jumped out of the 20&#x27;s. Vintage/Classic design is one of my favorites. I always have some seriously high expectations. I try not to be high maintenance, But, eh, its just  something that comes with womanly nature. I expected wonders with one wash. Why on earth I was in one of those dense mind states that day I still haven&#x27;t clue. Any-how! I didn&#x27;t do a skin patch test like I usually do and just lathered up and washed my entire body. Bad idea.. It worked well on my face and that  left absolutely fabulous  results. As for my body. Errr, I&#x27;m afraid to go this far. I was wishing it was National No Bra Day. When I finally had the chance I performed the wondrous bra removal trick. You know, the one where you remove your bra through your shirt sleeve? Well, it ended up looking like a New England snow storm in my bathroom. My black-lined bra was covered in these lovely crispy skin flakes. So, my final verdict? If you have combination skin on your body like most of us do stick to using it on just your face and the oily parts! Do I recommend it? YES, I actually do. After continued use on my problem spots it has indeed helped in clearing them up. I just don&#x27;t want any one else repeating my foolish actions and I had to share.</li>
            <li> If you follow my blog you should know by now that I love Adovia skincare products. Before I tried this line I have never had good luck with skin products simply because they either dried my skin too much, or made it too oily. I almost always broke out when I tried skin products. I basically just washed my face with soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when I became a blogger I got a lot of opportunities to try out Adovia products. I have tried exfoliating salts, Adovia Shea Butter, Adovia Face Moisturizer, and now Adovia Sulfur soap. I have very high expectations for this line, and the soap didn&#x27;t fail me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin and sometimes it is more oily than others. Lately it has been in the middle. This sulfur soap helps to regulate the oils in my skin and leave my face feeling soft and clean. Regular soap can make me break out sometimes so it is nice to have a soap that is made specifically to prevent that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition this soap can be used on your entire body! It isn&#x27;t just for your face. The sulfur in this soap really helps to keep it safe for your skin and to prevent break outs. I personally love this soap and plan on using it for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love most about this company is that they use ingredients from the Dead Sea. The salts and sulfur from this sea are supposed to work wonders on skin and are, according to legend, what Cleopatra used when she was alive! How cool is that?</li>
            <li> Drying to the skin and doesn&#x27;t work as well as grisi...I wish there was a 10% sulfur soap that was glycerin based!</li>
            <li> Leaves me feeling clean!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great cleansing soap but I&#x27;m not sure if it helps for acne problem..</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin, leaves soft and healthy feeling, cleans the pores well.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, it&#x27;s pretty good for a very sensitive skin like mine. (Only facial soap i can use everyday without irritation or having allergy  is ivory bar soap or unscented Dove).I like this stuff a lot!</li>
            <li> I think this is a great soap which also seems to be improving the tone of my skin. It has great ingredients and is among the three favorite face soaps I use. I gave it four stars because I think that the price is a bit high considering the size of the actual bar.  I still,however, would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this sulfur soap did justice to every part of my face! The smell is not that terrible but it does have a scent. It did clear up my cheeks *thanks aunt flo* and left my skin less shiny through out the day. Some soaps leave a waxy squeak after you rinse and I did not have that problem with this sulfur soap. I did receive this product for review.</li>
            <li> Very good, but very expensive for a bar of soap.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  My daughter had an issue with acne and we tried this as a last resort. It does work and does not dry out her skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this hasn&#x27;t helped my acne at all. If anything, it&#x27;s made it worse. I really liked it at first, but after continued use, my face is really dry and has cystic acne. I&#x27;m going back to my regular stuff--I can&#x27;t remember the last time I had had a zit:(&lt;br /&gt;I received this free for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this soap!  I use it twice a day with an electronic cleansing brush and it has drastically improved my complexion.  It is SO much better than benzoyl peroxide that bleaches your towels.  Like most acne sufferers I&#x27;ve tried countless different products and had been looking for something different than benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and the harsh prescriptions.  I&#x27;m amazed this has worked as well as it has.  I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and this has not irritated my skin at all!  I was nervous about a sulfur smell but there is no bad smell at all.  Just a note - I have tried numerous lengthy regimens for treating my acne but for the past 3 weeks I have only used 2 products: this soap (morning and nightly) and Bragg&#x27;s pure apple cider vinegar as a toner (only at night).  I love that I have a very minimal regimen now!  Definitely going to buy this soap again!</li>
            <li> I was able to try this for review and I have to admit, it was better than I expected. I thought that it would smell like rotten eggs because of the word &amp;#34;sulfer&amp;#34;, but it smells like nothing. It also leaves my skin soft and smooth. I really like it!</li>
            <li> Eh, it&#x27;s okay and it hasn&#x27;t really helped my face that I can notice. However, it does last a long time.</li>
            <li> Usually bar soap makes my face appear to be dry. This one didn&#x27;t. I love the Olive Oil, Dead Sea minerals, and Aloe Vera extract it has in it. It&#x27;s a great soap for people that have problems with breaking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a blogger that got this product to review. I write only my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I have been on a quest to find better ways to care for my skin and body. My quest is taking me down the natural path, as it is many others. I have been seeking products that I can use for myself and feel confident in their safety as well as their claims of being natural. Any time I get a chance to try a natural product, I take it! Therefore, my recent opportunity to try and review  Adovia Natural Sulfur Soap for Acne, Blackheads and Oily Skin with Dead Sea Salt was one I was eager to undertake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin on my face, and have trouble with some products being too drying while others make it too oily.  I was excited to see it claimed to be for all skin types.  In bar form, this soap has a nice clean, fresh scent, not chemical or overly natural, as some products can be, it does not at all smell like sulfur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the seller:&lt;br /&gt;Adovia sulfur soap, is highly enriched with minerals and sulfur from the Dead Sea.&lt;br /&gt;Your skin&#x27;s natural moisture levels are balanced and optimized with Olive Oil, Dead Sea minerals and Aloe Vera extract.&lt;br /&gt;Sulfur has Antiseptic, Anti-Fungal and Antibacterial properties&lt;br /&gt;This soap thoroughly cleanses your face and body and leaves your skin gentle and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Our sulfur soap has a 3% sulfur content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things, along with my desire to find a product that is safe and natural for my skin, made me eager to try.  I have used this soap as a facial cleanser as well as a whole body wash in the shower.  I have yet to be disappointed.  My skin feels and looks clean.  I don&#x27;t have oily or dry spots, it is just evenly clean and clear.  I have not had any acne breakouts since using this soap either, which I am very excited about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely on my list of products to buy again, I love the results and this has fast become one of my favorites.  From a seller I trust due to other products I have tried and liked, I can feel secure that this soap is what it claims to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>

I though that it worked well and it lathered really well. It worked well on my skin didn’t make it break out or anything like that and I do have sensitive skin. The only thing I found that I want not totally in love with was the scent or lack of, but over all I was really impressed by this, I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;”http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOM824549d74f91a25a84a2b9446c681974&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;Tomoson.com&amp;lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it has a high reviews. When I used it, it&#x27;s actually quite good, it makes the face smothy and comfortable. It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I love all Adovia products. I am using the sulfur soap for my &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; onset acne and so far I have not been disappointed. Although I have used it for less than a week I notice I have less breakouts. Mild and has caused no irritation up to this point. Hopefully this will continue until I have the clear skin I have always had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend to anyone experiencing acne at any age.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered for years with red, bumpy, scaly, itchy, broken out and irritated skin on my forehead, nose, cheeks, upper lip and patches around my lips.  I&#x27;ve been prescribed cream after cream.  I&#x27;ve tried facials and many different over-the-counter products.  Some things helped for awhile but nothing cured my problem - UNTIL NOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the many positive reviews about Adovia Mneral Skin Care &amp;#34;Sulfur Soap with Dead Seas Salt for Face &amp; Body.  The positive results people were getting made me feel that this soap might help me.  IT WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gently wash my face in the morning and in the evening using this wonderful soap.  I also use cold water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks my skin is clear again.  All of the symptoms are completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my moisturizer I use a tiny amount of Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and it doesn&#x27;t leave a waxy film like the typical bar soap can!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy I found Adovia&#x27;s Sulfur Soap with Dead Sea Salt for Face &amp; Body.  I give it a 10+ !!!</li>
            <li> Really good soap! I had suffer with acne and this helped minimize my acne and now I don&#x27;t break out!! I still have acne marks, but as far as acne I don&#x27;t have them. I would recommend this</li>
            <li> My teenage son won&#x27;t use any other soap. It really helps keep acne under control, which can be very difficult for a teenager. My husband doesn&#x27;t care for the sulphur smell, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, and I am normally very averse to scented soaps and lotions. It leaves me feeling clean and fresh without overdrying my skin. It&#x27;s a lot of money for bar soap, but it does seem to last a long time, even in the shower with daily use by 2 people. Also, doesn&#x27;t fall apart when the bar gets very thin, so I can use it until it&#x27;s nearly gone.</li>
            <li> Love it. Since using, I have noticed faster cell turnover in my skin. Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> This soap helps to clear up my whiteheads, blackheads, and oiliness! I use it morning and at night, with warm water, and a wash rag, and that&#x27;s it! It helps clear up my face with that little of effort! I also have noticed a glow/healthier look to my skin with using this product! I will DEFINITELY be purchasing this soap again in the future! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it! (I was given this product by the company to review.)</li>
            <li> Excellent for oily skin. Really reduces the oil, shine, and blackheads over time. The soap itself foams very well, has very little to no scent, and the bar is long lasting. It does not melt down or get soft easily which is pretty impressive and there is no waste. Makes my skin feel fabulous without drying it out. Very deep cleaning, all natural ingredients, and effective. I definitely recommend this soap and I am so glad I got a free sample of this to try.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;ve used Adovia skin care products before, so before I received this I had high expectations of quality.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used a bar soap for my face though, so my skepticism was at an all time high. I have to say though, this exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;It smells pleasant and lathers up really well. It didn&#x27;t make my skin feel dry, like many other bar soaps do to my hands and body. It leaves a really great &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling.&lt;br /&gt;The bar is very large and will likely last a LONG time. It&#x27;s firm and not crumbly like many hand wash bars of this size. This is a plus, because it makes it totally worth the cost. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this as a facial wash for anyone who has oily skin or gets acne frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Full Disclosure, Adovia sent me this product for review, however my opinion is 100% my own. You can read a longer, with pictures, review on my website later this month. Web link on my profile.)</li>
            <li> works great but leaves a little bit of a residue on my face that i have to scrub off with another cleanser</li>
            <li> I wanted my oldest daughter to try Adovia 100% Natural Sulfur Soap for Acne, Blackheads and Oily Skin, because she suffers from acne and has from the day she hit puberty.  The soap does not leave her skin feeling dry nor oily so it’s a perfect combination of ingredients to provide natural feeling skin.  She has had positive results with the soap so far and has plans to continue to use it.  She wants to add to this review after completing a full bar of the Adovia.  I&#x27;m happy that she has gained even an ounce of her confidence back with the results she&#x27;s seen so far.</li>
            <li> Application: I used this bar soap in the shower, and I was pleasantly surprised that it didn&#x27;t really have a fragrance. Sulfur generally has an unpleasant smell, but this was fine. I found that this soap did leave me feeling cleansed but not stripped of moisture, like other bar soaps can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: This is a good alternative to over-drying soaps with natural sulfur to help treat oily skin issues.  While it seems small in size, I am thinking that this soap will last a really long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.</li>
            <li> I tried the soap on my face first. For some reason I thought it was only a facial soap. I have really sensitive skin on my face and my face did not like this soap. Instead of preventing breakouts, I think it made them worse. It also made my skin really red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I read a little more about this soap and decided to use it on my hands, legs, arms and back. That made all the difference. It did exfoliate my skin and I could almost feel the sulfur pulling out the impurities in my skin. The soap made my skin very soft and there was a visible difference in the way it looked. I also liked that it had antiseptic and antibacterial properties. That tells me that it will help with skin irritations and any infections that Lupus can cause on my skin. It also would make a really good treatment for your hands. I reviewed Adovia moisturizer a few weeks ago and that moisturizer is a perfect companion product to use with this one. Using those on my hands left my hands soft and also decreased the look of age in my hands.</li>
            <li> I am usually pretty hesitant to try new facial cleansing products because I have really sensitive skin. I typically don’t like to stray from what I know won’t completely dry out my skin and cause me problems. I decided to try this Adovia Sulfur Soap because I had the opportunity to review it for my blog,I have also previously heard about many of the benefits that can come from Dead Sea minerals (seriously, look them up!), they are known to have many different therapeutic qualities and the soap is derived from all natural ingredients. We’re talking about ingredients you can actually read and pronounce! Its intended use is for people who suffer from acne, blackheads, and oily skin. Unfortunately I have always had issues with those awful blackheads and my skin is also naturally oily so I really had nothing to lose by trying this product. I have been using it morning and night on my face for the last 4 days and have been pleasantly surprised how the soap has left me feeling afterwards. Most soaps and cleansers either leave my face completely dried out or feeling like there’s some waxy residue left on my skin and I can honestly say I didn’t get either feeling with this.  There’s a very mild scent to the soap so it’s not overwhelming but it also doesn’t have your typical face soap fragrance. I plan on continuing to use this soap in place of my usual cleanser with the hopes of keeping my face clear without all the harsh ingredients. I still need to give it some more time to see how well it gets rid of blackheads so I’ll report back in a few weeks on that! Another plus was when my mail carrier managed to lose my package I decided to contact the seller directly about my issue. They were extremely friendly and sent out a new soap on the same day..great customer service.</li>
            <li> I have finally had the chance to use the adovia natural sulfur soap and of course i used it on my face where because of going out i was breaking out like crazy and needed a soap that wasn&#x27;t going to irritate my face or my nose ring, as you know i put my nose ring back in and was having issues with break outs by it and needed a soap badly or something that wouldn&#x27;t irritate it or make it infected, after trying a few products this one i decided to try next and it works! no more break outs around my nose and i have only used it for a day in the long run it will be an amazing product it does dry out your face so be warned on that and use a non oil based moisturizer or a toner after it so you don&#x27;t get the dry patches! Also all the black heads i was trying to figure out how to get rid of around my nose opposite of my nose ring all gone, my face is so completely soft. Just like i said make sure to use the moisturizer after it encase your skin goes from oily to dry like mine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have reviewed so many of Adovia&#x27;s products and I will say- I love them all.&lt;br /&gt;The scent on this soap is no exception. I expected a nasty sulfur smell, but was pleasantly surprised. You get the skin benefits of the sulfur but without the funky smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this on my breaky outy face with great results.. I really used it all over and have been pleased. It does not dry out my skin and it is keeping me clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much to Adovia for another great product!</li>
            <li> Last month Adovia Mineral Skin care was nice enough to send me a bar of their Sulfer Soap for Acne to review. I have never used a bar face soap so I was pretty iffy about it. When I started to use it I already had 3 pimples on my face, the soap did not help get rid of them, but since starting I have not had another break out. I have been using the bar 2 twice for about a month and the bar still looks like a brand new bar. I love this stuff and I would recommend anyone that gets acne to try this product. &#x27;</li>
            <li> I tried the Adovia sulfur soap because I wanted a soap that would work on my blackheads and my oily skin. I generally do not go towards bar soap but the sulfur in this soap intrigued me. I will admit that while it did not live up to my high standards I did see a decease in my acne breakouts and my blackheads, I just wanted to see more. I did see an overall decrease in the oiliness of my skin which was great. I think this is a great soap for people who have severe or constant breakouts as I feel the sulfur would aid greatly in these cases. So, while not necessarily for me, I do think this is a good bar soap and will help other suffers of acne. I received the product complimentary for review purposes and the opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> I bought this soup a week ago. I used it the same night it arrived. I can tell you that this soup is amazing. I seen a huge improvement in my skin. Before my acne on my forehead was getting worse and i couldnt get some pimples to leave. Finally, all the hard pimples are leaving. I feel confident. My pimples arent completely gone but you can see the big difference compare to before. I wash my face in the morning and before i got to bed with this soap. Amazing. I also use it for my body. I love it. My skin is smooth now.</li>
            <li> I received this product free for review purposes and I am very glad I did. My boyfriend gets extremely dirty and oily at work so he breaks out pretty bad and gets really bad blackheads. After using the soap for about a week I could already see his back starting to clear up and blackheads not getting to be as large. I was having to remind him everyday to use it but now I don&#x27;t have to say anything because he loves how it&#x27;s helping his skin and WANTS to use it.</li>
            <li> I used it for a itchy skin problem that my Dr didn&#x27;t find any reason, not allergies that I already knew, not bed bugs, but the most rare was nothing were on my skin but itchy. This soap take it out. Love his aroma, I was expecting a hard odor but not.</li>
            <li> My skin has cleared up a lot since I stared using this!</li>
            <li> bought for my daughter and her skin is showing rapid improvement from acne</li>
            <li> There is no denying I love Adovia. I have had the pleasure of trying many of their products and with every product, every service, and with every shipping expectation I can honestly say I have been impressed. I have even called Adovia my favorite beauty brand of 2014.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is another Adovia product that has transformed my skin and will surely be showcased on my weekly and monthly favorites on my blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the Adovia Natural Sulfur Soap. A mineral enriched dead sea soap that thoroughly cleanses your face, removing all your makeup and grim, unclogging your pores and this while keeping your skin soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not your every day soap. The Adovia Natural Sulfar soap is enriched with Olive oil, Aloe Vera, Palm Oil, Dead Sea Minerals and Sulfar; to deeply clean down into your pores and draw out those impurities and yet still leaves your skin beautifully soft, balanced, and oil free all day. It is not always easy to find products that thoroughly cleanse our face without stripping it from the natural moisture it so desperately needs but here you will find it not only balances but it will leave your skin feeling clean and soft for hours. I love it. It is the perfect tool to start breaking down that acne causing bacteria that clogs your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stat using this Adovia Natural Sulfar Soap and start seeing your skin transform with daily use.</li>
            <li> Got this soap for my son&#x27;s acne and it has done wonders its taken about three weeks (its natural not drugs) but his face is just about completely cleared definetely recommend.</li>
            <li> This product worked wonderfully from it&#x27;s very first use! After the birth of my son, my face has become oily. I notice a constant shine. The sulfur soap decreased the oil production for me after it&#x27;s very first use. After about a week of using it, I started following up with a oil free moisturizer afterwards because my skin was feeling a little dry/tight. My breakout have decreased, and I no longer have a shine on my face through out the day. I am very happy with my results.&lt;br /&gt;The soap creates a creamy lather that feels soft, and has no scent at all. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone battling excess oil and breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have very fair, fussy skin. At 51, i still get the occasional acne. Who knew you could have breakouts and hot flashes....lucky me! I do recommend the sulfur soap and have just placed an order for another bar. Lathers well. Works with bath sponge or cloth. The smell is not unpleasant. Rinses clean and does not dry out my skin. I use every day, twice a day. Hope this review helps.</li>
            <li> I loved for the two weeks I had it:( I accidently left it at a hotel in my toiletrie bag:( but I loved the customer service, the smell, feel and overall cleanliness I felt while using it:) wish I could have used all of it, though:(</li>
            <li> I got this soap to try to wean myself off of Avar (very expensive), and so far, it does seem to be effective. I am one of those that has to be very consistent about washing with this soap after sweating.</li>
            <li> MY PERSONAL REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have reviewed so many of Adovia&#x27;s products and I will say- I love them all. The scent on this soap is no exception. I expected a nasty sulfur smell, but was pleasantly surprised. You get the skin benefits of the sulfur but without the funky smell! I&#x27;m so glad I got to try this soap. The main reason why I wanted to try this soap was because I suffer from acne. I&#x27;m 34 and still suffer from it. I also have oily skin so I also want to try and help that. This soap has done it and I&#x27;m impressed. Great soap for anyone with oily skin, blackheads, or just fights with acne in general. No heavy fragrances and it lathers up great in the shower. Even in high humidity my face stayed clean and shine free for hours. After a week of using everyday my skin had fewer breakouts and best of all no redness or irritation like other acne products I have tried.After just one week of use my face is dramatically clearer! I would suggest if your having issues with acne and blackheads as well as oily skin!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how amazing this product is.&lt;br /&gt;I have slight acne issues and after first use the next morning my face was nearly pimple, blackhead, and bump free.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d high reccomend this item with Aztec Clay Mask.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product in order to facilitate my review, all thoughts and opinions expressed are in fact my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We love how Adovia products make our skin look and feel. The Natural Sulfur Soap is not different. It&#x27;s tough on oil and acne skin, but gentle enough on my challenge skin. We wanted to try this soap for its claims on Acne and Blackheads and Eczema, what we didn&#x27;t realize is that it wasn&#x27;t necessarily &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; for my sensitive skin, but I had to try it anyway. It is always important to read all the details before trying a new skin care regime regardless of its natural claims, it might not be suitable for all skin types. Where my skin was sensitive/dry it showed nothing extraordinary (nothing like Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap), but it did make it feel a lot dryer (had to follow up with some serious moisture) however, where my skin was oily (T-Zone) it was shiny and squeaky clean! My girls haven&#x27;t really had the time to get the full results, so we&#x27;ll hold off on that, but I am hoping their overall success is as good. Keep you posted on the update.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or anything but this made my skin sooo dry and patchy as well as blotchy.  It did nothing to help my skin tone or clear up the little bit of acne I get sometimes.  I have been using this product once or twice a day for about two weeks  and I am going to stop and find something better.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!!best one I&#x27;ve ever used. This made my skin vibrant and made my pores look smaller. I like how it completely removes the oil on my skin particularly on my back where i get breakouts while at the same time keeping it moisturized and looking clean. this definitely makes the acne marks on my body fade. the soap also lasts for months.  i highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Loved this soap!  Great for acne-prone skin.  First product EVER that cleared my skin without some crazy rash or hives or drying it out.  Love the naturally effective ingredient list!  It is an awesome product for both face &amp; body.  I can actually leave the house without make-up because my skin is so clear!!!</li>
            <li> I received this soap for testing purpose and I must say it leaves my skin very soft. This soap has no smell to it but it has many beneficial ingredients infused in it including the Dead Sea minerals. It&#x27;s a fabulous soap!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to use this soap at first, because it has sulfur in it after all. To my surprise it wasn&#x27;&#x27;t smelly and it actually left my face feeling nice and clean. I think I need a few more bars to give as gifts. This is a normal sized bar, the scent is pleasant and not overpowering, and it leaves your skin stripped of dirt and chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and rosacea.  This product is fairly inexpensive but cuts down on my facial redness without irritating it.  It does not have a strong smell either, like other sulfur soaps.  The seller is very good to deal with.  I even got a follow up email a couple of days after ordering making sure I was happy with my purchase and giving me contact information if I had any questions or concerns.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work on me for some reasons.  Made my acne even worse</li>
            <li> I really like this soap! It lathers very well and feels great! It leaves your skin feeling very soft and smooth and very clean! It works great on any blemishes I have and also helps clear up any eczema that shows up. It&#x27;s not too harsh or abrasive, but i do follow with a daily moisturizer. Helps heal blemishes without over drying my skin. I am so happy to recieve this product to review! It left my skin healthy and glowing!</li>
            <li> Horrible soap! Very disappointed, made me break out more than usual i gave it a chance because I thought that it was gonna get worst before it gets better but I couldn&#x27;t wait that long! not worth spending 10 bucks on 😡</li>
            <li> This is great for my teenage son&#x27;s oily skin. Since he&#x27;s been using it, for the past couple of weeks, his facial acne and oiliness has decreased. Overall he is happy with this soap. It is great for controlling oily skin, while not being too drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before we got it, we were afraid it would smell unpleasant because of the sulfur, but the sulfur odor is minimal.</li>
            <li> Using this soap I have noticed that my skin has been less itchy than using other soaps. I have sensitive skin and wasn&#x27;t sure this would make a difference but it has. Although I am use to using liquid soap it latter&#x27;s very well making me feel clean and refreshed.  My husband has been stealing it from my shower for himself too. I guess it&#x27;s time to buy him his own haha</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I have been on this natural/organic kick and I wanted a soap that doesn&#x27;t have all the junk my body washes had in it.&lt;br /&gt;My Experience:&lt;br /&gt;I have blemishes that I have just given up on and to my pleasant surprise, this soap began to fade those blemishes in just a week. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I had used fade creams and Shea butter with no luck. And after using this soap for a little over a week, I saw a complete difference in my complexion. My skin is brighter and looks so refreshed. I have definitely struck gold. The blemishes on my body are faint. You can still see them but they&#x27;re getting more and more faint (right before my eyes... It&#x27;s crazy). Will be looking into their other products now. If the sulfur soap does this to my face and body, I can only imagine what the scrubs and hair conditioner must do. Love when I stumble upon amazing products.</li>
            <li> i had flea bite and this really cures the inflammation immediately after the bath. i just apply it for 3 minutes then wash.</li>
            <li> Is an excellent product. Fits my skin and soft I can feel that the skin is healing!!</li>
            <li> To give this product a fair chance I bought and used two bars. After using them both I can honestly say I did not see any improvement of the acne on my chest reducing. I can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is really good. We love it. I will buy it again. Thanks.</li>
            <li> At least as effective as the $75 dollar prescription acne cleanser I used to get with about the same ingredients in it, except in a cream/gel form.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face oily and I break out more often.</li>
            <li> This is a very effective facial soap. It was able to reduce the occurrence of too many pimples on my son&#x27;s face. It has a very mild scent that one may not even smell that it is a sulfur soap. The only thing that may make you think twice is the price. Some other sulfur soap are cheaper and may be as effective.</li>
            <li> I was extremely impressed with the shipping. Though $10 is expensive for a bar of soap,  it holds up if you put it in a container or tray and keep it relatively dry. I could tell immediately during the first use that it was made of high quality ingredients. I have combination skin and the oily parts felt squeaky clean while the dry/sensitive parts did not get irritated or dried out. This is an expensive but excellent product.</li>
            <li> Soap is nice but the bar is really small and WAY overpriced</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this to review for my blog and I am in love with it. I was skeptical at first because of the sulfur and I remember how bad that smelled in high school, but there is hardly any scent at all to this wonderful soap! I can pronounce all the ingredients and it made my skin feel so soft and smooth after just the first wash! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I’m always on the hunt for that perfect product that will treat, or even eliminate my acne. In my twenties I remember using a facial soap that contained sulfur, and I remembered it worked on my acne prone skin. It was too expensive so I didn’t purchase it again. One of the great things about Adovia Natural Sulfur Soap is that it’s affordable! It only retails for $9.00, and anyone can buy it whether you are on a budget or not. Not only is it affordable, it works! Adovia Natural Sulfur Soap is a quality made product infused with ingredients that will keep your acne at bay.&lt;br /&gt;Every time I use Adovia on my face, I notice that my skin feels, and looks smoother! My oily skin is not as oily as before, and I haven’t experienced any breakouts! I love that my face feels clean, and moisturized plus it doesn’t leave an icky film behind. The Adovia Natural Sulfur Soap doesn’t have a scent either. I like that it’s fragrance free! It won’t irritate your skin because it’s made with all natural ingredients! Some of the ingredients include olive oil, the famous Dead Sea Minerals, and Aloe Vera extract. So it’s soothing to your skin too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the Adovia Natural Sulfur Soap is perfect for anyone that suffers from acne prone skin! If you have acne on your face or body the Adovia Natural Sulfur Soap is for you! I recommend it, and I truly with all sincerity love it! It works, and I think you will like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received Adovia Sulfur Soap for testing purposes. However, all the opinions expressed are 100% my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
            <li> Adovia Mineral Skin Care On Promotion Adovia Sulfur Soap for Acne, Blackheads and Oily Skin with Dead Sea Salt - 100% Natural is an amazing product. I have combination skin and it has made such a difference in my skin. It all natural so I didnt have to worry about my skin have a harsh reaction to it. I must admit i was worried about it drying out my skin but the Olive oil and Aloe Vera in it moisturized my skin as it it killed all the bacteria and got rid of all the oil in my skin. After one use i saw results immediately. There was no oil yet my skin had felt super smooth and soft. This is definitely a product I recommend to any one with acne prone skin with any skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: While I did receive this product complimentary through the company, this is my 100% my honest opinion and in no way shape or form change my opinion or alter it in any way.</li>
            <li> I have been using Adovia&#x27;s Sulfur Soap on my face and body during my morning shower each day for a couple months. This soap is very gentle on my sometimes-sensitive skin. Many soaps dry out my skin, but not Adovia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has remained soft despite daily use--it is one of the few soaps I would use on my face. The soap seems very mild and is one of my favorites. The scent is also very subtle--this pleasantly surprised me since it contains sulfur. I don&#x27;t have a serious acne problem, though I do experience occasional hormonal breakouts and backne. While I find it effective for my breakouts, I am not qualified to comment on how effective it is for chronic acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started using Adovia&#x27;s Sulfur Soap, I had a several small, but persistent pimples on my face and back. They have significantly decreased in size quicker than usual after using this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is important to know the ingredients in personal care products, so here is a list of the ingredients (according to the label): 80% Palm/ 20% Palm Kernel oil, Dead Sea Salts Magnesium, Sodium, Potassium, Deionized Water (Aqua), Sulphur, Olive Oil, Aloe Vera, Sodium Chloride, Natural extract (fragrance), Dead Sea Black Mud (Silt)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discounted bar of Adovia&#x27;s Sulfur Soap to review. I was so impressed I purchased a second bar!</li>
            <li> Hi! Rachelle here again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I want to talk about a problem that’s bothered me since I was in middle school: Acne. For some people, it goes away with the ‘teen hormones’. For others, like me, the annoying acne never really goes away. When I get stressed out, I break out. Let’s face it, college is stressful, so it’s safe to say that I’m always having a breakout of some sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given the opportunity to try Adovia Natural Sulfur Soap, and I jumped on it! I will admit I was nervous to try this product, because I have combination oily/dry skin, and every product that I have tried in the past has dried out my skin to the point that it peels and hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here’s what the box says:&lt;br /&gt;“ADOVIA’s Sulfur Soap is highly enriched with minerals and sulfur from the Dead Sea. Your skin’s natural moisture levels are balanced and optimized with Olive Oil, Dead Sea minerals and Aloe Vera. This soap thoroughly cleanses your face and body and leaves your skin gentle and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little put-off by the smell of the soap (smells are HUGE for me. I smell everything, especially anything that I put in or on my body).  The soap very lightly scented, so I was disappointed at first, but then I thought &#x27;maybe its the perfumes in the soaps I’ve used for my acne in the past that rendered them ineffective.’ Obviously a soap made out of natural ingredients shouldn’t smell like perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after giving the soap the smell-test, I tried it on my face. I was immediately impressed. Adovia’s Sulfur Soap took the excess oil from my face, without leaving it feel dry and tight, which is absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now, i’ll try it for a week and report back. It’s finals week..so if there’s any time for this soap to prove itself to me, it’s this week!  I promise to report back with my findings, but so far I only have amazing things to say!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, customer service is amazing and incredibly helpful(I had an issue with shipping—someone stole my package before I received it, and the problem was immediately solved).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll rate this product 9/10 for now, but I get a strong feeling that it will be 10/10!&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.ful(I had an issue with shipping—someone stole my package before I received it, and the problem was immediately solved).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll rate this product 9/10 for now, but I get a strong feeling that it will be 10/10!&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free.

            <li> Have used other kinds of sulfur soap which did help with my chronic adult acne, but left my skin rough and irritated. But THIS soap didn&#x27;t do that at all, in fact after just two days of use the condition of my skin is much improved. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I used this soap every morning for seven days because I wanted to have a true and honest result, and the truth is this:  My face seems to tingle a bit after I wash it with this soap, and I actually like that feeling. I have noticed that the blackheads on my chin area seem to have cleared and it looks like there are less of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that my face feels clean and moisturized while at the same time I don&#x27;t feel any kind of film that some soaps leave behind. It cleans nicely, removes dirt and unclogs pores, all without irritating or drying out my sensitive skin. An added plus is that this soap doesn’t irritate your skin because it’s made with all natural ingredients! I am very pleasantly surprised and pleased with this soap overall.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about a soap with Sulfur....I have smelled Sulfur before and it is not pleasant. I am happy to report that this soap does not at all smell like sulfur, and works beautifully. I do believe that it has helped clear up my acne prone skin and my skin feels very soft, not stripped of oils, after using. This soap brings a spa experience to your home, and I am very happy with this product. The bar itself and very dense and seems like it will last quite a while, unlike some softer soap bars that seem to melt away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I had to wait to use the soap because of a medical procedure, but so far it is very good. It is balancing my skins Ph and helping with the healing progress of my skin after my procedure. So far so good!!&lt;br /&gt;I remember my mother using sulfur for medical purposes and I wanted to find a natural sulfur soap. I finally have!!!</li>
            <li> Adovia Sulfur Soap with Dead Sea Salt has helped with my oily forehead and the blackheads on my nose. I also used it for the body, instead of just the face. My skin feels velvety smooth and clean. My skin is very dry; my legs get so ashy that it looks like I have cracks in my skin. Gross I know, but I’m being honest at least. After using the Sulfur Soap my skin felt hydrated again. I of course still use lotion which I’m sure helped a bunch. But, I think the real hero here is the Sulfur Soap I am absolutely in love with my skin now. I want to flaunt it, but unfortunately it is Fall and it’s time to bring out the sweaters. But, I can’t wait for Summer to come back again so that I can show off how nice my skin is.</li>
            <li> honestly this soap made me worse and made my skin so dry. my acne got even worse</li>
            <li> I absolutely love using this soap specially during &amp;#34;that time of the month&amp;#34; when all my &amp;#34;face demons&amp;#34; come out to play! It tames down my breakouts without drying my skin out. It works for my overly sensitive and dry skin. It has olive oil that hydrates and moisturizes my skin naturally, aloe vera that soothes my skin, dead sea minerals that adds nutrients back into the skin and sulfur that keeps bacteria from forming which causes acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.

            <li> I really like this soap, it&#x27;s been a really great addition to my skin care routine. I have cycstic acne prone, oily, sensitive skin and I love how it leaves me feeling clean and nourished. I have a full review at http://beautybymitchypoo.com</li>
            <li> A great soap for all ages….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is 14 and I am 43 years old, and yes, we both have acne, blackheads and troubled skin. We have been using the Adovia Sulfur Soap and enjoying the benefits from it. After cleaning my face and neck with the soap, my skin is very soft and smooth feeling afterwards. My daughter’s face seems to be even-ing out from the hormonal extremes that it is currently prone to. I love the incredibly mild scent that the soap has and feel confident that it can be used daily, if necessary, to clean my skin without drying it out. The bar is enriched with natural oils and leaves my skin feeling healthy and happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think for anyone, of any age, this would be a product that is worthwhile, to see if it can help clear up problem skin conditions. Keeping one’s face free from breakout’s is still a priority and challenge regardless of your age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.

            <li> I’m supper excited to try and share with you my “Adovia Sulfur Soap for Acne, Blackheads and Oily Skin with Dead Sea Salt - 100% Natural Review!”  What I love about this product is the natural Adovia soap is highly enriched with minerals and sulfur from the Dead Sea. With Olive Oil, Dead Sea minerals and Aloe Vera extract your skin’s natural moisture levels are balanced as well as optimized. Plus as an FYI (for your information) the sulfur( which is about 3% per bar) is used for its antiseptic, anti-fungal and antibacterial properties. Leaving your skin gentle and smooth this soap with thoroughly cleanse your face and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day my package arrived I got to try it out right after a long day at the beach. So I was hot, sweaty, covered in sunscreen, salt water and the Adovia soap was amazing from head to toe use.</li>
            <li> My review: This acne soap worked great my daughter. It&#x27;s unscented and a really pretty yellow colored bar. It did a great job of cleansing and getting deep down in the pores getting all the dirt out while not drying her face out. It left her face feeling soft and supple. As usual, Adovia rocks!!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference in my acne, but my face felt so clean and fresh after using this soap. It doesn&#x27;t leave that soap residue feeling on your face, and it does not make your face feel overly squeaky clean. Your skin will feel nourished and clean without being oily or drying. This is perfect for girls who have combination skin :)</li>
            <li> it does work on pimples and it does not dry out my face  will reorder</li>
            <li> Really impressed with this soap. I use it solely as a face wash. We have a Clarisonic face scrubber that does all kinds of spinning and rotating. Grab this bar of soap, rub it on the brushes of the scrubber and wash your face. The bar lasts a long long time. This one has lasted over 2 months with more than half to go. This is just plain old soap, nothing fru fru about it. Good all natural stuff.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this soap leaves my face feeling not only clean but pure. Luv it.</li>
            <li> Pretty good! It really clears my face up and also get rid of fungal infections! Not as drying as my old soaps and this doesn&#x27;t smell so much like a volcano as the other ones did.</li>
            <li> It loses it potency after about a month of daily use.  I really wished that it would maintain it&#x27;s salt and sulfur composition a little longer.</li>
            <li> I had to update my review, because after continued use of this soap I have noticed that my skin is considerably better. I have virtually no blackheads anymore and it really really calms my rosacea. I&#x27;ve been using it every day for about a month now and the bar is long lasting. I imagine this one bar will last me 4 or 5 months...I&#x27;m ecstatic I found this and am now excited to try some other products from this line.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Tomoson.com I was able to try this product for free. This is the first natural skin product I&#x27;ve ever used. So far I have been using this soap for two days and have just fallen in love with it. It has really helped my dry skin. I have found that it doesn&#x27;t leave a film on it like commercial soaps. I have also found that it&#x27;s improved many of my dry patches I have along with soften any acne prone areas I have. I have found it works wonders on my face since I tend to have dry or oily skin during the summer months. I noticed that my skin looks a little more radiant and less patchy. I also an improvement with two pimples I had they are beginning to shrink in size. I also found my face to be softer and less flaky. I highly reccommend this soap to anyone who in in the market to try a natural skin product.</li>
            <li> I had gotten this soap free for review purposes but that does not affect my review at all.&lt;br /&gt;I really did like the soap but was unaware it shouldn&#x27;t be used on sensitive skin, well I have sensitive facial skin after reading the box, I had discovered it wasn&#x27;t just a facial soap it can be used on the body as well. I love it for that it makes my skin feel so clean and it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue behind I do wish there was a little different fragrance to it though, but it did smell bad I am just picky when it comes to fragrances.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this soap. I&#x27;ve been using it for nightly since September 2014 and can see significant difference in my face. I no longer break out as much as I used it. For the first week or so using it, it left my face feeling a little dry but it also felt very clean. I use it to wash off my makeup (also tried removing makeup with facial wipes followed by using the soap and did not see any difference compared to using the soap alone) at night followed by applying an oil free moisturizer. My sisters now want to try the product. I would definitely recommend this to anyone prone to breakout and with oily skin. It may be too drying for those with normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> This soap feels luxurious when it is being lathered on. It has been very effective as well. I love all of the Adovia products that I have tried so far! I am so glad that I had the chance to review this. I will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> When I first open the box I noticed that the soap is unscented, which is good. When I showered with Adovia Sulfur Soap I made sure to wash my face and my body with that, just to see how it would affect my skin.  Lathers very easily, which I also liked. Usually I put lotion on after every shower, my skin is just not dry. So want to test the soap, I did not put any lotion on my body or my face whenever getting out. My body felt a little dry, but it wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable. Usually whenever my skin is dry it&#x27;s itchy, but this was fine-I just felt a little tight.&lt;br /&gt;My face was starting to break out because hormonal reasons prior to using the soap. My face was in good shape the morning after the first use of the Adovia Sulfur Soap. Like I said, my skin is usually very dry. When I went to bed after washing my face with the Adovia Sulfur Soap, I did not put any lotion on just to see how it would affect it. The next morning, the breakouts that I did have were dried up and almost gone. I use the soap again the following day, again face and body.&lt;br /&gt;This time, I chose to put lotion on my body, but I did not put anything on my face. When I applied lotion after my shower, my skin felt silky to my touch. My face, without any lotion, feels balanced. It&#x27;s not tight, it&#x27;s not greasy, and it looks bright and clean. That is one thing that I noticed about the soap, when you wash yourself, your skin is literally squeaky clean. Overall, I liked this product and I would use it again. I will recommend Adovia Sulfur Soap if your skin is oily and is prone to acne and blackheads, this is a great product to try. It&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin like other sulfur soaps. The soap is infused with moisturizing ingredients such as olive oil and Aloe Vera to keep skin soft and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a good soap,with continued use,you will definitely see results...........your face will be clean and clear of pimples.</li>
            <li> Been using this soap for over a month now. Hasn&#x27;t helped with my acne any. My acne hasn&#x27;t got any better or worse. It is very drying and makes my face raw red and feel and looks burned.  I&#x27;m going to stop using this soap.</li>
            <li> so far so good.  definitely need to be sure to exfoliate after using for a while.</li>
            <li> I use this to rinse my face in the morning.  It is not harsh at all.  Their is no harsh smell and the bar does not leave my skin feeling dry.  I was usually ordering bars like this from out of the country but this bar is a great compromise.</li>
            <li> I have only used this once but I am already starting to see results. I use it on my body and am loving it.</li>
