            <li>Great product, makes my hair really shine !!</li>
            <li>If you put a dab on your palm without evenly distributing it throughout your hands, and if you start to put a blob on the top of your head, Vitapointe will make your hair look greasy.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products.</li>
            <li>Better distributor</li>
            <li>Amazon will find it for me :)</li>
            <li>Used this product from Europe for many years now.  </li>
            <li>That Vitapointe is better product.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>wish there was more in the bottle.</li>
            <li>(Ok, so it&#x27;s not Brylcreem).  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many, many years when my brother-in-law was a V.P. with&lt;br</li>
            <li>my area do not carry this product any more</li>
            <li>Actually,&lt;br /&gt;it is more convenient this way.  </li>
            <li>I am becoming more and more worried that this product will no longer be available.</li>
            <li>i liked it very much!</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products, but keep returning to Vitapointe as it does the best job for me.</li>
            <li>so I am glad they have them available.</li>
            <li>It us great for ny scalp and give my white hair a lovely shine.</li>
            <li>but this is a completely new formulation and not as good.</li>
            <li>But if you never had it, you&#x27;ll probably like this just fine.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a long time and it is a great &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; conditioner for hair.</li>
            <li>Great product for dry, damaged or colored hair.</li>
            <li>Using Vitapointe makes my hair look more vibrant and</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and then could no longer find it in local stores.  </li>
            <li>It is nice that you can purchase it on Amazon, it is harder to find in the stores.</li>
            <li>this was the large jars.  </li>
            <li>It is designed, very well I might say, for women whose hair tends to be frizzy.  </li>
            <li>and I would not recommend this for anyone who wants to not feel this on their hair after it is applied.  </li>
            <li>The ends of your hair tend to be older and dryer than the rest of your hair.  </li>
            <li>Recommended by high end stylist.  </li>
            <li>Then you can rub it on your hair, FIRST starting at the ends of the hair.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s applied with a little finesse, you will see the desired results, and it is very well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Vitapointe leaves my naturally curly hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting the old Vitapointe</li>
            <li>This one seems quite heavy and not the light touch it used to have.  </li>
            <li>but I will have to continue looking for a replacement for the old Vitapointe.</li>
            <li>I feel that Vitapointe is worth every penny I spent on it!</li>
            <li>It is better than any other product that you can buy on the market and costs a lot less.</li>
            <li>I have seen some reviews in general about Vitapointe saying that the product is too greasy.  </li>
            <li>Product isn&#x27;t exactly the same as that that comes in the pink and blue squeeze tube from UK/Europe.</li>
            <li>This apparently is the american (?) issue.</li>

            <li> It is thick and heavy and greasy.  </li>
            <li> My hair is wavy and thick and has a&lt;br /&gt;tendency to be course looking.  </li>
            <li> The only sad part is that it was removed from local drugstores :(</li>
            <li> I am not happy at all</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have seen some reviews in general about Vitapointe saying that the product is too greasy.  My sister also feels it is too greasy.  In fact, yes, it can be too greasy.  I think it can down right make your hair look dirty.  Yet, I give it 5 stars.  Why would I do that?  Because, it is the way we apply the product that determines how it makes our hair look.  Like a lot of products such as hair products or even make up products, technique is imperative.  You have to dab about a dime size, per the instructions, on your palm.  Then rub it on both sides of your hands, palm and backs, like you would a lotion.  Then you can rub it on your hair, FIRST starting at the ends of the hair.  The ends of your hair tend to be older and dryer than the rest of your hair.  If you put a dab on your palm without evenly distributing it throughout your hands, and if you start to put a blob on the top of your head, Vitapointe will make your hair look greasy.  It is designed, very well I might say, for women whose hair tends to be frizzy.  If it&#x27;s applied with a little finesse, you will see the desired results, and it is very well worth it.  I have tried many products. I have tried coconut oil, eggs, mayonnaise, olive oil, baking soda, many over the counter products, but this works the best.  No scent and some nice results.</li>
            <li> Product terrific and current date  this was the large jars.  Better distributor</li>
            <li> Vitapointe leaves my naturally curly hair soft and shiny.  It also controlls frizz and dryness.  I have tried many other products, but keep returning to Vitapointe as it does the best job for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 7 years and loved it. I have spent lots of money triying different brands in hair products but nothing worked. Once I tried this product, never stop using it why? This is the best product ever. The only sad part is that it was removed from local drugstores :(&gt; But wait there is hope....Amazon will find it for me :)Great news!!!I can&#x27;t wait to get it, my hair is thirsty:0</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and it is the best thing I have found to keep my hair neat and shiny.</li>
            <li> Used this product from Europe for many years now.  This apparently is the american (?) issue. Product isn&#x27;t exactly the same as that that comes in the pink and blue squeeze tube from UK/Europe. That Vitapointe is better product.  But if you never had it, you&#x27;ll probably like this just fine.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.I have used Vita pointe fpr over 15 years and have found it to be excellent for my hair.</li>
            <li> I  have used this for years.  It does not build up in your hair; add shine</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time and it is a great &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; conditioner for hair. It is non greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave a film or make your hair heavy. Love it.</li>
            <li> I use this product before I blow dry or flat iron my hair. If you want your hair to have the perfect luster without being weighed down, this is the perfect product for you.</li>
            <li> Used this product for many years bnut unable to find it in stores.  Product is the same as it used to be---excellent</li>
            <li> product is as advertised very happy with results.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use too much!</li>
            <li> wish there was more in the bottle. I have a good amount of hair that eats moisturizers. It works well but I I still need something a little stronger.</li>
            <li> I thought this cream would be light and not sticky, but I was wrong.  It is thick and heavy and greasy.  I am not happy at all and I would not recommend this for anyone who wants to not feel this on their hair after it is applied.  It just makes my hair flat and icky.</li>
            <li> Best hairdressing  cream.. I recommended it to my barber as well. Used by both men and women!</li>
            <li> Recommended by high end stylist.  A dab&#x27;ll do ya!  (Ok, so it&#x27;s not Brylcreem).  Will last forever.  The only problem I found is, that the cream might separate from the oil...I knead the tube a bit before dispensing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  It makes my hair grow healthy, it shines and it is very to easy to manage! I feel that Vitapointe is worth every penny I spent on it!</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have used for years but can no longer get in  a store so I am glad they have them available.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many, many years when my brother-in-law was a V.P. with&lt;br /&gt;Clairol.....it was then I started along with their hair color.  My hair is wavy and thick and has a&lt;br /&gt;tendency to be course looking.  Using Vitapointe makes my hair look more vibrant and alive.&lt;br /&gt;The shine on my hair gets me compliments of &amp;#34;what do you do to get that shine?&amp;#34;  The stores&lt;br /&gt;in my area do not carry this product any more so I have to order it online in quanity.  Actually,&lt;br /&gt;it is more convenient this way.  I&#x27;ve tried other brand name products but they either have a&lt;br /&gt;fragrance that&#x27;s overpowering or weighs my hair down and not shiney.  I actually cut the tube&lt;br /&gt;in half and scoop out the inside to the last drop.  That&#x27;s how good it is!</li>
            <li> You cannot find this product in the stores and I swear by it.  It is better than any other product that you can buy on the market and costs a lot less.</li>
            <li> GIFT FOR MY SISTER;  VITAPOINTE ONLY HAIRDRESS  SHE LIKES; HAS BEEN USING FOR NUMBER OF YEARS</li>
            <li> use several times a week - no more dry hair/scalp</li>
            <li> I was expecting the old Vitapointe but this is a completely new formulation and not as good. This one seems quite heavy and not the light touch it used to have.  Sorry, but I will have to continue looking for a replacement for the old Vitapointe.</li>
            <li> I have used this product ever since it was a Clairol hairdressing. It is the only product that makes my over-processed hair shine. Yes, my straw-like hair actually shines. I am becoming more and more worried that this product will no longer be available. All it takes is just a little dab to make my hair look like hair again.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry, damaged or colored hair. Been using for years!&lt;br /&gt;Just a little dab every morning before showering1!</li>
            <li> Great product, makes my hair really shine !!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and then could no longer find it in local stores.  It us great for ny scalp and give my white hair a lovely shine.</li>
            <li> I had used it years ago but could no longer find it in our local stores. It still is the best product of its kind for my hair.</li>
            <li> i liked it very much!</li>
            <li> My husband swears by this, it is the only product that has worked for his hair. And believe me, we have tried a bunch. It is nice that you can purchase it on Amazon, it is harder to find in the stores.</li>
