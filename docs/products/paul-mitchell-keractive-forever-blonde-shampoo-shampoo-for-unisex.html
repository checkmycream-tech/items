            <li>This along with the forever blonde spray and conditioner is AMAZING!</li>

            <li>Other than that I love the product!!</li>
            <li>so it is dry but healthy (as healthy</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>The smells is amazing, and it helps keep the brassiness out of my blonde highlights.</li>
            <li>it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>even if they don&#x27;t highlight it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Use it several times a week to keep my hair blonde, bright, and shiny!</li>
            <li>Used for a long time by a friend who finds it keeps excellent blonde shade for older blond hair.</li>
            <li>I already knew I loved this product - but I can get it for less and have it delivered to my door.</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle there at the salon along with the&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the first couple times I used it, I immediately noticed my hair was a lot softer &amp; shinier.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is really purple!  </li>
            <li>I received this product just a few days after ordering it, well packed and in good condition.</li>
            <li>The shampoo leaves my highlighted hair feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Good shampoo, but nothing out of the ordinary-</li>
            <li>i ended up buying the large bottles.</li>
            <li>I really like it &amp; will 100% continue using it.</li>
            <li>I really do like this product.</li>
            <li>Really makes it shine.  </li>
            <li>It really does repair the hair.</li>
            <li>haha,</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo to anyone with lightened hair!</li>
            <li>So far so good- hair seems less frizzy!</li>
            <li>I definitely will buy it again with 33.8oz next time:)</li>
            <li>I do have a verrrry sensative scalp (a new onset&lt;br /&gt;due to underactive thyroid we just found out)</li>
            <li>This shampoo was recommended to me by my new hair stylist.  </li>
            <li>However, the only thing I wished they hadn&#x27;t done, was changed the Forever Blonde shampoo from the tube it was originally in to this bottle.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the new stylist that I am seeing said she thought the previous hair stylist was probably using a cheap product on my hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use much so hopefully it will last longer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>do however really like the Paul Mitchell Blonde conditioner.</li>
            <li>The hole clogs up with shampoo &amp; the bottle isn&#x27;t near as compact for travel as the tube was.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s lack of foaming action</li>
            <li>This is one of the products I use along with the Forever Blonde Conditioner to maintain its shine and body no matter what particular hue</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly even to those who are not blonde!</li>
            <li>Thank you for sending this to me here in Guam since no other beauty shop carries this line of PM.</li>
            <li>and then now I purchase it right here on Amazon (I save a few $$).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently bleached my hair ombr&amp;eacute; (I&#x27;m a natural brunette) and I was told that the blonde could lose its shine &amp; was recommended this shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair is not nearly as dry and the breakage seems to be stopping.  </li>
            <li>I have grey hair which has been  professionally colored and highlighted different shades of blonde and brown over a period of several years.</li>
            <li>Works well and adds volume for my fine, thin hair.</li>

            <li> Works well and adds volume for my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair a little too dry or a little too soft so that it gets greasy quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been getting highlights for decades and never had this problem until the past year when I started going to a new salon.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t notice a big difference using it vs. other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s a little more expensive than drugstore brands, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> have another shampoo brand used for blonde hair, and I feel it works just as well, and is less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and it was so very dry.  </li>
            <li> When I received the shampoo the cap had opened a little bit and there was shampoo all over the outside of the bottle</li>
            <li> works as expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but maybe once a week is enough to keep up.</li>
            <li> I understand that it probably opened while it was being shipped because the bubble wrap around the shampoo was on very tight (obviously trying to avoid it from opening).</li>
            <li> ( a small dime sized portion is all that is needed so will last a lot longer than the shampoo)</li>
            <li> now the conditioner on the other hand is AHHH mazing.</li>
            <li> I am a fake blonde and sometimes the blonde would start to look a little darker and brassy.  </li>
            <li> My hair no longer feels like dead straw.</li>
            <li> One of the purple shampoos made my hair tint of green.</li>
            <li> This is an everyday shampoo.</li>
            <li> The shampoo color is not &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; but it made my hair less brassy without dull.</li>
            <li> I would rate this 5 stars but when my shampoo arrived, the bottle was opened &amp; some of the product came out (very little).</li>
            <li> It was cheaper on amazon than in the salons I usually purchase from.</li>
            <li> The other made my hair shockingly purple....</li>

    <ol>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this and when I flipped open the cap and smelled&lt;br /&gt;it I was sold!!! I bought my first bottle there at the salon along with the&lt;br /&gt;conditioner and then now I purchase it right here on Amazon (I save a few $$).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the leave in of this line / scent and my hair just loves it! I have&lt;br /&gt;highlighted my hair for about 20 years so it is dry but healthy (as healthy&lt;br /&gt;as highlighted hair gets!!).  I do have a verrrry sensative scalp (a new onset&lt;br /&gt;due to underactive thyroid we just found out) so I don&#x27;t use this on the top of&lt;br /&gt;my scalp but I use it along the sides and back and through the ends and my hair&lt;br /&gt;smells absolutely delicious for 24 hrs. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this shampoo....it smells amazing as well as it does an amazing job of cleaning without stripping my hair.</li>
            <li> I have grey hair which has been  professionally colored and highlighted different shades of blonde and brown over a period of several years. This is one of the products I use along with the Forever Blonde Conditioner to maintain its shine and body no matter what particular hue I&#x27;m with at the moment.  I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> love love, makes my hair the way i want them to be</li>
            <li> I recently bleached my hair ombr&amp;eacute; (I&#x27;m a natural brunette) and I was told that the blonde could lose its shine &amp; was recommended this shampoo &amp; conditioner. After the first couple times I used it, I immediately noticed my hair was a lot softer &amp; shinier. I really like it &amp; will 100% continue using it. I would rate this 5 stars but when my shampoo arrived, the bottle was opened &amp; some of the product came out (very little). I understand that it probably opened while it was being shipped because the bubble wrap around the shampoo was on very tight (obviously trying to avoid it from opening). Other than that I love the product!!</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this shampoo a lot. It&#x27;s purple in color for highlighted or blonde hair. I don&#x27;t use much so hopefully it will last longer.&lt;br /&gt;I have another shampoo brand used for blonde hair, and I feel it works just as well, and is less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;This was recommended by my hairdresser, which is why I bought it. I don&#x27;t know if I would buy it again because of the price.&lt;br /&gt;I do however really like the Paul Mitchell Blonde conditioner. ( a small dime sized portion is all that is needed so will last a lot longer than the shampoo)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used PM since day one! That part is 5 stars. However, the only thing I wished they hadn&#x27;t done, was changed the Forever Blonde shampoo from the tube it was originally in to this bottle. The hole clogs up with shampoo &amp; the bottle isn&#x27;t near as compact for travel as the tube was. But as for the product itself, LOVE it! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This product works so good. After one use the blonde highlights in my hair lightened up. I am going to use this product once a week.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several weeks now and I honestly dont see any difference in my hair by using this product, in fact, my hair was better, shiner, &amp; softer when I was using Suave( keratin infusion). I could have stocked up with a years supply of Suave for what I paid for this. Will not purchase again and I may ask for a refund as this stuff is way overpriced for what it does.</li>
            <li> I really do like this product. It makes my hair very silky and smooth. I recommend it highly even to those who are not blonde!</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended this shampoo and conditioner.  I am a fake blonde and sometimes the blonde would start to look a little darker and brassy.  Now I use this and it keeps the blonde brighter.  I love the smell of the conditioner.  The shampoo is really purple!  It&#x27;s very good at getting my hair clean and conditioned.  I really love the conditioner bc I feel like it&#x27;s perfect.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair a little too dry or a little too soft so that it gets greasy quickly. The shampoo says to leave it sit for a couple of minutes.  I don&#x27;t love the smell of the shampoo but the smell of the conditioner is great so my hair ends up smelling so good.</li>
            <li> Thank you for sending this to me here in Guam since no other beauty shop carries this line of PM.</li>
            <li> So far so good- hair seems less frizzy!</li>
            <li> Seems to be the real deal and the price is much better than in the salon!</li>
            <li> I already knew I loved this product - but I can get it for less and have it delivered to my door. Really great for blonde hair, stylist recommended. and save your time and energy and money and get it here.</li>
            <li> Works well and adds volume for my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> When I received the shampoo the cap had opened a little bit and there was shampoo all over the outside of the bottle</li>
            <li> This is ok for my hair, but I like another product better. I don&#x27;t need the repair function. For me it&#x27;s just another shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great for my fine hair.  Really makes it shine.  I only use a drop as I have short hair.  I will last me a year,</li>
            <li> works as expected. smells wonderful to me and worked great on my over processed, blonde hair. i ended up buying the large bottles.</li>
            <li> I had severly damaged hair from highlighting. I used tons of products, most of them worked okay but nothing to write home about. My stylist recommended this. I figured \\&quot;what the hell\\&quot; since nothing else worked it was worth a shot. OMG! My hair no longer feels like dead straw. This along with the forever blonde spray and conditioner is AMAZING! I will recommend this to all my friends and relatives that highlight. Heck- even if they don&#x27;t highlight it is well worth it. It really does repair the hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Use it several times a week to keep my hair blonde, bright, and shiny!</li>
            <li> Good shampoo, but nothing out of the ordinary- I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference and I don&#x27;t like it&#x27;s lack of foaming action haha, but it is good shampoo- now the conditioner on the other hand is AHHH mazing.</li>
            <li> It cleans my hair well but cant tell it helps the color...It does not contain sulfates,which was important to me and does leave my hair fresh and bouncey</li>
            <li> My hair is bleached blonde(almost platinum). I have tried several shampoos for blonde hair. One of the purple shampoos made my hair tint of green. The other made my hair shockingly purple....&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I found the one that didn&#x27;t my platinum blonde turn into purple! This shampoo made me big smile:) now my hair looks shinny and bright! The shampoo color is not &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; but it made my hair less brassy without dull. I definitely will buy it again with 33.8oz next time:)</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo but I don&#x27;t notice a big difference using it vs. other shampoos.  Since it&#x27;s a little more expensive than drugstore brands, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! The smells is amazing, and it helps keep the brassiness out of my blonde highlights. I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but maybe once a week is enough to keep up. It was cheaper on amazon than in the salons I usually purchase from.</li>
            <li> I have bleached hair and I love this product it works great and smells good too I will for sure buying more of this product!</li>
            <li> This shampoo was recommended to me by my new hair stylist.  I switched salons recently because I was having a lot of hair breakage and it was so very dry.  I have been getting highlights for decades and never had this problem until the past year when I started going to a new salon.  Anyway, the new stylist that I am seeing said she thought the previous hair stylist was probably using a cheap product on my hair. She recommended this shampoo as well as the conditioner and it has been wonderful!  My hair is not nearly as dry and the breakage seems to be stopping.  It no longer gets tangled when I wash it either.  I received this product just a few days after ordering it, well packed and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Having platinum blonde hair, it is a challenge to find nourishing shampoo.  I love this shampoo!  It gives your hair a silky feel even without conditioner.  I highly recommend this shampoo to anyone with lightened hair!</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair from fading in between hair appointments!</li>
            <li> The shampoo leaves my highlighted hair feeling soft and clean. I like that it is sulfate free and smells great. It arrived on time and packaged very nicely with no damage or spills. I will be ordering this again in the future. You also can&#x27;t beat this price! It is worth it!</li>
            <li> This is an everyday shampoo. I love it and I&#x27;ve never seen graying of my hair</li>
            <li> Used for a long time by a friend who finds it keeps excellent blonde shade for older blond hair.</li>
