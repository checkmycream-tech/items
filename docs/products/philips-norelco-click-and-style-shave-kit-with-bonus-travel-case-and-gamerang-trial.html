            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>love the switchable head pieces that makes shaving a breeze...</li>
            <li>I love that it is showerproof, and I can rinse all the hair out of it when I am done.  </li>
            <li>This is just okay</li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>Very effective and gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good product.</li>
            <li>far as the cut, very nice in this department.</li>
            <li>The accessories are easy to attach.</li>
            <li>Easy to change heads.  </li>
            <li>works for trimming hair, it will not shave my beard clean and smooth!</li>
            <li>It comes apart easily for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Good shaver and powerfull highly recommended</li>
            <li>Hands down the best razor my husband has ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a while for a new beard trimmer, and I&#x27;ve also been wanting a good body groomer.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to clean as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived very quickly and it was securely packaged.</li>
            <li>I liked this trimmer so much that I ended up buying one for my brother in law for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>Good for grooming or complete shave..</li>
            <li>All the different attachments really help him get the best shave ever.</li>
            <li>Very nice present for a man who is growing out a beard.</li>
            <li>My past razor was perfect, lasted me forever</li>
            <li>Very useful super quality.</li>
            <li>Battery is PURE GARBAGE, buyer please be aware !!!</li>
            <li>While I mostly bought it just for the trimmer and body groomer, I have found that the shaver also works very well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Works great and very durable (we&#x27;ve dropped it several times and it just keeps on working, not a ding on it!)</li>
            <li>Charges quick and waterproof.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty cheap and doesn&#x27;t shave well</li>
            <li>So, overall this is pretty good</li>
            <li>Would be worth the price if it worked well</li>
            <li>this thing is awesome on facial hair and other place below the waist line!!</li>
            <li>Many reviews here state same thing.</li>
            <li>is my first shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is handy for touching up a beard or a haircut that is getting a little long, as well as just day-to-day shaving.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more than I expected.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s okay, but the attachments seem cheap and flimsy compared to my previous shavers.</li>
            <li>Turns out that the attachment (that holds the two shaving heads) wasn&#x27;t turning, could have been stuck since the main unit was working.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a high quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I had forgotten that my husband had another one like new.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my Phillips norelco since 2005 and could&#x27;ve bought a new set of blades but decided to get a new one all together just in case.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use electric shavers in the past because my skin is just too sensitive, but this unit doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t take up as much space in my suitcase as my last beard trimming kit.  </li>
            <li>Both of our trimmers are now well over a year old, and they both still work like they did when we got them.  </li>
            <li>Completely recommended.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this gives me no irritation.</li>
            <li>Very versatile shaver, I especially like the multi-use ability.</li>
            <li>This is a Christmas gift for my 14 year old son.</li>
            <li>Norelco generally has well-made shavers.</li>
            <li>and I barely have like 5 hairs.</li>
            <li>Not a huge deal, but worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> One here and one at local store, both wouldn&#x27;t take charge after less than one month.</li>
            <li> I have used it for both wet and dry shaves without any problems.  </li>
            <li> And in fact, it did take at least that long to achieve (near) closeness of a blade.  </li>
            <li> You have to be really careful when you&#x27;re using the trimmer attachment because it cut his lip.</li>
            <li> It comes with a travel bag that I didn&#x27;t expected.</li>
            <li> but as I said, I&#x27;m kinda missing that third rotary blade.</li>
            <li> not good head falls apart when cleaning</li>
            <li> Blades weren&#x27;t cutting well after a couple of months and then it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> This is totally worthless, not a close shave at all.</li>

            <li> This was a Christmas present for my husband. He says he has to shave the same spot over and over before it actually works. You have to be really careful when you&#x27;re using the trimmer attachment because it cut his lip. The accessories are easy to attach.</li>
            <li> not good head falls apart when cleaning</li>

            <li> Love it. Very useful super quality.</li>
            <li> If this included a head shaver.. Then this is the ultimate one</li>

            <li> Love this shaver, so far best one I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>

            <li> Battery is PURE GARBAGE, buyer please be aware !!! I bought 2 of these. One here and one at local store, both wouldn&#x27;t take charge after less than one month. Many reviews here state same thing. Please avoid this and all Norelco for your own good.</li>
            <li> Gives a really nice close shave, and it&#x27;s usable in the shower.</li>
            <li> Like it wish it could go closer in some places</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a while for a new beard trimmer, and I&#x27;ve also been wanting a good body groomer.  This unit has it all!  While I mostly bought it just for the trimmer and body groomer, I have found that the shaver also works very well.  I haven&#x27;t been able to use electric shavers in the past because my skin is just too sensitive, but this unit doesn&#x27;t bother me.

            <li> Completely recommended. It&#x27;s more than I expected. It comes with a travel bag that I didn&#x27;t expected.</li>
            <li> This is just okay I suppose. I&#x27;m coming over from a triple head Norelco, and to be honest I miss that third head. The instructions want you to swirl the two rotary blades around your face; it seems to me that is because it has the gap between the two blades that was always picked up by that third blade. Not a huge deal, but worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the cut, very nice in this department. I have sensitive skin and this gives me no irritation. It takes a bit longer to get that real close shave, but it at least it can do it unlike other electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also runs quiet- real quiet, and that&#x27;s just a plus in my book. So, overall this is pretty good but as I said, I&#x27;m kinda missing that third rotary blade.</li>
            <li> Loved it.  Very effective and gentle on my skin. It has good battery life as well.</li>
            <li> Very good machine close shave.</li>
            <li> Good shaver and powerfull highly recommended</li>
            <li> Used it on the day it arrived. Fabulous!</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver, and the attachments make if perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. Great price for what you receive.</li>
            <li> This is handy for touching up a beard or a haircut that is getting a little long, as well as just day-to-day shaving.</li>
            <li> my wife is happy to receive it.</li>
            <li> The person I gifted this to loved it!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy. And it did the job.</li>
            <li> Great. Works perfect.</li>
            <li> This is totally worthless, not a close shave at all.</li>
            <li> Very versatile shaver, I especially like the multi-use ability.</li>
            <li> Perfect delivery, wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Good Product from Phillips</li>
            <li> Great kit.  Charges quick and waterproof.  Easy to change heads.  That&#x27;s basically the gist of it.</li>
            <li> Blades weren&#x27;t cutting well after a couple of months and then it stopped working.  Turns out that the attachment (that holds the two shaving heads) wasn&#x27;t turning, could have been stuck since the main unit was working.  Phillips Norelco sells the two heads at 20 dollars but the attachment costs another 20+ dollars.  Would be worth the price if it worked well but it doesn&#x27;t after a short period of time.  Customer service at Phillips Norelco is GARBAGE.</li>
            <li> works for trimming hair, it will not shave my beard clean and smooth!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good item.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first shaver.&lt;br /&gt;It has a high quality.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Good!</li>
            <li> This is a Christmas gift for my 14 year old son.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty cheap and doesn&#x27;t shave well</li>
            <li> This razor is AMAZING. Hands down the best razor my husband has ever used. All the different attachments really help him get the best shave ever.</li>
            <li> Good value.  The instructions (yes I read them) say to allow a couple weeks to adjust to an electric razor if you&#x27;ve been using blades.  And in fact, it did take at least that long to achieve (near) closeness of a blade.  The extra attachments work well to trim my beard.  It comes apart easily for cleaning.  And I like that it is fully immersable.</li>
