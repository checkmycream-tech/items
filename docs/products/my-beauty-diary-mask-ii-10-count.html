            <li>This mask feels really wonderful on the skin...</li>
            <li>i like it very much: very effective!</li>
            <li>It smells very nice and makes me very happy.</li>
            <li>but i am happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>great  product would  purchase again.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s also great.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>It hydrates my skin perfectly and I believe this is authentic because it looks like it has no difference from the ones that I bought from Taiwan.</li>
            <li>And also, the smell is good.</li>
            <li>also let my visiting friend (who is a FACE nut) try it, and she absolutely loved it and</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I ended up falling in LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li>I also like to pour the excess on the face mask, just to replenish it when I wear the mask for more than what&#x27;s specified in the directions :)</li>
            <li>Oh and,,, i love how t doesn&#x27;t come with directions....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought this product.</li>
            <li>give my face a wonderful glossy look the next</li>
            <li>I think I originally just blotted off all the excess serum after taking off the mask-WRONG!</li>
            <li>After using it my skin feels incredibly hydrated, radiant, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The product has a light, refreshing smell that isn&#x27;t over powering.</li>
            <li>pearl powder mask is so cool!</li>
            <li>easy to do.</li>
            <li>So soft and nice, and when I&#x27;m through my skin looks amazing for like, two days.</li>
            <li>It hydrates smooths and bathes your skin in a silky wash which is cool and refreshing.</li>
            <li>a bit cooling, light fragrance...and was easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>ENJOY THIS MASK.</li>
            <li>Should be a good choice for young girls under 25.</li>
            <li>I put on nice music, some nice aroma therapy, candles and THIS MASK on my face and chill out and sometimes my dry skin soaks up</li>
            <li>YES!&amp;#34;  Just make sure you rub the gooey stuff in ;)</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a good product</li>
            <li>The trick is to rub the serum into your skin until its totally absorbed.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t my face perfectly right, but I have the roundest face in existence.  </li>
            <li>with it, to put on make up is a lot more easier even when no other moisturizer or toner or anything is applied first</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve tried other Korean masks, I strongly urge you to spend a bit more to try these d-(^.^ )</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I think the Sake and Red Wine masks are way better.</li>
            <li>It might take up to like 5 minutes of massaging your face, but if you don&#x27;t, it will just dry on top of your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t improve my skin, and I certainly didn&#x27;t see any glow like everyone else is talking about.</li>
            <li>Having a plastic sheet makes it so much easier to peel the face mask apart to apply it.</li>
            <li>The mask was very moist though.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice and haven&#x27;t seen much difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Guess it really is a temporary effect.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other Korean fruity ones that normally sell for around $1 in stores, so this was a bit pricier, but so much better.</li>
            <li>I tried the natto masks a couple years ago and was totally clueless about the right way to use them.</li>
            <li>After using it, my skin becomes very soft.</li>
            <li>I read almost every review including the bad ones (of which there were only 2 vs. almost 50 excellent ratings).</li>
            <li>but I really like using this product, especially after sunshine.</li>
            <li>If you do not have sensitive, or oily skin or acne prone....</li>
            <li>I have used 2 or 3 so far</li>
            <li>She used complete pack, but I didn&#x27;t see any deference in her face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped heal some old breakouts discoloration too.</li>
            <li>(I applied this in the morning), the effect completely vanished.  </li>
            <li>I understand most effects from masks are temporary, but can you at least last a day?</li>
            <li>As much as the bad reviews stood with good reason it wasn&#x27;t enough to deter me.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s also very helpful that the other dollar-bags don&#x27;t have is a plastic sheet.</li>
            <li>all of the nourishment it offers like a dry mud soaks water and after 20 min</li>

            <li> all of the nourishment it offers like a dry mud soaks water and after 20 min</li>
            <li> left this on until it started to dry up and massaged the rest of the residue into my face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, i highly recommend those with acne prone or sensitive skin to not to use it without care (i always use some medicated lotion to prevent acne but using this mask did make a few break outs on my forehead but just a few)</li>
            <li> It starts off wet, gets slightly tacky, and then dries completely.  </li>
            <li> I usually leave it on for longer than 20 minutes, just because I feel like it&#x27;s a waste of a product if I actually did throw it away after 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> My face felt visibly softer and smoother after the treatment, and it seemed to have a slight glow.  </li>
            <li> It did leave my skin smooth, but I got a nasty breakout the next morning.</li>
            <li> Even at 30 minutes, there&#x27;s still plenty of liquid that hasn&#x27;t dried up yet.</li>
            <li> Its waste of money.</li>
            <li> I usually leave it on for 2+ hours before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there are not enough mask!</li>
            <li> The face mask is sitting in the small bag, drenched in the liquid.</li>
            <li> Sometimes when i am over tired and so is my skin.</li>
            <li> think this mask gives salon&#x27;s shine effects like you have used an expensive face serum.</li>
            <li> Not that expensive either</li>
            <li> It is really bad for my skin.</li>
            <li> The ingredients made my skin felt very bad</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product totally brightened my face! I usually leave it on for 2+ hours before I go to bed. The next morning my skin is glowing.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It hydrates smooths and bathes your skin in a silky wash which is cool and refreshing. Unfortunately, there are not enough mask! You only get 10 and for the price that&#x27;s almost 2.00 dollars a mask. the directions say 2 per day... i guess they want you to reuse them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether my skin is brighter but I really like using this product, especially after sunshine. And also, the smell is good.</li>
            <li> I like it very much. It smells very nice and makes me very happy. After using it, my skin becomes very soft. Should be a good choice for young girls under 25.</li>
            <li> Sometimes when i am over tired and so is my skin. I put on nice music, some nice aroma therapy, candles and THIS MASK on my face and chill out and sometimes my dry skin soaks up all of the nourishment it offers like a dry mud soaks water and after 20 min i place the cloth mask on my neck and i am having glowing skin in no time.&lt;br /&gt;However, i highly recommend those with acne prone or sensitive skin to not to use it without care (i always use some medicated lotion to prevent acne but using this mask did make a few break outs on my forehead but just a few) but i am happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I think this mask gives salon&#x27;s shine effects like you have used an expensive face serum. If you do not have sensitive, or oily skin or acne prone.... ENJOY THIS MASK.</li>
            <li> i like it very much: very effective! with it, to put on make up is a lot more easier even when no other moisturizer or toner or anything is applied first</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim because of all the reviews. I ended up falling in LOVE with this product. I&#x27;ve tried other Korean fruity ones that normally sell for around $1 in stores, so this was a bit pricier, but so much better. The product has a light, refreshing smell that isn&#x27;t over powering. What&#x27;s also very helpful that the other dollar-bags don&#x27;t have is a plastic sheet. The face mask is sitting in the small bag, drenched in the liquid. Having a plastic sheet makes it so much easier to peel the face mask apart to apply it. I usually leave it on for longer than 20 minutes, just because I feel like it&#x27;s a waste of a product if I actually did throw it away after 20 minutes. Even at 30 minutes, there&#x27;s still plenty of liquid that hasn&#x27;t dried up yet. I also like to pour the excess on the face mask, just to replenish it when I wear the mask for more than what&#x27;s specified in the directions :) cheapie me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also let my visiting friend (who is a FACE nut) try it, and she absolutely loved it and (from what I heard) she bought a box for herself.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve tried other Korean masks, I strongly urge you to spend a bit more to try these d-(^.^ )z</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand what this is suppose to do.  Nothing happen at all.  The mask was very moist though.  Moisturized my face, although that wasn&#x27;t why I bought this one.</li>
            <li> It is really bad for my skin. The ingredients made my skin felt very bad and I had even skim breakouts after use it.</li>
            <li> Face feels moister after every use</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me. It didn&#x27;t improve my skin, and I certainly didn&#x27;t see any glow like everyone else is talking about. It didn&#x27;t damage my skin either but then, why pay money for nothing? Oh and,,, i love how t doesn&#x27;t come with directions....</li>
            <li> It hydrates my skin perfectly and I believe this is authentic because it looks like it has no difference from the ones that I bought from Taiwan. I will buy it again after I finished  this box. Thanks for such a good product</li>
            <li> Eh. I&#x27;ve used it twice and haven&#x27;t seen much difference in my skin.  I think the Sake and Red Wine masks are way better.</li>
            <li> I tried the natto masks a couple years ago and was totally clueless about the right way to use them. I think I originally just blotted off all the excess serum after taking off the mask-WRONG! It did leave my skin smooth, but I got a nasty breakout the next morning. The trick is to rub the serum into your skin until its totally absorbed. It might take up to like 5 minutes of massaging your face, but if you don&#x27;t, it will just dry on top of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pearl powder mask is so cool! I have used 2 or 3 so far and after I take it off I go around asking people if they can see a difference in the brightness of my skin. The answer is always &amp;#34;Wow! YES!&amp;#34;  Just make sure you rub the gooey stuff in ;)</li>
            <li> I ordered for my wife. She used complete pack, but I didn&#x27;t see any deference in her face. Its waste of money.</li>
            <li> great  product would  purchase again. does  what it says. easy to do. tones and makes your skin feel  silky. no beak outs</li>
            <li> I read almost every review including the bad ones (of which there were only 2 vs. almost 50 excellent ratings). As much as the bad reviews stood with good reason it wasn&#x27;t enough to deter me. I&#x27;m so glad I bought this product. It definitely made a big difference. After using it my skin feels incredibly hydrated, radiant, soft and smooth. It&#x27;s helped heal some old breakouts discoloration too. I&#x27;ve bought and tried the hylauronic one too and it&#x27;s also great. Go ahead and try them!</li>
            <li> I loooove them.&lt;br /&gt;They are moisturizing and hydrating.&lt;br /&gt;They give my face a wonderful glossy look the next day.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep ordering them</li>
            <li> These masks are wonderful. So soft and nice, and when I&#x27;m through my skin looks amazing for like, two days. Not that expensive either, I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> This mask feels really wonderful on the skin...a bit cooling, light fragrance...and was easy to apply.  The mask is literally drenched in serum, but it doesn&#x27;t drip all over the place once you put the mask on.  It didn&#x27;t my face perfectly right, but I have the roundest face in existence.  Even Buddha is jealous of my roundness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left this on until it started to dry up and massaged the rest of the residue into my face.  It starts off wet, gets slightly tacky, and then dries completely.  My face felt visibly softer and smoother after the treatment, and it seemed to have a slight glow.  When I washed my face at the end of the night though (I applied this in the morning), the effect completely vanished.  Boo!  Guess it really is a temporary effect.  I understand most effects from masks are temporary, but can you at least last a day? lol.</li>
