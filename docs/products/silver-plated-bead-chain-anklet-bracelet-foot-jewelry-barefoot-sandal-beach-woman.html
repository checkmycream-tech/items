            <li> I loved the look, I loved the size, and the delivery was sooner than expected. I&#x27;m hat I didn&#x27;t like was when it broke in 5 days. Not even the clasp, but the chain itself. For the price, I would have been happy if it lasted me 5 months. But, 5 days us not good enough.</li>
