            <li>/&gt;Super cute!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so cute!</li>
            <li>but they are really cute!</li>
            <li>Amazing for the price.</li>
            <li>A great product for cheap, but it does wear out a bit if you use it a lot.</li>
            <li>These are some of the cutest hair accessories I own.</li>
            <li>My daughter was kind of upset.</li>
            <li>Good value for a cute hair tie.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, they look best when I have my hair in a high bun</li>
            <li>These are very cute and adorable but they smell a bit.</li>
            <li>very cute, a lot of colors and wont snap like most hair bands</li>
            <li>Very cool however I received one that did not have a tie on it, and it happened to be my favourite of the pinks I got!  </li>
            <li>My sister loved them, so I ordered more so she can have more colors.</li>
            <li>Overall though I&#x27;m happy: these came at a good price!</li>
            <li>cheap and a good variety of color</li>
            <li>good for the price, but you can tell they are cheap</li>
            <li>There were many things that I liked about this order.</li>
            <li>Will not hold adult hair but perfect for babies which is what I got for.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;rabbit ears&amp;#34; stick up mostly on their own, though sometimes I&#x27;ll rearrange them a bit</li>
            <li>I love love love this!</li>
            <li>2 stars for getting me excited for nothing and thinking that it was a good deal.</li>
            <li>I like them better than the ones in the picture.</li>
            <li>I imagine they&#x27;d be better for someone with thicker hair.</li>
            <li>Really cute.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so I bought 2 orders of this item in hopes of getting more of a variety.</li>
            <li>cute</li>
            <li>And most of the colors had 2 which i didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>I love these hairties.</li>
            <li>I was given the opportunity to receive these adorable rabbit ear hair bows</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m more than content</li>
            <li>I love these adorable hair ties.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless the hair tires were so cute, my girls just love them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just kicking myself for not getting more.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>So overall, it was a great purchase!</li>
            <li>Cute.</li>
            <li>Too cute.</li>
            <li>For this price is okay.</li>
            <li>although they were cute</li>
            <li>Cute colors.</li>
            <li>looking cute.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments every time I&#x27;ve worn them</li>
            <li>They are so cute.</li>
            <li>I will probably order more of these.</li>
            <li>but I still love these hair wraps.</li>
            <li>They look adorable with braids too.</li>
            <li>I might have to buy more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li>She can put them to better use.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li>The rubber bands themselves are an ok quality.</li>
            <li>but my girls love them</li>
            <li>So... I decided to order 4 more.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t miss it! :)</li>
            <li>She loves them and they are cute.</li>
            <li>but, I love them nonetheless.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure my daughter will love them in a couple years when her hair is thicker</li>
            <li>No floral prints or cute colors as shown.  </li>
            <li>I imagine they would work even better with someone who has thinner hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it the five stars because the quality is ok but it is not like the pictures they have online.</li>
            <li>looks so cute, she loves it.</li>
            <li>They stay in her hair and have had many compliments on these.</li>
            <li>When i opened the package and look at most of them, 6 of the bows were ripped or had messed up stiching</li>
            <li>Cute set of hair ties.</li>
            <li>they were cute headbands for baby</li>
            <li>Great deal and vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>pretty good from china</li>
            <li>They r very cute and worth of every penny...</li>
            <li>I first ordered these a year or two ago and it was very bright and pretty.</li>
            <li>It came very quickly and I love it.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRICE AND EARLY DELIVERY !&lt;</li>
            <li>These are lovely and cheap.</li>
            <li>I wait almost 20 days , but looks very cute and pretty.</li>
            <li>These are cute, but cheap.</li>
            <li>After a couple wears it starts becoming fringed.</li>
            <li>I love these bow hair ties so much!!!</li>
            <li>They are super cute and I love them.</li>
            <li>Perfect little cute elastics.</li>
            <li>but they are perfect for my little one she looks adorable.</li>
            <li>The bunny ears are easy to adjust to make them stick up the way you want to.</li>
            <li>They match all my outfits and they are strong.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re meant for older children (not babies &amp; toddlers) and the quality wasn&#x27;t as good as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I might just order some more right now!</li>
            <li>This hair ties are very cute and holds my hair very well.</li>
            <li>My only wish would be for darker shades (most are fairly bright), but I still love them.</li>
            <li>For the most part, the colors of the ties are true to the ones displayed in the pictures.</li>
            <li>It works well with my daughter&#x27;s fine hair</li>
            <li>If you just wanna it for fine you can order it.</li>
            <li>Super cute well made bow ties.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so super cute and make any outfit I add them to look dressed up.</li>
            <li>Super cute</li>
            <li>they are super cute, well made</li>
            <li>They look super cute with my pigtails though.  </li>
            <li>These are so, so cute and exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li>/&gt;-relatively cheap (</li>
            <li>I thought that I would have to secure with another rubber band</li>
            <li>but they are really secure.</li>
            <li>But because it&#x27;s cheap I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li>They are fun, cute and stay in my hair.</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend buying this because of the great price and quality.</li>
            <li>The pricing is extremely cheap</li>
            <li>They are well made and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Cute products worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>It was some cheap &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; material and the colors were gloomy.</li>
            <li>they probably won&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>Fairly stretchy -- I tie my hair up with a different elastic band first before tying one on, but they also hold my hair just fine on their own.</li>
            <li>It is overall a great product, worth the $2!</li>
            <li>Need to wash/rinse before use but is very stylish, functional and great for tender heads to use instead of the hard &amp;#34;bubbles.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Very well made and super cute!</li>
            <li>It took a minute for shipping because they do come from overseas, but I found it was well worth the wait for the price of these cuties!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly what to expect.  </li>
            <li>Fun ties!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so cute and they hold your hair really well!</li>
            <li>The hair bows are super cute and come in all different colors I love them!</li>
            <li>These are really cute and don&#x27;t break easily like normal hair ties.</li>
            <li>Item received just as described and shipping dates were right on the money!</li>
            <li>They are very cute, soft and colorful.</li>
            <li>great deal and worth the long wait</li>
            <li>I got a good assortment, but received three of the same pattern.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the product was great to</li>
            <li>i love it.looks good on me and my little princess.</li>
            <li>Super Cute!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>These are super</li>
            <li>Received them quickly and in all-different colors.</li>
            <li>, they&#x27;re super cute!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish I got some small dotted ones, but these are very good for the price.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast though!</li>
            <li>I received an assortment different from the photo above but am happy because I like the colors I got much better.</li>
            <li>They are really fun to match with cute outfits and can add an adorable flair to simply summer dresses.</li>
            <li>While these are very cute, they are smaller than what I anticipated.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Missing the dark blue.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with this product&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great price for great quality, seriously this is a steal, I totally recommend buying this!</li>
            <li>The quality is great, except one of the ties has a really long, stray thread, which isn&#x27;t much of a problem because I could cut it off.</li>
            <li>Second, the hair ties are so cute!</li>
            <li>Came very quickly and are as vibrantly colored as the picture indicates.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and fun</li>
            <li>Add just a touch of fun to my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Kind of wish they had solid colors.</li>
            <li>I loved these the shipping was faster than expected.</li>
            <li>Worth the wait, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Sturdy and nice quality, got all ten of them but not all the colors they show on the picture.</li>
            <li>And the hairpieces are kid friendly to my kids are under three and the love wearing them on their little wrist so cute</li>
            <li>They have worked wonderfully for daily use alone or with other accessories.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was super fast!</li>
            <li>not all the colors are right.</li>
            <li>so that the bunny ears can stick right up!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>im happy with the quality of the hair ties, very tight and won&#x27;t get stuck in my hair.</li>
            <li>Super tiny but cute.</li>
            <li>Smaller than i expected, but a good quality for 2 dollars for 10 of them!</li>
            <li>Good for little kids.</li>
            <li>First of all, the shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness, because I love my double tails.</li>
            <li>they were exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The bows on top are starting to rip off, even on the ones I didn&#x27;t even use.</li>
            <li>However, I was able to receive this in only one or two weeks because the seller shipped it the day after I ordered it.</li>
            <li>cute but not stretchy enough.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d definitely recommend them to anyone to buy or give them as gifts :)</li>
            <li>If you guys had tracking info it would be much better, I know it&#x27;s only $4, but I bought this product in order to use it!</li>
            <li>These are so cute and the first time I wore mine, I was complemented on it constantly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute but came with not the same colors as shown...</li>
            <li>came with exactly 10 as described</li>
            <li>I got 10 different colors! :3</li>
            <li>, I wish there was more different colors</li>
            <li>The dots are bigger not as cute as the pictures.</li>
            <li>They look exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>Different from the pictures, but still loves them :)</li>
            <li>The material is pretty sturdy and none of mine have any damage on them</li>
            <li>But other than that they are super cute and wearable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with my order, though they are a bit smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li>The hair ties are really cute, but the only problem I have was that I didn&#x27;t get much of an assortment.</li>
            <li>tried ordering another round because I love the style and it&#x27;s cheap..</li>
            <li>but if you use them more then a few time you just better get a new pack because the whole thing will slide off</li>
            <li>They arrive pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Small but still good gave some to my doll</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing a couple of them for weeks, pretty consistently, and they still look and feel like new!</li>
            <li>(I clicked the wrong link) and ended up loving them for myself!!</li>
            <li>Unlike the pictures, almost all of the hair ties I recieved had large dots (See picture for reference).</li>
            <li>Did not get any duplicates, but mostly large dots and stripes.</li>
            <li>and I got a few even better colors that weren&#x27;t even pictured!</li>
            <li>The package arrived 2 weeks before the expected arrival date which I quite enjoyed but upon opening the package I quickly noticed that there was no green one.</li>
            <li>These hair ties are super cute but pretty small.</li>
            <li>a little more muted but still darling!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll make sure to set aside my daughters for use next year!</li>
            <li>idk.&lt;br /&gt;I would really like a light blue.</li>
            <li>cute!&lt;br /&gt;They are actually better than I expected and are very sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li>Would buy again and highly recommend!</li>
            <li>But I also got 7 duplicates (I don&#x27;t mind so much because i can put them to use)</li>
            <li>but I still really like them</li>
            <li>but they really try to solve the problem.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really mind that.</li>
            <li>These were much better quality than I expected.</li>
            <li>My daughter absolutely loves them.  </li>
            <li>SO much brighter than the picture I took.</li>
            <li>I have thin hair, and this only takes two &amp;#34;tie-arounds&amp;#34; until it sits perfectly holding my hair up.</li>
            <li>Other than that they are really cute hair ties.</li>
            <li>Slow shipping, but super cute colors and patterns.</li>
            <li>The green and light blue were two of the bows I was looking most forward to getting</li>
            <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re pretty strong for such a low price!!</li>
            <li>They are of different colors, I&#x27;m going to order some more, hopefully I get the same colors so they can be used in pairs too.</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s older.</li>
            <li>I was nervous about ordering these after reading some of the negative reviews, but I&#x27;m glad I went ahead and did it anyway!</li>
            <li>so I use a normal black one to tie it up, and then one of these on top to add style and cuteness to my ponytail.</li>
            <li>But i like them anyways and wear them on my high buns.</li>
            <li>Cute little hair ribbons.  </li>
            <li>These are cute for little girls</li>
            <li>I just wish they were a little more durable.</li>
            <li>I did receive all ten with a few of the same color, but otherwise the assortment was great</li>
            <li>However, what was kind of unexpected is that they are extremely small.</li>
            <li>Probably designed for children, but I can wrap them twice around my own pony tail (I have thick hair) without an issue.</li>
            <li>It holds my hair good since i have thin hair</li>
            <li>New.  </li>
            <li>They fit my daughter who has extremely thick hair which is rare to find.  </li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s better than some people because other people get like, 5 of the same colors</li>
            <li>Cute, small, not the colors that appear on the photo.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re cute, but small.</li>
            <li>they are really cute and small</li>
            <li>Still for $2.10 with free shipping, I won&#x27;t mark the review down any lower.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted the red, light blue and yellow one</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s adorable, and I got ten, but I got TWO dark blues.</li>
            <li>These are cute, i wear them to work a lot to give me some color in my wardrobe, cause all I wear at work is white and black.</li>
            <li>The hair ties seem to be good quality, but like other reviews have stated, they are a bit small (I have thinner hair</li>
            <li>They quickly responded and were extremely helpful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve uploaded a photo as well where you can clearly see</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t tug on your hair at all and even when the fabric rips from stretching it too far, it still does its job.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t really matter if it&#x27;s a bit smaller.</li>
            <li>I gave mine to a friend with a 3 year old daughter for her hair.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my three year old.</li>
            <li>Got two duplicates as shown but daughter doesn&#x27;t know any different and for two bucks I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li>However, for the price, I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my 4 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>May not be able to get as snug as you want to if your hairs thick</li>
            <li>super cute bunny ear hair tie, pull your hair in a pony tail and add this around, small enough not to get in the way, but big enough to be seen.</li>
            <li>Such cute little hair ties!</li>
            <li>I have very long hair (to my hips) and these hair ties really &amp;#34;charm-up&amp;#34</li>
            <li>They are cheap and bad quality but look cute on the hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike others who&#x27;ve complained, all of my bows were different colors :)</li>
            <li>Only got one color that was doubled but other than that, really pretty and works well!</li>
            <li>I have so many candy striper ones and the one black I got, doesn&#x27;t even look black.</li>
            <li>Her hair is thick and these almost barely fit around her hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get the light blue, hot pink, green, and the peachy color which was a little disapointing.</li>
            <li>Instead I got a lot of leopard print ones which I don&#x27;t really care for and some blue ones, and 1 pink and 1 white one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re not very wide, so you can&#x27;t always double knot them (only for a ponytail).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Although had to have a extra plain hair tie underneath due to having thick hair, other than that very cute!</li>
            <li>Ears are a little floppy and don&#x27;t stand up straight</li>

            <li> They&#x27;re so cute!</li>
            <li> but they are really cute!</li>
            <li> Amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> A great product for cheap, but it does wear out a bit if you use it a lot.</li>
            <li> These are some of the cutest hair accessories I own.</li>
            <li> My daughter was kind of upset.</li>
            <li> Good value for a cute hair tie.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, they look best when I have my hair in a high bun</li>
            <li> These are very cute and adorable but they smell a bit.</li>
            <li> very cute, a lot of colors and wont snap like most hair bands</li>
            <li> Very cool however I received one that did not have a tie on it, and it happened to be my favourite of the pinks I got!  </li>
            <li> My sister loved them, so I ordered more so she can have more colors.</li>
            <li> Overall though I&#x27;m happy: these came at a good price!</li>
            <li> cheap and a good variety of color</li>
            <li> good for the price, but you can tell they are cheap</li>
            <li> There were many things that I liked about this order.</li>
            <li> Will not hold adult hair but perfect for babies which is what I got for.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;rabbit ears&amp;#34; stick up mostly on their own, though sometimes I&#x27;ll rearrange them a bit</li>
            <li> I love love love this!</li>
            <li> 2 stars for getting me excited for nothing and thinking that it was a good deal.</li>
            <li> I like them better than the ones in the picture.</li>
            <li> I imagine they&#x27;d be better for someone with thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Really cute.  </li>
            <li> Ok, so I bought 2 orders of this item in hopes of getting more of a variety.</li>
            <li> cute</li>
            <li> And most of the colors had 2 which i didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I love these hairties.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to receive these adorable rabbit ear hair bows</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m more than content</li>
            <li> I love these adorable hair ties.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless the hair tires were so cute, my girls just love them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just kicking myself for not getting more.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> So overall, it was a great purchase!</li>
            <li> Cute.</li>
            <li> Too cute.</li>
            <li> For this price is okay.</li>
            <li> although they were cute</li>
            <li> Cute colors.</li>
            <li> looking cute.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments every time I&#x27;ve worn them</li>
            <li> They are so cute.</li>
            <li> I will probably order more of these.</li>
            <li> but I still love these hair wraps.</li>
            <li> They look adorable with braids too.</li>
            <li> I might have to buy more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> She can put them to better use.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> The rubber bands themselves are an ok quality.</li>
            <li> but my girls love them</li>
            <li> So... I decided to order 4 more.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t miss it! :)</li>
            <li> She loves them and they are cute.</li>
            <li> but, I love them nonetheless.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure my daughter will love them in a couple years when her hair is thicker</li>
            <li> No floral prints or cute colors as shown.  </li>
            <li> I imagine they would work even better with someone who has thinner hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it the five stars because the quality is ok but it is not like the pictures they have online.</li>
            <li> looks so cute, she loves it.</li>
            <li> They stay in her hair and have had many compliments on these.</li>
            <li> When i opened the package and look at most of them, 6 of the bows were ripped or had messed up stiching</li>
            <li> Cute set of hair ties.</li>
            <li> they were cute headbands for baby</li>
            <li> Great deal and vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> pretty good from china</li>
            <li> They r very cute and worth of every penny...</li>
            <li> I first ordered these a year or two ago and it was very bright and pretty.</li>
            <li> It came very quickly and I love it.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE AND EARLY DELIVERY !&lt;</li>
            <li> These are lovely and cheap.</li>
            <li> I wait almost 20 days , but looks very cute and pretty.</li>
            <li> These are cute, but cheap.</li>
            <li> After a couple wears it starts becoming fringed.</li>
            <li> I love these bow hair ties so much!!!</li>
            <li> They are super cute and I love them.</li>
            <li> Perfect little cute elastics.</li>
            <li> but they are perfect for my little one she looks adorable.</li>
            <li> The bunny ears are easy to adjust to make them stick up the way you want to.</li>
            <li> They match all my outfits and they are strong.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re meant for older children (not babies &amp; toddlers) and the quality wasn&#x27;t as good as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I might just order some more right now!</li>
            <li> This hair ties are very cute and holds my hair very well.</li>
            <li> My only wish would be for darker shades (most are fairly bright), but I still love them.</li>
            <li> For the most part, the colors of the ties are true to the ones displayed in the pictures.</li>
            <li> It works well with my daughter&#x27;s fine hair</li>
            <li> If you just wanna it for fine you can order it.</li>
            <li> Super cute well made bow ties.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so super cute and make any outfit I add them to look dressed up.</li>
            <li> Super cute</li>
            <li> they are super cute, well made</li>
            <li> They look super cute with my pigtails though.  </li>
            <li> These are so, so cute and exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li> /&gt;-relatively cheap (</li>
            <li> I thought that I would have to secure with another rubber band</li>
            <li> but they are really secure.</li>
            <li> But because it&#x27;s cheap I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> They are fun, cute and stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend buying this because of the great price and quality.</li>
            <li> The pricing is extremely cheap</li>
            <li> They are well made and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Cute products worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> It was some cheap &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; material and the colors were gloomy.</li>
            <li> they probably won&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> Fairly stretchy -- I tie my hair up with a different elastic band first before tying one on, but they also hold my hair just fine on their own.</li>
            <li> It is overall a great product, worth the $2!</li>
            <li> Need to wash/rinse before use but is very stylish, functional and great for tender heads to use instead of the hard &amp;#34;bubbles.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very well made and super cute!</li>
            <li> It took a minute for shipping because they do come from overseas, but I found it was well worth the wait for the price of these cuties!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly what to expect.  </li>

            <li> They are very cute, soft and colorful.</li>
            <li> great deal and worth the long wait</li>
            <li> I got a good assortment, but received three of the same pattern.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the product was great to</li>
            <li> i love it.looks good on me and my little princess.</li>
            <li> Super Cute!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> These are super</li>
            <li> Received them quickly and in all-different colors.</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re super cute!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish I got some small dotted ones, but these are very good for the price.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast though!</li>
            <li> I received an assortment different from the photo above but am happy because I like the colors I got much better.</li>
            <li> They are really fun to match with cute outfits and can add an adorable flair to simply summer dresses.</li>
            <li> While these are very cute, they are smaller than what I anticipated.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Missing the dark blue.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with this product&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great price for great quality, seriously this is a steal, I totally recommend buying this!</li>
            <li> The quality is great, except one of the ties has a really long, stray thread, which isn&#x27;t much of a problem because I could cut it off.</li>
            <li> Second, the hair ties are so cute!</li>
            <li> Came very quickly and are as vibrantly colored as the picture indicates.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and fun</li>
            <li> Add just a touch of fun to my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Kind of wish they had solid colors.</li>
            <li> I loved these the shipping was faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Worth the wait, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and nice quality, got all ten of them but not all the colors they show on the picture.</li>
            <li> And the hairpieces are kid friendly to my kids are under three and the love wearing them on their little wrist so cute</li>
            <li> They have worked wonderfully for daily use alone or with other accessories.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was super fast!</li>
            <li> not all the colors are right.</li>
            <li> so that the bunny ears can stick right up!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> im happy with the quality of the hair ties, very tight and won&#x27;t get stuck in my hair.</li>
            <li> Super tiny but cute.</li>
            <li> Smaller than i expected, but a good quality for 2 dollars for 10 of them!</li>
            <li> Good for little kids.</li>
            <li> First of all, the shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness, because I love my double tails.</li>
            <li> they were exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The bows on top are starting to rip off, even on the ones I didn&#x27;t even use.</li>
            <li> However, I was able to receive this in only one or two weeks because the seller shipped it the day after I ordered it.</li>
            <li> cute but not stretchy enough.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d definitely recommend them to anyone to buy or give them as gifts :)</li>
            <li> If you guys had tracking info it would be much better, I know it&#x27;s only $4, but I bought this product in order to use it!</li>
            <li> These are so cute and the first time I wore mine, I was complemented on it constantly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute but came with not the same colors as shown...</li>
            <li> came with exactly 10 as described</li>
            <li> I got 10 different colors! :3</li>
            <li> , I wish there was more different colors</li>
            <li> The dots are bigger not as cute as the pictures.</li>
            <li> They look exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> Different from the pictures, but still loves them :)</li>
            <li> The material is pretty sturdy and none of mine have any damage on them</li>
            <li> But other than that they are super cute and wearable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with my order, though they are a bit smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> The hair ties are really cute, but the only problem I have was that I didn&#x27;t get much of an assortment.</li>
            <li> tried ordering another round because I love the style and it&#x27;s cheap..</li>
            <li> but if you use them more then a few time you just better get a new pack because the whole thing will slide off</li>
            <li> They arrive pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Small but still good gave some to my doll</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing a couple of them for weeks, pretty consistently, and they still look and feel like new!</li>
            <li> (I clicked the wrong link) and ended up loving them for myself!!</li>
            <li> Unlike the pictures, almost all of the hair ties I recieved had large dots (See picture for reference).</li>
            <li> Did not get any duplicates, but mostly large dots and stripes.</li>
            <li> and I got a few even better colors that weren&#x27;t even pictured!</li>
            <li> The package arrived 2 weeks before the expected arrival date which I quite enjoyed but upon opening the package I quickly noticed that there was no green one.</li>
            <li> These hair ties are super cute but pretty small.</li>
            <li> a little more muted but still darling!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll make sure to set aside my daughters for use next year!</li>
            <li> idk.&lt;br /&gt;I would really like a light blue.</li>
            <li> cute!&lt;br /&gt;They are actually better than I expected and are very sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li> Would buy again and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> But I also got 7 duplicates (I don&#x27;t mind so much because i can put them to use)</li>
            <li> but I still really like them</li>
            <li> but they really try to solve the problem.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really mind that.</li>
            <li> These were much better quality than I expected.</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves them.  </li>
            <li> SO much brighter than the picture I took.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair, and this only takes two &amp;#34;tie-arounds&amp;#34; until it sits perfectly holding my hair up.</li>
            <li> Other than that they are really cute hair ties.</li>
            <li> Slow shipping, but super cute colors and patterns.</li>
            <li> The green and light blue were two of the bows I was looking most forward to getting</li>
            <li> /&gt;They&#x27;re pretty strong for such a low price!!</li>
            <li> They are of different colors, I&#x27;m going to order some more, hopefully I get the same colors so they can be used in pairs too.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s older.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about ordering these after reading some of the negative reviews, but I&#x27;m glad I went ahead and did it anyway!</li>
            <li> so I use a normal black one to tie it up, and then one of these on top to add style and cuteness to my ponytail.</li>
            <li> But i like them anyways and wear them on my high buns.</li>
            <li> Cute little hair ribbons.  </li>
            <li> These are cute for little girls</li>
            <li> I just wish they were a little more durable.</li>
            <li> I did receive all ten with a few of the same color, but otherwise the assortment was great</li>
            <li> However, what was kind of unexpected is that they are extremely small.</li>
            <li> Probably designed for children, but I can wrap them twice around my own pony tail (I have thick hair) without an issue.</li>
            <li> It holds my hair good since i have thin hair</li>
            <li> New.  </li>
            <li> They fit my daughter who has extremely thick hair which is rare to find.  </li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s better than some people because other people get like, 5 of the same colors</li>
            <li> Cute, small, not the colors that appear on the photo.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re cute, but small.</li>
            <li> they are really cute and small</li>
            <li> Still for $2.10 with free shipping, I won&#x27;t mark the review down any lower.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted the red, light blue and yellow one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s adorable, and I got ten, but I got TWO dark blues.</li>
            <li> These are cute, i wear them to work a lot to give me some color in my wardrobe, cause all I wear at work is white and black.</li>
            <li> The hair ties seem to be good quality, but like other reviews have stated, they are a bit small (I have thinner hair</li>
            <li> They quickly responded and were extremely helpful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve uploaded a photo as well where you can clearly see</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t tug on your hair at all and even when the fabric rips from stretching it too far, it still does its job.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t really matter if it&#x27;s a bit smaller.</li>
            <li> I gave mine to a friend with a 3 year old daughter for her hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my three year old.</li>
            <li> Got two duplicates as shown but daughter doesn&#x27;t know any different and for two bucks I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li> However, for the price, I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 4 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> May not be able to get as snug as you want to if your hairs thick</li>
            <li> super cute bunny ear hair tie, pull your hair in a pony tail and add this around, small enough not to get in the way, but big enough to be seen.</li>
            <li> Such cute little hair ties!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair (to my hips) and these hair ties really &amp;#34;charm-up&amp;#34</li>
            <li> They are cheap and bad quality but look cute on the hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike others who&#x27;ve complained, all of my bows were different colors :)</li>
            <li> Only got one color that was doubled but other than that, really pretty and works well!</li>
            <li> I have so many candy striper ones and the one black I got, doesn&#x27;t even look black.</li>
            <li> Her hair is thick and these almost barely fit around her hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the light blue, hot pink, green, and the peachy color which was a little disapointing.</li>
            <li> Instead I got a lot of leopard print ones which I don&#x27;t really care for and some blue ones, and 1 pink and 1 white one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They&#x27;re not very wide, so you can&#x27;t always double knot them (only for a ponytail).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Although had to have a extra plain hair tie underneath due to having thick hair, other than that very cute!</li>
            <li> Ears are a little floppy and don&#x27;t stand up straight</li>
            <li> I recommend for older gals as well as little girls.</li>
            <li> My hair is super thick and heavy, but these ties have no trouble holding my hair up!</li>
            <li> I received 4 mint green and cream polka dot ribbons exactly the same, plus 4 identical pink and cream ribbons.  </li>
            <li> It would have been very easy to receive a 5 star rating, but the 5 dull black black items and little variety with weird colors kind of do my enthusiasm in,</li>
            <li> Only received them today but they do seem sturdy and stand up to being stretched and pulled around.  </li>
            <li> her hair is thin and fit very well, and I have borrowed some of them and have used them in my hair,and they work equally well in mine, and my hair is very thick.</li>
            <li> I recieved only two of the same design, although it is a bit on the smaller side it was expected if you read the other customer&#x27;s review.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my 2 year old daughter, and even though they did take a little long to get here, when they did arrive</li>
            <li> I believe that I ordered this around the beginning of January, and the expected delivery date was around a month later.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute, thin, and small which perfectly fit my thin hair!</li>
            <li> As well as 3 of the same color and double of 2 other colors which is to be expected since it does say some might be duplicates</li>
            <li> Thin material but look exactly as picture.</li>
            <li> but I think I&#x27;ll wear an elastic under because I bet they&#x27;ll come loose as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> They were a little small but that doesn&#x27;t bother me that much.</li>
            <li> and two of the black, along with one red and nude.</li>
            <li> So basically I only got half of what I was guaranteed.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the yellow one in the picture is actually neon..</li>
            <li> The main complaint in the reviews is that people received colors that aren&#x27;t pictured and while i did receive a few that are different</li>
            <li> For the price I can&#x27;t complain but u so wish they were a little bigger</li>
            <li> Turns my bad hair day into a cute hair day.</li>
            <li> I am a senior citizen with long hair and like to wear it in either a pony tail or tied back at the nape of my neck and usually use coated rubber bands.  </li>
            <li> All ten arrived with a few duplicates.</li>
            <li> I expected a wide arrange of polka dot colors with each band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Minus another star for giving a striped one when I expected all to be polka dot.</li>
            <li> like maybe 2 inches wide (the bow)&lt;br /&gt;also the bow isn&#x27;t like pictured--</li>
            <li> They also arrived before the expected date hehe&lt;</li>
            <li> and I received them sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> and I can have a few back up colors, in case I lose it!</li>
            <li> Not the same colors as it is in the picture and it was missing 1.</li>
            <li> I had emailed them after I received my hair bows in the mail asking them if they could possibly replace one that was missing.</li>
            <li> (Later on I found the missing piece.</li>
            <li> so I can not really complain.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected when they come from China.</li>
            <li> I got this product a little less than two weeks, earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> I got them 3 days before they where due, and I did receive 10</li>
            <li> I assume due to the writing on the packed)</li>
            <li> Other than that i got everything , all 10 that it said i would get.</li>
            <li> But other than that i like it</li>
            <li> not for thick hair - can only wrap once and not very much elastic</li>
            <li> I can loop the tie twice if i want it loose, or three times if I want it really really tight.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t too in-your-face obvious because the round elastic part is wrapped around your hair, but the little bows stick out just the right/cute amount to show off your hair.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that, like others, I didn&#x27;t get all the colors.</li>
            <li> It took about three weeks for them to come - a few days before the earliest expected arrival date.</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, of all the colors to receive, I got the mustard yellow and baby pink, the two colors I hate the most.</li>
            <li> however half of them are orange color.</li>
            <li> Other than than that, the hair ties are small as said in other reviews</li>
            <li> I got two black ones tho.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about half a year now.</li>
            <li> I got it within like 1 and half weeks.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the assortment I received had duplicate colors in it, and I was hoping to receive a few of the ones in the photo that I did not.  </li>
            <li> I can put all or half of her hair up in these.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a little variety in color and did expect there might be duplicate colors, but I received 5 black ones with dirty beige, muted blue and sort of a red color dots, 2 that I guess would be called sort of peach, and 2 pink plus one without the bunny tales in a color</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are well made - little to no error in the stitching.  </li>
            <li> The edges do get frayed a little after multi use.</li>
            <li> Can be used for little girls hair or her dolls hair.</li>
            <li> I bought them for myself but decided to give them to my little cousin.</li>
            <li> As soon as they arrived I machine washed them in cold water on gentle cycle then air dried them.</li>
            <li> - i didn&#x27;t like a few of the colors (beige and orange) but</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t mind this but after reading a few reviews I thought I&#x27;d point it out)</li>
            <li> I got multiples of a few colors.</li>
            <li> I got every color exept green.</li>
            <li> I was also missing 1.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t give me the green one.</li>
            <li> They are also very tight and elastic.</li>
            <li> Minus one star for a very late arrival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Or something because there so small</li>
            <li> Besides the dots, I also recieved a pair of hairties with small hearts on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But turn out it is so small that i had to use it for my ponytail or buns...</li>
            <li> I was angry when I counted out only 8 hair bands when I paid for 10 of them.</li>
            <li> and I am pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> These were extremely small.</li>
            <li> To small dont stretch</li>
            <li> I would give this a five but the tie part is so small and not stretchy.</li>
            <li> They are small</li>
            <li> Got three pairs of matching colors and four of random different colors.</li>
            <li> My guess is they just grab and package ten at random.</li>
            <li> These things are so small.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fabric fused to thin foam and stitched down, not floppy like the pictures indicated, and</li>
            <li> Yes, I did expect them to be small, but didn&#x27;t know they would be this small!  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a bit disappointed considering I received three of the pink and blue,</li>
            <li> so I am unable to use them for a single pony tail.  </li>
            <li> The fabric was a little thin.</li>
            <li> No duplicates, but my order only had 9 bands and 1 way dirty-</li>
            <li> By the way, I have thick hair and these seem to hold it up</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> I mean come on.</li>
            <li> (because, they are so small and thin)</li>
            <li> They are thin and small, as though they are meant for an infant.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed, and wish I could get my money back, even though it was just a measly few dollars.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m confused</li>
            <li> Not impressed -_-</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and they stay put!</li>
            <li> My daughter has very thin hair</li>
            <li> but it was still disappointing.</li>
            <li> However, the colors that are provided in the package come at random, so I was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> I accidentally sent one through the washer and it faded and frayed badly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> pretty good from china - i didn&#x27;t like a few of the colors (beige and orange) but otherwise good hair ties</li>
            <li> I love these hair bows! They aren&#x27;t just decoration type hair bows the actually stretch and hold up. The main complaint in the reviews is that people received colors that aren&#x27;t pictured and while i did receive a few that are different I like them better than the ones in the picture.</li>
            <li> All ten arrived with a few duplicates. Thank goodness, because I love my double tails. They don&#x27;t tug on your hair at all and even when the fabric rips from stretching it too far, it still does its job. You can&#x27;t even tell there&#x27;s a rip.</li>
            <li> Item received just as described and shipping dates were right on the money! Would buy again and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Came very quickly and are as vibrantly colored as the picture indicates. I have thinnish hair though, so they are too big to only wrap twice but not quite big enough to wrap three times. I imagine they&#x27;d be better for someone with thicker hair. Side note, DO NOT WASH THEM. I accidentally sent one through the washer and it faded and frayed badly. My fault, but just a heads up!</li>
            <li> Really cute.  Took a good month or so to arrive but still arrived before the estimate.</li>
            <li> Are these bracelets? Or something because there so small no one could wear these so I&#x27;m confused</li>
            <li> i got 10 pcs however half of them are orange color.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I bought 2 orders of this item in hopes of getting more of a variety. And yes, i did get variety! But I also got 7 duplicates (I don&#x27;t mind so much because i can put them to use) The hair ties seem to be good quality, but like other reviews have stated, they are a bit small (I have thinner hair so I can just about get the third loop around, thank goodness). Unlike the pictures, almost all of the hair ties I recieved had large dots (See picture for reference). If that may bother you I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying these but I prefer them with the bigger dots. Besides the dots, I also recieved a pair of hairties with small hearts on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I thought it was a nice purchase! It may have lacked a bit of variety that I had been hoping for but nothing too major.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Super cute&lt;br /&gt;-relatively cheap ($ wise)&lt;br /&gt;-bit of a variety&lt;br /&gt;-seemingly good quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-on the smaller side&lt;br /&gt;-you might get duplicates&lt;br /&gt;-not all dots (I don&#x27;t mind this but after reading a few reviews I thought I&#x27;d point it out)</li>
            <li> What can I say? They are sooooo adorable! I don&#x27;t even want to wear them because I don&#x27;t want to wear them out. They arrived way ahead of time. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Very cute and affordable</li>
            <li> Super cute well made bow ties.  They fit my daughter who has extremely thick hair which is rare to find.  It took a minute for shipping because they do come from overseas, but I found it was well worth the wait for the price of these cuties!</li>
            <li> Minus one star for a very late arrival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus one star for lacking the same style as the photo. I expected a wide arrange of polka dot colors with each band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus another star for giving a striped one when I expected all to be polka dot.</li>
            <li> These are lovely and cheap. They match all my outfits and they are strong.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be much bigger for my head. But turn out it is so small that i had to use it for my ponytail or buns... It does not come with 10. I had only 9. And most of the colors had 2 which i didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I love these hairties. They&#x27;re so super cute and make any outfit I add them to look dressed up.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  New.  Perfect little cute elastics.</li>
            <li> Great! My sister loved them, so I ordered more so she can have more colors.</li>
            <li> Small but still good gave some to my doll</li>
            <li> Great ties, and cute too. Probably designed for children, but I can wrap them twice around my own pony tail (I have thick hair) without an issue. Turns my bad hair day into a cute hair day. Giving four stars because it took about 2+ months to get here, but for the price I can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li> Super Cute!&lt;br /&gt;When I was given the opportunity to receive these adorable rabbit ear hair bows I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly what to expect.  These are the cutest pony holders! I&#x27;ve set aside two for my daughter to wear in her pig-tails in her Easter picture and allowed her to share others with her girlfriends!  They are perfect size for my daughter and her friends.&lt;br /&gt;They are well made - little to no error in the stitching.  There&#x27;s stretch that is perfect to cover an already secured ponytail - on top of an elastic band.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are very cute too; some are bright and &#x27;pop&#x27; and others are a little more muted but still darling!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll make sure to set aside my daughters for use next year!</li>
            <li> Here is a tip for thicker/curly haired people, I personally wouldn&#x27;t use them to actually tie around your hair (because, they are so small and thin) use an actually pony tail holder for that. Then, just place the ribbon around it for show. Simple. It&#x27;s not rocket science.</li>
            <li> Super cute I got them 3 days before they where due, and I did receive 10 like said. As well as 3 of the same color and double of 2 other colors which is to be expected since it does say some might be duplicates but I&#x27;m more than content</li>
            <li> These are the cutest things! I thought that I would have to secure with another rubber band but they are really secure. The mixture of colors match any outifts.</li>
            <li> I love these adorable hair ties. It works well with my daughter&#x27;s fine hair and I&#x27;ve used some for my own ponytail! The edges do get frayed a little after multi use. But because it&#x27;s cheap I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Would have given it 5 stars but it took over a month to get here. Nevertheless the hair tires were so cute, my girls just love them.  And for the price, i think it&#x27;s with getting.  I&#x27;m just kicking myself for not getting more.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to get a mixture of colors. All I got was all of one color. I guess 9 people are getting one of these for Christmas.</li>
            <li> These are cute, i wear them to work a lot to give me some color in my wardrobe, cause all I wear at work is white and black. And the hairpieces are kid friendly to my kids are under three and the love wearing them on their little wrist so cute</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my 2 year old daughter, and even though they did take a little long to get here, when they did arrive they were exactly as described. My daughter loves them and they look great!</li>
            <li> Really adorable! came in within the time they said and they look great! they look well made, the stitching is neat.</li>
            <li> I got some that were the same but I still really like them</li>
            <li> I wait almost 20 days , but looks very cute and pretty.</li>
            <li> I received 10 different colored dot hair ties. They are fun, cute and stay in my hair. My baby likes to play with them as well. Great price too! I will probably purchase again, as I tend to lose these kinds of things!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a little variety in color and did expect there might be duplicate colors, but I received 5 black ones with dirty beige, muted blue and sort of a red color dots, 2 that I guess would be called sort of peach, and 2 pink plus one without the bunny tales in a color I can&#x27;t even begin to describe. Still for $2.10 with free shipping, I won&#x27;t mark the review down any lower.  It would have been very easy to receive a 5 star rating, but the 5 dull black black items and little variety with weird colors kind of do my enthusiasm in,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s adorable, and I got ten, but I got TWO dark blues. I guess it&#x27;s better than some people because other people get like, 5 of the same colors idk.&lt;br /&gt;I would really like a light blue.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! Smaller than i expected, but a good quality for 2 dollars for 10 of them!</li>
            <li> Awesome!!  When I ordered these, my expectations were very low.  Received them last week and I absolutely LOVE them!  I am a senior citizen with long hair and like to wear it in either a pony tail or tied back at the nape of my neck and usually use coated rubber bands.  These are so perfect for my hair style!  The colors are bright and attractive and considering the price, I got my money&#x27;s worth!  Would purchase them again.  Am going to purchase the child size for my great granddaughter.</li>
            <li> Need to wash/rinse before use but is very stylish, functional and great for tender heads to use instead of the hard &amp;#34;bubbles.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My daughter has very thin hair these worked perfect!</li>
            <li> I used for birthday goody bag i love it</li>
            <li> cheap and a good variety of color so you can match them up with your clothes!</li>
            <li> They are very cute and very strong, the colors are perfect and they look amazing. Ofcourse I got a couple doubled but I didn&#x27;t mind that. However, what was kind of unexpected is that they are extremely small. Yes, I did expect them to be small, but didn&#x27;t know they would be this small!  Shipping was very fast though! So overall, it was a great purchase! Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Cute. They were a little small but that doesn&#x27;t bother me that much.</li>
            <li> Cute, small, not the colors that appear on the photo.</li>
            <li> If you ever have a problem, their customer service was great! Other than that, the product was great to and I know you kinda get mixed signals from the reviews but they really try to solve the problem.</li>
            <li> Loved these hair ties! Got 3 doubles but that didn&#x27;t bother me. Great deal and vibrant colors. Took awhile but I knew that when I ordered it.</li>
            <li> good for the price, but you can tell they are cheap</li>
            <li> I only got four colors. And duplicates at that. Im actually very disappointed. I was trying to contact the seller, but it was no surprise to me that he or she did not respond. Other than than that, the hair ties are small as said in other reviews but I don&#x27;t really mind that. The bows on top are starting to rip off, even on the ones I didn&#x27;t even use.</li>
            <li> Too cute. Arrived just in time for Easter.</li>
            <li> There were many things that I liked about this order. First of all, the shipping was very fast. I believe that I ordered this around the beginning of January, and the expected delivery date was around a month later. However, I was able to receive this in only one or two weeks because the seller shipped it the day after I ordered it. Second, the hair ties are so cute! For the most part, the colors of the ties are true to the ones displayed in the pictures. There&#x27;s also a variety of dot patterns with each tie. Additionally, the sizes of the &amp;#34;bows&amp;#34; are perfect. I think that they&#x27;re around 1 1/2 to 2 inches(about 5 cm.).&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend buying this because of the great price and quality.</li>
            <li> For this price is okay.Quality is so so.</li>
            <li> These were much better quality than I expected. I received an assortment different from the photo above but am happy because I like the colors I got much better. The the dot patterns are the same just different colors. As soon as they arrived I machine washed them in cold water on gentle cycle then air dried them. They have worked wonderfully for daily use alone or with other accessories.</li>
            <li> These are very cute and adorable but they smell a bit. That&#x27;s no problem though because it will go away.</li>
            <li> Not impressed -_- I ordered 10 of these hair bands and it took about a month before they arrived(I almost forgot about them xP) although they were cute I was angry when I counted out only 8 hair bands when I paid for 10 of them. I emailed the seller, but still haven&#x27;t gotten a reply. Hopefully they can fix this, but until then never ordering from them again!</li>
            <li> Cute colors. recommend.</li>
            <li> I got my order a while back. It came very quickly and I love it. I got compliments on my hair ties. I got some designs that were not in the pictures shown, but I still like them.</li>
            <li> I recieved only two of the same design, although it is a bit on the smaller side it was expected if you read the other customer&#x27;s review. The pricing is extremely cheap so it doesn&#x27;t really matter if it&#x27;s a bit smaller.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re cute, but small. like maybe 2 inches wide (the bow)&lt;br /&gt;also the bow isn&#x27;t like pictured-- it&#x27;s fabric fused to thin foam and stitched down, not floppy like the pictures indicated, and not all the colors are right. But i like them anyways and wear them on my high buns. looking cute.</li>
            <li> Such cute little hair ties! Although had to have a extra plain hair tie underneath due to having thick hair, other than that very cute!</li>
            <li> cute but not stretchy enough.</li>
            <li> They are real cute, they hold great and do not pull your hair. Inexpensive and fun</li>
            <li> super cute bunny ear hair tie, pull your hair in a pony tail and add this around, small enough not to get in the way, but big enough to be seen.</li>
            <li> i love it.looks good on me and my little princess. Good quality too</li>
            <li> Thin material but look exactly as picture. Did not get any repeat colors.</li>
            <li> they are super cute, well made</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any duplicates and I got a few even better colors that weren&#x27;t even pictured! I&#x27;m so happy with my order, though they are a bit smaller than I expected. (Which was a really pleasant surprise for me!) I&#x27;ll post a picture of the colors I received.</li>
            <li> These are some of the cutest hair accessories I own. Everytime I wear them, people ask me where I got them from. They aren&#x27;t too in-your-face obvious because the round elastic part is wrapped around your hair, but the little bows stick out just the right/cute amount to show off your hair. They are really fun to match with cute outfits and can add an adorable flair to simply summer dresses. I recommend for older gals as well as little girls. The quality is good...I&#x27;ve been wearing a couple of them for weeks, pretty consistently, and they still look and feel like new! Totally a great price, a great buy.</li>
            <li> They arrived a lot earlier than estimated. The hair ties are really cute, but the only problem I have was that I didn&#x27;t get much of an assortment. I got multiples of a few colors. Overall, I do like them!</li>
            <li> Slow shipping, but super cute colors and patterns. Add just a touch of fun to my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> These are super cute!&lt;br /&gt;They are actually better than I expected and are very sturdy and well made. The stitches on each of the bows looks neat and the thread matches the colors of each of the different colored fabrics.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike others who&#x27;ve complained, all of my bows were different colors :)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments every time I&#x27;ve worn them so I&#x27;d definitely recommend them to anyone to buy or give them as gifts :)</li>
            <li> Way smaller than they look</li>
            <li> The last date of arrival was yesterday, so where are they? If you guys had tracking info it would be much better, I know it&#x27;s only $4, but I bought this product in order to use it!</li>
            <li> Lol. Cute little hair ribbons.  Can be used for little girls hair or her dolls hair. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I had to wait two weeks for these to arrive (they came from China I assume due to the writing on the packed), so I did not have them in time for the color run, which was the only reason I ordered them. Even when they came, I only received two, not TEN, as advertised. They are thin and small, as though they are meant for an infant. To make matters worse, of all the colors to receive, I got the mustard yellow and baby pink, the two colors I hate the most. I am extremely disappointed, and wish I could get my money back, even though it was just a measly few dollars.</li>
            <li> They are so cute. I can&#x27;t wait to wear them. They arrived today in the the mail and on time. I received one duplicate.  I have long thick hair. They look like they will stretch enough to get around my pony tail 2 or 3 times.  I would order them again.</li>
            <li> They are super cute and I love them. But mine came with nine and it came all in the same color.&lt;br /&gt;I tried ordering another round because I love the style and it&#x27;s cheap..&lt;br /&gt;let&#x27;s hope I get a variety of colors this time!</li>
            <li> These are great hair ties. They are very cute, soft and colorful. I received every color in the picture. They are also very tight and elastic. Definitely a great purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair, and this only takes two &amp;#34;tie-arounds&amp;#34; until it sits perfectly holding my hair up. The bunny ears are easy to adjust to make them stick up the way you want to. I will probably order more of these.</li>
            <li> I thought the boy part would be bigger but I still love these hair wraps. I use them Every time I pick up my hair even around the house.</li>
            <li> The package arrived 2 weeks before the expected arrival date which I quite enjoyed but upon opening the package I quickly noticed that there was no green one. I did receive 10 hair ties and no duplicates but it was still disappointing. I got 3 colors not shown on the pictures but it was my understanding that the colors in the pictures were the ones I was going to receive. The green and light blue were two of the bows I was looking most forward to getting and I am pretty disappointed. Regardless of the color mishap though, I did receive my order in a timely manner, all ties are well made, and it was a great price for 10 of these cute accessories.</li>
            <li> These are so cute and the first time I wore mine, I was complemented on it constantly. I have very thick hair so I use a normal black one to tie it up, and then one of these on top to add style and cuteness to my ponytail. Came in a variety of colors of pokadots. Kind of wish they had solid colors. They look adorable with braids too. Amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> Omgosh! They&#x27;re so cute! They also arrived before the expected date hehe&lt;br /&gt;It was super fast! I got a lot of different colors as well oUO the price is just perfect for these! I might just order some more right now! Lol</li>
            <li> Very cute. Received them quickly and in all-different colors.</li>
            <li> good quality, durable, very cute i wear them overtime i put my hair up</li>
            <li> Did not get any duplicates, but mostly large dots and stripes. I wish I got some small dotted ones, but these are very good for the price.</li>
            <li> No same colors but if you use them more then a few time you just better get a new pack because the whole thing will slide off</li>
            <li> No duplicates, but my order only had 9 bands and 1 way dirty- so only 8 usable hair bands.</li>
            <li> OMG! These are soooooo cute! They are well made and mine arrived in an assortment of colors. I might have to buy more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> I got every color exept green. Other than that i got everything , all 10 that it said i would get. I was impressed when i got it. I ordered it September 14, and by September 29 they had arrived. They arrive pretty fast. I would totally recomend it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how cheap this is and the product you get is great! Only got one color that was doubled but other than that, really pretty and works well! 10/10 would buy again!</li>
            <li> They r very cute and worth of every penny...</li>
            <li> These hair ties are super cute but pretty small. I bought them for myself but decided to give them to my little cousin. She can put them to better use. I got one of each color show in the picture. For the price I can&#x27;t complain but u so wish they were a little bigger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-the girlfriend</li>
            <li> This hair ties are very cute and holds my hair very well.</li>
            <li> Not for women. These were extremely small. Not at all what they are advertised to be. I gave mine to a friend with a 3 year old daughter for her hair. very disappointed. They are great for the child&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> great deal and worth the long wait</li>
            <li> I was nervous about ordering these after reading some of the negative reviews, but I&#x27;m glad I went ahead and did it anyway! These are so, so cute and exactly what I was hoping for! They are well made and comfortable. I did receive all ten with a few of the same color, but otherwise the assortment was great and I really don&#x27;t mind having a few doubles. It took about three weeks for them to come - a few days before the earliest expected arrival date. Overall I am very happy and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> These ties are so cute! I got 10 DIFFERENT colors and I&#x27;m so happy with them all.</li>
            <li> These are for children, not women.  It also took 2 months to arrive.</li>
            <li> These are very cute and well made.  The shipment came 10 days ahead of the estimated delivery.  They are of different colors, I&#x27;m going to order some more, hopefully I get the same colors so they can be used in pairs too.</li>
            <li> To small dont stretch</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute but came with not the same colors as shown... My daughter was kind of upset.</li>
            <li> Came in perfect conditions and many colors! Love them!</li>
            <li> These are cute, but cheap. After a couple wears it starts becoming fringed.</li>
            <li> Fun ties! I have thin hair and they stay put! Even gotten compliments!</li>
            <li> My girls loved these!!</li>
            <li> Super tiny but cute. Will not hold adult hair but perfect for babies which is what I got for.</li>
            <li> The rubber bands themselves are an ok quality. But I was expecting to get the colors shown in the picture. Instead I got a lot of leopard print ones which I don&#x27;t really care for and some blue ones, and 1 pink and 1 white one.</li>
            <li> These are cute for little girls and I received them sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> not for thick hair - can only wrap once and not very much elastic</li>
            <li> im happy with the quality of the hair ties, very tight and won&#x27;t get stuck in my hair.</li>
            <li> My package has arrived!!!!! I love love love this! It&#x27;s cute, thin, and small which perfectly fit my thin hair!</li>
            <li> I love them!!, they&#x27;re super cute!!&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a variety of colors. I got two black ones tho. But that&#x27;s OK, because I can do the cute piggy tail style with them!! 😁💕</li>
            <li> Cute products worth the wait.  It took like 2-3 weeks to received it.</li>
            <li> The&#x27;re really cute! The only problem i had was it gave me 9 rubber bands. and one of those 9 didn&#x27;t have bunny ears.. But other than that i like it (: It holds my hair good since i have thin hair</li>
            <li> Loved these they where very cute</li>
            <li> Ordered 2 packs got 2 of each color there perfect and I love them!!!!</li>
            <li> A great product for cheap, but it does wear out a bit if you use it a lot. I have been using it for about half a year now.</li>
            <li> Not as stretchy as I&#x27;d like. May not be able to get as snug as you want to if your hairs thick</li>
            <li> They are cheap and bad quality but look cute on the hair.</li>
            <li> I would give this a five but the tie part is so small and not stretchy. But other than that they are super cute and wearable. I was so happy to get them. They also arrived earlier than the estimated time. I got it within like 1 and half weeks.</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves them.  They look lovely on her!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Recommend to all.</li>
            <li> While these are very cute, they are smaller than what I anticipated.  I have a lot of hair so I am unable to use them for a single pony tail.  They look super cute with my pigtails though.  I like that they are fabric covered so they do not pull my hair out like some regular bands.  I do wish that they would have come in pair colors since I wear two at a time.  For the low price, I may just order another set and hope I can match up the colors.  Every time I wear the, I get several compliments and people ask me where I got them from.</li>
            <li> Ears are a little floppy and don&#x27;t stand up straight but my girls love them</li>
            <li> Very well made and super cute! came with exactly 10 as described and they were all different colors and patterns. They  are lovely! Great price for great quality, seriously this is a steal, I totally recommend buying this!</li>
            <li> They need to change their profile pic of the item. I first ordered these a year or two ago and it was very bright and pretty. So... I decided to order 4 more. This time, even the fabric had changed. It was some cheap &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; material and the colors were gloomy. I was also missing 1. I have so many candy striper ones and the one black I got, doesn&#x27;t even look black. Meh....</li>
            <li> very cute, a lot of colors and wont snap like most hair bands</li>
            <li> I loved these the shipping was faster than expected. They are small so I wouldn&#x27;t wear them but they are perfect for my little one she looks adorable. Great for the price.</li>
            <li> I love these bow hair ties so much!!! They&#x27;re so cute and they hold your hair really well! The only complaint I have is that, like others, I didn&#x27;t get all the colors. I didn&#x27;t get the light blue, hot pink, green, and the peachy color which was a little disapointing. That is why I&#x27;m probably ordering more! Hopefully, I will get the colors I didn&#x27;t get and I can have a few back up colors, in case I lose it! These probably can&#x27;t break! For the price, I think everyone should order this!</li>
            <li> I did not expect these ponytail holders to be as well made as they are. They are very cute in person.  My only complaint is that the assortment I received had duplicate colors in it, and I was hoping to receive a few of the ones in the photo that I did not.  But still a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Took forever to arrive. Good for little kids.</li>
            <li> these are great!! I have very long hair (to my hips) and these hair ties really &amp;#34;charm-up&amp;#34; my ponytails and side braids. My hair is super thick and heavy, but these ties have no trouble holding my hair up! I&#x27;ve bought several more just to have on hand dig the random colors in the assortment. My only wish would be for darker shades (most are fairly bright), but I still love them.</li>
            <li> These are adorable! However, the colors that are provided in the package come at random, so I was a bit disappointed. Also, there were repeats of some (same color and pattern). Overall though I&#x27;m happy: these came at a good price! Worth the wait, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Love it! !!! So so cute and the price is great. Happy I didn&#x27;t miss it! :)</li>
            <li> I love them~! I got 10 different colors! :3</li>
            <li> Love these!! They are so cute and the colors are awesome!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my three year old. They are smaller so if you have a lot of hair they probably won&#x27;t fit. I can put all or half of her hair up in these. She loves them and they are cute. They are well made considering the price and they arrived about a week before estimated. Got two duplicates as shown but daughter doesn&#x27;t know any different and for two bucks I don&#x27;t really care. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> very cute hair ties, I wish there was more different colors but oh well.</li>
            <li> Real cute! I just thought they were head bands not hair ties but, I love them nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter&#x27;s hair. They&#x27;re meant for older children (not babies &amp; toddlers) and the quality wasn&#x27;t as good as I had hoped. The fabric was a little thin. However, for the price, I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised. I got a great deal on these and I&#x27;m sure my daughter will love them in a couple years when her hair is thicker and she&#x27;s older.</li>
            <li> I ordered these about a month ago and just got them today. The quality is great but I&#x27;m a bit disappointed considering I received three of the pink and blue, and two of the black, along with one red and nude. So basically I only got half of what I was guaranteed. Oh well, you get what you pay for! I&#x27;ll just give the extras to my friends. By the way, I have thick hair and these seem to hold it up but I think I&#x27;ll wear an elastic under because I bet they&#x27;ll come loose as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE AND EARLY DELIVERY !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only got 9 of the 10, THOUGH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Missing the dark blue.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with this product&lt;br /&gt;They will go around a pony tail twice....&lt;br /&gt;Super cute!</li>
            <li> Not anything like what is pictured.  I received 4 mint green and cream polka dot ribbons exactly the same, plus 4 identical pink and cream ribbons.  One navy w/ cream polka dots and an ugly brown with polka dots.  Nothing resembled what is pictured. No floral prints or cute colors as shown.  Would never have bought this if I had known what I was getting instead.</li>
            <li> These are really cute and don&#x27;t break easily like normal hair ties. A must have. All my friends gave me compliments on these.</li>
            <li> All my friends ask me where I got them. They&#x27;re so cute!</li>
            <li> Not the same colors as it is in the picture and it was missing 1. I mean come on. Where is the HONESTY? Basically the seller was just tricking everyone. I got like 5 blacks... come on? I paid for ten and I only get 9? So freaking unconvinient! 2 stars for getting me excited for nothing and thinking that it was a good deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars because of the company. I had emailed them after I received my hair bows in the mail asking them if they could possibly replace one that was missing. They quickly responded and were extremely helpful. (Later on I found the missing piece. Oops) The hair bows are super cute and come in all different colors I love them!</li>
            <li> Some color are ok, some are silly</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 4 year old daughter. They are very cute and look great in her hair. I just wish they were a little more durable. Her hair is thick and these almost barely fit around her hair. I imagine they would work even better with someone who has thinner hair. Other than that they are really cute hair ties.</li>
            <li> I like the hair band with this price. I didn&#x27;t give it the five stars because the quality is ok but it is not like the pictures they have online. The dots are bigger not as cute as the pictures. If you just wanna it for fine you can order it. I plan to give them away to my students.</li>
            <li> they go with every outfit I have &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> looks so cute, she loves it. wish I had gotten an extra set. They stay in her hair and have had many compliments on these. her hair is thin and fit very well, and I have borrowed some of them and have used them in my hair,and they work equally well in mine, and my hair is very thick. Wonderful hairbands.</li>
            <li> When i opened the package and look at most of them, 6 of the bows were ripped or had messed up stiching</li>
            <li> they are really cute and small i been wearing them a lot (:</li>
            <li> Very cool however I received one that did not have a tie on it, and it happened to be my favourite of the pinks I got!  Good price, and they arrived faster than estimated so I can not really complain.  Only received them today but they do seem sturdy and stand up to being stretched and pulled around.  Good value for a cute hair tie.</li>
            <li> Cute set of hair ties. They look exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> I got this product a little less than two weeks, earlier than I expected. The quality is great, except one of the ties has a really long, stray thread, which isn&#x27;t much of a problem because I could cut it off. I got a good assortment, but received three of the same pattern. It is overall a great product, worth the $2! Will be buying more again soon!!!!!!!:) :)</li>
            <li> Ugly neon color unlike shown in picture. SO much brighter than the picture I took. Hurts to look at, physically.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and nice quality, got all ten of them but not all the colors they show on the picture. I really wanted the red, light blue and yellow one but instead i got some neon pinks and neon oranges.</li>
            <li> Different from the pictures, but still loves them :) PS it arrived faster then the estimated time</li>
            <li> Came in the mail and upon opening, it smelled terrible. They didn&#x27;t give me the green one. Instead, they sent me two neon yellow ones. Not sure if the yellow one in the picture is actually neon..or if I just got unlucky. I still did receive 10 bow ties which is good. I really wanted that green one...</li>
            <li> I now use these hair bows daily!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re pretty strong for such a low price!! In my opinion, they look best when I have my hair in a high bun so that the bunny ears can stick right up!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re not very wide, so you can&#x27;t always double knot them (only for a ponytail).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really love that it DOES NOT PULL MY HAIR!! The material is pretty sturdy and none of mine have any damage on them what-so-ever, even after daily use!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve uploaded a photo as well where you can clearly see the bunny bow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are my favorite hair accessory of all time, best purchase for a great price! I&#x27;ve bought more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Got three pairs of matching colors and four of random different colors. My guess is they just grab and package ten at random. Fairly stretchy -- I tie my hair up with a different elastic band first before tying one on, but they also hold my hair just fine on their own. The &amp;#34;rabbit ears&amp;#34; stick up mostly on their own, though sometimes I&#x27;ll rearrange them a bit so they stick up more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, the circumference of all my hair pulled back into a ponytail is the size of an American nickel. I can loop the tie twice if i want it loose, or three times if I want it really really tight.</li>
            <li> Horrible.  These things are so small.  I&#x27;m letting my daughter use them on her dolls.  Total waste of money.  Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered these thinking they were cute headbands for baby (I clicked the wrong link) and ended up loving them for myself!! I have really thick hair so I have to use a different hair tie underneath but they are really cute! It was about 3 weeks before I got them but that&#x27;s to be expected when they come from China.</li>
