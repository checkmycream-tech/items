            <li>Happy and satisfied the product.</li>
            <li>I got this in good price discount product promotions  in return of product reviews which is unbiased and honest .</li>
            <li>I am surprised, these are excellent quality, a great value too.  </li>
            <li>Love these !</li>
            <li>Great and cheap alternative to the OEM Brush heads.</li>
            <li>and it is amazing , because I had my teeth problem regarding plague</li>
            <li>We both have own brush head</li>
            <li>BrushBrite Premium Replacement Brush Heads work just as effectively as Sonicare&#x27;s replacement brush heads, but they cost one-third the price of Sonicare&#x27;s heads.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer:  I was offered this product at a promotional price to share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>They fit perfect and are extremely comfortable on your teeth.</li>
            <li>An absolute great value!</li>
            <li>My opinions are my own and are not influenced in any way.</li>
            <li>As what can i say this product is good quality even it is not as good in original</li>
            <li>Very satisfied :)</li>
            <li>Brushes are well made and have a snug fit on the handle  Switching for good</li>
            <li>I am impressed by these and was pleasantly surprised in their quality.</li>
            <li>They do fit the model just fine, though, and the price is great.</li>
            <li>The product was good, but I the brush was softer than original</li>
            <li>Seem just as good as the original Philips heads.</li>
            <li>They are great, exactly as described.</li>
            <li>These are much more affordable as a replacement toothbrush head, they do the job, but the quality is not quite sonicare.  </li>
            <li>and we both love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Save yourself some money and invest in as many packages you can afford</li>
            <li>Received product rather quickly, satisfied with the packaging.  </li>
            <li>, glad I ordered.</li>
            <li>handle either when the toothbrush is turned on making them that much better.</li>
            <li>I am going to be ordering a lot more now for they make owning a Sonicare toothbrush even better.</li>
            <li>Why pay more?</li>
            <li>Many people mentioned these being a lot softer than the name brand sonicare heads</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant given how much cheaper these heads are from the Phillips brand but they&#x27;ve held up great</li>
            <li>Way cheaper. :-)</li>
            <li>These are so much more affordable, and work as well as the brand name.</li>
            <li>did receive this for free for the purpose of reviewing honestly.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>They fit the  OralB (type3709), and I didn&#x27;t even expect it to!</li>
            <li>It cleans very well &amp; they are a great price.</li>
            <li>I try this how many time</li>
            <li>ok for the price</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay with me.</li>
            <li>I can change my brush heads more often, more sanitary to do that anyway.</li>
            <li>They are a bit softer than the one that came with the brush, but my teeth still feel nice and smooth, without damaging my gums.</li>
            <li>Why pay more?</li>
            <li>and so glad I ordered.</li>
            <li>But when I have to replace them every 2-3 weeks, these are a much better value</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly and seem to be of a high standard - really good!</li>
            <li>so far so good but not as good as the  original.</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly and feel the same.</li>
            <li>So far, they work great.  </li>
            <li>These heads fit my Philips Sonicare HX6211/30 perfectly and are much better than expected for the price.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the real thing but quite a lot cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I bought thses for my Sonicare toothbrush and not only do they fit perfectly, but they feel just as clean as the Sonicare toothbrush heads that I used to use, but</li>
            <li>almost better than original</li>
            <li>There made of amazing quality and honestly I was so surprised to get these it made my week.</li>
            <li>They do clean very well and get in between your teeth to give them a great clean.</li>
            <li>They attack easily to brush.</li>
            <li>Also, fits the unit easily and has color coding (for spouses to easily distinguish whose brush belongs to whom)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I try this product brushbrite premium replacement brush heads because it product description is set of 3 brush and it is easy to use .</li>
            <li>You do not get the dentist feeling clean as the stock Sonicare brush heads, but it&#x27;s way better than using manual brushes.</li>
            <li>Fit perfectly and cost half of what the sonicare replacements cost.  </li>
            <li>They fit on the toothbrush fine, but they don&#x27;t fit on the holder.</li>
            <li>These fit my toothbrush and have withstood the test of time.</li>
            <li>I have bought the name brand and even 1:10 heads don&#x27;t fit well.</li>
            <li>Great price, feels the same as the name brand stuff.</li>
            <li>Smaller heads but great product</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my brush.</li>
            <li>One downside is the hygiene cover doesn&#x27;t fit these heads</li>
            <li>I just bought a cheap plastic one to cover it.</li>
            <li>Just take the replacement head and snap it onto your electric toothbrush and enjoy.</li>
            <li>They do no come with a plastic cap to cover the brush head, though I imagine the one I have from Sonicare will fit.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such great item!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but i noticed it removes lightly.</li>
            <li>These generic Sonicare heads work just great.</li>
            <li>Great price, feels the same as the name brand stuff.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how good the quality of the toothbrush heads were because of the cheap price.  </li>
            <li>and they are comparable to the Philips sonic care small brush, they are a  perfect size.</li>
            <li>After using it about a month, I start to see significant wear on the brush.</li>
            <li>Looks and feels like the original.</li>
            <li>Fits on head like the original brushes.</li>
            <li>Like the original ones</li>
            <li>Cheaper alternative to the original brush heads.</li>
            <li>Bite the bullet and buy the original Philips toothbrushe heads.</li>
            <li>I think they wear out a little quicker than pricier options, but they&#x27;re an incredible value regardless.</li>
            <li>Definite good buy</li>
            <li>Fit right on the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads fit and perform exactly as the original Sonicare ones.</li>
            <li>These are super affordable and seem to work every bit as well as the name brand brushes.</li>
            <li>They are packaged as a set of three and are shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Pretty good generic version.</li>
            <li>They are significantly softer than the original heads, so much so that I&#x27;ve opted not to use them.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!!</li>
            <li>Pretty close to the Original.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are much softer than the brush that came with my Sonicare, which suited me fine.</li>
            <li>A+ great quality use it everyday so convenient</li>
            <li>It turns out that are nearly identical and at a much better price.</li>
            <li>These fit OK but definitely leave a gap between the head and the handle.  </li>
            <li>These seem to fit better and last longer.</li>
            <li>Hope this is useful.</li>
            <li>think  its worth the money</li>
            <li>Out of the generics I have used, these are the closest to the original and at a much lower cost.</li>
            <li>Right now it looks like these will be my heads.</li>
            <li>My teeth still feel just as clean and my wallet feels much fatter.</li>
            <li>My teeth still feel just as clean and my wallet feels much fatter.</li>
            <li>Really great comparable to the Sonic Brushes but a generic version to be honest can&#x27;t tell any difference why not buy these for half the price and get 3 in a pack!!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for a 1/3 of price.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how these generic replacements would work.  </li>
            <li>Inexpensive brush replacements that work just as well as the higher priced.</li>
            <li>great feel to these and extremely long lasting.  </li>
            <li>I used one and found myself brushing my teeth easily twice as long to just to get them as clean as the name brand version.</li>
            <li>They will do the job, but only with more brushing time.</li>
            <li>Bristles falling out on first use.</li>
            <li>I thought the second replacement head might perform better but it didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too !</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>They are OK but not the same.  </li>
            <li>They actually compare to the Sonicare brand and fit the Sonicare toothbrush just right.</li>
            <li>They go soft extremely quickly and brushing seemed to become ineffective.</li>
            <li>, These work just as good as the leading brand and last just as long too.</li>
            <li>These really are indistinguishable from the name-brand brush heads, and they&#x27;re so much</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>but it really went work well.</li>
            <li>I thought I would give it a shot since this product is so much cheaper than the Sonicare refills.</li>
            <li>I really wish it cleaned as well.</li>
            <li>These work really well and are much cheaper than the name brand.</li>
            <li>They are just a cheap generic version.</li>
            <li>how much cheaper they are than the name brand ones.</li>
            <li>These work really well.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do the job.</li>
            <li>how much cheaper they are than the name brand ones.</li>
            <li>Seems to have just a bit softer bristles, but cleans equally as well as original.  </li>
            <li>I will go with the Original in the future since it is cheaper than dental work..</li>
            <li>Great for those on a budget or not able to find the regular Sonicare brushes on sale (discount).</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re a single user and never take the brush head off, you&#x27;ll be fine...</li>
            <li>So I had to buy a new toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>They cost way less than the Sonicare brand and feel better on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Love the product compared to the Sonicare prices will definitely buy again in future.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Great alternative to the expensive sonic toothbrush refills.  </li>
            <li>I would like if the bristles were more firm.</li>
            <li>This seem maybe a bit more stiff than the Sonicare ones which is a plus.</li>
            <li>Worked for about two days and completely came loose and doesn&#x27;t even fit with the sonicare now.</li>
            <li>Was looking for new brush heads and saw this 3pk.</li>
            <li>hardly ever leave customer feedback, but this was too good of savings not to share with anyone who&#x27;s looking for a solid product!!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a very soft head, I suppose you would like these.</li>
            <li>I used to have to run hot water over the bristles in order to soften them up a bit before use, but that is not necessary with these BrushBrite heads.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I have braces now and the sharp edges damage brushes fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>I saved a couple of the caps from my old brush heads and just use those.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, these really do feel like the same as the name brand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are soft</li>
            <li>So far works well.</li>
            <li>Would definitely buy again over the originals that cost 3x-4x as much</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t find them to be too soft at all.  </li>
            <li>So far, they&#x27;re working well.</li>
            <li>Way too soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles however were extremely soft.</li>
            <li>As far as I am concerned BrushBrite Replacement Heads are junk</li>
            <li>Equal quality as the real ones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I read the reviews and ordered them instead of paying the ridiculous price for the name brand brushes.  </li>
            <li>The brushes spread a little more and seem to loose stiffness sooner.  </li>
            <li>Held securely and did not create any usual noises.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>The only difference that I have found is that the little toothbrush cover doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>Other generics have had a loose fit and you can see where they are not holding up well.</li>
            <li>They are very durable and last a long time.  </li>
            <li>Works great and much less expensive than name brand replacements.</li>
            <li>Great product and much less expensive than buying at the store.</li>
            <li>first use, it does not feel very stiff, they are very flexible brush heads (feel the same as name brand brush heads after about 2 months of use).</li>
            <li>even if they last only half as long they will have been well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Only thing I have to do now for a complete review is see how long they last.</li>
            <li>For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong, I am someone who likes a new toothbrush every couple of weeks and for the price this makes it worth it!</li>
            <li>, the brushes are not too soft or too hard and are so much cheaper , They don&#x27;t have the plastic travel caps on the toothbrush</li>

            <li> I am surprised, these are excellent quality, a great value too.  </li>
            <li> Love these !</li>
            <li> Great and cheap alternative to the OEM Brush heads.</li>
            <li> and it is amazing , because I had my teeth problem regarding plague</li>
            <li> We both have own brush head</li>
            <li> BrushBrite Premium Replacement Brush Heads work just as effectively as Sonicare&#x27;s replacement brush heads, but they cost one-third the price of Sonicare&#x27;s heads.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer:  I was offered this product at a promotional price to share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> They fit perfect and are extremely comfortable on your teeth.</li>
            <li> An absolute great value!</li>
            <li> My opinions are my own and are not influenced in any way.</li>
            <li> As what can i say this product is good quality even it is not as good in original</li>
            <li> Very satisfied :)</li>
            <li> Brushes are well made and have a snug fit on the handle  Switching for good</li>
            <li> I am impressed by these and was pleasantly surprised in their quality.</li>
            <li> They do fit the model just fine, though, and the price is great.</li>
            <li> The product was good, but I the brush was softer than original</li>
            <li> Seem just as good as the original Philips heads.</li>
            <li> They are great, exactly as described.</li>
            <li> These are much more affordable as a replacement toothbrush head, they do the job, but the quality is not quite sonicare.  </li>
            <li> and we both love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Save yourself some money and invest in as many packages you can afford</li>
            <li> Received product rather quickly, satisfied with the packaging.  </li>
            <li> , glad I ordered.</li>
            <li> handle either when the toothbrush is turned on making them that much better.</li>
            <li> I am going to be ordering a lot more now for they make owning a Sonicare toothbrush even better.</li>
            <li> Why pay more?</li>
            <li> Many people mentioned these being a lot softer than the name brand sonicare heads</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant given how much cheaper these heads are from the Phillips brand but they&#x27;ve held up great</li>
            <li> Way cheaper. :-)</li>
            <li> These are so much more affordable, and work as well as the brand name.</li>
            <li> did receive this for free for the purpose of reviewing honestly.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> They fit the  OralB (type3709), and I didn&#x27;t even expect it to!</li>
            <li> It cleans very well &amp; they are a great price.</li>
            <li> I try this how many time</li>
            <li> ok for the price</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s okay with me.</li>
            <li> I can change my brush heads more often, more sanitary to do that anyway.</li>
            <li> They are a bit softer than the one that came with the brush, but my teeth still feel nice and smooth, without damaging my gums.</li>
            <li> Why pay more?</li>
            <li> and so glad I ordered.</li>
            <li> But when I have to replace them every 2-3 weeks, these are a much better value</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly and seem to be of a high standard - really good!</li>
            <li> so far so good but not as good as the  original.</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly and feel the same.</li>
            <li> So far, they work great.  </li>
            <li> These heads fit my Philips Sonicare HX6211/30 perfectly and are much better than expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the real thing but quite a lot cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I bought thses for my Sonicare toothbrush and not only do they fit perfectly, but they feel just as clean as the Sonicare toothbrush heads that I used to use, but</li>
            <li> almost better than original</li>
            <li> There made of amazing quality and honestly I was so surprised to get these it made my week.</li>
            <li> They do clean very well and get in between your teeth to give them a great clean.</li>
            <li> They attack easily to brush.</li>
            <li> Also, fits the unit easily and has color coding (for spouses to easily distinguish whose brush belongs to whom)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I try this product brushbrite premium replacement brush heads because it product description is set of 3 brush and it is easy to use .</li>
            <li> You do not get the dentist feeling clean as the stock Sonicare brush heads, but it&#x27;s way better than using manual brushes.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly and cost half of what the sonicare replacements cost.  </li>
            <li> They fit on the toothbrush fine, but they don&#x27;t fit on the holder.</li>
            <li> These fit my toothbrush and have withstood the test of time.</li>
            <li> I have bought the name brand and even 1:10 heads don&#x27;t fit well.</li>
            <li> Great price, feels the same as the name brand stuff.</li>
            <li> Smaller heads but great product</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my brush.</li>
            <li> One downside is the hygiene cover doesn&#x27;t fit these heads</li>
            <li> I just bought a cheap plastic one to cover it.</li>
            <li> Just take the replacement head and snap it onto your electric toothbrush and enjoy.</li>
            <li> They do no come with a plastic cap to cover the brush head, though I imagine the one I have from Sonicare will fit.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such great item!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but i noticed it removes lightly.</li>
            <li> These generic Sonicare heads work just great.</li>
            <li> Great price, feels the same as the name brand stuff.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how good the quality of the toothbrush heads were because of the cheap price.  </li>
            <li> and they are comparable to the Philips sonic care small brush, they are a  perfect size.</li>
            <li> After using it about a month, I start to see significant wear on the brush.</li>
            <li> Looks and feels like the original.</li>
            <li> Fits on head like the original brushes.</li>
            <li> Like the original ones</li>
            <li> Cheaper alternative to the original brush heads.</li>
            <li> Bite the bullet and buy the original Philips toothbrushe heads.</li>
            <li> I think they wear out a little quicker than pricier options, but they&#x27;re an incredible value regardless.</li>
            <li> Definite good buy</li>
            <li> Fit right on the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads fit and perform exactly as the original Sonicare ones.</li>
            <li> These are super affordable and seem to work every bit as well as the name brand brushes.</li>
            <li> They are packaged as a set of three and are shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Pretty good generic version.</li>
            <li> They are significantly softer than the original heads, so much so that I&#x27;ve opted not to use them.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!!</li>
            <li> Pretty close to the Original.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are much softer than the brush that came with my Sonicare, which suited me fine.</li>
            <li> A+ great quality use it everyday so convenient</li>
            <li> It turns out that are nearly identical and at a much better price.</li>
            <li> These fit OK but definitely leave a gap between the head and the handle.  </li>
            <li> These seem to fit better and last longer.</li>
            <li> Hope this is useful.</li>
            <li> think  its worth the money</li>
            <li> Out of the generics I have used, these are the closest to the original and at a much lower cost.</li>
            <li> Right now it looks like these will be my heads.</li>
            <li> My teeth still feel just as clean and my wallet feels much fatter.</li>
            <li> My teeth still feel just as clean and my wallet feels much fatter.</li>
            <li> Really great comparable to the Sonic Brushes but a generic version to be honest can&#x27;t tell any difference why not buy these for half the price and get 3 in a pack!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for a 1/3 of price.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how these generic replacements would work.  </li>
            <li> Inexpensive brush replacements that work just as well as the higher priced.</li>
            <li> great feel to these and extremely long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I used one and found myself brushing my teeth easily twice as long to just to get them as clean as the name brand version.</li>
            <li> They will do the job, but only with more brushing time.</li>
            <li> Bristles falling out on first use.</li>
            <li> I thought the second replacement head might perform better but it didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too !</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> They are OK but not the same.  </li>
            <li> They actually compare to the Sonicare brand and fit the Sonicare toothbrush just right.</li>
            <li> They go soft extremely quickly and brushing seemed to become ineffective.</li>
            <li> , These work just as good as the leading brand and last just as long too.</li>
            <li> These really are indistinguishable from the name-brand brush heads, and they&#x27;re so much</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> but it really went work well.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give it a shot since this product is so much cheaper than the Sonicare refills.</li>
            <li> I really wish it cleaned as well.</li>
            <li> These work really well and are much cheaper than the name brand.</li>
            <li> They are just a cheap generic version.</li>
            <li> how much cheaper they are than the name brand ones.</li>
            <li> These work really well.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do the job.</li>
            <li> how much cheaper they are than the name brand ones.</li>
            <li> Seems to have just a bit softer bristles, but cleans equally as well as original.  </li>
            <li> I will go with the Original in the future since it is cheaper than dental work..</li>
            <li> Great for those on a budget or not able to find the regular Sonicare brushes on sale (discount).</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re a single user and never take the brush head off, you&#x27;ll be fine...</li>
            <li> So I had to buy a new toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> They cost way less than the Sonicare brand and feel better on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Love the product compared to the Sonicare prices will definitely buy again in future.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to the expensive sonic toothbrush refills.  </li>
            <li> I would like if the bristles were more firm.</li>
            <li> This seem maybe a bit more stiff than the Sonicare ones which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Worked for about two days and completely came loose and doesn&#x27;t even fit with the sonicare now.</li>
            <li> Was looking for new brush heads and saw this 3pk.</li>
            <li> hardly ever leave customer feedback, but this was too good of savings not to share with anyone who&#x27;s looking for a solid product!!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a very soft head, I suppose you would like these.</li>
            <li> I used to have to run hot water over the bristles in order to soften them up a bit before use, but that is not necessary with these BrushBrite heads.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I have braces now and the sharp edges damage brushes fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> I saved a couple of the caps from my old brush heads and just use those.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, these really do feel like the same as the name brand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are soft</li>
            <li> So far works well.</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy again over the originals that cost 3x-4x as much</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t find them to be too soft at all.  </li>
            <li> So far, they&#x27;re working well.</li>
            <li> Way too soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles however were extremely soft.</li>
            <li> As far as I am concerned BrushBrite Replacement Heads are junk</li>
            <li> Equal quality as the real ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I read the reviews and ordered them instead of paying the ridiculous price for the name brand brushes.  </li>
            <li> The brushes spread a little more and seem to loose stiffness sooner.  </li>
            <li> Held securely and did not create any usual noises.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> The only difference that I have found is that the little toothbrush cover doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> Other generics have had a loose fit and you can see where they are not holding up well.</li>
            <li> They are very durable and last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Works great and much less expensive than name brand replacements.</li>
            <li> Great product and much less expensive than buying at the store.</li>
            <li> first use, it does not feel very stiff, they are very flexible brush heads (feel the same as name brand brush heads after about 2 months of use).</li>
            <li> even if they last only half as long they will have been well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Only thing I have to do now for a complete review is see how long they last.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong, I am someone who likes a new toothbrush every couple of weeks and for the price this makes it worth it!</li>
            <li> , the brushes are not too soft or too hard and are so much cheaper , They don&#x27;t have the plastic travel caps on the toothbrush</li>
            <li> The two common themes in reviews I read about other products were (1) proper fit of the head and (2) bristle quality.</li>
            <li> Some say they&#x27;re not as stiff as the Sonicare, but I don&#x27;t notice a real difference.</li>
            <li> My only comment is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the OEM</li>
            <li> Even if these don&#x27;t last as long as the Sonicare ones, I still feel like it&#x27;s a bargain.</li>
            <li> the brushes eventually fall off the toothbrush holder so they really are not very good.</li>
            <li> And these replacement heads last just as long as the other more expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> your old caps do not fit and only loosely cover it</li>
            <li> But without such disclaimers, I do not believe it did what I expected, hence the 2 stars.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not certain they will last as long but</li>
            <li> and I will buy them as a long as they make them!</li>
            <li> My only lament would be that they don&#x27;t come with a little plastic cover for the head (and the cover for the brand name ones is too big-</li>
            <li> /&gt;there is a slight odor the next morning</li>
            <li> As a Sonicare tooth brush family we were shocked after receiving these to review because there better than we imagined.</li>
            <li> Arrived well packaged and exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> and I have bought generic in the past at Walmart and</li>
            <li> Brush heads fits the Philips Sonicare brush handles well, but does not work as well due to the lower quality bristles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read reviews stating that off brand replacement heads were extra noisy, but I&#x27;ve noticed nothing out of the ordinary.</li>
            <li> These cheap, in every sense of the word, brush heads turned out to be very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I will go back to paying full price :(</li>
            <li> The real brushes are so expensive I decided to try these.  </li>
            <li> Works just as well as the brand name but costs a lot less.</li>
            <li> They are almost identical to the originals at half the price.</li>
            <li> These work just as well as the Sonic Care brush heads and for less money.  </li>
            <li> : They don&#x27;t come with the little plastic protector cap to go over the brush head.</li>
            <li> May have a little softer brush fibers</li>
            <li> I was a little spectical</li>
            <li> the bristles seems stiff and quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (even clean bathrooms have filthy airborne germs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> small downside to using these</li>
            <li> Very stiff bristles.</li>
            <li> In less than a week, the bristles became too soft to use and the head separated from the base of the brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Ultimately they wouldn&#x27;t be bad if marketed as a kid product or indicating for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> These are much less expensive than the name brand toothbrush heads, but look almost identical.  </li>
            <li> Too noisy and too hard that it bleeds my gum so bad</li>
            <li> I looked a lot of places for replacement brush heads because Philips sonic care are so expensive</li>
            <li> Seems to be a high-quality replacement for the expensive name-brand brush heads.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with these at all...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, both my wife and I can feel a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> but boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> But worst of all, removing the broken base of the brush head from the brush body damaged the toothbrush connector</li>
            <li> Amazon should stop selling these worthless brush heads.</li>
            <li> Order the, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> This was without a doubt the worst purchase I ever made from Amazon.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These fit my Diamond Care perfectly. The bristles are much softer than the brush that came with my Sonicare, which suited me fine. I used to have to run hot water over the bristles in order to soften them up a bit before use, but that is not necessary with these BrushBrite heads.</li>
            <li> These are much more affordable as a replacement toothbrush head, they do the job, but the quality is not quite sonicare.  But for the savings, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> These really are indistinguishable from the name-brand brush heads, and they&#x27;re so much cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One small downside to using these: They don&#x27;t come with the little plastic protector cap to go over the brush head. I saved a couple of the caps from my old brush heads and just use those. Otherwise, these really do feel like the same as the name brand.</li>
            <li> Ever since my boyfriend and I moved in together we have tried to save money and now we share an electric tooth brush. We both have own brush head and we tried these yesterday and we both love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are soft&lt;br /&gt;Day to clip on</li>
            <li> These fit my toothbrush and have withstood the test of time. I have bought the name brand and even 1:10 heads don&#x27;t fit well. Tried all 3 for fit, and they work awesome. Save yourself some money and invest in as many packages you can afford</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference in stiffness between these and the OEM&#x27;s. I&#x27;m convinced and switching for good!</li>
            <li> Received product rather quickly, satisfied with the packaging.  Love the product compared to the Sonicare prices will definitely buy again in future.  Brushes are well made and have a snug fit on the handle  Switching for good, glad I ordered.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and undamaged.</li>
            <li> I like these toothbrush heads.  They work just great on my Sonic Toothbrush. I appreciate how it&#x27;s color coded.  Last&#x27;s about 3 months.  Great product.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Use it for a month. So far works well. No complains</li>
            <li> Wonderful price and does a wonderful job. May have a little softer brush fibers but I have a tender mouth. Will continue to purchase this brand.</li>
            <li> Was looking for new brush heads and saw this 3pk. Bought it and it works perfectly on my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> As a Sonicare tooth brush family we were shocked after receiving these to review because there better than we imagined. They actually compare to the Sonicare brand and fit the Sonicare toothbrush just right. There made of amazing quality and honestly I was so surprised to get these it made my week. They cost way less than the Sonicare brand and feel better on my teeth and gums. They do clean very well and get in between your teeth to give them a great clean. They don&#x27;t fall off the toothbrush handle either when the toothbrush is turned on making them that much better. I am going to be ordering a lot more now for they make owning a Sonicare toothbrush even better.</li>
            <li> Works very well. They attack easily to brush. Very good buy, These work just as good as the leading brand and last just as long too.</li>
            <li> Great price, feels the same as the name brand stuff. Why pay more?</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement for original brushes.  Fits my sonicare perfectly and I have had no issues.  Would definitely buy again over the originals that cost 3x-4x as much</li>
            <li> What great value these heads were!  They fit perfectly and seem to be of a high standard - really good!</li>
            <li> Smaller heads but great product</li>
            <li> I have the Philips sonic flex care toothbrush and the toothbrush replacement heads work great, they come with the colored rings and it said the bristles fade when they need to be replaced and they fit the Philips sonic care toothbrush perfectly and they are comparable to the Philips sonic care small brush, they are a  perfect size. I looked a lot of places for replacement brush heads because Philips sonic care are so expensive and I have bought generic in the past at Walmart and the brushes eventually fall off the toothbrush holder so they really are not very good. these work great, the brushes are not too soft or too hard and are so much cheaper , They don&#x27;t have the plastic travel caps on the toothbrush so I kept the ones I had from my last toothbrushes and they fit perfect I will keep buying these they are a great value and work just as good as Philips sonic care replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my brush. This was my fault.</li>
            <li> After using it about a month, I start to see significant wear on the brush. I would say it needs replacement 2x sooner than the OEM but for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I will never buy Sonicare brand brush heads again - only these. These heads fit my Philips Sonicare HX6211/30 perfectly and are much better than expected for the price. I am impressed by these and was pleasantly surprised in their quality.</li>
            <li> Really great comparable to the Sonic Brushes but a generic version to be honest can&#x27;t tell any difference why not buy these for half the price and get 3 in a pack!!! Recommend this for anyone who has these brushes!!!</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the brand name but costs a lot less.</li>
            <li> Many people mentioned these being a lot softer than the name brand sonicare heads but I actually prefer these and I don&#x27;t find them to be too soft at all.  One downside is the hygiene cover doesn&#x27;t fit these heads I just bought a cheap plastic one to cover it.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement brush heads for my toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend. Would never pay oem again</li>
            <li> 2 stars for value.  Also, fits the unit easily and has color coding (for spouses to easily distinguish whose brush belongs to whom)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not come with a cap for the brush and your old caps do not fit and only loosely cover it (even clean bathrooms have filthy airborne germs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon first use, it does not feel very stiff, they are very flexible brush heads (feel the same as name brand brush heads after about 2 months of use).</li>
            <li> Love these ! Exactly what I needed for a 1/3 of price. Shipping was fast!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how these generic replacements would work.  It turns out that are nearly identical and at a much better price. I&#x27;m very glad that I tried them and I would definitely buy these replacement heads again. The only difference that I have found is that the little toothbrush cover doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> These are super affordable and seem to work every bit as well as the name brand brushes. We plan on buying these again and again.</li>
            <li> BrushBrite Premium Replacement Brush Heads work just as effectively as Sonicare&#x27;s replacement brush heads, but they cost one-third the price of Sonicare&#x27;s heads.  They are packaged as a set of three and are shipped quickly. Just take the replacement head and snap it onto your electric toothbrush and enjoy. The bristles do not fall out; you won&#x27;t find bristles in your mouth. And these replacement heads last just as long as the other more expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried. I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  I was offered this product at a promotional price to share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great value. Allows me to replace my tooth brush every month,without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price. Very satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> Great alternative at a great price!</li>
            <li> The product was good, but I the brush was softer than original</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! These replacement heads are wonderful. They fit perfect and are extremely comfortable on your teeth. I was a little spectical but boy was I wrong! An absolute great value! I will be reordering when it is time to replace.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant given how much cheaper these heads are from the Phillips brand but they&#x27;ve held up great and I will buy them as a long as they make them!</li>
            <li> Inexpensive brush replacements that work just as well as the higher priced. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase anything else.&lt;br /&gt;Love them...</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t know till I see the dentist, but these seem to work and feel just like the OEM brushes. Way cheaper. :-)</li>
            <li> They go soft extremely quickly and brushing seemed to become ineffective.</li>
            <li> Wow!  These brushes fit my Sonicare perfectly.  I&#x27;m so glad I read the reviews and ordered them instead of paying the ridiculous price for the name brand brushes.  Order the, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Seems to be a high-quality replacement for the expensive name-brand brush heads. So far, they&#x27;re working well.</li>
            <li> So far, they work great.  These are much less expensive than the name brand toothbrush heads, but look almost identical.  They do no come with a plastic cap to cover the brush head, though I imagine the one I have from Sonicare will fit.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly on my Sonicare, bristles feel good and leave a nice clean feeling</li>
            <li> These replacement heads fit and perform exactly as the original Sonicare ones. They are not for the &amp;#34;E&amp;#34; series, so do note that. These are so much more affordable, and work as well as the brand name. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and price! I will buy this one from now on for my sonicare! Thank you for such great item!&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this for free for the purpose of reviewing honestly. My opinions are my own and are not influenced in any way.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong, I am someone who likes a new toothbrush every couple of weeks and for the price this makes it worth it!</li>
            <li> Worked for about two days and completely came loose and doesn&#x27;t even fit with the sonicare now. Would not buy these</li>
            <li> Looks and feels like the original.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how good the quality of the toothbrush heads were because of the cheap price.  They are very durable and last a long time.  They are a great replacement brushhead competitor.</li>
            <li> great feel to these and extremely long lasting.  I definitely will be using these as a replacement to the much more expensive 1st party toothbrush heads form phillips.</li>
            <li> Too noisy and too hard that it bleeds my gum so bad</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the Philips brand. They fit perfectly and feel the same.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to the expensive sonic toothbrush refills.  These work well for my sonic care elite toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These heads works great with my Sonicare Toothbrush. I love them.</li>
            <li> Great and cheap alternative to the OEM Brush heads. I would recommend these to anyone with a sonicare brush</li>
            <li> Pretty good generic version. Fits well and feels good on teeth.</li>
            <li> Wonderful replacement heads. They fit perfectly !</li>
            <li> Perfect fit and quality</li>
            <li> Very good toothbrush heads!  I bought thses for my Sonicare toothbrush and not only do they fit perfectly, but they feel just as clean as the Sonicare toothbrush heads that I used to use, but at a fraction of the cost!  I&#x27;m really happy with this product and would recommend them to anyone looking for some replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with these at all...Some say they&#x27;re not as stiff as the Sonicare, but I don&#x27;t notice a real difference.</li>
            <li> work great and they do fit perfectly</li>
            <li> These are awesome. They fit the  OralB (type3709), and I didn&#x27;t even expect it to! It cleans very well &amp; they are a great price. I was very impressed!</li>
            <li> These work perfect, arrived fast, and the price is awesome!!! Very satisfied :)</li>
            <li> Good price &amp; work well.</li>
            <li> Good brushes, great price.</li>
            <li> Took a leap and tried the knock-offs... don&#x27;t miss the more expensive factory replacements at all. I&#x27;ve only used these for about a month so I&#x27;m not certain they will last as long but even if they last only half as long they will have been well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Fits on head like the original brushes. Seems to have just a bit softer bristles, but cleans equally as well as original.  In my opinion the OEM heads are over priced, and should be priced like these. Only thing I have to do now for a complete review is see how long they last. Right now it looks like these will be my heads.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet. But I am displeased that these brush heads are about 25% larger than the brush head that came with my Sonicare Series 2. They do fit the model just fine, though, and the price is great.</li>
            <li> These work just as well as the name brand</li>
            <li> These work just ad well as the sonicare brand at a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> I try this product brushbrite premium replacement brush heads because it product description is set of 3 brush and it is easy to use . As what can i say this product is good quality even it is not as good in original but it really went work well. I try this how many time and it is amazing , because I had my teeth problem regarding plague but i noticed it removes lightly.Happy and satisfied the product. I got this in good price discount product promotions  in return of product reviews which is unbiased and honest .</li>
            <li> These fit OK but definitely leave a gap between the head and the handle.  They are significantly softer than the original heads, so much so that I&#x27;ve opted not to use them.  If you are looking for a very soft head, I suppose you would like these.</li>
            <li> These are not quite the same as the Philips brush heads. I will go back to paying full price :(</li>
            <li> Excellent quality.  Just as good as the originals.</li>
            <li> Fit right on the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Way too soft. Not even close to Sonicare brand heads what so ever. Do not buy this product!</li>
            <li> so far so good but not as good as the  original. ok for the price</li>
            <li> Brush heads fits the Philips Sonicare brush handles well, but does not work as well due to the lower quality bristles. You do not get the dentist feeling clean as the stock Sonicare brush heads, but it&#x27;s way better than using manual brushes. Great for those on a budget or not able to find the regular Sonicare brushes on sale (discount).</li>
            <li> I thought I would give it a shot since this product is so much cheaper than the Sonicare refills. I really wish it cleaned as well. Unfortunately, both my wife and I can feel a noticeable difference. I will go with the Original in the future since it is cheaper than dental work..</li>
            <li> Seem just as good as the original Philips heads.</li>
            <li> These work really well and are much cheaper than the name brand. I even think they last longer</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> Works great and much less expensive than name brand replacements.</li>
            <li> Sorry. I just can&#x27;t recommend these. They are just a cheap generic version. I used one and found myself brushing my teeth easily twice as long to just to get them as clean as the name brand version. They will do the job, but only with more brushing time.</li>
            <li> Great product and much less expensive than buying at the store. I will be purchasing these again when it&#x27;s time to replace!!</li>
            <li> If you are like me, you always cringe when you have to buy replacement heads for your sonic toothbrush. I can&#x27;t believe how well these work and how much cheaper they are than the name brand ones. My teeth still feel just as clean and my wallet feels much fatter. I will never buy name brand toothbrush heads again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> These generic Sonicare heads work just great. Other generics have had a loose fit and you can see where they are not holding up well. These seem to fit better and last longer. Out of the generics I have used, these are the closest to the original and at a much lower cost.</li>
            <li> Like the original ones</li>
            <li> These are awesome--just like the Sonicare ones for a fraction of the price. I&#x27;ve been using mine for about month. Even if these don&#x27;t last as long as the Sonicare ones, I still feel like it&#x27;s a bargain. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> A+ great quality use it everyday so convenient</li>
            <li> My impression, this product was meant to be a substitute for the OEM replacement heads. The two common themes in reviews I read about other products were (1) proper fit of the head and (2) bristle quality. I own the Flexcare Platinum (HX9140) and the fit was great! Held securely and did not create any usual noises. The bristles however were extremely soft. Everyone&#x27;s sensitivity level is different so trying to add a somewhat universal understand, they were the texture of an infant hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately they wouldn&#x27;t be bad if marketed as a kid product or indicating for sensitive gums. But without such disclaimers, I do not believe it did what I expected, hence the 2 stars. Hope this is useful.</li>
            <li> Cheaper alternative to the original brush heads. My only comment is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the OEM but that&#x27;s okay with me. I can change my brush heads more often, more sanitary to do that anyway.</li>
            <li> They are great, exactly as described.</li>
            <li> These replacements were the perfect fit and work great. They are almost identical to the originals at half the price. I would buy again!!</li>
            <li> These fit my Sonicare toothbrush perfectly. I&#x27;d read reviews stating that off brand replacement heads were extra noisy, but I&#x27;ve noticed nothing out of the ordinary. My only lament would be that they don&#x27;t come with a little plastic cover for the head (and the cover for the brand name ones is too big- doesn&#x27;t click to attach on- for these), but for the price, I figure beggars can&#x27;t be choosers!</li>
            <li> I am surprised, these are excellent quality, a great value too.  I tried the brush out today, fits perfectly on my handle, just like the original  and a great OEM brush alternative, I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> These were purchased for a Sonicare Flexcare Platinum.  They work great.  They are a bit softer than the one that came with the brush, but my teeth still feel nice and smooth, without damaging my gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying these instead of the Sonicare ones for now on.  This seem maybe a bit more stiff than the Sonicare ones which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Will do in a tight...will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Terrible. Bristles falling out on first use. Very stiff bristles.</li>
            <li> Great price and quality to boot!</li>
            <li> Great price on replacement heads. Work well!</li>
            <li> These work just as well as the Sonic Care brush heads and for less money.  Very happy with them!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t meet expectations as bristles didn&#x27;t hold up as they should.  I thought the second replacement head might perform better but it didn&#x27;t and I had to replace both heads after only one month&#x27;s use when you are supposed to get three months.  As far as I am concerned BrushBrite Replacement Heads are junk and I will not buy them again!</li>
            <li> Great price, feels the same as the name brand stuff. Why pay more?</li>
            <li> I would like if the bristles were more firm.</li>
            <li> Pretty close to the Original.  These work really well.  I have been using for 2 weeks now with no issues.  the bristles seems stiff and quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there is a slight odor the next morning but after 4 uses it went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think  its worth the money</li>
            <li> This is the BEST Brand! Wouldn&#x27;t use another -- Works great and so glad I ordered. Fast shipping too !</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy these!  These cheap, in every sense of the word, brush heads turned out to be very expensive.  In less than a week, the bristles became too soft to use and the head separated from the base of the brush.  But worst of all, removing the broken base of the brush head from the brush body damaged the toothbrush connector so it no longer worked well - even with bona fide sonicare brush heads.  So I had to buy a new toothbrush!  This was without a doubt the worst purchase I ever made from Amazon.  Amazon should stop selling these worthless brush heads.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do the job. Bite the bullet and buy the original Philips toothbrushe heads.</li>
            <li> Arrived well packaged and exactly as expected. Thanks!</li>
            <li> These things work great. I think they wear out a little quicker than pricier options, but they&#x27;re an incredible value regardless.</li>
            <li> They fit on the toothbrush fine, but they don&#x27;t fit on the holder. Since my wife &amp; I both use the toothbrush we take off the heads to store on holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a single user and never take the brush head off, you&#x27;ll be fine...just wanted to give those that do a warning.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell a difference from the originals that came with the sonicare. These were a great way to save some money on replacements and I plan on buying again.</li>
            <li> If you are like me, you always cringe when you have to buy replacement heads for your sonic toothbrush. I can&#x27;t believe how well these work and how much cheaper they are than the name brand ones. My teeth still feel just as clean and my wallet feels much fatter. I will never buy name brand toothbrush heads again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price! Will def order these again and again.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the real thing but quite a lot cheaper.  I have braces now and the sharp edges damage brushes fairly quickly.  The real brushes are so expensive I decided to try these.  They are OK but not the same.  The brushes spread a little more and seem to loose stiffness sooner.  But when I have to replace them every 2-3 weeks, these are a much better value</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and I as we both have Sonicare brushes (though different models). It fits well on both and feels just as good as the official ones.</li>
            <li> great ! almost better than original :_)</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly and cost half of what the sonicare replacements cost.  Definite good buy</li>
            <li> Good quality, happy with product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever pay $30 for the sonicare brush heads again! This is a great product! Fits well with my Flex Sonicare toothbrush. Has the same feel when I brush and its even a bigger head than the Sonicare ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hardly ever leave customer feedback, but this was too good of savings not to share with anyone who&#x27;s looking for a solid product!!</li>
            <li> Equal quality as the real ones. Would definitely recommend.</li>
