            <li>I am so happy to find this because my friends would be like why is your head so bumpy and don&#x27;t you have face wash?</li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>Everything feels and smells great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s honestly the best I have found!!</li>
            <li>The AcneFree treatment system comes with great products that help your skin.</li>
            <li>His skin looks really great and his confidence has grown.</li>
            <li>this time, not at all lol maybe they changed the ingredients?</li>
            <li>I am really happy I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Acnefree severe really is great and works well</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Great products.</li>
            <li>My daughter is so happy and confident now!!</li>
            <li>Better yet, it&#x27;s one of the cheapest acne systems out there!!</li>
            <li>I love it, and you will too!!</li>
            <li>The Retinol cream is viscous, but it blends into the skin very nicely.</li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;m happy to say that AcneFree Severe has done and is continuing to do an amazing job!  </li>
            <li>The Mask is amazing!</li>
            <li>As a side note I have started using Lerosett, an organic clay mask/face wash skin care line and let me tell you it is amazing!</li>
            <li>It is working amazingly well!</li>
            <li>So I hung in there with it, and now, after about 6 weeks of using the product, MY SKIN LOOKS AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Truthfully, it&#x27;s the best over-the-counter acne treatment Ive used to date.</li>
            <li>The best part about it is you can wear the repair lotion all day without ever being able to see it.</li>
            <li>But, as I said, you need to make it part of your healthy lifestyle for the best results.</li>
            <li>great shipping time and good tracking.</li>
            <li>I know most benzyl peroxide treatments work best for oily</li>
            <li>My beautiful skin is infested with cysts and almost any kind of acne that exists, I would all bouquet of acne</li>
            <li>Good stuff just remember to moisturize</li>
            <li>and you should be good to go.</li>
            <li>but all in all this product worked good for me.</li>
            <li>Good price, and</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see if that turns out to be a good thing or not.     </li>
            <li>To be fair, I tried it for a month.  </li>
            <li>I counter acted this with stopping the treatment for two days and used a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>On Amazon it was listed in stock, so it was surprising when I received the email about it being delayed.</li>
            <li>It got to the point where the antibiotics were also killing my good bacteria</li>
            <li>So how good was it?      </li>
            <li>My doctor has prescribed oral antibiotics which did show some improvement but not for a good stretch of time.</li>
            <li>a good non-comedogenic foundation (I like</li>
            <li>feels good</li>
            <li>And I increase my consumption of good fat, protein.</li>
            <li>Good seller,  no problem at all</li>
            <li>It works really good.</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>This acne system works fairly well.</li>
            <li>I started the product during PMS (which may or may not have been a good idea).</li>
            <li>10% is very potent as another reviewer already stated.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and as it says its better than proactiv.</li>
            <li>Yes I love this product , been using this for months and have gotten great results.</li>
            <li>I honestly picked it out of all the products because it was in a bright package and on sale.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased by this product.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff and the price is GREAT</li>
            <li>They are fast at shipping, always on time, quality is always good, you get what you pay for, and the price is always the best.</li>
            <li>Love my skin!</li>
            <li>I love Avacados!    </li>
            <li>Worked wonders that many others could not do!  </li>
            <li>Make sure you use the Toner and the Moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still breaking out, and even more of my face is covered with acne!</li>
            <li>love this kit!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>So glad i found this product!</li>
            <li>I have tried Pro-Active, for me, this works MUCH better !</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;ll have to cover the redness with make-up, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore and looks 75% better!...</li>
            <li>This is a great product I strongly suggest it.</li>
            <li>This product was an amazing buy for its price.</li>
            <li>Step 4 - Skin feels amazing after waking up.</li>
            <li>and I have seen an amazing improvement.</li>
            <li>Amazing results, at that.</li>
            <li>This product was simply amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazingly, I did not find this line to be drying at all</li>
            <li>My skin wasn&#x27;t working well with salicylic acid, so I purchased the AcneeFree treatment system with benzoyl peroxide and it works amazing.</li>
            <li>Its AMAZING</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I dont leave comments often but after one week my skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li>So why is this so amazing?</li>
            <li>and it has worked out amazingly</li>
            <li>After using this for three Weeks the results where amazing but still not what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I was able to put up with the roller-coaster success of MaxClarity because sometimes I would have perfect skin that would boost my confidence...</li>
            <li>but this product really is the best...</li>
            <li>it dosn&#x27;t hurt to make your own diary and mark your own findings.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own  </li>
            <li>I have noticed with this product that my face cleared up nicely.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>so I cleanse and tone with the acnefree product in the morning and use my own moisturizer and then at night I cleanse, tone, and put the lotion on.  </li>
            <li>You can always skip a day of the medicated lotions and it&#x27;s still effective...</li>
            <li>It can heal any kind of acne.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with my skin, it&#x27;s even better now than it was before I started breaking out.  </li>
            <li>Keep lip balm handy as it dries out your lips too.  </li>
            <li>my God, I&#x27;ve got to get the doctor for this\\&quot;\\&quot; -kind of skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried every kind of product out there including both doctor-prescribed and over-the-counter.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>I honestly couldn&#x27;t believe it....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle, and it&#x27;s not as good as combining a sulfer wash with retin-a and benzoyl peroxide - but my skin looks better than it has in awhile.</li>
            <li>This acne kit effectively reduces severe acne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alright, it does work but not that effectively.</li>
            <li>I received this product quickly and in great condition.</li>
            <li>As someone who has been struggling with acne for years and wondering why I&#x27;m not the lucky girl that has pimple free skin with no effort, I hope this product works!!!    </li>
            <li>One absolute recommendation when using this product is to use a VERY GOOD moisturizer day and night.</li>
            <li>U can damp your face and wipe with the moist towelettes and feel real clean ..</li>
            <li>I have to say, so far, it seems awesome!!!</li>
            <li>So far very happy with the immediate results!</li>
            <li>(makeup wouldn&#x27;t cover it the first day I got the blemish, the day after I started using the Severe kit, makeup covered it beautifully).  </li>
            <li>very happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>Works better than Proactiv and the value is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is probably the most effective thing I&#x27;ve tried yet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got adult onset, and after being off Rx acne meds for a couple years this is the best OTC stuff I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Pro-Active may cost more, but it is much more effective on my skin.  </li>
            <li>daily.(Tastes great hot or</li>
            <li>I bought this product for the first time ever and it worked great -  </li>
            <li>If you have skin like mine, you know what a huge, amazing thing this is.     </li>
            <li>I get more compliments on my skin ..</li>
            <li>One day, I came across this product and decided to give it a try since it advertised that it was \\&quot;Better than Proactiv\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>so i made sure to moisturize them all throughout the day.</li>
            <li>acnefree may be just what you&#x27;re looking for :)</li>
            <li>I have had acne since I was 12, although I let it go untreated most of that time.</li>
            <li>so I felt confident I could handle an over the counter severe acne treatment kit.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still using it 2 years after I found it :)</li>
            <li>I will make sure to write another review in a couple weeks to document the affectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li>This allows me to skip the 10 minute waiting time after application of Step 2, and it seems to be helping my skin along even more.</li>
            <li>:)    </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I came across this product at Target and decided to try it (for 1/3 the price of ProActiv) and I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I can almost tell, I used the Step 3 lotion more than what I should.</li>
            <li>My skin looks the best it has ever looked in my entire life.</li>
            <li>its 3.5% sulfur and copper, Better than the proactiv Mask</li>
            <li>THIS STUFF IS POTENT.</li>
            <li>I tried so many acne systems over 9 years</li>
            <li>Was glad for that tip and thought I&#x27;d share.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s hope it doesn&#x27;t just \\&quot;re-transfer\\&quot; like this one did!:)</li>
            <li>I researched many products and decided to give this a try....</li>
            <li>I am hoping that this combination will work better for me.     </li>
            <li>product seems to be more of a retroactive treatment than preventative, because I am still getting a pimple or blemish here and there, but it clears them up</li>
            <li>Already my face is looking and feeling better.</li>
            <li>My face never got better.  </li>
            <li>but instead I have more acne.  </li>
            <li>I have used Proactiv for over a year and still had blemishes, with Acne Free my face cleared up in two weeks!</li>
            <li>and you will be touching your face again.</li>
            <li>Also, be sure to wash your face of the benzyl peroxide lotion before bed</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I am severely allergic to most soaps and most acne products</li>
            <li>and I noticed my face is already looking better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, I&#x27;m not saying Proactiv doesn&#x27;t work--it does for some people, I&#x27;m sure.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.     </li>
            <li>This lotion is not oily whatsoever and really does a great job at fixing the moisture balance without causing a breakout like most face lotions I have used.          </li>
            <li>and i see a lot of reviews saying that it clears up MOST acne in 1-3 days</li>
            <li>For the most part, it has stopped breakouts from emerging.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s helped quite a bit. :)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>None of the products irritated my skin any more than it already was.</li>
            <li>For some reason, I seem to use more of those two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My breakouts would mostly be on my cheeks, chin, forehead and around the edges of my nose.  </li>
            <li>My family knew too many people that were on Accutane that had issues with it</li>
            <li>There was no makeup or magic solution to fix this problem.  </li>
            <li>I love how this system has 4 separate parts that you can use whenever you want.  </li>
            <li>Words truly can&#x27;t explain how satisfied I am about this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this system.</li>
            <li>But overall Iam very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>plus this one smells better.</li>
            <li>you also get more with this product than proactiv.</li>
            <li>Used it for 7 days, after the 7 days, my acne is clear,and it made my skin real smooth, But i think too smooth.</li>
            <li>Also, make sure your skin condition is indeed severe; that may be why it didn&#x27;t work so well for me.</li>
            <li>Better than proactiv because you wont keep getting billed every month, you can order it when you need.</li>
            <li>The four-step process is simple to follow and feels excellent on my face.  </li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>Within a couple of weeks my skin even became smoother, softer, and more even-toned.  </li>
            <li>LOVELY.</li>
            <li>I saw the acnefree severe product at Target and thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try one more product.  </li>
            <li>I have been having problems with acne, mostly my cheeks and chin area, after stopping birth control age 28.  </li>
            <li>Also, be sure to apply sparingly.  </li>
            <li>husband noticed my face looked better in just one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Nothing worked better than this.</li>
            <li>i have even tried the milder version of the acne free system and didn&#x27;t have as good results as i get with the severe acne free system.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Okay</li>
            <li>I tried over the counter treatments i tried spot treatments and though they they vanish SOME pimples more and more and more just kept appearing</li>
            <li>SURE YOU READ THE DIRECTIONS.</li>
            <li>Glad she didnt though,</li>
            <li>I love the pH toner</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much better than the proactiv one.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and then it burned and it broke out even more.</li>
            <li>i picked this product up at wal mart for cheap and just like all acne treatments they clame them to be the miricle cure!</li>
            <li>love how the retinol smooths your skin at night and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed the more I put on, the clearer my skin is in the morning.  </li>
            <li>and after that you&#x27;ll be glad you stuck to it.  </li>
            <li>So we continue our search for a better product, for him anyways.</li>
            <li>sure if the items were expired,</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll be sticking to this for a while. :)</li>
            <li>(side note do not use a lot of this more cream</li>
            <li>This works better for me than the stuff I was getting from the doctors.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference - as soon as one would go away, two more would pop up.  </li>
            <li>and I figured if I was pleased, why rock the boat?  </li>
            <li>- I was a bit concerned after switching from ProActiv to AcneFree because I felt the AcneFree wash did not have as many grains as the ProActiv and</li>
            <li>was concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t work as well - it works BETTER.  </li>
            <li>- AcneFree didn&#x27;t come with the many instructions provided by ProActiv.  </li>
            <li>I wonder if those who have had issues with this product drying their skin out are using more than that?  </li>
            <li>and i really love this product.</li>
            <li>but it looks and feels better too.</li>
            <li>and you need to use it constantly and be patient to get the best results!.</li>
            <li>I love this product.    </li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>but AcneFree products just work better.</li>
            <li>Like I said, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>worked ok for about 3 days &amp; after that no difference</li>
            <li>I have so much more confidence now...</li>
            <li>you will be ecstatic with your results! :)</li>
            <li>Many dermatologists have recommended Accutane, but that is where I drew the line - too risky and requires blood draws every 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I tried many treatments, with no results.</li>
            <li>Not prefect, if you don&#x27;t do everything, but still better than the rest if your inconsistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>But if you have so many pimples, maybe the lotion makes sense.</li>
            <li>/ forehead a lot more</li>
            <li>You have been warned. :)</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using this acne treatment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much more affordable and comes with the 4th product.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to always use sunscreen with either this stuff or with Proactive.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend using 2 to 3 times a week in order to get the best results.</li>
            <li>whatever it is, made me breakout even more.</li>
            <li>I have been acne free for 4 years now!</li>
            <li>It seems like this stuff works better than proactiv for acne.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>and she says it really works great.</li>
            <li>:  )  hope the pics help</li>
            <li>I could see more skin than redness on his face.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t Wait to go to the concert now :)</li>
            <li>I Love It!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>And more - they create problems.</li>
            <li>and my skin is covergirl commercial flawless.</li>
            <li>My face feels a lot better, but sometimes I look in the mirror</li>
            <li>Okay It DIDNT Stop ME From BREAKING Out</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of things for cystic acne and this product has worked faster and shown more results than any nonprescription item I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>I am very excited to have found this product</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Good product works very fast, and better than proactive.</li>
            <li>I have noticed my skin is  a lot smoother and is very effective on picking up dead skin that causes the skin to feel smoother which is always a good thing you want for you skin and any acne products you use!</li>
            <li>The texture is nice when going on- creamy and cool.</li>
            <li>and I am excited again!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy to say that this Severe Acne Free System definitely works, my skin is clearer than ever.</li>
            <li>Clean your pillow cases as often as you can!</li>
            <li>We had tried so many other  products, including ProActive, and this system is the best.</li>
            <li>so far I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li>So far I am a happy customer.    </li>
            <li>Just invest in some great moisturizer if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I found what worked best for me was to purchase the strongest products I could find in the stores, but it never REALLY cleared up my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>ok, i must warn you that i may sound like an infomercial, but i am hooked on this product for my acne</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Acne Free and would recommend it to anyone who is suffering with acne or break outs.</li>
            <li>I almost spent $80.00 on the Clinique Acne Solutions and am happy I tried this before hand!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very happy with this, most products I use work for a short time, and then my skin wins the battle with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would still absolutely suggest using a good moisturizer morning and night to combat the dryness of the benzyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re in your 30&#x27;s and are STILL dealing with acne, you start to wish for wrinkles, because who has wrinkles and acne, right?!?!</li>
            <li>The first 1-5 days more pimples came out from the woodwork, there were all over my face!</li>
            <li>Pros: Minimizes Pores, Easy To Use    Cons:</li>
            <li>Not dryness, and my acne was clearing up very quickly.       </li>
            <li>began using this product because my brother (who also has good skin) was raving about how this product heals his blemishes and keeps his skin healthy and clear.  </li>
            <li>People noticed a difference in my acne very quickly.</li>
            <li>May be too strong for some peoples skin</li>
            <li>This stuff is strong as advertised.</li>
            <li>This won&#x27;t always work, but it should help steer you in the right direction, and sometimes give you much better information than a dermatologist (for free!).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li>I would honestly call it a miracle product because it&#x27;s ridiculous how awesome it works.  </li>
            <li>She tried the cleanser before and it is working fine</li>
            <li>my skin is fine, no rashes or irritation.</li>
            <li>After that experience I donated the rest to  my best friend and she began to get black spots on her face also.</li>
            <li>which seemed to have pretty good reviews &amp; thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>but it was fine nonetheless.</li>
            <li>I think this stuff really kills acne bacteria and most of the time prevents breakouts from attacking again!  </li>
            <li>It is extremely potent and after 5 days of use my skin&#x27;s texture has completely changes and not for the better!</li>
            <li>, I just easily worked it out by following the instructions on how to use the product plus using some good day/night moisturizers by The Body Shop (I love their products).  </li>
            <li>Huge price difference.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best my skin has ever looked in my adult life.  </li>
            <li>and I am noticing a huge difference in my Acne.  </li>
            <li>and I have noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Within 4 days I noticed a huge difference in the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li>After a week of using the product, I noticed a HUGE difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I like the acne free wipes to lo</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I do notice it keeps my skin supple and more colorful.</li>
            <li>I have learned how much my skin needs and how to effectively apply my products overtime.</li>
            <li>Sure, maybe it won&#x27;t work for everybody/every skin type, but it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li>Overall - I am happy with this product and will continue to use it...</li>
            <li>I love how non-abrasive the wash is, it leaves my skin feeling fresh and</li>
            <li>I have been using Acne Free Sever for about 8-12 months now and it has proven to work well for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Acne Free Severe for about 6 weeks now and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li>Before using Acne Free it seemed like each morning</li>
            <li>Then I found Acne Free Severe Treatment.</li>
            <li>Now I incorporate oil free moisturizer in the morning.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s available at the store...</li>
            <li>Been using this product for a few week and my face looks its best in years.</li>
            <li>Before using Severe Acne Free, I used to go to a dermatologist because of never ending acne.</li>
            <li>My mom read reviews for Severe Acne Free and was convinced it would help, so we found a set at Walmart for $21.87.</li>
            <li>I got and used Severe Acne Free System on 12/30 [evening treatment]</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I started using an oil free, fragrance free moisturizer (olay regenerist), and that cleared everything up.     </li>
            <li>I learned that one of the recommended treatments by dermatologists is to use Retin A, which is a primary ingredient (retinol) in the Acne Free Severe Treatment.</li>
            <li>i tried the acne free severe treatment</li>
            <li>so I am really happy I found a product that I use and that actually works.</li>
            <li>It is not visibly noticeable, but if you apply makeup soon after...your makeup will not go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>The size and redness of the pimple is greatly reduced the next morning.     </li>
            <li>i started using acne free severe for 4 days</li>
            <li>The breakouts I had started to disappear and they weren&#x27;t as red or inflamed either; this kit did a great job of soothing them.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, it kept my face moisturized and feeling smooth</li>
            <li>kept using it and got fantastic results.  </li>
            <li>Here are the three products: Yogi Skin DeTox Tea, Acne Free Maximum Strength, and the 0.5mm MT Skin Roller.</li>
            <li>the Maximum Strength Acne Free system morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>a scent/dye free laundry detergent (I like All Free and Clear)&lt;br /&gt;-wash</li>
            <li>If I am out of toner, I will use witch hazel in its place (the primary ingredient in the AF toner), while I am finishing up the others and preparing to order another kit.</li>
            <li>This was way more effective than Proactiv for me... and way more affordable (especially if you order on amazon and not in supermarkets where it&#x27;s triple the price!).</li>
            <li>overall happy with this product, would recommend.</li>
            <li>The 24 acne free system did not work for me like I would have hoped.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve landed on this page, you are fortunate.  </li>
            <li>until I read the reviews for Acne Free Severe.  </li>
            <li>so I tried Acne Free.</li>
            <li>I USE IT BEFORE USING THE ACNE FREE CLEANSER.</li>
            <li>the product being realtivly cheap, I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>LIGHTLY wash your face and rub in Step 1.  </li>
            <li>I run across Acne Free</li>
            <li>I am almost on my 3rd week of using this product, it has greatly improved some of the areas on my face.</li>
            <li>Use everything else as directed and add terminator 10 (an acne cream distributed by acne free).</li>
            <li>To curb that I bought some cheap non oil bassed lotion from target and cacked on my face at night before I went to bed.</li>
            <li>I hope this helps, and good luck to clear skin.</li>
            <li>Right now, I am trying Proactiv, and just by comparing both system&#x27;s ingredients I have a feeling that their \\&quot;Better than  </li>
            <li>so much for that!!!</li>
            <li>Overall, a very effective acne kit.</li>
            <li>The first thing i noticed that made it awesome was that a few hours after i used it, my skin just felt better...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done Clinique&#x27;s 3 step system, neutrogena, clearasil, noxema, and the original Acne free.  </li>
            <li>So far Im pretty happy with the results</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly mind because the towels I use for drying my face aren&#x27;t my &#x27;nice&#x27; towels, but this is something to remember.  </li>
            <li>And on a side not the L&#x27;oreal youth code dark spot corrector works incredible well with acne free.</li>
            <li>Poppy Soap makes an amazing line (her tea tree oil bar is especially nice for acne-prone skin) of natural, organic bars that contain essential oils and gentle ingredients.</li>
            <li>So I haven&#x27;t used the entire system but the spot treatment is amazing!</li>
            <li>I found this product because I was looking for a wallet friendly alternative to controlling acne besides accutane or seeing a dermatologist.</li>
            <li>Okay, first of...</li>
            <li>For the first time in years, my skin looks healthy and glowing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is EXTREMELY potent and you will feel it after the first application.     </li>
            <li>What I have noticed is the discoloration from past acne flareups seems to be fading which I am very happy about.    </li>
            <li>Sounds familiar?</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t tell you how excited I am about this product.  </li>
            <li>and this stuff is worth trying!</li>
            <li>I was ecstatic the after just 24 hours of use, all of my breakout significantly diminished</li>
            <li>I tried ProActiv for a month and was pretty pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Once I started breaking out, I began using the original acnefree kit.</li>
            <li>There has been a significant improvement in my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>laugh lines easily if my skin is</li>
            <li>good thing is if you make regular and -light- applications of all the steps, it does well.  </li>
            <li>sure enough, it has been amazing.</li>
            <li>Nearly a month later, my skin looks practically flawless.</li>
            <li>In 3 days his face was clean.</li>
            <li>It works great with my skin and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li>My face never felt clean using this product and I continued to break out.</li>
            <li>/Having a clean diet  </li>
            <li>Keep a sanitary environment when rolling and clean your roller afterward.</li>
            <li>It will clean up and heal severe acne after using it about 4 to 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>The PH balancing part if this system is amazing and completely changed the the look and feel of my skin!</li>
            <li>Simply the best and within 10 days a major improvement.</li>
            <li>First of all I&#x27;d liked to state, I don&#x27;t really have severe acne</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with the product because I have seen an overall improvement in my skin</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I felt like I had to go out of my way to write a review - a first for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Just a quick clean up.</li>
            <li>and my skin really started to look better.</li>
            <li>But this seems true of all these types of products.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really help the acne, her skin looked way better before using this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this product so far, and will definetly continue to use it.</li>
            <li>after using this product my chin and cheeks are full of acne.  </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t see my dermatologist anymore, though he was sweet.</li>
            <li>it worked a full four months before losing its potency.</li>
            <li>I would use the spot treatment on existing treatments and I would have to say that is the only semi good product they offer: it dries up an existing pimple faster as opposed to using nothing at all.</li>
            <li>It is very cooling and refreshing.    </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good about this stuff.</li>
            <li>My face is REALLY looking better.  </li>
            <li>the ones I already had really havent gotten much better.</li>
            <li>I realized that my diet did not have enough good fat and protein to help the body to fight infection and cell regeneration.</li>
            <li>It seems to last a fair amount of time, maybe 2 months for one person, for the cost of it.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it is really a confidence booster.</li>
            <li>and I felt like the only thing it was good for was bleaching my towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also if you want to use the whole system as intended make sure you have cotton balls or pads for the toner (step 2).</li>
            <li>No bad smells either</li>
            <li>Been using the severe for about 12 months now, and have gotten about 2-4 pimples a MONTH, and not bad ones either.  </li>
            <li>Just be aware that it&#x27;s strong stuff that shouldn&#x27;t be underestimated.</li>
            <li>and I wanted a strong first attack.</li>
            <li>At first this stuff was kinda strong and irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li>You can buy this system in some places for $20 and for the price of an average dinner, drink, &amp; dessert at a decent restaurant you can get the best looking skin in your life!     </li>
            <li>After one month of using this special combination I barely noticed any kind of difference.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, I cant live without it!</li>
            <li>If something less potent can get me close to the results of the product, I&#x27;m going to use it as I&#x27;m sure it would be better for my skin.</li>
            <li>Face looks fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Wash itself feels mild, yet creamy, with some granules.</li>
            <li>Even if your skin isn&#x27;t responding to the product as quickly as others, it seems as if AcneFree takes time (</li>
            <li>I find that using the acne spot treatment at night instead of step 4 clears up any stray pimples extremely quickly (2-3 days).</li>
            <li>I started using this product 2 months ago when I was 5 months pregnant.</li>
            <li>The product says not to use while pregnant unless consulting physician</li>
            <li>I also own an exfoliator by St. Ives, a cucumber rejuvenating peel-off mask and use Neutrogena Acne free foundation when I put make up on (it has saylic acid in it, one of the low doses of acne treatment).</li>
            <li>You will see results with this quickly but it&#x27;s not the silver bullet for acne issues.</li>
            <li>I would say when using mild acne treatments i would get about a lot of pimples with a bunch of redness on my face.</li>
            <li>I use Step1 and 2 twice a day along eith the Terminator Belmish Spot Cream (which you may have to buy separately for like $5, but if you&#x27;re lucky and look around sometimes you can find it added on to the kit as a \\&quot;bonus\\&quot;, but beware...</li>
            <li>Ive had mild to severe acne since 13</li>
            <li>It is a good exfoliant for everyday use, but I would recommend to also exfoliate with something more abrasive, once a week.</li>
            <li>AcneFree Severe Acne Treatment has shown tremendous progress over the course of a couple months of faithful use.</li>
            <li>I do warn people to find an excellent non-comedogenic moisturizer and commitment to drinking tons of water prior to starting use of this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s honestly the only cheap thing that works so its kool ✔</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway I&#x27;m really happy with this and would recommend it to anyone, and am getting ready to buy my second kit.</li>
            <li>My friends and family commented on how quickly my acne went away.</li>
            <li>I saw results quickly.</li>
            <li>Your skin looks better, like, instantly, and it just keeps getting better.</li>
            <li>I believe Step 2 is what contributes to most of the dryness because it&#x27;s a toner with alcohol as one of the main ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have had acne for over a decade and this product has cleared my skin quickly.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to anyone seeking to keep their skin healthy and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product, it gives the same feeling as proactiv in which your skin becomes smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>normally don&#x27;t have the patience for a beauty regime that involves more than a couple of products</li>
            <li>The very first week I used this I noticed results.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m going to try switching over to the regular acne free kit for maintenance to be sure my skin doesn&#x27;t somehow get \\&quot;used\\&quot; to the acne free severe.</li>
            <li>So far, it works better than the original.  </li>
            <li>So whether you are using the Severe, Original, or Sensitive AcneFree, make sure you are not overdoing the lotion because this is your culprit to the skin dryness.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, this product maintains my clear skin perfectly!</li>
            <li>My skin is clear, it&#x27;s not as oily, I actually have people tell me how good my skin looks!  </li>
            <li>No unpleasant scent, whatsoever.    </li>
            <li>A cysteine(Lef.org, as the powder is very fine that can dissolve in water completely), vitamin C powder, sea salt in some water.</li>
            <li>however, after i started my new job, i was under a lot more stress.</li>
            <li>MaxClarity made my skin soft, and at some points I was completely pimple-free, it was amazing!</li>
            <li>My face is much clearer and I have much more confidence because I know the regime will provide consistent results.</li>
            <li>It is a long a process and my skin needs so many products to stay healthy and not have a break out...</li>
            <li>It is slightly drying, but just use a good moisturizer once a day and you will be fine.</li>
            <li>I figured my only true way out was to grow out of it or get some kind of laser skin treatment.      </li>
            <li>, I love that you can buy this in pretty much any Walgreens and Walmart</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recomend that everyone try it since it is very affordable and easy to find in the drug stores.  </li>
            <li>The clearing doesn&#x27;t happen overnight, but it can significantly help your skin in the first couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>Even the Skin Dr products were not that fast!!</li>
            <li>I now have deep scars from those humongous pimples that I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten had I not used acne free!!</li>
            <li>When I first started using the original AcneFree, I did all 3 steps every morning and every night...</li>
            <li>This all happened during that first week, so be patient!)</li>
            <li>and I saw results first thing in the morning!</li>
            <li>thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>The companies selling on Amazon seem to have higher prices for this item, so you may be able to find a better value at your local supermarket.</li>
            <li>Also, if you have sensitive skin I suggest you go with something more mild.</li>
            <li>and this product helps clear my skin, and leaves it feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li>If you have been using BP products for a while around 5 and 10% then you will be fine and this product will work very well for you aside from some drying.</li>
            <li>I really suggest the product for quick results!</li>
            <li>After one application of acne free, the redness was reduced significantly, and some of my more painfull bumps had gone down in size...which is huge.     </li>
            <li>Just swab lightly so you can really cover on your face without having to apply more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is absolutely amazing, I can&#x27;t even say enough about it.</li>
            <li>But after a couple of days, I can definitely tell some amazing results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It only takes about 3 days to see amazing results.</li>
            <li>I believe its worth just to try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now 22 years old, and I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne for most of my life.</li>
            <li>However, this may not work for everybody, so I would recommend experimenting with this step if you find Step 4 isn&#x27;t useful.</li>
            <li>I am no longer self conscious and can be more myself without worrying about how people see me.</li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular, just a couple of zits on my forehead and shoulders, but enough to annoy me.</li>
            <li>this is the only kind of make up that dosnt cause a break out of any sort.  </li>
            <li>I rarely go out in the sun  5.</li>
            <li>I rarely have any stress    </li>
            <li>Guys, just try it once, just once and see how it will change your confidence and smile.</li>
            <li>First of, these medications are very potent and my left eye been itching since I started using this product because I think I accidentally applied some around my eye.</li>
            <li>Well.. I&#x27;m on day 3 of using this product and so far I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>All in all, so far my face is feeling so much better.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try for stubborn acne, and for those who cannot or do not want to go the \\&quot;pill\\&quot; route.</li>
            <li>The benzyl peroxide repair lotion is nice not only cause it puts moisture it but also works to prevent acne from forming in the day.</li>
            <li>After getting out of the shower, with my face freshly washed with Step One, I apply the toner with a cotton pad.</li>
            <li>and I rarely have a breakout.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t classify my skin as \\&quot;severe\\&quot; at all, in fact, my skin tends to be clear most of the time.  </li>
            <li>It will not be fun, but once your skin gets rid of all the gunk it has been hanging onto, the transition into clearer skin is practically</li>
            <li>Also, as another reviewer wrote, this is not for you if you have the rare breakout.  </li>
            <li>This product is worth a try.</li>
            <li>I have to start with a make up remover (I use Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser)</li>
            <li>I bought this product and have used it for about 18 hours and my face is really much more clear.  </li>
            <li>One more thing, we are all different and every skin type may show a different reaction to this product, so, even though I can tell the product has been working awesome for me since I got it, this is just and opinion/advice according to my personal experience.  </li>
            <li>I would still say this product is worth a try.  </li>
            <li>(I would say I&#x27;m an 8 out of 10, as far as \\&quot;severity\\&quot; goes, with 10 being the most severe</li>
            <li>DEFINETLY WORTH</li>
            <li>I am 21 years old and have struggled with acne most of my life.</li>
            <li>After reading some pretty good reviews I bought the severe treatment because I have struggled with breakouts for a very long time.</li>
            <li>I have used Clearasil, Pro-Active, Oxy, and countless other treatments, but this product has worked the best for me.</li>
            <li>At first I was worried because it seemed to be making me break out even more than I already did, but after about 2 weeks, my skin has completely cleared up!  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t magic but it was better than other products that our daughter had been using.</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT: find a good lotion that is oil and fragrance free and is good for sensitive skin, because this product will leave your skin very dry (to rid the acne) and that&#x27;s not good in the long run to healthy skin and kind of defeats the purpose of the product.</li>
            <li>couple warnings and tips:&lt;br /&gt;-AcneFree Severe is strong and it will dry out most peoples skin.  </li>
            <li>Yes, that&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>wait an hour or right before i leave for school/work i put on my moisturizer</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s 1/3 right now</li>
            <li>yeah right, this just might be another knock off thing like proactive.</li>
            <li>But God answered my prayers right on time so that by the end of summer break,when I go to school</li>
            <li>WTH, right??  </li>
            <li>, what&#x27;s another 25 bucks right?  </li>
            <li>Ive try diff acne tx, it makes my pimple erupt like volcano, then I bought thus product right away,.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s right for you.</li>
            <li>witch cleared it right up.</li>
            <li>This product works great in the first few weeks.   </li>
            <li>With this particular combination of things I have been acne free.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a great product and if you have mild or moderate acne</li>
            <li>(and it&#x27;s super cheap and available at just about every local drugstore.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>The wash works really well and leaves my face feeling clean without ruining my skin.</li>
            <li>Another suggestion that I highly recommend would be using an oil free moisturizer with the product.</li>
            <li>how much dirt it takes off your face, even right after I&#x27;ve scrubbed my face in the shower!  </li>
            <li>Excellent product and 2/3rds less the price of big box stores!</li>
            <li>you University Medical for making a product that actually delivers on its promise, is very reasonably priced and has given me the beautiful complexion I have tried for years to attain.</li>
            <li>I give my face a gentle rub for a couple minutes and rinse with cool water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many acne products such as Proactiv, Daniel Kern&#x27;s, and other various products with salicylic acid (Stridex pads) and the likes, and I found this to work the best out of all of them.</li>
            <li>So I got home and used the night one because it was night and when I first used the cleansing wash I could tell a difference right there and then.</li>
            <li>I was basically best friends with my dermatolgist who knew that my skin would need something new every other year, due to its becoming immuned to the medicine after awhile.</li>
            <li>night like 30 minutes later to make sure all of step 3 and 4 have absorbed..</li>
            <li>I have left overs from 3 boxes ago which I apply on my back and shoulders and chest with great results.</li>
            <li>Most recently I found temporary success using MaxClarity.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several products in the past and this one seemed to worked the best to help clear up my very mild blemishes around my nose and does it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I would suggest a light oil free moisturizer with sunscreen after the regimen, in the morning only.</li>
            <li>The kit is really easy to use and comes with clear, easy-to-follow directions.</li>
            <li>I took many trips to the dermatologist&#x27;s office with him promising me one day where I&#x27;d have clear skin like the Photoshopped models that were hanging all over his wall.      </li>
            <li>The price is also reasonable and worthy.</li>
            <li>If I start with the make up remover and follow with the 3 AcneFree steps, I get a great cleaning and starting with the make up remover only adds a minute to the routine.  </li>
            <li>but I think hormones continue to get the best of my face and it reappeared a few years later.</li>
            <li>I will say, it is pretty strong but my usually sensitive skin can handle it.</li>
            <li>, I read the directions and ingredients very VERY closely.  </li>
            <li>I saw Acne Free on an ad while I was looking at some other face wash products and decided to read more about it.</li>
            <li>Trust me, if you have problem skin and want to try something new, this product is definitely worth a shot!</li>
            <li>Most reviews says it dries out your face, my face is was super oily so it didn&#x27;t start to feel dry until the 7th day.</li>
            <li>word of caution:  If your face is mild to dry, make sure you use a moisturizer between the morning and evening sessions.  </li>
            <li>As I mentioned it before, bear in mind that acnefree might dry up your skin, but you can work it out with a moisturizer and that&#x27;s a whole lot better than fighting acne!</li>
            <li>I will probably try to use the lotion again once I am no longer pregnant and see if I get a different reaction but for now the other 3 steps are working just great.</li>
            <li>When I woke up the next morning I could see a huge difference!</li>
            <li>Renewing Toner is definitely a vital component because its primary ingredient is Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li>Another great thing about it (for me) is the bottle for the Healing Lotion seems to last really long.</li>
            <li>I recommend using it after your first week of just STEPS 1-3, to get your skin use to the products.</li>
            <li>This is not a miracle product, but it does exactly what I was hoping it could do: control my acne, prevent breakouts, and promote skin health.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m nearing the end of the first week of using Acnefree Severe.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff since 2008, and it has not failed me yet.</li>
            <li>Now after 2 weeks ,my face is REALLY clearing up!</li>
            <li>E, Biotin, and flax will really help skin a lot!</li>
            <li>The lotion burned for about the first week of application, then my skin got used to it.</li>
            <li>It worked at first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been exactly 7 days</li>
            <li>Thanks to AcneFree!    </li>
            <li>The moisturizer is EXPENSIVE, but it soothes the skin, and smells great!</li>
            <li>First week, OMG First week</li>
            <li>First off, this is my mother&#x27;s account.</li>
            <li>I used the 4 steps when I first got it and</li>
            <li>I am comfortable with them so far.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My daughers, who don&#x27;t have severe acne, love the regular AcneFree Treatment system.  </li>
            <li>This is the only brand I have been able to find that works for me...</li>
            <li>I was concerned about the benzyl peroxide because of my sensitive skin and let me say my concerns were justified.</li>
            <li>I do still get the occasional break out, but my skin is 10X better than it has EVER been.  </li>
            <li>(non-acne-medicated) first, then wash with the acnefree cleanser.  </li>
            <li>So, wash the makeup off with a make-up removing cleanser first, then use the AcneFree system.  </li>
            <li>No problems the first week.</li>
            <li>However, I continued using it because what a lot of acne medications do first is bring all impurities to the surface as part of ridding your acne.</li>
            <li>I tried the severe acne formula first because nothing else seemed to be working on the persistent buggers</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting zero breakouts, and my skin feels smooth and soft.   </li>
            <li>Maybe I was in the sun more, maybe my diet improved, maybe I was just finally growing out of acne.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions and used it exactly as prescribed for 3+ weeks.  </li>
            <li>but by that point you should be able to just use a regular face wash again.  </li>
            <li>For the first time ever that I can remember, I can walk out of my house with confidence in how my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>This product cleared my face with consistent use after about two months.</li>
            <li>First off, ive never bought any acne products in my life, so I can&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li>One kit lasted me 6 months and my skin is soft &amp; smooth.  </li>
            <li>Find a friend (or better yet, a sibling) with similar ancestry to you who has already overcome your problem and ask them how they&#x27;ve done it.</li>
            <li>Makes me think the kid packing it decided to sneak into the john and test it out first.</li>
            <li>Not meant to be funny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to prolong the life of the package that I bought by only using it when I start to break out.</li>
            <li>(Which seems to be pretty standard for more people.)</li>
            <li>If you decide to use AcneFree, make a commitment not to panic for the first month.</li>
            <li>It works about the same as Proactiv, but more affordable.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the product was at night</li>
            <li>My scarring has faded significantly, my face looks baby soft!</li>
            <li>This is a life saver, first time I&#x27;ve written a review for anything.</li>
            <li>It peeled like cracy the first two weeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh and is pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>but it instore, it will be much cheaper!</li>
            <li>First of all on Amazon it is $14.00 cheaper than any of the retail stores</li>
            <li>I now make sure that I use this stuff religiously morning and night!!</li>
            <li>I used it exactly as directed for a month and saw no improvement, so was beginning to be once again discouraged.</li>
            <li>Except this time the results are real!  </li>
            <li>, many nights I forget to use the last step (to use 10 mins after the toner).</li>
            <li>Even when I say screw it and don&#x27;t follows all of it&#x27;s rules is still works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I was not using it consistently at this point, but rather just when break outs occurred.</li>
            <li>I was better off before, actually.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to, then first try applying a heated spoon to your zit.</li>
            <li>Okay so I found this product at a local Walmart, and I saw that it said \\&quot;BETTER\\&quot; than proactive.</li>
            <li>FAST AND NO DRYNESS OR REDNESS!</li>
            <li>I WISH I WOULD HAVE TRIED THIS FIRST.</li>
            <li>the first week, my skin was a nightmare.</li>
            <li>Most definitely will purchase again!</li>
            <li>She has not had success with much else.</li>
            <li>I only wish they provided more toner.</li>
            <li>I stood in her bathroom watching as she did exactly what the box said to do.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin, which is really surprising.</li>
            <li>Hands down, the best $25 dollars I ever spent.  </li>
            <li>I have suffered with mild acne since I have graduated high school.</li>
            <li>I put off adding a review right away (even though I noticed results immediately) because I wanted to be sure I was going to have positive results long term.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very tall at 6&#x27;8\\&quot; and I have very large pores.  </li>
            <li>I used the original 3-step Acnefree since middle school and it worked fine all through high school too</li>
            <li>I recommend AcneFree to people who have tried other non effective acne products on their faces.</li>
            <li>My acne is not the kind that causes massive scars, but rather is just the small persistent bumpy kind.</li>
            <li>- You do tend to go through the toner more quickly than the other products.  </li>
            <li>I have tried almost everything (ProActive, Skin ID, Clean &amp; Clear, Clearasil Acne, etc.)</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and clean.     </li>
            <li>This is the only product that did really helped with my acne this product deserves more than 5 stars .. recommended</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been following healthy diet and trying to avoid acne causing foods as much as I could and it worked.</li>
            <li>I found this to be true, right before I turned a corner for 2 weeks of major breakouts.</li>
            <li>There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a consensus between dermatologists about whether a &amp;#34;purge period&amp;#34; really exists, but in my experience it was very real.</li>
            <li>I have know been using acne free for four months and like the name I am acne free and know I only use the terminator 10 to keep my acne under control only using the full regimen once a week</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 2 and a half weeks, and already i have more confidence because my face has cleared up about 85%!</li>
            <li>I used the DeTox tea and Acne Free products for two weeks without rolling, and I saw improvements to my skin tone and texture right away, but the deep cysts remained.</li>
            <li>The medicines are potent and it will dry out your skin the first week you use it.  </li>
            <li>cuz i bet these positive comments about it are from paid spokespeople.</li>
            <li>Other than that I give this product my full reccomendation with consistent use it will most likely clear up most cases of acne.</li>
            <li>I have used Proactiv, clearasil, oxy pads, pretty much everything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not completely clear, but much better than I was with Proactiv.  </li>
            <li>It took a full 4 weeks to get consistently clear skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve pretty much used everything, but nothing worked, until I tried out this product.  </li>
            <li>am a 32-year-old female who has experienced moderate adult acne.</li>
            <li>I barely wear any face make up, just some powder and blush and it looks so smooth.    </li>
            <li>PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING</li>
            <li>I bought this instead of Proactive, which I have used in the past with good results.  </li>
            <li>I am very cautious about how I use this, and the original product, on my face since my skin is quite sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Good product, I&#x27;m too lazy to try anything else</li>
            <li>Now, my skin looks amazing with just a thin layer of light foundation and a little bit of concealer to cover up fading acne marks, plus it looks good ALL DAY.</li>
            <li>It gets absorbed into the skin VERY quickly, so you don&#x27;t have to wait around for it to dry.</li>
            <li>Within after the first day my red blemishes stopped hurtin and began to dimish Quickly!</li>
            <li>The pimples that I do get are much smaller, surface quickly and go away quickly.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t have issues with dry skin you will probably love it, but just don&#x27;t stop using then... ha.</li>
            <li>The strength of the chemicals will likely dry out and irritate most peoples&#x27; skin, so a oil-free, strong moisturizer willhelp combat that dryness.</li>
            <li>But nothing worked as quickly and completely as Acnefree.</li>
            <li>I still have just as many breakouts, but now my skin is also dry, peeling and itchy.  </li>
            <li>It can dry out skin, so I make sure to use a moisturizer, and that eliminates it.      </li>
            <li>I happened to be at Wal-Greens one day about 5 weeks ago and saw the AcneFree Severe to Clear System and bought it for $30 after reading some quick reviews.  </li>
            <li>Compare it to Pro-Active and it costs WAY less but just as effective.</li>
            <li>My sister recommended this to me a long time ago, and then this Fall I relented and bought this instead of Neutrogena Advanced Solutions (which I&#x27;d been using with some success for 2 years).</li>
            <li>I used ProActive for about 10 years in my 20&#x27;s for mild adult acne and</li>
            <li>For the weeks following, I would say that I have experienced about 1 pimple per week on average.</li>
            <li>Have not used long enough to give fair rating.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s happy that those gigantic red cysts had gone down a lot.</li>
            <li>I use 100% pure intensive healing moisturizing balm (pasting the link below).</li>
            <li>Immediately, it started to heal the pimples I had (large cyst like pimples).  </li>
            <li>and you will see results, I certainly did.</li>
            <li>I was diagnosed with PCOS this year, and am fairly certain that the acne I struggle with is a result of hormonal imbalances.</li>
            <li>AcneFree Severe may not be or everyone, but it has certainly worked for me.</li>
            <li>At first I used the acne free system as directed, but it was too strong for my skin, my face became raw and BURNED like nothing else I have ever felt.</li>
            <li>and my face has diminishing pimples on my cheeks and is not dried up nor feeling greasy but for the most part my face is pretty cleared up in only 5 days.</li>
            <li>And honestly I&#x27;d rather have dry, clear skin than oily acne skin.  </li>
            <li>only downside to this product is it does cause your face to dry out, and you will need a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>so i stopped and just used the basic drugstore products which worked fine.</li>
            <li>First of all, as other reviews have mentioned this product is much better than proactive.</li>
            <li>After giving so many different products (prescription and non-prescription) a go, religiously using AcneFree has cleared my skin up to a point where it is smooth, clear and clean enough that I rarely wear makeup anymore.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use half the bottle at once to get rid of your spots, it honestly takes a dime sized amount to cover your whole face and sometimes that&#x27;s too much.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m forty-ummmm,...a bit older ;)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even spray perfumes on certain parts of my body without it breaking out really</li>
            <li>We started paying our other medical expenses after that in full from our own pockets because we haven&#x27;t fulfilled our deductible for the year....</li>
            <li>It is better, but still pretty active.</li>
            <li>It was too much for her since she has pretty good skin other than the occasional blemish, though if she waited it out she would have adjusted too.</li>
            <li>I actually noticed that my skin was having more of a breakout than what I had to begin with; keep in mind that I don&#x27;t have major or even consistent acne issues.</li>
            <li>Huge cluster breakout on cheek, burnt around my eyes, red burns and irritation on my neck and chest.  </li>
            <li>I still have huge visible pores and will focus on minimizing them later .</li>
            <li>If I start using it consistently again the acne will clear up pretty</li>
            <li>Thanks.    </li>
            <li>With all that said, this is a fantastic product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Also, this kit did not overdry my skin as straight benzoyl peroxide treatments have done.</li>
            <li>Bought this product for my son, and he reports that it works very well.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, the Toner should really be used in conjunction with the lotion.</li>
            <li>If you find yourself just going through bottles, you might be using to much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;BTW, Proactiv really does suck.</li>
            <li>This supposedly niche product has performed very well in both fighting my acne and rejuvenating my skin for a $20 package ($18, now that amazon has the subscribe</li>
            <li>Please please please give this product a try because I have a feeling it will help you just as much as it helped me</li>
            <li>I have used proactiv and didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensative skin and was using it as directed.</li>
            <li>and I think by me scratching at it so much and then applying the product</li>
            <li>It also seems that step 2 really irritated my skin</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to get rid of stubborn acne.</li>
            <li>Avoid putting on make up till you really need to...</li>
            <li>/&gt;For a fraction of the cost, it&#x27;s worth having clear skin all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With that said, this product in combination with Clarisonic did absolute miracles for me.</li>
            <li>The #2 gets used up much quicker than the rest of the products.      </li>
            <li>After 2 weeks my skin started healing extremely fast.</li>
            <li>My skin is very oily and in the summer prone to severe acne.</li>
            <li>However, nothing really worked, until I found it.</li>
            <li>so I bought the whole system.  </li>
            <li>I would also recommend you putting aloe gel on your face because it really soothes and makes the redness and irritation go away.</li>
            <li>I would like to say thank you to Acne Free, you have given my son his confidance back.</li>
            <li>but nothing was really clearing up my acne.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how fast it worked because of the severity of my acne the day before.</li>
            <li>Severe Acne Free results happened the next day for me.</li>
            <li>They work very well.</li>
            <li>My husband has remarked on how much brighter my skin looks, and I am over the moon.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely, whole heartedly reccomend this product to anyone dealing with acne.</li>
            <li>They only had the Acne Free Severe product.  </li>
            <li>I really like that they include the retinol for use at night.</li>
            <li>It really does get the job done.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really notice any change in my acne.  </li>
            <li>FAST.</li>
            <li>After years of acne and being told I would have to go birth control or Acutane if I really wanted to take care of the problem, I tried this product and</li>
            <li>Anyone with acne will appreciate how much that</li>
            <li>All kinds of facial scrubs  - LED Light Therapy   -</li>
            <li>My skin is very oily and where some guys have a 5 &#x27;o clock shadow</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing much improvement.</li>
            <li>I would NOT recommend this product, especially if you plan to wear some sort of concealer or make-up; the lotion does NOT leave your skin smooth.</li>
            <li>I have not seen much improvement.  </li>
            <li>I go through the toner really fast though....</li>
            <li>Saw real results after two weeks of using this product.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very convenient...</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been working really well for me.</li>
            <li>this is a very drying formula that works on my very oily</li>
            <li>When I do wear makeup, I like to use a gentle cleansing bar to remove the makeup before I go through the AF steps.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even describe how much this worked for me.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s so much dirt hiding here and there in my pores and face its</li>
            <li>Yes, it cleared up that much.  </li>
            <li>It is really CLEANING your face with the face wash, using the toner.  </li>
            <li>This should be put on very generously.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Fast forward 2 days,</li>
            <li>and I havent really seen a change in my face.</li>
            <li>but I really dont have a whole like ot faith in it now.</li>
            <li>I never leave reviews but given how much I rely on reviews, I figured it was about time</li>
            <li>so I was ready to do it......</li>
            <li>It is not drying, not irritating.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who needs a fast problem solver.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions absolutely correcly</li>
            <li>It really improves my skin.</li>
            <li>It really works for me and my skintype.</li>
            <li>(Walmart, Rite Aid &amp; Kmart).You can&#x27;t really beat the price.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>I have found this to be very helpful in and of</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>I had very severe acne.</li>
            <li>REAL SEVERE, not just 5 or 6 pimples</li>
            <li>I got a bunch of cysts, which would get very infected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>IT WAS ONLY  AVAILABLE ON A MONTHLY REFILL BASIS.</li>
            <li>I DECIDED TO GO BACK TO USING THE ACNE FREE SEVERE KIT, I WAS USING IT</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>THE PRICE IS REASONABLE, I SHUDDER</li>
            <li>Now, at 17, I was really becomming irritated with my acne and nothing working.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Proactive about 5 years ago, which didn&#x27;t really work too well for me, but I thought that&#x27;s how things just were.  </li>
            <li>I really hope that you found this review helpful.</li>
            <li>This product is much cheaper than Proactive and works just as well.  </li>
            <li>thanks. .  </li>
            <li>Product that works very well</li>
            <li>Ok, after finishing the entire package, using it morning and night, never missing a day, i&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that it hasn&#x27;t helped one bit.</li>
            <li>I used to run to the mirror as soon as I got up to see what was there, now I am rest assured to only find a clear, smooth face!  </li>
            <li>So far so good, I can see an improvement of my acne (under my chin) using this product, but as I woke up after applying it on my second day I saw my t-shirt on the mirror and its collar was totally bleached !</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I noticed a difference in a few days with the acnefree than I did in months with Proactiv.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, I am not a huge fan of this step.</li>
            <li>I actually liked the morning lotion which does burn a little and feels somewhat sandy when applied, but it&#x27;s better than the oily feel I get with other products.     </li>
            <li>New is in quotations because, while I do still have acne coming in, I believe that most of the pimples that are showing up on my face are from cysts that were under the skin for a long time and beginning to surface.</li>
            <li>Wow!!!  </li>
            <li>so far i like the product because my face start to clearing out!!!</li>
            <li>I had very high hopes for this product, as I know many other users did.</li>
            <li>Now I know a lot of guys don&#x27;t use moisturizer, but honestly guys, this product WILL dry out your skin and which would you rather have, dry flaky skin or smooth soft skin?   </li>
            <li>I stumbled upon AcneFree Severe because Clean n&#x27; Clear Advantage was out of stock (which, by the way, worked to a point then became completely ineffective).</li>
            <li>I had some HUGE pimples and after 2 days of use they were almost flat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m not sure how they actually measured AcneFree Severe to be 4x better, but YES, it performed INFINITELY better than Proactiv for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Proactive and many other acne treatments.    </li>
            <li>I do caution others those (as many other reviewers have pointed out)</li>
            <li>I had run out of the original and went to my local Walmart to pick some up.  </li>
            <li>It is better than ProActive and other over the counter medicines.  </li>
            <li>MANY OF THE OTHER PRODUCTS IRRITATED AND DRYED</li>
            <li>I bought this off Amazon about a month and a half ago because of the many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>After clearing out some REALLY congested pores, aka having to deal with some new pimples popping up (nbd!</li>
            <li>All of my spots were smaller and not a single one was bright red.</li>
            <li>facial wash didn&#x27;t seem to clean my face, and it wouldn&#x27;t remove any makeup that I had on.</li>
            <li>I have acne mainly on my forehead and nose, and I also have very oily skin on my nose.</li>
            <li>I did get one bump around the two week mark, and I had some old bumps that took a full 4 weeks to clear up.</li>
            <li>I tried pills, topical creams, lotions, special face wash, mud masks (I&#x27;m a guy</li>
            <li>Make sure your face is dry completely before applying     </li>
            <li>When I do get that bad pimple once in a blue moon, I use AcneFree Terminator 10, which also works GREAT, but is hit and miss honestly.      </li>
            <li>I have used the original Acne Free product for the past year or so.  </li>
            <li>At first my skin gets clear, and tighter, not as oily.  </li>
            <li>I am just a normal person who has been very observant of my skin and have made coorelations between breakouts and the things I have done...</li>
            <li>I do not give the product a full 5 stars only because it does not do everything I want.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty young</li>
            <li>We had tried most everything out on the market all to no success.</li>
            <li>At night, is is very important to wait 10 minutes before applying the night serum-wash your hands again before the last step at night as 10 minutes is enough time for your fingers to build up oils</li>
            <li>My skin was super itchy and dry in the first two weeks.</li>
            <li>All in all, I was pleased and figured I could deal with the occasional small zit that could be covered relatively easily with make up.  </li>
            <li>I can be a brand new person!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m about ready for a new kit.  </li>
            <li>Also, you&#x27;re better off finding this at Walmart where I got mine for less.</li>
            <li>I purhased mine at Walmart for $20-something in November 2006 and still have more than half remaining of each product in the pack.   </li>
            <li>Still, he has asked me to buy this particular brand again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from Proactive, to prescription pills, topical medicine from dermatologists, and most recently, MaxClarity.</li>
            <li>three months faithfully, only to find that the most it did was transfer my acne colonies in a different direction.</li>
            <li>Let me give a super brief background about myself.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products, including Proactiv and the regular AcneFree for the last decade.</li>
            <li>Oh, 1 last note, use a white or cream colored towel and be sure that you&#x27;d be wearing a sleepwear you don&#x27;t mind being damaged by benzoyl peroxide...</li>
            <li>and I have had mild acne for ten years.</li>
            <li>Perhaps when it finally arrives it will be fantastic, but I have been asked to review it now, and this is my experience so far.</li>
            <li>A lot of people mentioned how quick they noticed a difference and for me it was the same way.  </li>
            <li>My evening supplements are Super Omega Fish oil, Basic Antioxident and</li>
            <li>18 ans just recent started getting mild to severe acne all over my face.</li>
            <li>Mainly my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li>Luckily, my purge period was only two weeks.</li>
            <li>But after like 3 weeks I needed to order more toner, so I just got the regular AcneFree toner, a big bottle of it, on Ebay.  </li>
            <li>I want to start out by saying I don&#x27;t have severe acne all over my face just my chin mainly.</li>
            <li>the older I get.</li>
            <li>My skin began to look much better in a few days, the repair lotion really works.</li>
            <li>but you cant apply at morning because this treatment lotion is too white and doesnt absorbs quickly as like Proactiv STEP 3.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If my skin ever becomes very dry though, I&#x27;m pretty quick to apply another lotion to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After my first use my skin felt great, and over the last few days I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts, and the ones I have seem to be getting smaller.</li>
            <li>With the plausibility of dry skin due to the Benzoyl Peroxide, I DO NOT recommend warm or hot water as it breaks down a very fine layer of epithelial lipids that keep skin balmy and protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have been struggling to find a product that works, I highly recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend buying off of Amazon.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.    </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I had to be put on Accutane my sophmore year for 6 months in high school</li>
            <li>However, I highly recommend trying AcneFree Severe before purchasing Proactive.</li>
            <li>I did not have a lot of acne in high school</li>
            <li>(high amount).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recomend this product</li>
            <li>Highly suggested.</li>
            <li>Purpose Dual Treatment Moisture Lotion with SPF 15 4 fl oz (120 ml)]], highly recommended)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m pretty impressed; I started off with worse acne, but things have settled down.  </li>
            <li>After a week or two, I really didnt see a difference other that the huge cystic pimples i now had from this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have tried proactive, clear skin and so many other products on both myself and my son and none of them have worked as well as this has.</li>
            <li>I do follow the instructions exactly as given and use no other product on my face except for eye makeup    </li>
            <li>(And actually receive compliments on what pretty skin I have!)</li>
            <li>I would say that I have mild-severe acne, although it has gotten a little better over time.</li>
            <li>And walking out with a clean and clear face definitely brings my confidence level up.  </li>
            <li>IF YOU ARE OF MEDITERRANEAN HERITAGE (I&amp;#34;M GREEK) AND HAVE STUGGLED WITH ACNE PRODUCTS FOR YEARS, BUY THIS AND CLEAN AND CLEAR</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, Acne Free is NOT proactive; if you dont use it ever single day or indulge in a Butterfinger or two, you WILL get new breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have tried: antibiotics/differn, clean and clear &amp; clear advantage acne kit, clearasil ulta acnes solution kit,lush,and OF COURSE PROACTIVE, which sucks the most by the way.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to express in words how happy I am looking in the mirror now and seeing a clear complexion looking back at me.    </li>
            <li>I recommend you consider where in the world your particular ancestors lived and compare the environmental factors they were disposed to with where you currently live.</li>
            <li>This system works very well on my adult acne.</li>
            <li>I am 30 years old, oily skin and always experienced blackheads around my nose area, but lately I began to get big cyst like pimples around my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li>My acne vulgaris is gone and I have a clear face today, thanks to AcneFree.</li>
            <li>So if you have sensitive skin I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this, I&#x27;d recommend the non-severe version.</li>
            <li>It really did helped clear the acne that I had.</li>
            <li>Ultimately, I would suggest this product to anybody that can have fairly severe breakouts, but breakouts that have been temporarily manageable in the past.</li>
            <li>BUY A WHITE TOWEL, Benzoyl peroxide will destroy you&#x27;r towels, but its worth it. :]    </li>
            <li>(Not inconvenient enough to make me stop using it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only has it reduced the amount of white heads appearing on my face daily, but it is fading red marks remarkably well.  </li>
            <li>My sister had recommended this and we pretty much have the same type of skin...extremely oily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from dermatologists to every OTC medication and topical on the marke with varying degrees of success.</li>
            <li>I notice my skin was not as oily as normal and does not shine as much as it normally would.</li>
            <li>One day at Target, I was browsing the Acne aisle as I normally do to try to find yet something else to try.</li>
            <li>While this may not work for everyone&#x27;s hormonal acne, I think it is worth a shot if you are struggling with moderate cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Although i still have a little acne ive noticed a huge positive change in the Size and swelling as well as the amount.</li>
            <li>I have the type of acne that usually pops up right before my monthly cycle, then takes forever to heal, and this product starts making a huge dent in the acne overnight.</li>
            <li>This product was very worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>the ONLY thing that i noticed (which is contradictory to other reviews i&#x27;ve seen) is that my skin is oilier pretty early on in the day, but that can be taken care of with oil-blotting sheets.  &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>It took about two and a half weeks or so before I really noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had clear skin all my life and after turning 20 I started getting some mild acne on my back and shoulders</li>
            <li>- Make sure you never use all four steps or you will likely dry your skin out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It did dry my skin, but I used a facial lotion with a sunscreen on top of this treatment program.</li>
            <li>After about a week and a half of madness, things started to clear up like magic.</li>
            <li>The product is strong so be careful if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>May be easier to order on line in the future, but I wanted to try it right away to see if it worked.</li>
            <li>Put 1 dab on each your left and right cheek and your forehead.  </li>
            <li>If you want quick results for something i would try this product, but if you want long term results, this is not for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve developed my own \\&quot;surgical\\&quot; intervention when possible, but the cyst has to follow a specific pattern to open with a sterile needle.  </li>
            <li>My final note is be sure to be consistent (at least a first).  </li>
            <li>My face had less visible pimples but way more painful bumps that were so huge that you really cant cover up with any kind of makeup.</li>
            <li>I used Proactiv previously which seemed to help at first but quickly lost its vigor</li>
            <li>so this is nothing new to me.</li>
            <li>And, it keeps new pimples from appearing.  </li>
            <li>and I do not have a new pimple at all.</li>
            <li>I live in the carribean and ordered it front amazon.com.</li>
            <li>As with anything new some adjustment is required-</li>
            <li>Any new ones:  gone.  </li>
            <li>Though I havent gotten any new brakeouts</li>
            <li>Where I live now</li>
            <li>Then I leave it in my purse and use it as a spot treatment if I feel a new breakout attempting to surface during the day.</li>
            <li>have tried ever store brand, birth control, doxycycline, new make up, no make up, dieting, and so on and so forth.</li>
            <li>Am hoping once all my zits clear up the pain will go away...will give it a few more days and see.    </li>
            <li>When putting on the Toner, you should be able to feel the elasticity of your natural skin return and it should ameliorate any dryness or burning with a few swabs applied from a cotton ball.</li>
            <li>It does dry out your face a bit, but I have super oily skin</li>
            <li>Since twelve years old, I have had issues with acne, particularly blackheads.  </li>
            <li>I will admit I did skip a few days at a time sometimes, but this product definitely showed nice results.</li>
            <li>I just bought this product because I was really breaking out everywhere, making it very embarrasing when working in a medical environment and just being around family.  </li>
            <li>I have had acne for a long long time, many years.</li>
            <li>Just make sure not to use to much of the product; a little really does go a long way.</li>
            <li>If you are struggling with frequent breakouts that don&#x27;t seem to be clearing up, I would HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have not had skin this clear since high school</li>
            <li>Benzoil Peroxide (please excuse the spelling)I am really depressed that I listened to the advertisement on the box, that it was better &amp; faster than Pro Active.</li>
            <li>the next morning my face felt smoother and the right side of my face looked almost clear.</li>
            <li>My skin is almost completely clear now!  </li>
            <li>My skin is exactly the same as it was 2 months ago.</li>
            <li>As with any acne treatment the key is being consistent.</li>
            <li>First day I thought it was working  2nd Day</li>
            <li>Consistent use is absolutely key.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first because people said it burned your face and is only for people with severe acne.</li>
            <li>Other than that I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product and would recommend to anyone with moderate - severe acne.</li>
            <li>After putting my dermatologist visits on hold because of the expenses, my acne did not fail to come back.</li>
            <li>Normally it takes about two weeks for one of these to clear up (with or without treatment).</li>
            <li>2.Try not to touch your face, especially during the first week of treatment as this will irritate the obstructions.  </li>
            <li>3.Before washing your face, take a hot washcloth and drape it over your face (this will open the pores) for about a minute.</li>
            <li>cause the package is only 20 and some retinol can be pretty pricey for quality stuff</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many acne products in the past</li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your money on this!</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product, and WOW!</li>
            <li>At first I was scared to use it because i seen a couple reviews that said it burned their skin and made their face red.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first day I only used 1,2,3 day and night to get my face introduced to it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried alot of different things, and at first they all would work.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv, and multiple other OTC acne products, I tried Acnefree and it worked better than anything.  </li>
            <li>I rather use this than pay $65 to $100 for over priced products that do the exact same thing.</li>
            <li>Completely cleared my skin!</li>
            <li>First of all when I went to buy it, it&#x27;s was only $5.00 dollars at five below.</li>
            <li>This only lasts about the first week or two though</li>
            <li>O M G all I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li>At 28, I felt that I was TOO OLD to be having these problems!  </li>
            <li>Use it daily and it may be too much acne medication for your skin!</li>
            <li>Go easy with the roller if you are under 40 and roll less frequently.</li>
            <li>See other websites on how to use and clean your roller.</li>
            <li>my face has begun to clear - no new cysts and the old ones healing more quickly than usual.  </li>
            <li>New acne was reduced to nothing and old acne started clearing up.     </li>
            <li>My son took before pictures and a new one and was surprised at the differences.</li>
            <li>his acne is just slightly improving from the huge amount he got from using this product.</li>
            <li>The price is great for the product - At this rate, it looks like I will go through a package about every 2-2.5 months which makes it less than half the cost of ProActiv for the same amount of product.</li>
            <li>I suggest you do STEP 3 less or start using an oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Now that I am pretty much clear, I only use the products every couple days, using milder alternatives in between.   </li>
            <li>havent been long enough to be acne free yet</li>
            <li>, im talking about 20 or more big zits, cyst, pain under face, WHO cried several times alone in the toilet because of acne.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Unlike other reviewers, I didn&#x27;t develop dryness, redness or any other kind of discomfort.</li>
            <li>I have to say, I&#x27;ve used a million acne treatments, and this is one of the first ones I&#x27;ve ever used that didn&#x27;t make my face 10 times worse before it got better..</li>
            <li>Initially made my acne worse and took 6 weeks to show results, but was incredibly effective!  </li>
            <li>within the hour my skin looks less red and more clear!</li>
            <li>but I cannot blame this product for that because I have a very active and somewhat stressful lifestyle filled with dirt and irritation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was VERY tempted to stop using this product during my first week of use because my skin dried out SOOO much</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, and I have new breakouts almost daily - ah the wonders of genetics.</li>
            <li>After my face stared to clear up, I found that ANY face scrub will due, and you could actually skip the repair lotion and use the Alba Moisturizer by itself,, but Unfortunately you can&#x27;t buy the acne medication by itself,, but regardless, it&#x27;s worth it to get the best skin possible for me.    </li>
            <li>It really help my teenage daughter clear her face!</li>
            <li>But I used moisturizing cream for a few days and it was fine after that.</li>
            <li>The only OTC product that really works for my 17 year old son!  </li>
            <li>So I only purchase items with a large review</li>
            <li>--when one colony disappeared, another appeared just slightly n/s/w/e from the original position.</li>
            <li>While it wasn&#x27;t as miraculous as I had hoped in terms of speed of improvement, after a significant amount of use, I&#x27;m finding far less breakouts occurring and the ones that do crop up disappear quicker.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t crazy about spending all that money, but was happy with the results</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that within 2 weeks my skin will be completely clear (seeing as how my progress is now).</li>
            <li>Face is clear for the 1st time in months.  </li>
            <li>But still, I can see the clear difference after I used this product.</li>
            <li>, I always had a clear face.    </li>
            <li>Almost a week into the treatment and my skin was completely clear.</li>
            <li>Clear</li>
            <li>I was completely clear of acne in one month.</li>
            <li>my clear skin (from using Pro-Active) broke out in pimples.  </li>
            <li>Once again my skin is clear.  </li>
            <li>I replaced the toner with the Neutrogena rapid clear 2 in 1 toner when the one that came with the system ran out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did take about a 6 weeks for my skin to totally clear up from this kit.</li>
            <li>Now it was time to see if the system could clear up the monstrosity that my face became.  </li>
            <li>I have determined that staying clear is a lifestyle, no one thing will cure your outbreaks.  </li>
            <li>My skin:  clear as can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face is clear and I haven&#x27;t had one cystic pimple since.  </li>
            <li>But, if I follow through with each step and keep up the routine, my face is quite clear.</li>
            <li>It took about three months for my skin to gradually clear.</li>
            <li>But the instructions clearly say not to use the product on the eyes area</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still not 100% clear, but people compliment me on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got the 4 piece sensitive skin + the Mask at a Proactiv kiosk at the mall</li>
            <li>I started getting acne in my early 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>If not, at least his face looks MUCH BETTER than before.</li>
            <li>I am 35 years old and have been suffering from acne since I turned an adult.</li>
            <li>Do Not get it anywhere near your lips or eyelids!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, do not put this stuff near your eyes they will burn.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT PUT THIS ANYWHERE NEAR YOUR EYES   </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m 23 years old.</li>
            <li>I had severe acne since I was 10 years old.</li>
            <li>I think I used a bit too much though when I got a rash on my upper cheeks.</li>
            <li>The night treatment, when put directly on a pimple, did nothing to reduce it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the combination of calming, natural ingredients in the composition of each product.</li>
            <li>None of it worked nearly as well as this.</li>
            <li>I am now 34 yrs old</li>
            <li>It really gets at any pimples that are already there and any pimples that are just starting to form.</li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s face isn&#x27;t completely cleared of blemishes yet</li>
            <li>it is nearly gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one really worked for him-and it was the only one.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for one of my teenage sons, who has had trouble tolerating many of the prescribed pills to help clear his acne.</li>
            <li>I am not saying that this won&#x27;t work for you, but it DEFINATELY did not work for me or my friend&#x27;s 15 year old son.....</li>
            <li>Hence I thought I need to use a complete system to cleanse, tone and treat my skin.</li>
            <li>i am 44 years old and have suffered with severe breakouts for all of my adult life.</li>
            <li>in two weeks my skin had cleared and within a month was cleared completely.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s completely manageable.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t wash your hands frequently use a alcohol based sanitizer, this will help minimize the oil in your fingertips.   </li>
            <li>The next day, i could tell that this product went straight to work.</li>
            <li>I am 28 years old and have always had oily/problem skin.</li>
            <li>The texture of this is very creamy with tiny microbeads in it.</li>
            <li>I have now been using this kit for about 6 months now and my acne scars are nearly completely gone</li>
            <li>15 years old btw</li>
            <li>And wow...</li>
            <li>I only really had it on my face</li>
            <li>so common colds would even take me 1 month or more to get rid of.      </li>
            <li>I was completely blown away.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it worked nearly as well as this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 27, so some acne products currently on the market don&#x27;t work very well for me.  </li>
            <li>If you do NOT have sensitive skin but have acne that NEVER goes away...</li>
            <li>In just 3 days my face it 80% completely</li>
            <li>now i can use it on my whole face, but I only use it on my T-zone bc</li>
            <li>so i decided to take action before that and try this product.</li>
            <li>Paid 30+ dollars for this at my local walgreens  and was very pissed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 35 years old</li>
            <li>but overall my complexion is so much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been two weeks and the acne is completely gone.</li>
            <li>my pimples were clearing up and my skin was really soft, so</li>
            <li>Nothing completely got rid of it.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will totally clear up completely.</li>
            <li>Doesnt burn my skin even during a workout or after a workout or when i start sweating like that its only really one step you have to wash off</li>
            <li>I woke up this morning and literally said WOW when I looked in the mirror.</li>
            <li>Oh and whatever you do dont get it near your eyes.</li>
            <li>with a dermatologist, but he was too busy to see me</li>
            <li>I have cystic acne combined with REALLY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Complete strangers walk up to me and ask me what am I using on my skin.</li>
            <li>Now I can see hope that my acne will be completely eliminated soon.</li>
            <li>I eat my fat and protein early in the day with bile and HCL.     </li>
            <li>I figured out a home made recipe to get rid of old skin.</li>
            <li>After using this system my acne didn&#x27;t vanish, but did reduce considerably.</li>
            <li>I am 31 years old</li>
            <li>but i guess not, 26 years old now.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with acne since I was about 13 years old.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Above direction is for only who has REALLY SEVERE ACNE</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been 5 days and my skin is sooooo freaking soft and clear.   </li>
            <li>I am 31 years old and have had acne since a teenager.</li>
            <li>I took accutane in my early 20s</li>
            <li>I consider myself to have sensitive skin but didn&#x27;t have any problems with this product itching, peeling, redness or anything.</li>
            <li>my skin is soft, and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li>My 16 year old daughter has struggled with acne since she was 12.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve rarely seen a product produce noticeable results in such a short amount of time after using it.</li>
            <li>It really is very simple to use and doesn&#x27;t take more than a few minutes to apply after the skin has been cleansed.   </li>
            <li>Honestly, none of the products seemed to work (and in fact made my acne worse)</li>
            <li>(which is surprising because my skin usually reacts to acne cleansers by getting red, itchy, dry in patches, oily in others.)</li>
            <li>I used the original acnefree and felt I needed something a little stronger.</li>
            <li>doesnt mean more acne removal give this about a 3 month test and see if you see a difference</li>
            <li>My face is feeling soft, my acne is less red and inflamed and easy to cover up with make-up.</li>
            <li>At first it didn&#x27;t seem to be working, all it did was dry out my skin a lot.</li>
            <li>with step 3: the first night I&#x27;ve used the product, my face was really tender and a little inflamed.</li>
            <li>Now 4 years after trying Acnefree Severe, my skin has never been so clear and my confidence so high while going out in public without makeup.</li>
            <li>The only draw back so far is that my face is turning red for a couple hours after treatment like I have a mild sunburn.</li>
            <li>I will start this review by saying I have tried so many difficult products in an attempt to resolve my mild adult acne -- nothing worked until I finally gave in and tried AcneFree.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin, and when I was in high school I played on the football team which required me to wear a helmet that was always sweaty and bacteria-infested from prior play.</li>
            <li>This balm is seriously amazing because you only have to use a small amount, the small jar will last you months because of that, and the balm consistency is SO MUCH MORE hydrating than a regular lotion.</li>
            <li>Only acne treatment that works on both my kids, unlike Pro Active this works fast and skins stays pretty clear.</li>
            <li>first week of using the 4 products in the package my face became EXTREMELY dry!</li>
            <li>It was always moderate but it moved to severe within 2 weeks for the first time since my teenage years.</li>
            <li>Initially it did seem to flare up around my period, but over time I started noticing that I had steady acne with worsening cystic bumps based on hormone fluctuations.</li>
            <li>It reminded me of my teenage days when I would have 8-10 (or more) pimples at a time - rather than my usual 4-5 during PMS.</li>
            <li>First step is to throw away step 1 (the facial cleanser) and replace it with morning burst detoxifying facial wash.</li>
            <li>During the first three days your skin is very dry-</li>
            <li>I tried this product first (other than different types of soaps and cleaners) and it worked VERY well.</li>
            <li>It does pack a noticeable \\&quot;cool burning\\&quot; sensation and it does feel a little like sandpaper.</li>
            <li>I highly highly highly recommend Neutrogenas Liquid Foundation that actually has acne medicine it.</li>
            <li>I have always had moderate to severe acne, from High school</li>
            <li>I did, however, try multiple solutions in high school to fix my acne-related issues.  </li>
            <li>At first I was worried because it would always be a little red and irritated for the first hour or two after going through the routine.  </li>
            <li>Also my face is very oily all day long.</li>
            <li>first i wet</li>
            <li>I tried everything to make my body go back to normal</li>
            <li>Normally you are supposed to use step 3 during the day and step 4 at night but since my acne is under control I decided to use the medications only at night (alternating each night)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been really careful to follow the directions exactly since then and haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li>And, of course, last but not least, the cream.</li>
            <li>i received this product, i used about 10 days following the normal direction.</li>
            <li>I had a blemish on my chin that appeared the day before I bought the kit and after only 1 night and 1 morning of using it, it has gone down significantly</li>
            <li>I started the program with three nodules that have seemed to calm down quite a bit.</li>
            <li>At first my skin started to turn red and dry out on my forehead and near my chin.</li>
            <li>Use the Clearasi Ultra Cleansing Pads to get that deep down clean or anything you missed  3.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really hoping that this product works in the long run!</li>
            <li>But if you have tried a bunch of other products and they didn&#x27;t seem to work for you, or if  regular strength Acne Free worked well, but just not well enough this may be the product for you.</li>
            <li>, I woke with a new red spot on my face.  </li>
            <li>I have acne that is resistant to a lot of different types of remedies, so i figured \\&quot;what do i have to lose by using a new product?\\</li>
            <li>and I did not seem to be getting any new red spots on my face.  </li>
            <li>Messing with the steps actually caused my skin to have new</li>
            <li>well, is that to say that you have to live in the deep caves under earth, who never goes in the sun?</li>
            <li>Once this kit was used up, I didn&#x27;t order a new one and my acne came back.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, but this product has helped dry out my skin</li>
            <li>I developed acne as an adult, in my mid twenties</li>
            <li>But I guess for different people really you can have different reactions...</li>
            <li>The first use (at night) did cause minor facial swelling that subsided in about the time it took me to shower.</li>
            <li>I have only been using Acne Free Severe for a few days.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 25 years old with moderate adult acne</li>
            <li>Then, I shelfed it for a while because I couldn&#x27;t take it but decided that upon my reuse of it, I would not use the entire system mixed because it&#x27;s too intense</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so you may need to try several products to find something that really works for you.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, I would try the regular version or the sensitive skin version of AcneFree.  </li>
            <li>I found this product and decided to give it a shot because I had seen good reviews of it, and within 3 weeks, my acne had cleared up and the harsh scarring was slowly going way.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to that as long as my face was clear and all of a sudden boom !</li>
            <li>my skin began to  not only clear, but it&#x27;s smoothing out and the tone is evening out now... something I thought I&#x27;d be stuck with even if I could stop the breakouts!</li>
            <li>The only downside I can think of is that step 4 comes in a small 1 ounce container and will most likely run out before the rest of the kit does.</li>
            <li>AVOID the eye and lip area, especially if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>but for him it&#x27;s a major improvement.</li>
            <li>After a while i found some proactiv on a major sale</li>
            <li>it hasn&#x27;t remained at THAT severe level, but I still have quite a bit of issues with my complexion, especially considering at my age its usually not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is short on dates and it seems like there are sending old products!</li>
            <li>Within the first 2 days, I could see that it was starting to dry out my pre-existing acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say the only issue I had at first was dry, flaky skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how strong the formula actually was.</li>
            <li>He has been using it for almost a year and the acné is still pretty active.</li>
            <li>I tried benzoate, retinol/tretinol and antibiotic treatments (minocyclin) with no significant success.</li>
            <li>It takes a little bit of effort considering it is a 4 step process, but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I have not had any bad reactions since and my skin feels really smooth and just looks better overall.  </li>
            <li>Within a week, the huge breakouts are now no more, and are starting to fade.  </li>
            <li>people struggling with acne in general</li>
            <li>At night, use the MT Roller once a week all over your face over the Acne Free Retinol Complex.</li>
            <li>I recommend this treatment for anyone who is suffering from acne in general.</li>
            <li>You can stop doing this once the problems clear up, or roll only when problems surface.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i am a 22 year old female</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I would say within a couple of days after commencing use of the products my breakouts were reduced to almost nil and shortly thereafter the problem was completely cleared.  </li>
            <li>I barely been using it a week.</li>
            <li>in all a decent product just wish it didn&#x27;t dry my face out and wish it prevented acne, not just cleared it up.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any drying with the severe though, which with my sensitive skin, surprises me; however(!)</li>
            <li>the eye area, as that skin is extra sensitive and dries out easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am 33 and have moderate adult acne.</li>
            <li>I only started breaking out with acne in my early thirties.  </li>
            <li>None of this happened to me, i guess only if you have an allergic reaction or really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway...also beware that the cleanser and the morning lotion contains benzoyl peroxide and it WILL bleach your towels, pillowcases, and clothes if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the regular one.</li>
            <li>- AcneFree will bleach your clothes or towels if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li>After having spent \\&quot;too much money with dermatologist\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Which is 10% Benzoyl Peroxide ($5) as well for acne spots that come up during the day (Just be careful how much you use...read the instructions on the box).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product that&#x27;s completely cleared my face up.</li>
            <li>Went the natural approach at one time also including different vitamins, etc.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it lighten old scars, but it seems to reduce the amount of scarring of \\&quot;new\\&quot; acne.</li>
            <li>I recently found out retinol is basically vitamin A which is crazy good for keeping skin young looking.</li>
            <li>My skin did improve, but by the time the bottles were nearly empty and six weeks had gone by, my skin was exactly the same as when I started the system.</li>
            <li>many small bumps under the skin that don&#x27;t become full fledged white heads, uneven skin texture and color, but not much scarring.</li>
            <li>And I can&#x27;t stop touching them, which makes them worse.  </li>
            <li>Expect things to get worse before they get better.</li>
            <li>If you just take it kind of slow at the beginning and use only the minimal amount each time then you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 43, female, have had mild cystic acne off and on for 17 years, and in the last few years my go-to remedies (antibiotics and Retin-A) completely stopped working.</li>
            <li>I have three girls, they love this product, and in the past have used  Pro-active only to have dry skin, and irritation.  </li>
            <li>I read all of the amazon reviews for this product and decided it was the most feasible to get in a short amount of time to start treating my horrible acne ASAP, plus it had the most positive reviews of any acne product.</li>
            <li>My skin is very oily, as mentioned earlier, but apparently not very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Seriously guys, I have had so much success with AcneFree that I&#x27;ve felt the need to come back to this review multiple times since I first posted it 4 years ago and</li>
            <li>At first i noticed a difference i was breaking out alot less</li>
            <li>first the pimples diminished, then the black scarring started to fade, and now it&#x27;s as if he never had acne.</li>
            <li>It can leave my face a little shiny, but nothing a little powder won&#x27;t fix :)     [...]    </li>
            <li>AcneFree product worked better than other products I used in the past.</li>
            <li>AcneFree uses Benzoyl Peroxide to treat you acne instead of Salicylic Acid, which is the active ingredient in many if not most of your over the counter acne treatments.</li>
            <li>The only active ingredient in this product is exactly that.</li>
            <li>Just use a piece of ribbon and pull it back gently till your ready to go out and just use a small bobby pin to pull the bangs.</li>
            <li>Her face is a hot mess.  </li>
            <li>For the past 10 years, I have been fortunate enough to not have difficulties with acne except for the occasional zit.  </li>
            <li>Anywho, finally went to proactive and my face was back to normal about a month later.</li>
            <li>I think other products work better (although a little more expensive) and kinder on your skin than this one.</li>
            <li>The lotion does tend to make my face a little greasy, so I try not to use very much of it.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is very concentrated, and you should follow the directions VERY carefully.</li>
            <li>My son is 15 years old, African American, and had a severe case of acne on both sides of his face and on his forehead.</li>
            <li>only wash that has actually reduces acne completely</li>
            <li>In several weeks the product cleared up the cystic acne I had all over my chin and lightened the scars from old spots at the same time.</li>
            <li>It came back and it felt worse and more of a hassle.</li>
            <li>None of these worked for me, and most actually made my skin worse.     </li>
            <li>It did not dry out my skin at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done it and it dried my skin out to the point where it hurt to smile or make any facial expressions.</li>
            <li>There was a little discomfort the first week I used it, which my sister who gave it to me told me about.</li>
            <li>I would recommend going to a dermatologist because i&#x27;ve tried Proactive and several other off the counter treatments and nothing really works.</li>
            <li>in early November I happened to stumble upon this product.  </li>
            <li>It may not have looked severe to other people, but it felt pretty darn severe to me after dealing with it for so long.</li>
            <li>my skin was becoming worse with pustule breakouts all along my nose and chin.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a harsh product, but if you can stand the burning over the first few uses and are willing to accept drier skin, try this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I tried Proactiv and it was good but very expensive.</li>
            <li>He did have a little burning and drying at first, but only for the first few days.</li>
            <li>I have been using AcneFree day and night for the last 5 weeks and have not had a single new zit.  </li>
            <li>hope this works for other people, particularly people over 40.</li>
            <li>I have extremely oily skin and still suffered through painfully dry skin through the first week of use.  </li>
            <li>Overall I really like this product, but I am currently looking for other products.</li>
            <li>I looked up all the active ingredients of most acne medications and then spent a few hours in CVS reading the packaging over every acne clearing medicine on the shelf.</li>
            <li>i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for those with dry or sensitive skin and acne.  </li>
            <li>The key to any acne product is that it works in the long term, and so far it seems to be doing just that.</li>
            <li>But it was a waste of money and didn&#x27;t make any positive difference for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>Not only did it clear my pimples, but it has really started to repair damage done from pimples I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li>This got my skin back to normal with minimal acne present.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin so anything I use has to be mild, non irritating and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Of course the bottom line is results, this product absolutely cleared up all my acne in a little under a month.</li>
            <li>In addition, after a couple weeks of use I noticed that the Step 4 retinoid cream wasn&#x27;t doing much for my skin, in fact it seemed to make my forehead break out a little.</li>
            <li>The Toner usually empties first but pour about 4-5 drops on a normal size cottonball and it should last closer to the other bottles.</li>
            <li>I was ecstatic, but had experienced these results with other topical treatments, only to be let down a week or so later, when my skin would eventually return to its angry self.</li>
            <li>To get that deep down clean just in case the face wash missing anything.</li>
            <li>I have more painful breakouts now and are very embarrassing.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great products.</li>
            <li> My daughter is so happy and confident now!!</li>
            <li> Better yet, it&#x27;s one of the cheapest acne systems out there!!</li>
            <li> I love it, and you will too!!</li>
            <li> The Retinol cream is viscous, but it blends into the skin very nicely.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m happy to say that AcneFree Severe has done and is continuing to do an amazing job!  </li>
            <li> The Mask is amazing!</li>
            <li> As a side note I have started using Lerosett, an organic clay mask/face wash skin care line and let me tell you it is amazing!</li>
            <li> It is working amazingly well!</li>
            <li> So I hung in there with it, and now, after about 6 weeks of using the product, MY SKIN LOOKS AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Truthfully, it&#x27;s the best over-the-counter acne treatment Ive used to date.</li>
            <li> The best part about it is you can wear the repair lotion all day without ever being able to see it.</li>
            <li> But, as I said, you need to make it part of your healthy lifestyle for the best results.</li>
            <li> great shipping time and good tracking.</li>
            <li> I know most benzyl peroxide treatments work best for oily</li>
            <li> My beautiful skin is infested with cysts and almost any kind of acne that exists, I would all bouquet of acne</li>
            <li> Good stuff just remember to moisturize</li>
            <li> and you should be good to go.</li>
            <li> but all in all this product worked good for me.</li>
            <li> Good price, and</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see if that turns out to be a good thing or not.     </li>
            <li> To be fair, I tried it for a month.  </li>
            <li> I counter acted this with stopping the treatment for two days and used a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> On Amazon it was listed in stock, so it was surprising when I received the email about it being delayed.</li>
            <li> It got to the point where the antibiotics were also killing my good bacteria</li>
            <li> So how good was it?      </li>
            <li> My doctor has prescribed oral antibiotics which did show some improvement but not for a good stretch of time.</li>
            <li> a good non-comedogenic foundation (I like</li>
            <li> feels good</li>
            <li> And I increase my consumption of good fat, protein.</li>
            <li> Good seller,  no problem at all</li>
            <li> It works really good.</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> This acne system works fairly well.</li>
            <li> I started the product during PMS (which may or may not have been a good idea).</li>
            <li> 10% is very potent as another reviewer already stated.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and as it says its better than proactiv.</li>
            <li> Yes I love this product , been using this for months and have gotten great results.</li>
            <li> I honestly picked it out of all the products because it was in a bright package and on sale.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased by this product.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff and the price is GREAT</li>
            <li> They are fast at shipping, always on time, quality is always good, you get what you pay for, and the price is always the best.</li>
            <li> Love my skin!</li>
            <li> I love Avacados!    </li>
            <li> Worked wonders that many others could not do!  </li>
            <li> Make sure you use the Toner and the Moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still breaking out, and even more of my face is covered with acne!</li>
            <li> love this kit!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> So glad i found this product!</li>
            <li> I have tried Pro-Active, for me, this works MUCH better !</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ll have to cover the redness with make-up, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore and looks 75% better!...</li>
            <li> This is a great product I strongly suggest it.</li>
            <li> This product was an amazing buy for its price.</li>
            <li> Step 4 - Skin feels amazing after waking up.</li>
            <li> and I have seen an amazing improvement.</li>
            <li> Amazing results, at that.</li>
            <li> This product was simply amazing.  </li>
            <li> Amazingly, I did not find this line to be drying at all</li>
            <li> My skin wasn&#x27;t working well with salicylic acid, so I purchased the AcneeFree treatment system with benzoyl peroxide and it works amazing.</li>
            <li> Its AMAZING</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I dont leave comments often but after one week my skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li> So why is this so amazing?</li>
            <li> and it has worked out amazingly</li>
            <li> After using this for three Weeks the results where amazing but still not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I was able to put up with the roller-coaster success of MaxClarity because sometimes I would have perfect skin that would boost my confidence...</li>
            <li> but this product really is the best...</li>
            <li> it dosn&#x27;t hurt to make your own diary and mark your own findings.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own  </li>
            <li> I have noticed with this product that my face cleared up nicely.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> so I cleanse and tone with the acnefree product in the morning and use my own moisturizer and then at night I cleanse, tone, and put the lotion on.  </li>
            <li> You can always skip a day of the medicated lotions and it&#x27;s still effective...</li>
            <li> It can heal any kind of acne.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with my skin, it&#x27;s even better now than it was before I started breaking out.  </li>
            <li> Keep lip balm handy as it dries out your lips too.  </li>
            <li> my God, I&#x27;ve got to get the doctor for this\\&quot;\\&quot; -kind of skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried every kind of product out there including both doctor-prescribed and over-the-counter.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> I honestly couldn&#x27;t believe it....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle, and it&#x27;s not as good as combining a sulfer wash with retin-a and benzoyl peroxide - but my skin looks better than it has in awhile.</li>
            <li> This acne kit effectively reduces severe acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright, it does work but not that effectively.</li>
            <li> I received this product quickly and in great condition.</li>
            <li> As someone who has been struggling with acne for years and wondering why I&#x27;m not the lucky girl that has pimple free skin with no effort, I hope this product works!!!    </li>
            <li> One absolute recommendation when using this product is to use a VERY GOOD moisturizer day and night.</li>
            <li> U can damp your face and wipe with the moist towelettes and feel real clean ..</li>
            <li> I have to say, so far, it seems awesome!!!</li>
            <li> So far very happy with the immediate results!</li>
            <li> (makeup wouldn&#x27;t cover it the first day I got the blemish, the day after I started using the Severe kit, makeup covered it beautifully).  </li>
            <li> very happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> Works better than Proactiv and the value is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is probably the most effective thing I&#x27;ve tried yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got adult onset, and after being off Rx acne meds for a couple years this is the best OTC stuff I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Pro-Active may cost more, but it is much more effective on my skin.  </li>
            <li> daily.(Tastes great hot or</li>
            <li> I bought this product for the first time ever and it worked great -  </li>
            <li> If you have skin like mine, you know what a huge, amazing thing this is.     </li>
            <li> I get more compliments on my skin ..</li>
            <li> One day, I came across this product and decided to give it a try since it advertised that it was \\&quot;Better than Proactiv\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> so i made sure to moisturize them all throughout the day.</li>
            <li> acnefree may be just what you&#x27;re looking for :)</li>
            <li> I have had acne since I was 12, although I let it go untreated most of that time.</li>
            <li> so I felt confident I could handle an over the counter severe acne treatment kit.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still using it 2 years after I found it :)</li>
            <li> I will make sure to write another review in a couple weeks to document the affectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li> This allows me to skip the 10 minute waiting time after application of Step 2, and it seems to be helping my skin along even more.</li>
            <li> :)    </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I came across this product at Target and decided to try it (for 1/3 the price of ProActiv) and I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I can almost tell, I used the Step 3 lotion more than what I should.</li>
            <li> My skin looks the best it has ever looked in my entire life.</li>
            <li> its 3.5% sulfur and copper, Better than the proactiv Mask</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS POTENT.</li>
            <li> I tried so many acne systems over 9 years</li>
            <li> Was glad for that tip and thought I&#x27;d share.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s hope it doesn&#x27;t just \\&quot;re-transfer\\&quot; like this one did!:)</li>
            <li> I researched many products and decided to give this a try....</li>
            <li> I am hoping that this combination will work better for me.     </li>
            <li> product seems to be more of a retroactive treatment than preventative, because I am still getting a pimple or blemish here and there, but it clears them up</li>
            <li> Already my face is looking and feeling better.</li>
            <li> My face never got better.  </li>
            <li> but instead I have more acne.  </li>
            <li> I have used Proactiv for over a year and still had blemishes, with Acne Free my face cleared up in two weeks!</li>
            <li> and you will be touching your face again.</li>
            <li> Also, be sure to wash your face of the benzyl peroxide lotion before bed</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> and I am severely allergic to most soaps and most acne products</li>
            <li> and I noticed my face is already looking better.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, I&#x27;m not saying Proactiv doesn&#x27;t work--it does for some people, I&#x27;m sure.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.     </li>
            <li> This lotion is not oily whatsoever and really does a great job at fixing the moisture balance without causing a breakout like most face lotions I have used.          </li>
            <li> and i see a lot of reviews saying that it clears up MOST acne in 1-3 days</li>
            <li> For the most part, it has stopped breakouts from emerging.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s helped quite a bit. :)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> None of the products irritated my skin any more than it already was.</li>
            <li> For some reason, I seem to use more of those two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My breakouts would mostly be on my cheeks, chin, forehead and around the edges of my nose.  </li>
            <li> My family knew too many people that were on Accutane that had issues with it</li>
            <li> There was no makeup or magic solution to fix this problem.  </li>
            <li> I love how this system has 4 separate parts that you can use whenever you want.  </li>
            <li> Words truly can&#x27;t explain how satisfied I am about this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this system.</li>
            <li> But overall Iam very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> plus this one smells better.</li>
            <li> you also get more with this product than proactiv.</li>
            <li> Used it for 7 days, after the 7 days, my acne is clear,and it made my skin real smooth, But i think too smooth.</li>
            <li> Also, make sure your skin condition is indeed severe; that may be why it didn&#x27;t work so well for me.</li>
            <li> Better than proactiv because you wont keep getting billed every month, you can order it when you need.</li>
            <li> The four-step process is simple to follow and feels excellent on my face.  </li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> Within a couple of weeks my skin even became smoother, softer, and more even-toned.  </li>
            <li> LOVELY.</li>
            <li> I saw the acnefree severe product at Target and thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try one more product.  </li>
            <li> I have been having problems with acne, mostly my cheeks and chin area, after stopping birth control age 28.  </li>
            <li> Also, be sure to apply sparingly.  </li>
            <li> husband noticed my face looked better in just one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Nothing worked better than this.</li>
            <li> i have even tried the milder version of the acne free system and didn&#x27;t have as good results as i get with the severe acne free system.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Okay</li>
            <li> I tried over the counter treatments i tried spot treatments and though they they vanish SOME pimples more and more and more just kept appearing</li>
            <li> SURE YOU READ THE DIRECTIONS.</li>
            <li> Glad she didnt though,</li>
            <li> I love the pH toner</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much better than the proactiv one.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and then it burned and it broke out even more.</li>
            <li> i picked this product up at wal mart for cheap and just like all acne treatments they clame them to be the miricle cure!</li>
            <li> love how the retinol smooths your skin at night and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed the more I put on, the clearer my skin is in the morning.  </li>
            <li> and after that you&#x27;ll be glad you stuck to it.  </li>
            <li> So we continue our search for a better product, for him anyways.</li>
            <li> sure if the items were expired,</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll be sticking to this for a while. :)</li>
            <li> (side note do not use a lot of this more cream</li>
            <li> This works better for me than the stuff I was getting from the doctors.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference - as soon as one would go away, two more would pop up.  </li>
            <li> and I figured if I was pleased, why rock the boat?  </li>
            <li> - I was a bit concerned after switching from ProActiv to AcneFree because I felt the AcneFree wash did not have as many grains as the ProActiv and</li>
            <li> was concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t work as well - it works BETTER.  </li>
            <li> - AcneFree didn&#x27;t come with the many instructions provided by ProActiv.  </li>
            <li> I wonder if those who have had issues with this product drying their skin out are using more than that?  </li>
            <li> and i really love this product.</li>
            <li> but it looks and feels better too.</li>
            <li> and you need to use it constantly and be patient to get the best results!.</li>
            <li> I love this product.    </li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> but AcneFree products just work better.</li>
            <li> Like I said, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> worked ok for about 3 days &amp; after that no difference</li>
            <li> I have so much more confidence now...</li>
            <li> you will be ecstatic with your results! :)</li>
            <li> Many dermatologists have recommended Accutane, but that is where I drew the line - too risky and requires blood draws every 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I tried many treatments, with no results.</li>
            <li> Not prefect, if you don&#x27;t do everything, but still better than the rest if your inconsistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> But if you have so many pimples, maybe the lotion makes sense.</li>
            <li> / forehead a lot more</li>
            <li> You have been warned. :)</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this acne treatment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much more affordable and comes with the 4th product.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to always use sunscreen with either this stuff or with Proactive.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend using 2 to 3 times a week in order to get the best results.</li>
            <li> whatever it is, made me breakout even more.</li>
            <li> I have been acne free for 4 years now!</li>
            <li> It seems like this stuff works better than proactiv for acne.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> and she says it really works great.</li>
            <li> :  )  hope the pics help</li>
            <li> I could see more skin than redness on his face.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t Wait to go to the concert now :)</li>
            <li> I Love It!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> And more - they create problems.</li>
            <li> and my skin is covergirl commercial flawless.</li>
            <li> My face feels a lot better, but sometimes I look in the mirror</li>
            <li> Okay It DIDNT Stop ME From BREAKING Out</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of things for cystic acne and this product has worked faster and shown more results than any nonprescription item I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I am very excited to have found this product</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> Good product works very fast, and better than proactive.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my skin is  a lot smoother and is very effective on picking up dead skin that causes the skin to feel smoother which is always a good thing you want for you skin and any acne products you use!</li>
            <li> The texture is nice when going on- creamy and cool.</li>
            <li> and I am excited again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy to say that this Severe Acne Free System definitely works, my skin is clearer than ever.</li>
            <li> Clean your pillow cases as often as you can!</li>
            <li> We had tried so many other  products, including ProActive, and this system is the best.</li>
            <li> so far I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li> So far I am a happy customer.    </li>
            <li> Just invest in some great moisturizer if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I found what worked best for me was to purchase the strongest products I could find in the stores, but it never REALLY cleared up my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ok, i must warn you that i may sound like an infomercial, but i am hooked on this product for my acne</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Acne Free and would recommend it to anyone who is suffering with acne or break outs.</li>
            <li> I almost spent $80.00 on the Clinique Acne Solutions and am happy I tried this before hand!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very happy with this, most products I use work for a short time, and then my skin wins the battle with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would still absolutely suggest using a good moisturizer morning and night to combat the dryness of the benzyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re in your 30&#x27;s and are STILL dealing with acne, you start to wish for wrinkles, because who has wrinkles and acne, right?!?!</li>
            <li> The first 1-5 days more pimples came out from the woodwork, there were all over my face!</li>
            <li> Pros: Minimizes Pores, Easy To Use    Cons:</li>
            <li> Not dryness, and my acne was clearing up very quickly.       </li>
            <li> began using this product because my brother (who also has good skin) was raving about how this product heals his blemishes and keeps his skin healthy and clear.  </li>
            <li> People noticed a difference in my acne very quickly.</li>
            <li> May be too strong for some peoples skin</li>
            <li> This stuff is strong as advertised.</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t always work, but it should help steer you in the right direction, and sometimes give you much better information than a dermatologist (for free!).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li> I would honestly call it a miracle product because it&#x27;s ridiculous how awesome it works.  </li>
            <li> She tried the cleanser before and it is working fine</li>
            <li> my skin is fine, no rashes or irritation.</li>
            <li> After that experience I donated the rest to  my best friend and she began to get black spots on her face also.</li>
            <li> which seemed to have pretty good reviews &amp; thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> but it was fine nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff really kills acne bacteria and most of the time prevents breakouts from attacking again!  </li>
            <li> It is extremely potent and after 5 days of use my skin&#x27;s texture has completely changes and not for the better!</li>
            <li> , I just easily worked it out by following the instructions on how to use the product plus using some good day/night moisturizers by The Body Shop (I love their products).  </li>
            <li> Huge price difference.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best my skin has ever looked in my adult life.  </li>
            <li> and I am noticing a huge difference in my Acne.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> Within 4 days I noticed a huge difference in the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> After a week of using the product, I noticed a HUGE difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I like the acne free wipes to lo</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I do notice it keeps my skin supple and more colorful.</li>
            <li> I have learned how much my skin needs and how to effectively apply my products overtime.</li>
            <li> Sure, maybe it won&#x27;t work for everybody/every skin type, but it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Overall - I am happy with this product and will continue to use it...</li>
            <li> I love how non-abrasive the wash is, it leaves my skin feeling fresh and</li>
            <li> I have been using Acne Free Sever for about 8-12 months now and it has proven to work well for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Acne Free Severe for about 6 weeks now and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> Before using Acne Free it seemed like each morning</li>
            <li> Then I found Acne Free Severe Treatment.</li>
            <li> Now I incorporate oil free moisturizer in the morning.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s available at the store...</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a few week and my face looks its best in years.</li>
            <li> Before using Severe Acne Free, I used to go to a dermatologist because of never ending acne.</li>
            <li> My mom read reviews for Severe Acne Free and was convinced it would help, so we found a set at Walmart for $21.87.</li>
            <li> I got and used Severe Acne Free System on 12/30 [evening treatment]</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I started using an oil free, fragrance free moisturizer (olay regenerist), and that cleared everything up.     </li>
            <li> I learned that one of the recommended treatments by dermatologists is to use Retin A, which is a primary ingredient (retinol) in the Acne Free Severe Treatment.</li>
            <li> i tried the acne free severe treatment</li>
            <li> so I am really happy I found a product that I use and that actually works.</li>
            <li> It is not visibly noticeable, but if you apply makeup soon after...your makeup will not go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> The size and redness of the pimple is greatly reduced the next morning.     </li>
            <li> i started using acne free severe for 4 days</li>
            <li> The breakouts I had started to disappear and they weren&#x27;t as red or inflamed either; this kit did a great job of soothing them.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, it kept my face moisturized and feeling smooth</li>
            <li> kept using it and got fantastic results.  </li>
            <li> Here are the three products: Yogi Skin DeTox Tea, Acne Free Maximum Strength, and the 0.5mm MT Skin Roller.</li>
            <li> the Maximum Strength Acne Free system morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> a scent/dye free laundry detergent (I like All Free and Clear)&lt;br /&gt;-wash</li>
            <li> If I am out of toner, I will use witch hazel in its place (the primary ingredient in the AF toner), while I am finishing up the others and preparing to order another kit.</li>
            <li> This was way more effective than Proactiv for me... and way more affordable (especially if you order on amazon and not in supermarkets where it&#x27;s triple the price!).</li>
            <li> overall happy with this product, would recommend.</li>
            <li> The 24 acne free system did not work for me like I would have hoped.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve landed on this page, you are fortunate.  </li>
            <li> until I read the reviews for Acne Free Severe.  </li>
            <li> so I tried Acne Free.</li>
            <li> I USE IT BEFORE USING THE ACNE FREE CLEANSER.</li>
            <li> the product being realtivly cheap, I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> LIGHTLY wash your face and rub in Step 1.  </li>
            <li> I run across Acne Free</li>
            <li> I am almost on my 3rd week of using this product, it has greatly improved some of the areas on my face.</li>
            <li> Use everything else as directed and add terminator 10 (an acne cream distributed by acne free).</li>
            <li> To curb that I bought some cheap non oil bassed lotion from target and cacked on my face at night before I went to bed.</li>
            <li> I hope this helps, and good luck to clear skin.</li>
            <li> Right now, I am trying Proactiv, and just by comparing both system&#x27;s ingredients I have a feeling that their \\&quot;Better than  </li>
            <li> so much for that!!!</li>
            <li> Overall, a very effective acne kit.</li>
            <li> The first thing i noticed that made it awesome was that a few hours after i used it, my skin just felt better...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done Clinique&#x27;s 3 step system, neutrogena, clearasil, noxema, and the original Acne free.  </li>
            <li> So far Im pretty happy with the results</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly mind because the towels I use for drying my face aren&#x27;t my &#x27;nice&#x27; towels, but this is something to remember.  </li>
            <li> And on a side not the L&#x27;oreal youth code dark spot corrector works incredible well with acne free.</li>
            <li> Poppy Soap makes an amazing line (her tea tree oil bar is especially nice for acne-prone skin) of natural, organic bars that contain essential oils and gentle ingredients.</li>
            <li> So I haven&#x27;t used the entire system but the spot treatment is amazing!</li>
            <li> I found this product because I was looking for a wallet friendly alternative to controlling acne besides accutane or seeing a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Okay, first of...</li>
            <li> For the first time in years, my skin looks healthy and glowing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is EXTREMELY potent and you will feel it after the first application.     </li>
            <li> What I have noticed is the discoloration from past acne flareups seems to be fading which I am very happy about.    </li>
            <li> Sounds familiar?</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell you how excited I am about this product.  </li>
            <li> and this stuff is worth trying!</li>
            <li> I was ecstatic the after just 24 hours of use, all of my breakout significantly diminished</li>
            <li> I tried ProActiv for a month and was pretty pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Once I started breaking out, I began using the original acnefree kit.</li>
            <li> There has been a significant improvement in my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> laugh lines easily if my skin is</li>
            <li> good thing is if you make regular and -light- applications of all the steps, it does well.  </li>
            <li> sure enough, it has been amazing.</li>
            <li> Nearly a month later, my skin looks practically flawless.</li>
            <li> In 3 days his face was clean.</li>
            <li> It works great with my skin and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> My face never felt clean using this product and I continued to break out.</li>
            <li> /Having a clean diet  </li>
            <li> Keep a sanitary environment when rolling and clean your roller afterward.</li>
            <li> It will clean up and heal severe acne after using it about 4 to 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> The PH balancing part if this system is amazing and completely changed the the look and feel of my skin!</li>
            <li> Simply the best and within 10 days a major improvement.</li>
            <li> First of all I&#x27;d liked to state, I don&#x27;t really have severe acne</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with the product because I have seen an overall improvement in my skin</li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I felt like I had to go out of my way to write a review - a first for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Just a quick clean up.</li>
            <li> and my skin really started to look better.</li>
            <li> But this seems true of all these types of products.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really help the acne, her skin looked way better before using this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this product so far, and will definetly continue to use it.</li>
            <li> after using this product my chin and cheeks are full of acne.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t see my dermatologist anymore, though he was sweet.</li>
            <li> it worked a full four months before losing its potency.</li>
            <li> I would use the spot treatment on existing treatments and I would have to say that is the only semi good product they offer: it dries up an existing pimple faster as opposed to using nothing at all.</li>
            <li> It is very cooling and refreshing.    </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good about this stuff.</li>
            <li> My face is REALLY looking better.  </li>
            <li> the ones I already had really havent gotten much better.</li>
            <li> I realized that my diet did not have enough good fat and protein to help the body to fight infection and cell regeneration.</li>
            <li> It seems to last a fair amount of time, maybe 2 months for one person, for the cost of it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is really a confidence booster.</li>
            <li> and I felt like the only thing it was good for was bleaching my towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also if you want to use the whole system as intended make sure you have cotton balls or pads for the toner (step 2).</li>
            <li> No bad smells either</li>
            <li> Been using the severe for about 12 months now, and have gotten about 2-4 pimples a MONTH, and not bad ones either.  </li>
            <li> Just be aware that it&#x27;s strong stuff that shouldn&#x27;t be underestimated.</li>
            <li> and I wanted a strong first attack.</li>
            <li> At first this stuff was kinda strong and irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> You can buy this system in some places for $20 and for the price of an average dinner, drink, &amp; dessert at a decent restaurant you can get the best looking skin in your life!     </li>
            <li> After one month of using this special combination I barely noticed any kind of difference.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, I cant live without it!</li>
            <li> If something less potent can get me close to the results of the product, I&#x27;m going to use it as I&#x27;m sure it would be better for my skin.</li>
            <li> Face looks fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Wash itself feels mild, yet creamy, with some granules.</li>
            <li> Even if your skin isn&#x27;t responding to the product as quickly as others, it seems as if AcneFree takes time (</li>
            <li> I find that using the acne spot treatment at night instead of step 4 clears up any stray pimples extremely quickly (2-3 days).</li>
            <li> I started using this product 2 months ago when I was 5 months pregnant.</li>
            <li> The product says not to use while pregnant unless consulting physician</li>
            <li> I also own an exfoliator by St. Ives, a cucumber rejuvenating peel-off mask and use Neutrogena Acne free foundation when I put make up on (it has saylic acid in it, one of the low doses of acne treatment).</li>
            <li> You will see results with this quickly but it&#x27;s not the silver bullet for acne issues.</li>
            <li> I would say when using mild acne treatments i would get about a lot of pimples with a bunch of redness on my face.</li>
            <li> I use Step1 and 2 twice a day along eith the Terminator Belmish Spot Cream (which you may have to buy separately for like $5, but if you&#x27;re lucky and look around sometimes you can find it added on to the kit as a \\&quot;bonus\\&quot;, but beware...</li>
            <li> Ive had mild to severe acne since 13</li>
            <li> It is a good exfoliant for everyday use, but I would recommend to also exfoliate with something more abrasive, once a week.</li>
            <li> AcneFree Severe Acne Treatment has shown tremendous progress over the course of a couple months of faithful use.</li>
            <li> I do warn people to find an excellent non-comedogenic moisturizer and commitment to drinking tons of water prior to starting use of this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s honestly the only cheap thing that works so its kool ✔</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway I&#x27;m really happy with this and would recommend it to anyone, and am getting ready to buy my second kit.</li>
            <li> My friends and family commented on how quickly my acne went away.</li>
            <li> I saw results quickly.</li>
            <li> Your skin looks better, like, instantly, and it just keeps getting better.</li>
            <li> I believe Step 2 is what contributes to most of the dryness because it&#x27;s a toner with alcohol as one of the main ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have had acne for over a decade and this product has cleared my skin quickly.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product to anyone seeking to keep their skin healthy and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product, it gives the same feeling as proactiv in which your skin becomes smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> normally don&#x27;t have the patience for a beauty regime that involves more than a couple of products</li>
            <li> The very first week I used this I noticed results.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m going to try switching over to the regular acne free kit for maintenance to be sure my skin doesn&#x27;t somehow get \\&quot;used\\&quot; to the acne free severe.</li>
            <li> So far, it works better than the original.  </li>
            <li> So whether you are using the Severe, Original, or Sensitive AcneFree, make sure you are not overdoing the lotion because this is your culprit to the skin dryness.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, this product maintains my clear skin perfectly!</li>
            <li> My skin is clear, it&#x27;s not as oily, I actually have people tell me how good my skin looks!  </li>
            <li> No unpleasant scent, whatsoever.    </li>
            <li> A cysteine(Lef.org, as the powder is very fine that can dissolve in water completely), vitamin C powder, sea salt in some water.</li>
            <li> however, after i started my new job, i was under a lot more stress.</li>
            <li> MaxClarity made my skin soft, and at some points I was completely pimple-free, it was amazing!</li>
            <li> My face is much clearer and I have much more confidence because I know the regime will provide consistent results.</li>
            <li> It is a long a process and my skin needs so many products to stay healthy and not have a break out...</li>
            <li> It is slightly drying, but just use a good moisturizer once a day and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> I figured my only true way out was to grow out of it or get some kind of laser skin treatment.      </li>
            <li> , I love that you can buy this in pretty much any Walgreens and Walmart</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recomend that everyone try it since it is very affordable and easy to find in the drug stores.  </li>
            <li> The clearing doesn&#x27;t happen overnight, but it can significantly help your skin in the first couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> Even the Skin Dr products were not that fast!!</li>
            <li> I now have deep scars from those humongous pimples that I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten had I not used acne free!!</li>
            <li> When I first started using the original AcneFree, I did all 3 steps every morning and every night...</li>
            <li> This all happened during that first week, so be patient!)</li>
            <li> and I saw results first thing in the morning!</li>
            <li> thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> The companies selling on Amazon seem to have higher prices for this item, so you may be able to find a better value at your local supermarket.</li>
            <li> Also, if you have sensitive skin I suggest you go with something more mild.</li>
            <li> and this product helps clear my skin, and leaves it feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li> If you have been using BP products for a while around 5 and 10% then you will be fine and this product will work very well for you aside from some drying.</li>
            <li> I really suggest the product for quick results!</li>
            <li> After one application of acne free, the redness was reduced significantly, and some of my more painfull bumps had gone down in size...which is huge.     </li>
            <li> Just swab lightly so you can really cover on your face without having to apply more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is absolutely amazing, I can&#x27;t even say enough about it.</li>
            <li> But after a couple of days, I can definitely tell some amazing results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It only takes about 3 days to see amazing results.</li>
            <li> I believe its worth just to try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now 22 years old, and I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne for most of my life.</li>
            <li> However, this may not work for everybody, so I would recommend experimenting with this step if you find Step 4 isn&#x27;t useful.</li>
            <li> I am no longer self conscious and can be more myself without worrying about how people see me.</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular, just a couple of zits on my forehead and shoulders, but enough to annoy me.</li>
            <li> this is the only kind of make up that dosnt cause a break out of any sort.  </li>
            <li> I rarely go out in the sun  5.</li>
            <li> I rarely have any stress    </li>
            <li> Guys, just try it once, just once and see how it will change your confidence and smile.</li>
            <li> First of, these medications are very potent and my left eye been itching since I started using this product because I think I accidentally applied some around my eye.</li>
            <li> Well.. I&#x27;m on day 3 of using this product and so far I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> All in all, so far my face is feeling so much better.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try for stubborn acne, and for those who cannot or do not want to go the \\&quot;pill\\&quot; route.</li>
            <li> The benzyl peroxide repair lotion is nice not only cause it puts moisture it but also works to prevent acne from forming in the day.</li>
            <li> After getting out of the shower, with my face freshly washed with Step One, I apply the toner with a cotton pad.</li>
            <li> and I rarely have a breakout.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t classify my skin as \\&quot;severe\\&quot; at all, in fact, my skin tends to be clear most of the time.  </li>
            <li> It will not be fun, but once your skin gets rid of all the gunk it has been hanging onto, the transition into clearer skin is practically</li>
            <li> Also, as another reviewer wrote, this is not for you if you have the rare breakout.  </li>
            <li> This product is worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have to start with a make up remover (I use Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser)</li>
            <li> I bought this product and have used it for about 18 hours and my face is really much more clear.  </li>
            <li> One more thing, we are all different and every skin type may show a different reaction to this product, so, even though I can tell the product has been working awesome for me since I got it, this is just and opinion/advice according to my personal experience.  </li>
            <li> I would still say this product is worth a try.  </li>
            <li> (I would say I&#x27;m an 8 out of 10, as far as \\&quot;severity\\&quot; goes, with 10 being the most severe</li>
            <li> DEFINETLY WORTH</li>
            <li> I am 21 years old and have struggled with acne most of my life.</li>
            <li> After reading some pretty good reviews I bought the severe treatment because I have struggled with breakouts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have used Clearasil, Pro-Active, Oxy, and countless other treatments, but this product has worked the best for me.</li>
            <li> At first I was worried because it seemed to be making me break out even more than I already did, but after about 2 weeks, my skin has completely cleared up!  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t magic but it was better than other products that our daughter had been using.</li>
            <li> IMPORTANT: find a good lotion that is oil and fragrance free and is good for sensitive skin, because this product will leave your skin very dry (to rid the acne) and that&#x27;s not good in the long run to healthy skin and kind of defeats the purpose of the product.</li>
            <li> couple warnings and tips:&lt;br /&gt;-AcneFree Severe is strong and it will dry out most peoples skin.  </li>
            <li> Yes, that&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> wait an hour or right before i leave for school/work i put on my moisturizer</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s 1/3 right now</li>
            <li> yeah right, this just might be another knock off thing like proactive.</li>
            <li> But God answered my prayers right on time so that by the end of summer break,when I go to school</li>
            <li> WTH, right??  </li>
            <li> , what&#x27;s another 25 bucks right?  </li>
            <li> Ive try diff acne tx, it makes my pimple erupt like volcano, then I bought thus product right away,.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s right for you.</li>
            <li> witch cleared it right up.</li>
            <li> This product works great in the first few weeks.   </li>
            <li> With this particular combination of things I have been acne free.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a great product and if you have mild or moderate acne</li>
            <li> (and it&#x27;s super cheap and available at just about every local drugstore.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> The wash works really well and leaves my face feeling clean without ruining my skin.</li>
            <li> Another suggestion that I highly recommend would be using an oil free moisturizer with the product.</li>
            <li> how much dirt it takes off your face, even right after I&#x27;ve scrubbed my face in the shower!  </li>
            <li> Excellent product and 2/3rds less the price of big box stores!</li>
            <li> you University Medical for making a product that actually delivers on its promise, is very reasonably priced and has given me the beautiful complexion I have tried for years to attain.</li>
            <li> I give my face a gentle rub for a couple minutes and rinse with cool water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many acne products such as Proactiv, Daniel Kern&#x27;s, and other various products with salicylic acid (Stridex pads) and the likes, and I found this to work the best out of all of them.</li>
            <li> So I got home and used the night one because it was night and when I first used the cleansing wash I could tell a difference right there and then.</li>
            <li> I was basically best friends with my dermatolgist who knew that my skin would need something new every other year, due to its becoming immuned to the medicine after awhile.</li>
            <li> night like 30 minutes later to make sure all of step 3 and 4 have absorbed..</li>
            <li> I have left overs from 3 boxes ago which I apply on my back and shoulders and chest with great results.</li>
            <li> Most recently I found temporary success using MaxClarity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several products in the past and this one seemed to worked the best to help clear up my very mild blemishes around my nose and does it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I would suggest a light oil free moisturizer with sunscreen after the regimen, in the morning only.</li>
            <li> The kit is really easy to use and comes with clear, easy-to-follow directions.</li>
            <li> I took many trips to the dermatologist&#x27;s office with him promising me one day where I&#x27;d have clear skin like the Photoshopped models that were hanging all over his wall.      </li>
            <li> The price is also reasonable and worthy.</li>
            <li> If I start with the make up remover and follow with the 3 AcneFree steps, I get a great cleaning and starting with the make up remover only adds a minute to the routine.  </li>
            <li> but I think hormones continue to get the best of my face and it reappeared a few years later.</li>
            <li> I will say, it is pretty strong but my usually sensitive skin can handle it.</li>
            <li> , I read the directions and ingredients very VERY closely.  </li>
            <li> I saw Acne Free on an ad while I was looking at some other face wash products and decided to read more about it.</li>
            <li> Trust me, if you have problem skin and want to try something new, this product is definitely worth a shot!</li>
            <li> Most reviews says it dries out your face, my face is was super oily so it didn&#x27;t start to feel dry until the 7th day.</li>
            <li> word of caution:  If your face is mild to dry, make sure you use a moisturizer between the morning and evening sessions.  </li>
            <li> As I mentioned it before, bear in mind that acnefree might dry up your skin, but you can work it out with a moisturizer and that&#x27;s a whole lot better than fighting acne!</li>
            <li> I will probably try to use the lotion again once I am no longer pregnant and see if I get a different reaction but for now the other 3 steps are working just great.</li>
            <li> When I woke up the next morning I could see a huge difference!</li>
            <li> Renewing Toner is definitely a vital component because its primary ingredient is Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li> Another great thing about it (for me) is the bottle for the Healing Lotion seems to last really long.</li>
            <li> I recommend using it after your first week of just STEPS 1-3, to get your skin use to the products.</li>
            <li> This is not a miracle product, but it does exactly what I was hoping it could do: control my acne, prevent breakouts, and promote skin health.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m nearing the end of the first week of using Acnefree Severe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff since 2008, and it has not failed me yet.</li>
            <li> Now after 2 weeks ,my face is REALLY clearing up!</li>
            <li> E, Biotin, and flax will really help skin a lot!</li>
            <li> The lotion burned for about the first week of application, then my skin got used to it.</li>
            <li> It worked at first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been exactly 7 days</li>
            <li> Thanks to AcneFree!    </li>
            <li> The moisturizer is EXPENSIVE, but it soothes the skin, and smells great!</li>
            <li> First week, OMG First week</li>
            <li> First off, this is my mother&#x27;s account.</li>
            <li> I used the 4 steps when I first got it and</li>
            <li> I am comfortable with them so far.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My daughers, who don&#x27;t have severe acne, love the regular AcneFree Treatment system.  </li>
            <li> This is the only brand I have been able to find that works for me...</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the benzyl peroxide because of my sensitive skin and let me say my concerns were justified.</li>
            <li> I do still get the occasional break out, but my skin is 10X better than it has EVER been.  </li>
            <li> (non-acne-medicated) first, then wash with the acnefree cleanser.  </li>
            <li> So, wash the makeup off with a make-up removing cleanser first, then use the AcneFree system.  </li>
            <li> No problems the first week.</li>
            <li> However, I continued using it because what a lot of acne medications do first is bring all impurities to the surface as part of ridding your acne.</li>
            <li> I tried the severe acne formula first because nothing else seemed to be working on the persistent buggers</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting zero breakouts, and my skin feels smooth and soft.   </li>
            <li> Maybe I was in the sun more, maybe my diet improved, maybe I was just finally growing out of acne.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions and used it exactly as prescribed for 3+ weeks.  </li>
            <li> but by that point you should be able to just use a regular face wash again.  </li>
            <li> For the first time ever that I can remember, I can walk out of my house with confidence in how my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> This product cleared my face with consistent use after about two months.</li>
            <li> First off, ive never bought any acne products in my life, so I can&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> One kit lasted me 6 months and my skin is soft &amp; smooth.  </li>
            <li> Find a friend (or better yet, a sibling) with similar ancestry to you who has already overcome your problem and ask them how they&#x27;ve done it.</li>
            <li> Makes me think the kid packing it decided to sneak into the john and test it out first.</li>
            <li> Not meant to be funny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to prolong the life of the package that I bought by only using it when I start to break out.</li>
            <li> (Which seems to be pretty standard for more people.)</li>
            <li> If you decide to use AcneFree, make a commitment not to panic for the first month.</li>
            <li> It works about the same as Proactiv, but more affordable.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the product was at night</li>
            <li> My scarring has faded significantly, my face looks baby soft!</li>
            <li> This is a life saver, first time I&#x27;ve written a review for anything.</li>
            <li> It peeled like cracy the first two weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not harsh and is pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> but it instore, it will be much cheaper!</li>
            <li> First of all on Amazon it is $14.00 cheaper than any of the retail stores</li>
            <li> I now make sure that I use this stuff religiously morning and night!!</li>
            <li> I used it exactly as directed for a month and saw no improvement, so was beginning to be once again discouraged.</li>
            <li> Except this time the results are real!  </li>
            <li> , many nights I forget to use the last step (to use 10 mins after the toner).</li>
            <li> Even when I say screw it and don&#x27;t follows all of it&#x27;s rules is still works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I was not using it consistently at this point, but rather just when break outs occurred.</li>
            <li> I was better off before, actually.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to, then first try applying a heated spoon to your zit.</li>
            <li> Okay so I found this product at a local Walmart, and I saw that it said \\&quot;BETTER\\&quot; than proactive.</li>
            <li> FAST AND NO DRYNESS OR REDNESS!</li>
            <li> I WISH I WOULD HAVE TRIED THIS FIRST.</li>
            <li> the first week, my skin was a nightmare.</li>
            <li> Most definitely will purchase again!</li>
            <li> She has not had success with much else.</li>
            <li> I only wish they provided more toner.</li>
            <li> I stood in her bathroom watching as she did exactly what the box said to do.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin, which is really surprising.</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best $25 dollars I ever spent.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered with mild acne since I have graduated high school.</li>
            <li> I put off adding a review right away (even though I noticed results immediately) because I wanted to be sure I was going to have positive results long term.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very tall at 6&#x27;8\\&quot; and I have very large pores.  </li>
            <li> I used the original 3-step Acnefree since middle school and it worked fine all through high school too</li>
            <li> I recommend AcneFree to people who have tried other non effective acne products on their faces.</li>
            <li> My acne is not the kind that causes massive scars, but rather is just the small persistent bumpy kind.</li>
            <li> - You do tend to go through the toner more quickly than the other products.  </li>
            <li> I have tried almost everything (ProActive, Skin ID, Clean &amp; Clear, Clearasil Acne, etc.)</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and clean.     </li>
            <li> This is the only product that did really helped with my acne this product deserves more than 5 stars .. recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been following healthy diet and trying to avoid acne causing foods as much as I could and it worked.</li>
            <li> I found this to be true, right before I turned a corner for 2 weeks of major breakouts.</li>
            <li> There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a consensus between dermatologists about whether a &amp;#34;purge period&amp;#34; really exists, but in my experience it was very real.</li>
            <li> I have know been using acne free for four months and like the name I am acne free and know I only use the terminator 10 to keep my acne under control only using the full regimen once a week</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 2 and a half weeks, and already i have more confidence because my face has cleared up about 85%!</li>
            <li> I used the DeTox tea and Acne Free products for two weeks without rolling, and I saw improvements to my skin tone and texture right away, but the deep cysts remained.</li>
            <li> The medicines are potent and it will dry out your skin the first week you use it.  </li>
            <li> cuz i bet these positive comments about it are from paid spokespeople.</li>
            <li> Other than that I give this product my full reccomendation with consistent use it will most likely clear up most cases of acne.</li>
            <li> I have used Proactiv, clearasil, oxy pads, pretty much everything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not completely clear, but much better than I was with Proactiv.  </li>
            <li> It took a full 4 weeks to get consistently clear skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pretty much used everything, but nothing worked, until I tried out this product.  </li>
            <li> am a 32-year-old female who has experienced moderate adult acne.</li>
            <li> I barely wear any face make up, just some powder and blush and it looks so smooth.    </li>
            <li> PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of Proactive, which I have used in the past with good results.  </li>
            <li> I am very cautious about how I use this, and the original product, on my face since my skin is quite sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Good product, I&#x27;m too lazy to try anything else</li>
            <li> Now, my skin looks amazing with just a thin layer of light foundation and a little bit of concealer to cover up fading acne marks, plus it looks good ALL DAY.</li>
            <li> It gets absorbed into the skin VERY quickly, so you don&#x27;t have to wait around for it to dry.</li>
            <li> Within after the first day my red blemishes stopped hurtin and began to dimish Quickly!</li>
            <li> The pimples that I do get are much smaller, surface quickly and go away quickly.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t have issues with dry skin you will probably love it, but just don&#x27;t stop using then... ha.</li>
            <li> The strength of the chemicals will likely dry out and irritate most peoples&#x27; skin, so a oil-free, strong moisturizer willhelp combat that dryness.</li>
            <li> But nothing worked as quickly and completely as Acnefree.</li>
            <li> I still have just as many breakouts, but now my skin is also dry, peeling and itchy.  </li>
            <li> It can dry out skin, so I make sure to use a moisturizer, and that eliminates it.      </li>
            <li> I happened to be at Wal-Greens one day about 5 weeks ago and saw the AcneFree Severe to Clear System and bought it for $30 after reading some quick reviews.  </li>
            <li> Compare it to Pro-Active and it costs WAY less but just as effective.</li>
            <li> My sister recommended this to me a long time ago, and then this Fall I relented and bought this instead of Neutrogena Advanced Solutions (which I&#x27;d been using with some success for 2 years).</li>
            <li> I used ProActive for about 10 years in my 20&#x27;s for mild adult acne and</li>
            <li> For the weeks following, I would say that I have experienced about 1 pimple per week on average.</li>
            <li> Have not used long enough to give fair rating.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s happy that those gigantic red cysts had gone down a lot.</li>
            <li> I use 100% pure intensive healing moisturizing balm (pasting the link below).</li>
            <li> Immediately, it started to heal the pimples I had (large cyst like pimples).  </li>
            <li> and you will see results, I certainly did.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with PCOS this year, and am fairly certain that the acne I struggle with is a result of hormonal imbalances.</li>
            <li> AcneFree Severe may not be or everyone, but it has certainly worked for me.</li>
            <li> At first I used the acne free system as directed, but it was too strong for my skin, my face became raw and BURNED like nothing else I have ever felt.</li>
            <li> and my face has diminishing pimples on my cheeks and is not dried up nor feeling greasy but for the most part my face is pretty cleared up in only 5 days.</li>
            <li> And honestly I&#x27;d rather have dry, clear skin than oily acne skin.  </li>
            <li> only downside to this product is it does cause your face to dry out, and you will need a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> so i stopped and just used the basic drugstore products which worked fine.</li>
            <li> First of all, as other reviews have mentioned this product is much better than proactive.</li>
            <li> After giving so many different products (prescription and non-prescription) a go, religiously using AcneFree has cleared my skin up to a point where it is smooth, clear and clean enough that I rarely wear makeup anymore.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use half the bottle at once to get rid of your spots, it honestly takes a dime sized amount to cover your whole face and sometimes that&#x27;s too much.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m forty-ummmm,...a bit older ;)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even spray perfumes on certain parts of my body without it breaking out really</li>
            <li> We started paying our other medical expenses after that in full from our own pockets because we haven&#x27;t fulfilled our deductible for the year....</li>
            <li> It is better, but still pretty active.</li>
            <li> It was too much for her since she has pretty good skin other than the occasional blemish, though if she waited it out she would have adjusted too.</li>
            <li> I actually noticed that my skin was having more of a breakout than what I had to begin with; keep in mind that I don&#x27;t have major or even consistent acne issues.</li>
            <li> Huge cluster breakout on cheek, burnt around my eyes, red burns and irritation on my neck and chest.  </li>
            <li> I still have huge visible pores and will focus on minimizing them later .</li>
            <li> If I start using it consistently again the acne will clear up pretty</li>
            <li> Thanks.    </li>
            <li> With all that said, this is a fantastic product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Also, this kit did not overdry my skin as straight benzoyl peroxide treatments have done.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my son, and he reports that it works very well.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, the Toner should really be used in conjunction with the lotion.</li>
            <li> If you find yourself just going through bottles, you might be using to much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BTW, Proactiv really does suck.</li>
            <li> This supposedly niche product has performed very well in both fighting my acne and rejuvenating my skin for a $20 package ($18, now that amazon has the subscribe</li>
            <li> Please please please give this product a try because I have a feeling it will help you just as much as it helped me</li>
            <li> I have used proactiv and didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensative skin and was using it as directed.</li>
            <li> and I think by me scratching at it so much and then applying the product</li>
            <li> It also seems that step 2 really irritated my skin</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to get rid of stubborn acne.</li>
            <li> Avoid putting on make up till you really need to...</li>
            <li> /&gt;For a fraction of the cost, it&#x27;s worth having clear skin all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With that said, this product in combination with Clarisonic did absolute miracles for me.</li>
            <li> The #2 gets used up much quicker than the rest of the products.      </li>
            <li> After 2 weeks my skin started healing extremely fast.</li>
            <li> My skin is very oily and in the summer prone to severe acne.</li>
            <li> However, nothing really worked, until I found it.</li>
            <li> so I bought the whole system.  </li>
            <li> I would also recommend you putting aloe gel on your face because it really soothes and makes the redness and irritation go away.</li>
            <li> I would like to say thank you to Acne Free, you have given my son his confidance back.</li>
            <li> but nothing was really clearing up my acne.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how fast it worked because of the severity of my acne the day before.</li>
            <li> Severe Acne Free results happened the next day for me.</li>
            <li> They work very well.</li>
            <li> My husband has remarked on how much brighter my skin looks, and I am over the moon.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely, whole heartedly reccomend this product to anyone dealing with acne.</li>
            <li> They only had the Acne Free Severe product.  </li>
            <li> I really like that they include the retinol for use at night.</li>
            <li> It really does get the job done.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really notice any change in my acne.  </li>
            <li> FAST.</li>
            <li> After years of acne and being told I would have to go birth control or Acutane if I really wanted to take care of the problem, I tried this product and</li>
            <li> Anyone with acne will appreciate how much that</li>
            <li> All kinds of facial scrubs  - LED Light Therapy   -</li>
            <li> My skin is very oily and where some guys have a 5 &#x27;o clock shadow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing much improvement.</li>
            <li> I would NOT recommend this product, especially if you plan to wear some sort of concealer or make-up; the lotion does NOT leave your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I have not seen much improvement.  </li>
            <li> I go through the toner really fast though....</li>
            <li> Saw real results after two weeks of using this product.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very convenient...</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been working really well for me.</li>
            <li> this is a very drying formula that works on my very oily</li>
            <li> When I do wear makeup, I like to use a gentle cleansing bar to remove the makeup before I go through the AF steps.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even describe how much this worked for me.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s so much dirt hiding here and there in my pores and face its</li>
            <li> Yes, it cleared up that much.  </li>
            <li> It is really CLEANING your face with the face wash, using the toner.  </li>
            <li> This should be put on very generously.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Fast forward 2 days,</li>
            <li> and I havent really seen a change in my face.</li>
            <li> but I really dont have a whole like ot faith in it now.</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews but given how much I rely on reviews, I figured it was about time</li>
            <li> so I was ready to do it......</li>
            <li> It is not drying, not irritating.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who needs a fast problem solver.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions absolutely correcly</li>
            <li> It really improves my skin.</li>
            <li> It really works for me and my skintype.</li>
            <li> (Walmart, Rite Aid &amp; Kmart).You can&#x27;t really beat the price.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> I have found this to be very helpful in and of</li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> I had very severe acne.</li>
            <li> REAL SEVERE, not just 5 or 6 pimples</li>
            <li> I got a bunch of cysts, which would get very infected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> IT WAS ONLY  AVAILABLE ON A MONTHLY REFILL BASIS.</li>
            <li> I DECIDED TO GO BACK TO USING THE ACNE FREE SEVERE KIT, I WAS USING IT</li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> THE PRICE IS REASONABLE, I SHUDDER</li>
            <li> Now, at 17, I was really becomming irritated with my acne and nothing working.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Proactive about 5 years ago, which didn&#x27;t really work too well for me, but I thought that&#x27;s how things just were.  </li>
            <li> I really hope that you found this review helpful.</li>
            <li> This product is much cheaper than Proactive and works just as well.  </li>
            <li> thanks. .  </li>
            <li> Product that works very well</li>
            <li> Ok, after finishing the entire package, using it morning and night, never missing a day, i&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that it hasn&#x27;t helped one bit.</li>
            <li> I used to run to the mirror as soon as I got up to see what was there, now I am rest assured to only find a clear, smooth face!  </li>
            <li> So far so good, I can see an improvement of my acne (under my chin) using this product, but as I woke up after applying it on my second day I saw my t-shirt on the mirror and its collar was totally bleached !</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I noticed a difference in a few days with the acnefree than I did in months with Proactiv.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I am not a huge fan of this step.</li>
            <li> I actually liked the morning lotion which does burn a little and feels somewhat sandy when applied, but it&#x27;s better than the oily feel I get with other products.     </li>
            <li> New is in quotations because, while I do still have acne coming in, I believe that most of the pimples that are showing up on my face are from cysts that were under the skin for a long time and beginning to surface.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!  </li>
            <li> so far i like the product because my face start to clearing out!!!</li>
            <li> I had very high hopes for this product, as I know many other users did.</li>
            <li> Now I know a lot of guys don&#x27;t use moisturizer, but honestly guys, this product WILL dry out your skin and which would you rather have, dry flaky skin or smooth soft skin?   </li>
            <li> I stumbled upon AcneFree Severe because Clean n&#x27; Clear Advantage was out of stock (which, by the way, worked to a point then became completely ineffective).</li>
            <li> I had some HUGE pimples and after 2 days of use they were almost flat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m not sure how they actually measured AcneFree Severe to be 4x better, but YES, it performed INFINITELY better than Proactiv for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Proactive and many other acne treatments.    </li>
            <li> I do caution others those (as many other reviewers have pointed out)</li>
            <li> I had run out of the original and went to my local Walmart to pick some up.  </li>
            <li> It is better than ProActive and other over the counter medicines.  </li>
            <li> MANY OF THE OTHER PRODUCTS IRRITATED AND DRYED</li>
            <li> I bought this off Amazon about a month and a half ago because of the many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> After clearing out some REALLY congested pores, aka having to deal with some new pimples popping up (nbd!</li>
            <li> All of my spots were smaller and not a single one was bright red.</li>
            <li> facial wash didn&#x27;t seem to clean my face, and it wouldn&#x27;t remove any makeup that I had on.</li>
            <li> I have acne mainly on my forehead and nose, and I also have very oily skin on my nose.</li>
            <li> I did get one bump around the two week mark, and I had some old bumps that took a full 4 weeks to clear up.</li>
            <li> I tried pills, topical creams, lotions, special face wash, mud masks (I&#x27;m a guy</li>
            <li> Make sure your face is dry completely before applying     </li>
            <li> When I do get that bad pimple once in a blue moon, I use AcneFree Terminator 10, which also works GREAT, but is hit and miss honestly.      </li>
            <li> I have used the original Acne Free product for the past year or so.  </li>
            <li> At first my skin gets clear, and tighter, not as oily.  </li>
            <li> I am just a normal person who has been very observant of my skin and have made coorelations between breakouts and the things I have done...</li>
            <li> I do not give the product a full 5 stars only because it does not do everything I want.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty young</li>
            <li> We had tried most everything out on the market all to no success.</li>
            <li> At night, is is very important to wait 10 minutes before applying the night serum-wash your hands again before the last step at night as 10 minutes is enough time for your fingers to build up oils</li>
            <li> My skin was super itchy and dry in the first two weeks.</li>
            <li> All in all, I was pleased and figured I could deal with the occasional small zit that could be covered relatively easily with make up.  </li>
            <li> I can be a brand new person!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m about ready for a new kit.  </li>
            <li> Also, you&#x27;re better off finding this at Walmart where I got mine for less.</li>
            <li> I purhased mine at Walmart for $20-something in November 2006 and still have more than half remaining of each product in the pack.   </li>
            <li> Still, he has asked me to buy this particular brand again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from Proactive, to prescription pills, topical medicine from dermatologists, and most recently, MaxClarity.</li>
            <li> three months faithfully, only to find that the most it did was transfer my acne colonies in a different direction.</li>
            <li> Let me give a super brief background about myself.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products, including Proactiv and the regular AcneFree for the last decade.</li>
            <li> Oh, 1 last note, use a white or cream colored towel and be sure that you&#x27;d be wearing a sleepwear you don&#x27;t mind being damaged by benzoyl peroxide...</li>
            <li> and I have had mild acne for ten years.</li>
            <li> Perhaps when it finally arrives it will be fantastic, but I have been asked to review it now, and this is my experience so far.</li>
            <li> A lot of people mentioned how quick they noticed a difference and for me it was the same way.  </li>
            <li> My evening supplements are Super Omega Fish oil, Basic Antioxident and</li>
            <li> 18 ans just recent started getting mild to severe acne all over my face.</li>
            <li> Mainly my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li> Luckily, my purge period was only two weeks.</li>
            <li> But after like 3 weeks I needed to order more toner, so I just got the regular AcneFree toner, a big bottle of it, on Ebay.  </li>
            <li> I want to start out by saying I don&#x27;t have severe acne all over my face just my chin mainly.</li>
            <li> the older I get.</li>
            <li> My skin began to look much better in a few days, the repair lotion really works.</li>
            <li> but you cant apply at morning because this treatment lotion is too white and doesnt absorbs quickly as like Proactiv STEP 3.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If my skin ever becomes very dry though, I&#x27;m pretty quick to apply another lotion to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After my first use my skin felt great, and over the last few days I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts, and the ones I have seem to be getting smaller.</li>
            <li> With the plausibility of dry skin due to the Benzoyl Peroxide, I DO NOT recommend warm or hot water as it breaks down a very fine layer of epithelial lipids that keep skin balmy and protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have been struggling to find a product that works, I highly recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend buying off of Amazon.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.    </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had to be put on Accutane my sophmore year for 6 months in high school</li>
            <li> However, I highly recommend trying AcneFree Severe before purchasing Proactive.</li>
            <li> I did not have a lot of acne in high school</li>
            <li> (high amount).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recomend this product</li>
            <li> Highly suggested.</li>
            <li> Purpose Dual Treatment Moisture Lotion with SPF 15 4 fl oz (120 ml)]], highly recommended)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m pretty impressed; I started off with worse acne, but things have settled down.  </li>
            <li> After a week or two, I really didnt see a difference other that the huge cystic pimples i now had from this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have tried proactive, clear skin and so many other products on both myself and my son and none of them have worked as well as this has.</li>
            <li> I do follow the instructions exactly as given and use no other product on my face except for eye makeup    </li>
            <li> (And actually receive compliments on what pretty skin I have!)</li>
            <li> I would say that I have mild-severe acne, although it has gotten a little better over time.</li>
            <li> And walking out with a clean and clear face definitely brings my confidence level up.  </li>
            <li> IF YOU ARE OF MEDITERRANEAN HERITAGE (I&amp;#34;M GREEK) AND HAVE STUGGLED WITH ACNE PRODUCTS FOR YEARS, BUY THIS AND CLEAN AND CLEAR</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, Acne Free is NOT proactive; if you dont use it ever single day or indulge in a Butterfinger or two, you WILL get new breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have tried: antibiotics/differn, clean and clear &amp; clear advantage acne kit, clearasil ulta acnes solution kit,lush,and OF COURSE PROACTIVE, which sucks the most by the way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to express in words how happy I am looking in the mirror now and seeing a clear complexion looking back at me.    </li>
            <li> I recommend you consider where in the world your particular ancestors lived and compare the environmental factors they were disposed to with where you currently live.</li>
            <li> This system works very well on my adult acne.</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old, oily skin and always experienced blackheads around my nose area, but lately I began to get big cyst like pimples around my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li> My acne vulgaris is gone and I have a clear face today, thanks to AcneFree.</li>
            <li> So if you have sensitive skin I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this, I&#x27;d recommend the non-severe version.</li>
            <li> It really did helped clear the acne that I had.</li>
            <li> Ultimately, I would suggest this product to anybody that can have fairly severe breakouts, but breakouts that have been temporarily manageable in the past.</li>
            <li> BUY A WHITE TOWEL, Benzoyl peroxide will destroy you&#x27;r towels, but its worth it. :]    </li>
            <li> (Not inconvenient enough to make me stop using it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only has it reduced the amount of white heads appearing on my face daily, but it is fading red marks remarkably well.  </li>
            <li> My sister had recommended this and we pretty much have the same type of skin...extremely oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from dermatologists to every OTC medication and topical on the marke with varying degrees of success.</li>
            <li> I notice my skin was not as oily as normal and does not shine as much as it normally would.</li>
            <li> One day at Target, I was browsing the Acne aisle as I normally do to try to find yet something else to try.</li>
            <li> While this may not work for everyone&#x27;s hormonal acne, I think it is worth a shot if you are struggling with moderate cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Although i still have a little acne ive noticed a huge positive change in the Size and swelling as well as the amount.</li>
            <li> I have the type of acne that usually pops up right before my monthly cycle, then takes forever to heal, and this product starts making a huge dent in the acne overnight.</li>
            <li> This product was very worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> the ONLY thing that i noticed (which is contradictory to other reviews i&#x27;ve seen) is that my skin is oilier pretty early on in the day, but that can be taken care of with oil-blotting sheets.  &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> It took about two and a half weeks or so before I really noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had clear skin all my life and after turning 20 I started getting some mild acne on my back and shoulders</li>
            <li> - Make sure you never use all four steps or you will likely dry your skin out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It did dry my skin, but I used a facial lotion with a sunscreen on top of this treatment program.</li>
            <li> After about a week and a half of madness, things started to clear up like magic.</li>
            <li> The product is strong so be careful if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> May be easier to order on line in the future, but I wanted to try it right away to see if it worked.</li>
            <li> Put 1 dab on each your left and right cheek and your forehead.  </li>
            <li> If you want quick results for something i would try this product, but if you want long term results, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve developed my own \\&quot;surgical\\&quot; intervention when possible, but the cyst has to follow a specific pattern to open with a sterile needle.  </li>
            <li> My final note is be sure to be consistent (at least a first).  </li>
            <li> My face had less visible pimples but way more painful bumps that were so huge that you really cant cover up with any kind of makeup.</li>
            <li> I used Proactiv previously which seemed to help at first but quickly lost its vigor</li>
            <li> so this is nothing new to me.</li>
            <li> And, it keeps new pimples from appearing.  </li>
            <li> and I do not have a new pimple at all.</li>
            <li> I live in the carribean and ordered it front amazon.com.</li>
            <li> As with anything new some adjustment is required-</li>
            <li> Any new ones:  gone.  </li>
            <li> Though I havent gotten any new brakeouts</li>
            <li> Where I live now</li>
            <li> Then I leave it in my purse and use it as a spot treatment if I feel a new breakout attempting to surface during the day.</li>
            <li> have tried ever store brand, birth control, doxycycline, new make up, no make up, dieting, and so on and so forth.</li>
            <li> Am hoping once all my zits clear up the pain will go away...will give it a few more days and see.    </li>
            <li> When putting on the Toner, you should be able to feel the elasticity of your natural skin return and it should ameliorate any dryness or burning with a few swabs applied from a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> It does dry out your face a bit, but I have super oily skin</li>
            <li> Since twelve years old, I have had issues with acne, particularly blackheads.  </li>
            <li> I will admit I did skip a few days at a time sometimes, but this product definitely showed nice results.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product because I was really breaking out everywhere, making it very embarrasing when working in a medical environment and just being around family.  </li>
            <li> I have had acne for a long long time, many years.</li>
            <li> Just make sure not to use to much of the product; a little really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> If you are struggling with frequent breakouts that don&#x27;t seem to be clearing up, I would HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have not had skin this clear since high school</li>
            <li> Benzoil Peroxide (please excuse the spelling)I am really depressed that I listened to the advertisement on the box, that it was better &amp; faster than Pro Active.</li>
            <li> the next morning my face felt smoother and the right side of my face looked almost clear.</li>
            <li> My skin is almost completely clear now!  </li>
            <li> My skin is exactly the same as it was 2 months ago.</li>
            <li> As with any acne treatment the key is being consistent.</li>
            <li> First day I thought it was working  2nd Day</li>
            <li> Consistent use is absolutely key.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first because people said it burned your face and is only for people with severe acne.</li>
            <li> Other than that I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product and would recommend to anyone with moderate - severe acne.</li>
            <li> After putting my dermatologist visits on hold because of the expenses, my acne did not fail to come back.</li>
            <li> Normally it takes about two weeks for one of these to clear up (with or without treatment).</li>
            <li> 2.Try not to touch your face, especially during the first week of treatment as this will irritate the obstructions.  </li>
            <li> 3.Before washing your face, take a hot washcloth and drape it over your face (this will open the pores) for about a minute.</li>
            <li> cause the package is only 20 and some retinol can be pretty pricey for quality stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many acne products in the past</li>
            <li> Do NOT waste your money on this!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product, and WOW!</li>
            <li> At first I was scared to use it because i seen a couple reviews that said it burned their skin and made their face red.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first day I only used 1,2,3 day and night to get my face introduced to it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried alot of different things, and at first they all would work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv, and multiple other OTC acne products, I tried Acnefree and it worked better than anything.  </li>
            <li> I rather use this than pay $65 to $100 for over priced products that do the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> Completely cleared my skin!</li>
            <li> First of all when I went to buy it, it&#x27;s was only $5.00 dollars at five below.</li>
            <li> This only lasts about the first week or two though</li>
            <li> O M G all I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li> At 28, I felt that I was TOO OLD to be having these problems!  </li>
            <li> Use it daily and it may be too much acne medication for your skin!</li>
            <li> Go easy with the roller if you are under 40 and roll less frequently.</li>
            <li> See other websites on how to use and clean your roller.</li>
            <li> my face has begun to clear - no new cysts and the old ones healing more quickly than usual.  </li>
            <li> New acne was reduced to nothing and old acne started clearing up.     </li>
            <li> My son took before pictures and a new one and was surprised at the differences.</li>
            <li> his acne is just slightly improving from the huge amount he got from using this product.</li>
            <li> The price is great for the product - At this rate, it looks like I will go through a package about every 2-2.5 months which makes it less than half the cost of ProActiv for the same amount of product.</li>
            <li> I suggest you do STEP 3 less or start using an oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Now that I am pretty much clear, I only use the products every couple days, using milder alternatives in between.   </li>
            <li> havent been long enough to be acne free yet</li>
            <li> , im talking about 20 or more big zits, cyst, pain under face, WHO cried several times alone in the toilet because of acne.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, I didn&#x27;t develop dryness, redness or any other kind of discomfort.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I&#x27;ve used a million acne treatments, and this is one of the first ones I&#x27;ve ever used that didn&#x27;t make my face 10 times worse before it got better..</li>
            <li> Initially made my acne worse and took 6 weeks to show results, but was incredibly effective!  </li>
            <li> within the hour my skin looks less red and more clear!</li>
            <li> but I cannot blame this product for that because I have a very active and somewhat stressful lifestyle filled with dirt and irritation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was VERY tempted to stop using this product during my first week of use because my skin dried out SOOO much</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and I have new breakouts almost daily - ah the wonders of genetics.</li>
            <li> After my face stared to clear up, I found that ANY face scrub will due, and you could actually skip the repair lotion and use the Alba Moisturizer by itself,, but Unfortunately you can&#x27;t buy the acne medication by itself,, but regardless, it&#x27;s worth it to get the best skin possible for me.    </li>
            <li> It really help my teenage daughter clear her face!</li>
            <li> But I used moisturizing cream for a few days and it was fine after that.</li>
            <li> The only OTC product that really works for my 17 year old son!  </li>
            <li> So I only purchase items with a large review</li>
            <li> --when one colony disappeared, another appeared just slightly n/s/w/e from the original position.</li>
            <li> While it wasn&#x27;t as miraculous as I had hoped in terms of speed of improvement, after a significant amount of use, I&#x27;m finding far less breakouts occurring and the ones that do crop up disappear quicker.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about spending all that money, but was happy with the results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that within 2 weeks my skin will be completely clear (seeing as how my progress is now).</li>
            <li> Face is clear for the 1st time in months.  </li>
            <li> But still, I can see the clear difference after I used this product.</li>
            <li> , I always had a clear face.    </li>
            <li> Almost a week into the treatment and my skin was completely clear.</li>
            <li> Clear</li>
            <li> I was completely clear of acne in one month.</li>
            <li> my clear skin (from using Pro-Active) broke out in pimples.  </li>
            <li> Once again my skin is clear.  </li>
            <li> I replaced the toner with the Neutrogena rapid clear 2 in 1 toner when the one that came with the system ran out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did take about a 6 weeks for my skin to totally clear up from this kit.</li>
            <li> Now it was time to see if the system could clear up the monstrosity that my face became.  </li>
            <li> I have determined that staying clear is a lifestyle, no one thing will cure your outbreaks.  </li>
            <li> My skin:  clear as can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face is clear and I haven&#x27;t had one cystic pimple since.  </li>
            <li> But, if I follow through with each step and keep up the routine, my face is quite clear.</li>
            <li> It took about three months for my skin to gradually clear.</li>
            <li> But the instructions clearly say not to use the product on the eyes area</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not 100% clear, but people compliment me on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got the 4 piece sensitive skin + the Mask at a Proactiv kiosk at the mall</li>
            <li> I started getting acne in my early 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> If not, at least his face looks MUCH BETTER than before.</li>
            <li> I am 35 years old and have been suffering from acne since I turned an adult.</li>
            <li> Do Not get it anywhere near your lips or eyelids!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, do not put this stuff near your eyes they will burn.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT PUT THIS ANYWHERE NEAR YOUR EYES   </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m 23 years old.</li>
            <li> I had severe acne since I was 10 years old.</li>
            <li> I think I used a bit too much though when I got a rash on my upper cheeks.</li>
            <li> The night treatment, when put directly on a pimple, did nothing to reduce it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the combination of calming, natural ingredients in the composition of each product.</li>
            <li> None of it worked nearly as well as this.</li>
            <li> I am now 34 yrs old</li>
            <li> It really gets at any pimples that are already there and any pimples that are just starting to form.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s face isn&#x27;t completely cleared of blemishes yet</li>
            <li> it is nearly gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one really worked for him-and it was the only one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for one of my teenage sons, who has had trouble tolerating many of the prescribed pills to help clear his acne.</li>
            <li> I am not saying that this won&#x27;t work for you, but it DEFINATELY did not work for me or my friend&#x27;s 15 year old son.....</li>
            <li> Hence I thought I need to use a complete system to cleanse, tone and treat my skin.</li>
            <li> i am 44 years old and have suffered with severe breakouts for all of my adult life.</li>
            <li> in two weeks my skin had cleared and within a month was cleared completely.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s completely manageable.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t wash your hands frequently use a alcohol based sanitizer, this will help minimize the oil in your fingertips.   </li>
            <li> The next day, i could tell that this product went straight to work.</li>
            <li> I am 28 years old and have always had oily/problem skin.</li>
            <li> The texture of this is very creamy with tiny microbeads in it.</li>
            <li> I have now been using this kit for about 6 months now and my acne scars are nearly completely gone</li>
            <li> 15 years old btw</li>
            <li> And wow...</li>
            <li> I only really had it on my face</li>
            <li> so common colds would even take me 1 month or more to get rid of.      </li>
            <li> I was completely blown away.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it worked nearly as well as this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27, so some acne products currently on the market don&#x27;t work very well for me.  </li>
            <li> If you do NOT have sensitive skin but have acne that NEVER goes away...</li>
            <li> In just 3 days my face it 80% completely</li>
            <li> now i can use it on my whole face, but I only use it on my T-zone bc</li>
            <li> so i decided to take action before that and try this product.</li>
            <li> Paid 30+ dollars for this at my local walgreens  and was very pissed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 35 years old</li>
            <li> but overall my complexion is so much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been two weeks and the acne is completely gone.</li>
            <li> my pimples were clearing up and my skin was really soft, so</li>
            <li> Nothing completely got rid of it.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will totally clear up completely.</li>
            <li> Doesnt burn my skin even during a workout or after a workout or when i start sweating like that its only really one step you have to wash off</li>
            <li> I woke up this morning and literally said WOW when I looked in the mirror.</li>
            <li> Oh and whatever you do dont get it near your eyes.</li>
            <li> with a dermatologist, but he was too busy to see me</li>
            <li> I have cystic acne combined with REALLY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Complete strangers walk up to me and ask me what am I using on my skin.</li>
            <li> Now I can see hope that my acne will be completely eliminated soon.</li>
            <li> I eat my fat and protein early in the day with bile and HCL.     </li>
            <li> I figured out a home made recipe to get rid of old skin.</li>
            <li> After using this system my acne didn&#x27;t vanish, but did reduce considerably.</li>
            <li> I am 31 years old</li>
            <li> but i guess not, 26 years old now.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne since I was about 13 years old.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Above direction is for only who has REALLY SEVERE ACNE</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been 5 days and my skin is sooooo freaking soft and clear.   </li>
            <li> I am 31 years old and have had acne since a teenager.</li>
            <li> I took accutane in my early 20s</li>
            <li> I consider myself to have sensitive skin but didn&#x27;t have any problems with this product itching, peeling, redness or anything.</li>
            <li> my skin is soft, and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> My 16 year old daughter has struggled with acne since she was 12.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve rarely seen a product produce noticeable results in such a short amount of time after using it.</li>
            <li> It really is very simple to use and doesn&#x27;t take more than a few minutes to apply after the skin has been cleansed.   </li>
            <li> Honestly, none of the products seemed to work (and in fact made my acne worse)</li>
            <li> (which is surprising because my skin usually reacts to acne cleansers by getting red, itchy, dry in patches, oily in others.)</li>
            <li> I used the original acnefree and felt I needed something a little stronger.</li>
            <li> doesnt mean more acne removal give this about a 3 month test and see if you see a difference</li>
            <li> My face is feeling soft, my acne is less red and inflamed and easy to cover up with make-up.</li>
            <li> At first it didn&#x27;t seem to be working, all it did was dry out my skin a lot.</li>
            <li> with step 3: the first night I&#x27;ve used the product, my face was really tender and a little inflamed.</li>
            <li> Now 4 years after trying Acnefree Severe, my skin has never been so clear and my confidence so high while going out in public without makeup.</li>
            <li> The only draw back so far is that my face is turning red for a couple hours after treatment like I have a mild sunburn.</li>
            <li> I will start this review by saying I have tried so many difficult products in an attempt to resolve my mild adult acne -- nothing worked until I finally gave in and tried AcneFree.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin, and when I was in high school I played on the football team which required me to wear a helmet that was always sweaty and bacteria-infested from prior play.</li>
            <li> This balm is seriously amazing because you only have to use a small amount, the small jar will last you months because of that, and the balm consistency is SO MUCH MORE hydrating than a regular lotion.</li>
            <li> Only acne treatment that works on both my kids, unlike Pro Active this works fast and skins stays pretty clear.</li>
            <li> first week of using the 4 products in the package my face became EXTREMELY dry!</li>
            <li> It was always moderate but it moved to severe within 2 weeks for the first time since my teenage years.</li>
            <li> Initially it did seem to flare up around my period, but over time I started noticing that I had steady acne with worsening cystic bumps based on hormone fluctuations.</li>
            <li> It reminded me of my teenage days when I would have 8-10 (or more) pimples at a time - rather than my usual 4-5 during PMS.</li>
            <li> First step is to throw away step 1 (the facial cleanser) and replace it with morning burst detoxifying facial wash.</li>
            <li> During the first three days your skin is very dry-</li>
            <li> I tried this product first (other than different types of soaps and cleaners) and it worked VERY well.</li>
            <li> It does pack a noticeable \\&quot;cool burning\\&quot; sensation and it does feel a little like sandpaper.</li>
            <li> I highly highly highly recommend Neutrogenas Liquid Foundation that actually has acne medicine it.</li>
            <li> I have always had moderate to severe acne, from High school</li>
            <li> I did, however, try multiple solutions in high school to fix my acne-related issues.  </li>
            <li> At first I was worried because it would always be a little red and irritated for the first hour or two after going through the routine.  </li>
            <li> Also my face is very oily all day long.</li>
            <li> first i wet</li>
            <li> I tried everything to make my body go back to normal</li>
            <li> Normally you are supposed to use step 3 during the day and step 4 at night but since my acne is under control I decided to use the medications only at night (alternating each night)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really careful to follow the directions exactly since then and haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li> And, of course, last but not least, the cream.</li>
            <li> i received this product, i used about 10 days following the normal direction.</li>
            <li> I had a blemish on my chin that appeared the day before I bought the kit and after only 1 night and 1 morning of using it, it has gone down significantly</li>
            <li> I started the program with three nodules that have seemed to calm down quite a bit.</li>
            <li> At first my skin started to turn red and dry out on my forehead and near my chin.</li>
            <li> Use the Clearasi Ultra Cleansing Pads to get that deep down clean or anything you missed  3.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really hoping that this product works in the long run!</li>
            <li> But if you have tried a bunch of other products and they didn&#x27;t seem to work for you, or if  regular strength Acne Free worked well, but just not well enough this may be the product for you.</li>
            <li> , I woke with a new red spot on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have acne that is resistant to a lot of different types of remedies, so i figured \\&quot;what do i have to lose by using a new product?\\</li>
            <li> and I did not seem to be getting any new red spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> Messing with the steps actually caused my skin to have new</li>
            <li> well, is that to say that you have to live in the deep caves under earth, who never goes in the sun?</li>
            <li> Once this kit was used up, I didn&#x27;t order a new one and my acne came back.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, but this product has helped dry out my skin</li>
            <li> I developed acne as an adult, in my mid twenties</li>
            <li> But I guess for different people really you can have different reactions...</li>
            <li> The first use (at night) did cause minor facial swelling that subsided in about the time it took me to shower.</li>
            <li> I have only been using Acne Free Severe for a few days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 years old with moderate adult acne</li>
            <li> Then, I shelfed it for a while because I couldn&#x27;t take it but decided that upon my reuse of it, I would not use the entire system mixed because it&#x27;s too intense</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so you may need to try several products to find something that really works for you.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, I would try the regular version or the sensitive skin version of AcneFree.  </li>
            <li> I found this product and decided to give it a shot because I had seen good reviews of it, and within 3 weeks, my acne had cleared up and the harsh scarring was slowly going way.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to that as long as my face was clear and all of a sudden boom !</li>
            <li> my skin began to  not only clear, but it&#x27;s smoothing out and the tone is evening out now... something I thought I&#x27;d be stuck with even if I could stop the breakouts!</li>
            <li> The only downside I can think of is that step 4 comes in a small 1 ounce container and will most likely run out before the rest of the kit does.</li>
            <li> AVOID the eye and lip area, especially if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> but for him it&#x27;s a major improvement.</li>
            <li> After a while i found some proactiv on a major sale</li>
            <li> it hasn&#x27;t remained at THAT severe level, but I still have quite a bit of issues with my complexion, especially considering at my age its usually not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is short on dates and it seems like there are sending old products!</li>
            <li> Within the first 2 days, I could see that it was starting to dry out my pre-existing acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say the only issue I had at first was dry, flaky skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how strong the formula actually was.</li>
            <li> He has been using it for almost a year and the acné is still pretty active.</li>
            <li> I tried benzoate, retinol/tretinol and antibiotic treatments (minocyclin) with no significant success.</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit of effort considering it is a 4 step process, but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I have not had any bad reactions since and my skin feels really smooth and just looks better overall.  </li>
            <li> Within a week, the huge breakouts are now no more, and are starting to fade.  </li>
            <li> people struggling with acne in general</li>
            <li> At night, use the MT Roller once a week all over your face over the Acne Free Retinol Complex.</li>
            <li> I recommend this treatment for anyone who is suffering from acne in general.</li>
            <li> You can stop doing this once the problems clear up, or roll only when problems surface.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i am a 22 year old female</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I would say within a couple of days after commencing use of the products my breakouts were reduced to almost nil and shortly thereafter the problem was completely cleared.  </li>
            <li> I barely been using it a week.</li>
            <li> in all a decent product just wish it didn&#x27;t dry my face out and wish it prevented acne, not just cleared it up.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any drying with the severe though, which with my sensitive skin, surprises me; however(!)</li>
            <li> the eye area, as that skin is extra sensitive and dries out easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am 33 and have moderate adult acne.</li>
            <li> I only started breaking out with acne in my early thirties.  </li>
            <li> None of this happened to me, i guess only if you have an allergic reaction or really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway...also beware that the cleanser and the morning lotion contains benzoyl peroxide and it WILL bleach your towels, pillowcases, and clothes if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the regular one.</li>
            <li> - AcneFree will bleach your clothes or towels if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li> After having spent \\&quot;too much money with dermatologist\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Which is 10% Benzoyl Peroxide ($5) as well for acne spots that come up during the day (Just be careful how much you use...read the instructions on the box).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product that&#x27;s completely cleared my face up.</li>
            <li> Went the natural approach at one time also including different vitamins, etc.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it lighten old scars, but it seems to reduce the amount of scarring of \\&quot;new\\&quot; acne.</li>
            <li> I recently found out retinol is basically vitamin A which is crazy good for keeping skin young looking.</li>
            <li> My skin did improve, but by the time the bottles were nearly empty and six weeks had gone by, my skin was exactly the same as when I started the system.</li>
            <li> many small bumps under the skin that don&#x27;t become full fledged white heads, uneven skin texture and color, but not much scarring.</li>
            <li> And I can&#x27;t stop touching them, which makes them worse.  </li>
            <li> Expect things to get worse before they get better.</li>
            <li> If you just take it kind of slow at the beginning and use only the minimal amount each time then you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 43, female, have had mild cystic acne off and on for 17 years, and in the last few years my go-to remedies (antibiotics and Retin-A) completely stopped working.</li>
            <li> I have three girls, they love this product, and in the past have used  Pro-active only to have dry skin, and irritation.  </li>
            <li> I read all of the amazon reviews for this product and decided it was the most feasible to get in a short amount of time to start treating my horrible acne ASAP, plus it had the most positive reviews of any acne product.</li>
            <li> My skin is very oily, as mentioned earlier, but apparently not very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Seriously guys, I have had so much success with AcneFree that I&#x27;ve felt the need to come back to this review multiple times since I first posted it 4 years ago and</li>
            <li> At first i noticed a difference i was breaking out alot less</li>
            <li> first the pimples diminished, then the black scarring started to fade, and now it&#x27;s as if he never had acne.</li>
            <li> It can leave my face a little shiny, but nothing a little powder won&#x27;t fix :)     [...]    </li>
            <li> AcneFree product worked better than other products I used in the past.</li>
            <li> AcneFree uses Benzoyl Peroxide to treat you acne instead of Salicylic Acid, which is the active ingredient in many if not most of your over the counter acne treatments.</li>
            <li> The only active ingredient in this product is exactly that.</li>
            <li> Just use a piece of ribbon and pull it back gently till your ready to go out and just use a small bobby pin to pull the bangs.</li>
            <li> Her face is a hot mess.  </li>
            <li> For the past 10 years, I have been fortunate enough to not have difficulties with acne except for the occasional zit.  </li>
            <li> Anywho, finally went to proactive and my face was back to normal about a month later.</li>
            <li> I think other products work better (although a little more expensive) and kinder on your skin than this one.</li>
            <li> The lotion does tend to make my face a little greasy, so I try not to use very much of it.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is very concentrated, and you should follow the directions VERY carefully.</li>
            <li> My son is 15 years old, African American, and had a severe case of acne on both sides of his face and on his forehead.</li>
            <li> only wash that has actually reduces acne completely</li>
            <li> In several weeks the product cleared up the cystic acne I had all over my chin and lightened the scars from old spots at the same time.</li>
            <li> It came back and it felt worse and more of a hassle.</li>
            <li> None of these worked for me, and most actually made my skin worse.     </li>
            <li> It did not dry out my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done it and it dried my skin out to the point where it hurt to smile or make any facial expressions.</li>
            <li> There was a little discomfort the first week I used it, which my sister who gave it to me told me about.</li>
            <li> I would recommend going to a dermatologist because i&#x27;ve tried Proactive and several other off the counter treatments and nothing really works.</li>
            <li> in early November I happened to stumble upon this product.  </li>
            <li> It may not have looked severe to other people, but it felt pretty darn severe to me after dealing with it for so long.</li>
            <li> my skin was becoming worse with pustule breakouts all along my nose and chin.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a harsh product, but if you can stand the burning over the first few uses and are willing to accept drier skin, try this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tried Proactiv and it was good but very expensive.</li>
            <li> He did have a little burning and drying at first, but only for the first few days.</li>
            <li> I have been using AcneFree day and night for the last 5 weeks and have not had a single new zit.  </li>
            <li> hope this works for other people, particularly people over 40.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and still suffered through painfully dry skin through the first week of use.  </li>
            <li> Overall I really like this product, but I am currently looking for other products.</li>
            <li> I looked up all the active ingredients of most acne medications and then spent a few hours in CVS reading the packaging over every acne clearing medicine on the shelf.</li>
            <li> i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for those with dry or sensitive skin and acne.  </li>
            <li> The key to any acne product is that it works in the long term, and so far it seems to be doing just that.</li>
            <li> But it was a waste of money and didn&#x27;t make any positive difference for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it clear my pimples, but it has really started to repair damage done from pimples I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> This got my skin back to normal with minimal acne present.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so anything I use has to be mild, non irritating and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Of course the bottom line is results, this product absolutely cleared up all my acne in a little under a month.</li>
            <li> In addition, after a couple weeks of use I noticed that the Step 4 retinoid cream wasn&#x27;t doing much for my skin, in fact it seemed to make my forehead break out a little.</li>
            <li> The Toner usually empties first but pour about 4-5 drops on a normal size cottonball and it should last closer to the other bottles.</li>
            <li> I was ecstatic, but had experienced these results with other topical treatments, only to be let down a week or so later, when my skin would eventually return to its angry self.</li>
            <li> To get that deep down clean just in case the face wash missing anything.</li>
            <li> I have more painful breakouts now and are very embarrassing.</li>
            <li> While I still get acne breakouts even with the product, I get maybe 1-3 new breakouts a day on average vs several or over a dozen new breakouts per day when I used other products.</li>
            <li> My face was a little dry and itchy the first week - but that went way</li>
            <li> I have had acne since I was 12 years old and it has become very severe in the last few years with hormones surging due to multiple pregnancies.  </li>
            <li> always considered my skin normal, not very oily or dry.</li>
            <li> AND THEY DID TAKE A LONG TIME TO CLEAR UP WITH THIS PRODUCT, BUT HAVE HAD NO NEW ONES SINCE STARING</li>
            <li> , i&#x27;ve normal skin (slightly oily), AND i&#x27;m not a ACNEFREE staff who just advertising this product.</li>
            <li> I also started to get mild acne on my face a few months ago and it is getting smaller and less noticeable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also pleased that I&#x27;ve not experienced extreme dryness as others report.  </li>
            <li> the first time I used it my skin began to smooth but not without an intense and dangerous burning of my skin, I mean 911 burning and my skin dried so much that I had to use healing ointments to soothe it.</li>
            <li> Yes, it made my skin very dry the first few weeks</li>
            <li> I began to get very dry skin during the first few days, but using the moisturizer helped immensly.</li>
            <li> Step 2 will go a lot faster than the other steps, but you can go on their website or call the company directly and buy just that step.    </li>
            <li> After the first four weeks, continue to use the roller weekly with the Retinol Complex or other products to remove old acne scars.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t slightly reduce the size of white heads, but rather, completely eradicates any trace of it, and results are delivered in just a couple of days.    </li>
            <li> Now not only does she have the burn, but also patches of dry white flaky skin that will not go away!  </li>
            <li> My skin tends to get dry if I use it twice daily for days on end, so I use it once daily.</li>
            <li> I only use the repairing lotion at night, and within a few days the drying went away and I now have very soft skin.  </li>
            <li> During that time I have tried everythng including Proactiv... which really, dont waste your money!</li>
            <li> Very stringent process everyday!</li>
            <li> 10% benzoyl peroxide, in abundance over a long period of time, has the potential to leave scars, so don&#x27;t glob a lot of this stuff over a whitehead hoping to make it go away overnight.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s the long and short of it.</li>
            <li> After using this for several months, I realized that it does not solve my acne problem long term.   </li>
            <li> then just use STEP 1 and 3, 8.10 am MORNING step 1, very little amount of STEP 3, THEN evening 7 pm when i came back from my work JUST STEP 1, BEFORE SLEEP 11 or 12 pm STEP 1 with HIGH AMOUNT OF STEP 3.</li>
            <li> For my skin to experience a major breakout because of the product I chose to clear up a small issue, that did it for me.</li>
            <li> although honestly not that much compared to other products) to fully clear skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is not available where we live</li>
            <li> Less than 30$ for Clear Skin.</li>
            <li> My previous breakouts are completely cleared up at this point, and any acne marks are noticeably faded/continuing to fade.</li>
            <li> So after I apply the stages and let each dry, I apply a layer of Cetaphil facial moisturizer which has SPF and won&#x27;t clog pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin feels coarse, dry, and flaky.     </li>
            <li> and my face was red, irritated and dry.  </li>
            <li> Letting that dry entirely and then either putting on the moisturizer in the morning, or the overnight cream at night.  </li>
            <li> For some reasin, the second time around, my face got really dry, to the point of itchiness</li>
            <li> you my skin did get really dry the third week.</li>
            <li> my skin was clear for a few years with an occasional pimple here and there that i would zap with acne spot treatment medication.</li>
            <li> /few break out spots on side of cheeks) and AcneFree severe is one of the few things that actually gets my skin clear.</li>
            <li> Actually, the first couple of days it dried my skin up a little bit</li>
            <li> It is KEY to wash your face using the Acnefree kit every single day, morning and night.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that will not miss a single acne.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen both positive and negative reviews for this product.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for mild acne, I would try something a little less extreme.</li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;re Greek (and Orthodox), don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re being irreligious by using evolutionary theory---evolution was largely founded by the church and today is accepted by both the Orthodox and Catholic church.</li>
            <li> Yesterday she started with a rash which then turned into a really bad chemical burn on most of her face!  </li>
            <li> After trying Proactiv and other anti-acne products, I gave up for a year and just tried to bare with it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go out to gym in morning without make up because of the extreme redness on my face and neck :O</li>
            <li> I long for the day when my skin is clear and I don&#x27;t have to wear make-up to &#x27;hide&#x27; flaws and black marks over my face.</li>
            <li> I get hormonal acne and this is by far the only thing that helps keep my skin tame.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as described, came way before estimated time but was a bit damaged but nothing serious just the box.</li>
            <li> all the other things i&#x27;ve used worked initially but stopped working after only two or three months.  </li>
            <li> TO THINK OF HOW MUCH MONEY I WASTED ON OTHER PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> Prior to using acne free, I had small bumps, whiteheads, and periodic cystic bumps that were super painful.</li>
            <li> At first his face burned and dried out a little, but his face now seems used to the product.  </li>
            <li> My face is naturally very oily so if yours is I would use very little moisturizer, not much is needed.</li>
            <li> This product has left me with red skin, bad acne, and more acne scars.</li>
            <li> I would much rather have the AcneFree Terminator blemish cream than the Retinol Renewal Complex.  </li>
            <li> In the end, I decided if I was going to get a long-term regime, I should at least try the product that was MUCH cheaper than ProActiv</li>
            <li> While walking through Walgreens, I happened to notice the box of Acne free and for some weird reason, told myself why not.  </li>
            <li> i used to use practive and it used to keep my skin clear but with like few zits here and there</li>
            <li> My skin is oily and not particularly sensitive</li>
            <li> /&gt;Witch Hazel is an astringent which can be store bought at any old CVS/Walgreens/Walmart for a few dollars.</li>
            <li> As someone who has been struggling with acne for so long, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results AcneFree Severe has given me.</li>
            <li> I had also had some MINOR acne on my shoulders, within 1 week of using the system that had cleared up</li>
            <li> I have tried several products over the last few years (to include oral and topical prescription medications) and nothing seemed to work.</li>
            <li> I pray this works for me in the long run</li>
            <li> Why did I wait this long to see it after my skin has been damaged by acne scars.</li>
            <li> , it has gotten my oil under control and it has helped with my blackheads, although they are not completely gone.</li>
            <li> We have gone through several wash/cream regimens but with no real results.</li>
            <li> my skin is not sensitive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 29 and living the healthiest life I&#x27;ve had in as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> I just assumed that I had been on it too long</li>
            <li> It never fixed her acne, yet she swore by it.</li>
            <li> This is what I add that help my skin problem long term: Vit D, K, N A cystein, MSM, curcumin.</li>
            <li> I would get really strange pimples the likes of which I&#x27;ve never seen, using this stuff.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s acne did not clear up as I was hoping it would.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s acne did not clear up as I was whising</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a few weeks upon the first few days of use</li>
            <li> the beginning if you do get irritated red spots just use 1 and 2 on that area until it settles back down before you start putting 3 or 4 in that area</li>
            <li> still have the dark spots which take forever to clear, which is typical for African</li>
            <li> The cleanser and astringent will easily last the month, but the acne lotion only lasts half that long.  </li>
            <li> and it said it worked better and faster than Pro-Active and was less expensive.  </li>
            <li> It is now 6 weeks later and his pimples are not totally gone but his acne is much less severe than it was.    </li>
            <li> Usually one is healing while a new one is forming.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product, especially if you are ineligible to take accutane, or don&#x27;t want to mess with that stuff.</li>
            <li> I do notice that even with that occasional pimple, it does clear up in a matter of days (no picking at or messing with it required), and no red spots or marks are left behind.</li>
            <li> All the acne is gone, I mean, seriously my skin is completely clean!</li>
            <li> If I skipped a night here and there due to laziness, the occasional pimple would pop up that could take up to a week to go away.</li>
            <li> I had to stop using it and go back to my other way of clearing my acne</li>
            <li> so different then other things I have tried...</li>
            <li> I was having problems finding a series of products that worked in unison with each other and this was finally the product I was looking for.</li>
            <li> After using the kit for two weeks straight I decided to slow down on the use and began to alternate steps 3 and 4 each night.</li>
            <li> I ordered this a very long time ago, and still have not received it.</li>
            <li> Then, I tried some all natural cleanser in a black bottle, and while my face FELT better, I still got pimples, and bad pimples.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t cake it on, it won&#x27;t dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> Without The Toner (STEP 2), the potency of The Wash (Step 1) and The Healing Lotion (STEP 3) may dry you out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I continued using it, but my skin never got excessively dry.</li>
            <li> You just have to remember that even though it may come over night, your acne is not going to cure over night, and acne products WILL dry your skin out and irritate it for a while, but that means that it is working.</li>
            <li> My skin was tremendously dry.</li>
            <li> It took two weeks for the system to dry my skin out and for me to see results.</li>
            <li> Your skin will dry out and start flaking at which point</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin  </li>
            <li> dry</li>
            <li> , you want your face completely dry from the toner before proceeding to step 3  once face is completely dry</li>
            <li> I tried proactive (worked for a month then just started to dry and deteriorate my skin) and Nutregena, I even saw a dermatologist and was given prescription strength medications lotions and even birth control for acne.</li>
            <li> It is now three weeks after starting application, and my skin has honestly never been so clear.</li>
            <li> Then apply the face wash, let the skin dry before applying the toner.</li>
            <li> Again let the skin dry before applying the repairing lotion.</li>
            <li> I started seeing results, however after about a week of using it my skin began burning and having dry spots.</li>
            <li> Use it wherever you skin gets dry.  </li>
            <li> but I think that&#x27;s because your supposed to let it dry for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does tend to make my skin dry after using step 3 and/or step 4</li>
            <li> and i like the fact that it did not make my skin dry.</li>
            <li> I use this on weekends with just a oil of olay bar to give my face a rest from the ingredients in the system that dry my face out.    </li>
            <li> my pimples would dry out and eventually leave.</li>
            <li> As we approach summer I am hoping the sun will dry some of it up.</li>
            <li> my skin became so dehydrated, dry, and scaly.</li>
            <li> It did what what it advertised, and it didn&#x27;t burn, or make my skin itchy, dry, or flakey.</li>
            <li> After about a week, my acne started to dry up and go away (without over-drying the rest of my face).</li>
            <li> DRY OFF.</li>
            <li> Then, rinse off with the shower water, and DAB your face dry.    </li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin but still clears out my skin.</li>
            <li> It did dry my face out, however.</li>
            <li> so I could compare active ingredients and topical strengths</li>
            <li> Only complaint I have is when I get busy or don&#x27;t stay at my place, thus forget/can&#x27;t use the treatment as recommended -</li>
            <li> but I was comfortable with using it since my face ALWAYS breaks out horribly when I am pregnant, and this is the third time</li>
            <li> Accutane treated my acne as kid, and I was acne-free for years, but they say that people often have to do a second round of treatment 10 - 15 years later.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had hoped it would work for my 15 year old son, but it really didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> A few months back I had moderate acne breakout and it wouldn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> July 28th, 2009 update - still no new blemishes.  </li>
            <li> and I had no new break outs forming.</li>
            <li> It has not completely cleared my face, but made a significant difference in a few weeks, and continues to make a difference after approximately 7-8 weeks.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty tough, so it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> This is the one I settled on seeing that it had the strongest chemicals in a single system than anything else.</li>
            <li> This product outperforms every single product and DOCTOR</li>
            <li> if you have a function or a party that you need to go to, consider using this afterwards, because it takes a few days for your face to clear the stubborn acnes and other after effects)</li>
            <li> I will just start this review by saying that I do not normally write reviews.</li>
            <li> For the first two weeks of diligent use, my acne became worse.</li>
            <li> My acne has gotten worse the first week of using this product.</li>
            <li> one night when I first started using it, I was really tired and in a hurry to go to bed.</li>
            <li> I was a hesitant at first for buying this poduct because of the number of people who did give it a poor review.  </li>
            <li> I even visited an \\&quot;acne forum\\&quot; to read suggested products and made purchases based on those recommendations, although my skin only improved slightly - and at the expense of being embarrassingly dry and flakey.    </li>
            <li> The only down fall was</li>
            <li> After one/two days you can see the blemishes starting to go down and after a week or so</li>
            <li> I have a list written down of 25 different acne treatments I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> skin is dry too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had severe acne on my back for about a year in a half.</li>
            <li> My acne scars were fading and the amount of acne I had diminished by half by the 3rd week.</li>
            <li> My skin was rough to the touch, I had dry patches all over my chin and nose, and my makeup did not apply well on my skin.</li>
            <li> It also seems to be lightening the scars left from previous breakouts.  </li>
            <li> It stops your face from drying out but occasionally leaves my face feeling slightly oily.</li>
            <li> I strongly suggest anyone who is desperate for acne relief to try this product.</li>
            <li> I mean why not, I had already spent so much money on other products</li>
            <li> i stopped using this product and the redness has began to fade and the cystic pimples have decreased a lot i am positive this product caused this.</li>
            <li> Made my face very dry</li>
            <li> My skin never became very dry because of this product.</li>
            <li> Used as directed and did not see a change, just made my skin very dry.</li>
            <li> long before the other bottles in the set.  </li>
            <li> When I break out, my self esteem is pretty much non-existent and I hate going out because I think the only thing people see is my acne!!!</li>
            <li> There are no new pimples and the old ones are slowly fading.</li>
            <li> While I am still forming a few pimples (although less red, not cystic, and not as obvious), I assume that this is just a result of Acnefree purging my face of any soon-to-form acne.</li>
            <li> Touch your face as little as possible during the day.  </li>
            <li> Takes a time to get use to and will make face a little red.</li>
            <li> It also helps a little with my back and shoulder acne.</li>
            <li> ...$20 down the toilet.</li>
            <li> Like a lot of the other reviews have said, this treatment will leave your skin extremely dry, to the point of discomfort.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry it out like other products can.</li>
            <li> This kit did not do hardly anything for my adult acne.</li>
            <li> My oily skin slowly but surely has decreased a little.    </li>
            <li> within 4 days i felt 100 percent better, and when the skin healed, the bad acne had cleared.</li>
            <li> My immune system got bad throughout my life from having too many antibiotics.  </li>
            <li> and I was dismayed to see that the acne had returned, albeit not as bad as when I was a teenager, and had moved more to my jawline/cheeks.  </li>
            <li> the years I have experimented with using The Antibacterial Wash, The Benzoyl Peroxide and the Retinol Complex completely by themselves.</li>
            <li> i think that the negative reviews on this product are from people with overly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so I could clear up dark spots and get rid of small breakouts.</li>
            <li> If you start missing applications acne Will come back.    </li>
            <li> which I spent lots of money on and it did NOTHING for me.  </li>
            <li> I tried ProActiv for about a year with minimal results.  </li>
            <li> Within a few days his pimples starting clearing up.  </li>
            <li> Now if you work in an environment where you sweat be careful cause benzyl peroxide will stain clothes.</li>
            <li> A few minutes later it started stinging around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I will write my review for Proactiv within the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> Also you can&#x27;t realistically apply the day cream during the day as it leaves a messy white residue on your face.</li>
            <li> I had mainly white heads, with a few cystic bumbs.</li>
            <li> and they never really seemed to go away.  </li>
            <li> The products are staining to materials so be careful what you touch after applying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I  only had a few  pimples on my face before using this product, after I began to use this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also helping with my overall skin time because my face doesn&#x27;t get all oily in a few hours now.</li>
            <li> i have used the regular type of this product for a few years.</li>
            <li> I had fairly heavy acne growing up, especially in my t-zone, which came under control when I began birth control pills when I turned 18.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks following the directions, my acne cleared.</li>
            <li> My severe acne disappeared and now I just have to cope with few regular breakouts like once in a while</li>
            <li> I was on  dermatologist prescribed kits that cost a fortune and tried a few different antibiotics, and it did not seem to work.</li>
            <li> But be careful because all that scrubbing can irritate your skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;With in two days my zits were dried up, and I only have one now.</li>
            <li> I only write reviews for products that I either COMPLETELY LOVE or COMPLETELY HATE.  </li>
            <li> My T-zone is oily, but the rest of my face is a bit on the dry side, so when I first used this product it dried out my face so much to the point it stung really badly.  </li>
            <li> I have it running all the way down from my forehead to my shoulders, down to my lower back.</li>
            <li> I mean clear.</li>
            <li> However, I was still regularly getting very small zits which would typically clear within a few days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very consistent with using it, which is probably why other things never really worked</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, this product works.</li>
            <li> and my skin did not dry out anymore than usual.  </li>
            <li> it made my skin feel like sandpaper, and 3) the lotion was soo thick, heavy, and gritty and left a white residue on my dark complexion.</li>
            <li> This product may be too strong for someone with a pimple or two, but worked wonders for a very difficult case of acne.</li>
            <li> My skin wasn&#x27;t too problematic as a teen, but around the age of 23, I started experiencing regular breakouts -- primarily a combination of those awful cystic bumps and generally clogged pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finally eating 3 meals a day (compared to 1), eating less junk food, drinking less pop (soda)</li>
            <li> I stopped using the product since now my skin gets real tight on my face after water hits it, and i dry it, and my skin on my face is getting red and burns when i rub any     wash cloth.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that this product is a bit drying but nothing a little moisturizer can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> the only downsides are it made the skin around my eyes very tight</li>
            <li> It cleared my face out within days, however it has a slight tendency to dry my face out.</li>
            <li> but after a few months clear skin I started developing small oil bumps all over my forehead.</li>
            <li> I have always had minor issues with acne, at least since my teen years.  </li>
            <li> They are getting worse as I get older.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> 34;a little goes a long way&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This also has to dry before hitting the pillow to avoid a mess.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 23 and have had acne issues since I was about 17, started mild, then got bad starting about age 19.</li>
            <li> other than that, this product is a godsend.</li>
            <li> i would recommend this to anyone who has tried other products and received no results.</li>
            <li> For some reason, I&#x27;ve gone through a worse episode than normal</li>
            <li> So I am in my mid 30&#x27;s and have been dealing with breakouts for the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> I used a stronger exfoliating scrub with the cleanser provided (extremely oily skin)   3.</li>
            <li> I have extremely NON-sensitive skin  3.</li>
            <li> However within those first 10 days it can be a scary process.</li>
            <li> Like every other acne product i&#x27;ve ever tried that didn&#x27;t work, this was no exception.</li>
            <li> It has even started to get rid of some of the scars that past acne break outs left.  </li>
            <li> I used ProActive and almost any other OTC products I could find, nothing would help.</li>
            <li> I get extreme breakouts and so does my son.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars at dermatoligists that couldn&#x27;t help!  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products like ProActice, and prescription drugs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it all - dermatologist cream perscriptions, proactive and all the other products that you see in the stores.  </li>
            <li> I can purchase it whenever I want without having to buy it every 3 months or so like other products.  </li>
            <li> But from other reviews I hear it just passes, and if you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ll do just about anything.   </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see myself switching to any other acne treatments as the results I&#x27;ve seen here have been unparalleled by anything else I&#x27;ve used (that&#x27;s</li>
            <li> First off I want to explain that I have had terrible acne off and on (mostly on though) for the past 8 years.  </li>
            <li> and there was no foil under the other three lids.</li>
            <li> i was extremely depressed .</li>
            <li> This has worked so well that my husband, who has always used Retinol A cream (which is not covered by insurance due to him not being a teenager) has decided to switch to this product.</li>
            <li> Since I do not want to strip my skin, I now use the product once every other day as part of my regimen.</li>
            <li> Mix enough for one week in a small cup and refrigerate.</li>
            <li> It was more \\&quot;severe\\&quot; on my skin, and didn&#x27;t help my severe acne. :(</li>
            <li> The company actually refunds if your are not satisfied in anyway.</li>
            <li> I never even considered myself having severe acne, but I always had something or other in some place or another.</li>
            <li> That, for some reason, empties out way before the other bottles.</li>
            <li> But along with it working it causes dry skin, but nothing a little lotion couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> I barely used it, but I forgot to mention how unsettling it was to open a box with a little tab of tape at each end and no seals on the tubes and the under the lid foil on step 4 was part way open</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m 24 and decided enough was enough, I bought this kit even though my acne is no longer what I consider \\&quot;severe\\&quot; (although it has been in the past as the scars left behind can attest to)</li>
            <li> Although my face burned, hurt, very dried out, flakey, red..  </li>
            <li> Some people have bad reviews for this probably because they havent ever dealt with a medication as strong as 10% BP thus the peeling.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d have bought the Pro Active</li>
            <li> I woke up to 10-15 active cysts and whiteheads and used this product in desperation.  </li>
            <li> BUT PRO ACTIVE</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I went back on the Benzamycin it no longer worked to clear up the acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let me just say, that as someone who has struggled with acne for SO LONG and have broken down crying because of the horrible acne on my face, I can say now that my face is the best it has ever looked!</li>
            <li> However, I usually use Step Three morning and night and only use the Retinol Corrector if my skin is feeling a little tight and dry.     </li>
            <li> I was starting to think I would be one of the few dealing with both, and that was a pretty depressing prospect.     </li>
            <li> I would consider myself having moderate to severe acne -- usually peaking during PMS and less severe during the rest of the month.</li>
            <li> I put the codes for the other two products down below for anyone who wanted it.  </li>
            <li> At night, use the MT Roller over the Retinol Complex every other day between weekly rollings ONLY on problem areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably spent around a little under $1000 trying to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very pale person and by day three alone my previous blemishes have almost disappeared entirely!</li>
            <li> Here is a warning for people who actually have pretty bad skin:</li>
            <li> THe only negative comment I have is that the products can sometimes bleach clothes and pillowcases.</li>
            <li> The Retinol Complex is also a smaller \\&quot;bottle\\&quot; so if you use it like the others, you&#x27;ll run out.</li>
            <li> However, I have not experienced these issues and my face is completely clear.</li>
            <li> i have tried everything from proactive to expensive prescription meds and very fancy dermatological treatments and peels.</li>
            <li> The AcneFree Severe comes with the same 3 step bottles as the orginal (step 1: cleans, step 2: tone, step 3: repairing lotion) but comes with an addition step, step 4: Retinol Renewal Complex.  </li>
            <li> but it seemed to at least finally be manageable.     </li>
            <li> Within 1 week my face was approximately 95% clear of acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started getting dark spots all over my face for picking at my pimples.</li>
            <li> my pimples turned so dark I had to use skin bleaching cream to get rid of the dark spots.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it really dried out my skin and gave me flakes, but I guess that&#x27;s to be expected from a severe acne treatment.</li>
            <li> I then add some astaxanthin which also fades dark spot.</li>
            <li> , if I become too inconstant (not using it at least once a day) acne will pop back up.</li>
            <li> This product cleared up my severe acne and help lighten my dark spots as well.</li>
            <li> It DIDNT  Do Anything For THE Dark  </li>
            <li> I spent a few hours looking up my skin type online...</li>
            <li> This was by far the worse acne treatment system.</li>
            <li> The redness had decreased a considerable amount, and my acne keeps going away day by day.  </li>
            <li> was having extremely painful and frequent breakouts in the later half of last year and</li>
            <li> This stuff is a lifesaver, hands down.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how relieved I am that I have a chance of walking down the aisle acne-free.</li>
            <li> After 1 week, I noticed swelling dying down.  </li>
            <li> Hands down, i&#x27;d buy this over proactiv</li>
            <li> Hands down.  </li>
            <li> It took about a week for my acne to go down and</li>
            <li> Down  </li>
            <li> Saw a you tube video where a customer recommends using witch hazel as toner until the other 3 products run out!  </li>
            <li> However, within 4 days ALL of my blemishes (big and small) had cleared up!</li>
            <li> Other than that, I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Because this is a benzoyl peroxide based product, after a few weeks my skin became really tight, and that led to a few minor bumps.</li>
            <li> Now With just using the wash, toner, and night cream, my face has made a dramatic turn around, I still get occasional pimples, on my cheek area and still have some minor blackheads</li>
            <li> It was very frustrating; I resorted to sleeping in different positions and other potentially helpful measures, but to no avail.</li>
            <li> Be very very careful if you use this!  </li>
            <li> It is not as harsh as I have read in other reviews.</li>
            <li> Apply a little extra Retinol Complex to problem areas after rolling.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I have had breakouts due to my hormone levels changing and wanted to try something without having to waste my money.</li>
            <li> Proactiv goes for $40 on Amazon and this stuff sells for almost half that.</li>
            <li> It smells slightly but it is not a concern for me.</li>
            <li> I still have acne, but less than before and the remaining zits seem to heal faster.</li>
            <li> for less than $25 dollars, without the hassle of prescription, and typically found at any pharmacy store like Walgreens,</li>
            <li> I put extra moisturizer and vaseline on the worst of it which seems to be doing an okay job.</li>
            <li> I was going to a dermatologist monthly for less than a year</li>
            <li> but it became to pricey with the expensive doryx pills, various topical creams [epiduo gel then atralin] and glycolic acid face wash.</li>
            <li> it was ridiculous, my entire face felt like SANDPAPER and LOOKED LIKE SANDPAPER--</li>
            <li> and I have previously used proactive</li>
            <li> today his face has noticeably fewer whiteheads and is less oily.</li>
            <li> My sister has started using it as well and her acne cleared up in less than a week.</li>
            <li> But pimples and black heads leaving.</li>
            <li> (still have half of the lotion and face wash).    </li>
            <li> I will typically moisturize with Clinique&#x27;s gel moisturizer to keep my skin hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> all for less than an hour&#x27;s work.  </li>
            <li> but I do notice a slight fading on some of my towels.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item about 2 and a half months ago.</li>
            <li> Then tried AcneFree, and I had less pimples, but still about 3-5 a week.  </li>
            <li> Maybe my skin was previously conditioned by the Proactiv</li>
            <li> Then PMS rolled around again &amp; the breakout began -- but much, much less severe.  </li>
            <li> At one point one of the tubes of the prescribed cream was costing over $200 for a one and one half month supply.  </li>
            <li> USE STEP 1,2,3 , few days later step 2 will finishes (i mean it will run off)</li>
            <li> Also if you live in a hot area and find yourself sweating a lot (Arizona), keep this stuff AWAY from any articles of clothing, because it can and will bleach your clothes very badly.</li>
            <li> Her acne is so bad they are big red bumps all over her face, and back.</li>
            <li> i started breaking out with big, painful red pimples and as soon as one would finally go away another would pop up.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts because I had already given Proactiv a couple of tries in the past.</li>
            <li> I drank only water for months at a time, but that did no good.</li>
            <li> I tried every product on the market - Clean &amp; Clear, Proactiv, Neutrogena, Murad and even insanely over-priced Dermalogica.</li>
            <li> We have hard water at my house so my skin is always dry when I get out of the shower.      </li>
            <li> The acne is super painful for her.</li>
            <li> Back when I was in High School it cost a silly price (39.99) and used a lot of celebrity endorsement to gain false credibility (catalogues featuring Vanessa Williams/Jessica Simpson/Avril Lavigne).</li>
            <li> When I started using this product i saw a little difference by a week.</li>
            <li> After using this product I get about 4-5 pimples a month and little to no redness on face.</li>
            <li> If you are not familiar with retinol do some research on it.</li>
            <li> with little to no results.</li>
            <li> When I do, it is usually around the time of my period or if I am extremely stessed.</li>
            <li> Even burns a little.</li>
            <li> I started using the acnefree severe system a little over a month ago, maybe two months now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start with a little background about me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a week now</li>
            <li> I usually supplement other non-comodogenic lotion (CeraVe Lotion)</li>
            <li> and this caused little drying for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get just a little pimple, they are almost like boils.  </li>
            <li> Not fun!</li>
            <li> well maybe it will help a little.</li>
            <li> Yes some little bumps are still there, but compared to what was...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been a little over two months</li>
            <li> But I decided I had little to lose.  </li>
            <li> At first, my acne got worse!!</li>
            <li> I had tried Pro active in the past and it did not work for me, but I think I needed something a little stronger.</li>
            <li> I used to use proactiv for about 3 years when my acne got bad but eventually like many customers I got tired of the hidden fees and overcharges.</li>
            <li> all day lotion (step 3) is a little bit harsh on my skin, it&#x27;s the 10% benzoil (sp?) peroxide, but it gets the job done</li>
            <li> Its a little embarrassing, but I&#x27;d rather have that then struggle with acne everyday.</li>
            <li> I had the hard, large painful nodules on my face and this not only cleared them</li>
            <li> but it just made my face worse and some days dry and other days greasy.</li>
            <li> I am an 18 year old male who has a history of bad acne because of genetics.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the smallest bottle of lotion runs out (at least for him)</li>
            <li> I know it sounds crazy, but I saw a difference in my skin the next day, after only applying it before I went to bed.</li>
            <li> but some of my dark spots are disappearing and my brother keeps making fun of my face :(</li>
            <li> I was afraid my only resort would be to go back on Accutane.</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> i tried proactive a few years ago and my acne never cleared up</li>
            <li> I have tried everything from expensive Organic Natural products,Proactive (which burns as well), Antibacterial soaps, no soap, Dove...  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t cleared my skin entirely, but the severity of breakouts have definitely decreased.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, in another few months all of his pimples will be gone.  </li>
            <li> It started drying my face out and so did a few of the pimples.</li>
            <li> Few things to note:     1.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had acne, but even now at 30 years old, it started to get worse!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product helped, but I  use ALBA  aloe &amp; green tea oil-free moisturizer after I put on the three step.  </li>
            <li> Use Alba Aloe &amp; Green Tea Mosiurizer    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been suffering from acne for a few years now and tried just about all the drugstore acne products sold but nothing ever worked.</li>
            <li> and I ended up getting a Neutrogena face wash/mask that cleared up my skin in a few days.</li>
            <li> but I continued and the dead skin soon just went away, but it also caused my skin to itch</li>
            <li> I still have a few bumps, but compared to what I was dealing with before, I&#x27;ll take them.</li>
            <li> While Proactive dried my skin out, it did nothing like this product.</li>
            <li> and i started to see results within a few days.</li>
            <li> the day time lotion was just too harsh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until a few months ago when I decided to try the AcneFree Severe system.  </li>
            <li> i would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is tired of going through Neutrogena, Noxzema, Clearasil, etc.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything for me except waste my time.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste you money on anything else before you try what I&#x27;ve been using.    </li>
            <li> After that, I kept using it just to maintain the few breakouts I was still getting.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this everyday and her acne is almost gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to recommend you go through it, because I don&#x27;t want to be held accountable for you getting hurt ( or worse) from an allergic reaction, but I personally got through it</li>
            <li> The MT Roller will be too harsh on 20-something skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t roll on broken skin or white pustules.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-exercise a few times/week to keep your body in tune and to sweat your toxins</li>
            <li> clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was scared from some of the reviews about it being really harsh on skin, peeling, burning etc.  </li>
            <li> few thoughts...</li>
            <li> I have not had my face irritated or dried out at all using this.  </li>
            <li> Before I replaced the toner, I tried some Neutrogena acne toner and it dried out my face</li>
            <li> Everyday you could see improvement:</li>
            <li> and there so my money isn&#x27;t completely wasted.</li>
            <li> However, a few months ago I stopped taking birth control</li>
            <li> Antibiotics,Proactive,and Murad only made the situation worse.</li>
            <li> I stopped eating fatty foods</li>
            <li> It actually dried out her face and almost \\&quot;burned\\&quot; it.  </li>
            <li> This stuff actually seem to make my acne worse.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time, money, or looks... go with something else.</li>
            <li> Anyway, as soon as I saw the product dried my skin up</li>
            <li> At 24, getting tired of constantly worrying about my face and piling on makeup to hide it, I decided to give AcneFree Severe a shot.</li>
            <li> i purchased ACNEFREE GREEN TEA MOISTURIZER, i m using it now</li>
            <li> and I believe it is because I slacked off using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> My acne usually forms around my mouth, chin and sometimes  my cheeks and will typically take weeks to heal.</li>
            <li> As I kept using it (2 weeks in)I started getting the really bad, painful under the skin kind of pimples!</li>
            <li> All of this without bad flaking or additional breakouts first.    </li>
            <li> My acne was pretty bad</li>
            <li> It was pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> The chemical strength of Acnefree is probably NOT ideal for somebody with the occasional pimple or hormonal flare-up.</li>
            <li> They work for a while but very expensive as the Dr wants me to see him on monthly bases.      </li>
            <li> Just raw oatmeal.&lt;br /&gt;Change</li>
            <li> I always had a white head problem around my mouth area, but it recently broke out bad all over my face for reasons I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I thought the powerful system might have been shocking my skin since it has a larger dose of treatment than what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> So, I would recommend waiting at least a half hour before applying makeup.     </li>
            <li> just gave me a little scare in the beginning!</li>
            <li> I will have a little tiny pimple every one in awhile, but that&#x27;s no big deal since I am used to constant awful break</li>
            <li> However, I tend to get the large, painful cyst-like pimples under the skin that never go away.</li>
            <li> My breakouts were always large and painful.  </li>
            <li> For very little monetary cost and NO health side effects, this product took care of my acne.</li>
            <li> Like I said, you don&#x27;t need to go overboard.</li>
            <li> My breakouts started clearing up almost immediately, and no more have formed.</li>
            <li> I usually check out reviews on everything before I buy it, but when I saw this product at target, and saw that it was marketed specifically for severe acne, I bought it without knowing a thing about it</li>
            <li> My acne is far from severe, but I was desperate.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure of the quality of the Vitamin A in the retinol</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> For the past three years I have been seeing a dermatologist and have been on Epiduo, Retin-A, Tarzorac, oral antibiotics, you name it.</li>
            <li> Dab a small amount and use one or two fingers to massage it.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, however this product deserves 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not just washing your face and slick on some moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I speak from experience :/</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, so dryness usually isn&#x27;t a problem for me.</li>
            <li> Within 3 days of using AcneFree, it cleared the small zits that ProActiv couldn&#x27;t seem to keep under control.  </li>
            <li> Within a week my acne (and scars) were improving and my face didn&#x27;t feel like an oil slick.</li>
            <li> i have bought this product in the past at a store, and it worked for me once.</li>
            <li> I WAS GETTING AT LEAST ONE PIMPLE EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li> and I have dried skin all over my chin!</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for something that would work, but unfortunately, this set up is complicated, and after all that, just doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that I have extremely severe acne, however I am constantly plagued with cystic acne, whiteheads, or just ugly clusters of pimples.</li>
            <li> To me, the scent is subtle and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin red.. except for my forehead, for some weird reason.</li>
            <li> and when I got this in at the time my face was pretty bad broken out.</li>
            <li> After the acne went it away, it did leave behind the black marks</li>
            <li> Here are some tips I have had to find out the hard way about acne breakouts:  </li>
            <li> you know how hard it is to find a soap that doesn&#x27;t undo all the work your treatments are doing.</li>
            <li> I tired this product because it was a little cheaper and didn&#x27;t require a membership.</li>
            <li> I got a face wash/lotion combination called Rapid Clear from Neutrogena that was supposed to help bad breakouts like this one.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 14 year old granddaughter who had a bad case of acne and she has been using it for 10 days and her acne is almost gone.  </li>
            <li> To anyone who suffers from actual &#x27;severe&#x27; acne, this isn&#x27;t going to help you at all.</li>
            <li> The Retinol Complex</li>
            <li> The Retinol Complex says it is not to be used in tandem with The Healing Potion (10% Benzoyl Peroxide).</li>
            <li> I substitute the Retinol Complex for the Healing Potion</li>
            <li> I have determined for myself that the while the Antibacterial Wash and Benzoyl Peroxide fight acne, it is the Retinol Complex and the Renewing Toner that will \\&quot;stabilize\\&quot; your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not effective, but it didn&#x27;t work consistanly.</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing this, I had just had a terrible experience with Burts Bees acne products, which had made my skin red, even more oily, and had produced terrible pre-pubescent breakouts along both sides of my chin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the retinol complex in the package because i don&#x27;t like the way it feels on myskin.</li>
            <li> I do notice that I go through the toner and spot treatment a lot quicker than the cleanser and retinol complex.</li>
            <li> The roller and Retinol Complex will increase sun sensitivity.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I forgot to wait at least 10 minutes between steps 3 and 4, and I ended up turning my pillow case orange.</li>
            <li> I made a commitment to stick with AcneFree for at least 3 months before dropping it.</li>
            <li> At least I only had to deal with one awkward phase of life at a time, not all at the age of 16 --</li>
            <li> Now it has been at least two weeks since he stopped using it and</li>
            <li> The retinol can be over-drying if it&#x27;s used every night, at least that was the case for me.</li>
            <li> Lately (I&#x27;m 27)</li>
            <li> so buy at least two packs too start</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d encourage anyone to at least try it.</li>
            <li> However as for the scars there are slowly fading away.</li>
            <li> A few observations:  - AcneFree is not great at removing make up.  </li>
            <li> But It Did slow  It</li>
            <li> The sad thing is, since the Renewing toner is basically like a liquid consistency, not cream, so it runs out faster than the other two steps.</li>
            <li> I started seeing results in just a few days!!</li>
            <li> I mean everything from cystic acne, blackheads to whiteheads and everything in between.</li>
            <li> This product is unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Furthermore it makes my skin excessively oily like the days of puberty!</li>
            <li> (I MEAN SEVERE..</li>
            <li> YAZ birthcontrol and Bare Minerals destroyed my face: cystic acne, red crusty, flaky, oily, disgusting.</li>
            <li> I developed terrible breakouts and tried many different types of salicylic acid treatments that all failed miserably.</li>
            <li> The past acne systems I&#x27;ve used would always leave one or two acne bumps behind</li>
            <li> o using it you have virtually no or very small blamishes.  </li>
            <li> However, it began getting worse over the past year, and spiraled out of control when I stopped using Benzamycin and tried to fill in with OTC products.</li>
            <li> I used it for a about half a year before ditching it with mediocre results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I was seriously scared to even try this</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Seriously - Stop wasting your time on BS products.  </li>
            <li> Along with my lower neck plus those horrible bulbs of deep acne thay would leav my face with giant bruises and purple knots.</li>
            <li> It was horrible time in my life, super embarrassing.</li>
            <li> I got horrible acne (in my opinion, it was probably considered mild or mild-moderate).</li>
            <li> I have large pores and always hated the way my skin looked.</li>
            <li> I feel bad for the people that did not get the same results</li>
            <li> : I learned about this from a friend of mine which is also Greek and which had acne as bad as I did.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d occasionally get 2-3 really bad pimples</li>
            <li> But after a month or so, it&#x27;s back to bad skin.</li>
            <li> only bad thing is I&#x27;d like to use this on my chest as well</li>
            <li> The bad part is that we&#x27;re only 2 days away from seeing Alan Jackson in concert</li>
            <li> 3rd Day all my zits are drying out, but it is still incredibly painful    </li>
            <li> The burn is very red, rashy, and really painful.</li>
            <li> It was late, I was tired and decided I would try this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had chronic, painful acne for five or so years (I&#x27;m 18) with no improvement shown after trying various over-the-counter face washes/treatments.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin (its crazy).</li>
            <li> For bad, painful acne this is the right product.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I went out of town for a weekend and forgot it, and by Sunday my face looked worse than it had in years, worse than before I had even started using it....</li>
            <li> My face suffers much less dryness and irritability when I apply it.</li>
            <li> With my wedding less than a year away, I was desperate.   </li>
            <li> but here I am nearly 30 and still struggling with bad acne!  </li>
            <li> and I hated that because I thought they were supposed to keep my skin completely clear!  </li>
            <li> took one star off b/c after applying the Repair Lotion in the a.m., sometimes my foundation doesn&#x27;t go on evenly, so that&#x27;s a little inconvenient.</li>
            <li> a couple days a week or when I have been getting exposed to really dirty conditions or harsh elements (e.g. exercise, winter, beach, dog).</li>
            <li> All those dead hair and skin cells on your face and the rubbing of skin on dirty fabrics?</li>
            <li> so I decided to play the over the counter game till I got insurance again.     </li>
            <li> My acne has been halted, but my face looks worse than it did before the treatment.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it for 4 days and my acne is getting worse.  </li>
            <li> The irritating bumps and whiteheads are disappearing but I must say that the step 3 lotion can irritate and burn all day.</li>
            <li> Thin skin beneath my eyes became a bit flaky but now i just avoid the eyes:</li>
            <li> I never had it before now, so it was incredibly frustrating.</li>
            <li> and it just kept getting worse.</li>
            <li> It was worse</li>
            <li> I feel that its secret is the 4th step that you apply at night which Proactiv didn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> However, it leaves a thin layer behind.</li>
            <li> And after about a month, It no longer works, my acne is getting worse than its ever been in my life.  </li>
            <li> It was never great or gone</li>
            <li> so unhealthy idk what to do.</li>
            <li> I tried it once and noticed i was getting WORSE acne.</li>
            <li> ;... well EVERY TIME i tried it again, I would get MUCH WORSE ACNE.</li>
            <li> but i KNOW its from this product.. used it 7 seperate times, worse acne every time.</li>
            <li> In fact, I believe it made it worse.</li>
            <li> and I lost weight, but the acne continue to get worse</li>
            <li> The downside of this product was that my face became addicted to benzoyl peroxide treatments.</li>
            <li> It made my skins worse, but I still gave it a try.</li>
            <li> Proactiv\\&quot; statement is false.</li>
            <li> I now use the less severe version to keep my acne away, because it isn&#x27;t as harsh as this is made for clearing away very bad cases of acne.</li>
            <li> My mom and I sat down and read all of the reviews and came up with the conclusion that the majority of the people who gave it bad reviews had had progress with proactive.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have horrible skin to begin with, but I got a new haircut where my hair hit the sides of my face</li>
            <li> Acne, pimples that resembled cysts, dry raw skin, black/white heads...the worst.</li>
            <li> The swelling is gone and less painful.  </li>
            <li> Not only were they embarrassing, but they were so painful!</li>
            <li> However, my clear face was short-lived, and I&#x27;d have a horrible acne flare-up that would take weeks to heal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne for years, but the past year it has become worse (painful nodules).  </li>
            <li> and I have suffered from terrible acne since my early teens.</li>
            <li> But last week about 10 Very Bad pimple cystic-like bumps came up on my face....</li>
            <li> (usually because AcneFree is sometimes impossible to find)</li>
            <li> Ill get frustrated with the few pimples i get so ill think &amp;#34; no way it could have been acnefree making it worse</li>
            <li> When I had horrible acne before, I&#x27;d have to constantly run to the mirror to cover up my spots with concealer, in addition to wearing lots of foundation.</li>
            <li> They are painful, disfiguring and slow to heal.  </li>
            <li> If all else fails I go to the dermatologist for a steroid shot.  </li>
            <li> While using PROACTIVE, I felt uncomfortable wearing the toner and lotion..</li>
            <li> Not perfect on</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I tried Salycic Acid in Clearskin, Clearisil, and Oxy and they all failed.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use in place of the Clinique Acne Solutions kit, because the Clinique kit is expensive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where I went wrong.  </li>
            <li> and I am regretful to say this product as failed as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m angry  </li>
            <li> I have been using pro-active for years and it has been useless.  </li>
            <li> lame.</li>
            <li> ill</li>
            <li> so maybe that is where some people went wrong.</li>
            <li> For the price, I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Proactive worked well with two of our children but is rather expensive.  </li>
            <li> but I got the worst acne ever in my mid 20s.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ridiculously expensive</li>
            <li> UNFORTUNATELY</li>
            <li> Not happy with THE &amp;#34;GUARANTEED&amp;#34; RESULTS!</li>
            <li> From my point of view - those specifics are useless.</li>
            <li> The problem is that the side effects can be horrible, it has been linked to Chrohn&#x27;s disease and you have to wait a long time after treatment before you can try to have kids.</li>
            <li> I happened upon this product listing and decided to curiously read the reviews because I have used it before myself and it was horrible.</li>
            <li> My immune system is horrible and that&#x27;s half of what my problem was</li>
            <li> I became desperate for another skin regimen.</li>
            <li> It was crazy.</li>
            <li> so this was awkward), even my girlfriend&#x27;s concealer to try to cover up the issue.  </li>
            <li> Im afraid if i stop using this product my breakouts will begin again</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m afraid of bleaching my clothes</li>
            <li> however, in the past couple of weeks my acne has been the worst</li>
            <li> Nothing would work, and I found this by luck at a expensive store, and IT WORKED!  </li>
            <li> I am very skeptical on anything I buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 18 and suffer from EXTREMELY bad acne.</li>
            <li> Now when I say my skin was bad, it was so bad I can&#x27;t go anywhere without makeup.  </li>
            <li> Over my winter break, it got really bad.</li>
            <li> BAD product, go for Proactive instead.</li>
            <li> Two months ago, my acne was getting so bad that I didn&#x27;t want to leave the house.</li>
            <li> The alternating seems to keep my face from drying out too bad.</li>

            <li> My skin was in a horrible condition and everything I tried was just making it worse, not better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have cystic acne that is extremely painful and the dermatologist had given me pills and creams that didn&#x27;t seem to help the acne at all.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product is exactly as described, came way before estimated time but was a bit damaged but nothing serious just the box.</li>
            <li> It works as well as proactive it&#x27;s 30 @ walgreens and 2200 @ walmart . I get more compliments on my skin .. I use my moisturizer after he last step @ night like 30 minutes later to make sure all of step 3 and 4 have absorbed.. I don&#x27;t used step 3 and 4 in the daytime I just put on my daytime moisturizer and face powder .. I like the acne free wipes to lo but they are kinda soapy .. U can damp your face and wipe with the moist towelettes and feel real clean .. Just a quick clean up. I&#x27;m the daytime or after working out</li>
            <li> Good stuff just remember to moisturize</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 18 and suffer from EXTREMELY bad acne. I have it running all the way down from my forehead to my shoulders, down to my lower back. It&#x27;s horrific to take my shirt off. After trying Proactiv and other anti-acne products, I gave up for a year and just tried to bare with it. One day, I came across this product and decided to give it a try since it advertised that it was \\&quot;Better than Proactiv\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve been using this consecutively for about 4 weeks now. I&#x27;ve never missed a day, have put it on morning and night as it instructed. I haven&#x27;t noticed ANY change whatsoever in my skin. I&#x27;m going to continue using this until I eventually run out. I&#x27;ll write another post and say if my skin ever cleared up. [...]  . Thanks.    Ok, after finishing the entire package, using it morning and night, never missing a day, i&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that it hasn&#x27;t helped one bit. My skin is exactly the same as it was 2 months ago. This product was a waste of time and money. To anyone who suffers from actual &#x27;severe&#x27; acne, this isn&#x27;t going to help you at all. I would recommend going to a dermatologist because i&#x27;ve tried Proactive and several other off the counter treatments and nothing really works.</li>
            <li> i am a 22 year old female and i thought i was finally done with breakouts. my skin was clear for a few years with an occasional pimple here and there that i would zap with acne spot treatment medication. however, after i started my new job, i was under a lot more stress. i started breaking out with big, painful red pimples and as soon as one would finally go away another would pop up. i was so frustrated and i hated what i saw when i looked in the mirror. i decided to pick up the acnefree severe kit from my local cvs store and thought, what the heck? after just 3 days i noticed a difference. a pimple i had on the side of my nose cleared up overnight and my skin really started to look better. i am so happy with this product. the only downsides are it made the skin around my eyes very tight so i made sure to moisturize them all throughout the day. other than that, this product is a godsend. i tried proactive a few years ago and my acne never cleared up so i stopped and just used the basic drugstore products which worked fine. however, acnefree definitely helped alleviate my stress-caused acne and i am so thankful! i would recommend this to anyone who has tried other products and received no results. acnefree may be just what you&#x27;re looking for :)</li>
            <li> I bought this off Amazon about a month and a half ago because of the many positive reviews. I have had acne since I was 12, although I let it go untreated most of that time. Now I&#x27;m 24 and decided enough was enough, I bought this kit even though my acne is no longer what I consider \\&quot;severe\\&quot; (although it has been in the past as the scars left behind can attest to) My skin is oily and not particularly sensitive so I felt confident I could handle an over the counter severe acne treatment kit. Immediately before I started using this I had been using a generic 5% benzoyl peroxide cream, that had been over drying my face. (I define over drying as when my skin starts flaking)    With all that said, this is a fantastic product, especially for the price. Proactiv goes for $40 on Amazon and this stuff sells for almost half that. Also, this kit did not overdry my skin as straight benzoyl peroxide treatments have done. I imagine some people might have a drying problem, but just use some moisturizer and you should be good to go. As with any acne treatment the key is being consistent. If you start missing applications acne Will come back.    Of course the bottom line is results, this product absolutely cleared up all my acne in a little under a month. It&#x27;s hard to express in words how happy I am looking in the mirror now and seeing a clear complexion looking back at me.    The only downside I can think of is that step 4 comes in a small 1 ounce container and will most likely run out before the rest of the kit does. Other than that I give this product my full reccomendation with consistent use it will most likely clear up most cases of acne.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that did really helped with my acne this product deserves more than 5 stars .. recommended</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. I have tried everything and this is the only system that has given me results.  The clearing doesn&#x27;t happen overnight, but it can significantly help your skin in the first couple of weeks.  THe only negative comment I have is that the products can sometimes bleach clothes and pillowcases.</li>
            <li> This product was an amazing buy for its price. My acne didn&#x27;t start clearing up until about 4 weeks into the system. Although I didn&#x27;t get instant results it&#x27;s the only thing that has worked for me. Less than 30$ for Clear Skin. I believe its worth just to try.</li>
            <li> Pros: Minimizes Pores, Easy To Use    Cons: Burns, Irritates Skin, Dries Out Skin    I would not recommend this to a friend.  I have tried everything from expensive Organic Natural products,Proactive (which burns as well), Antibacterial soaps, no soap, Dove...  Saw this on sale, figured I&#x27;d give it one last shot before my dermatologist appointment.  First day I thought it was working  2nd Day Huge cluster breakout on cheek, burnt around my eyes, red burns and irritation on my neck and chest.  3rd Day all my zits are drying out, but it is still incredibly painful    Am hoping once all my zits clear up the pain will go away...will give it a few more days and see.    Can&#x27;t go out to gym in morning without make up because of the extreme redness on my face and neck :O(</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my son, and he reports that it works very well.  My only complaint is that the smallest bottle of lotion runs out (at least for him) long before the other bottles in the set.  But this seems true of all these types of products.  The cleanser and astringent will easily last the month, but the acne lotion only lasts half that long.  Still, he has asked me to buy this particular brand again.</li>
            <li> *Edit 12/28/2012*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a look at my 2 years of experience with AcneFree Severe. I found this product because I was looking for a wallet friendly alternative to controlling acne besides accutane or seeing a dermatologist. I want to help you understand the effects of this product but I&#x27;ll also talk about my routine and I how I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(STEP 1) The Antibacterial Cleansing Wash&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Antibacterial Wash has Benzoyl peroxide in it which is the standard for fighting acne causing bacteria. Keep this in mind: you are administering a double dose of Benzoyl Peroxide when you use the Antibacterial Wash in combination with the Maximum Strength Repair Lotion in (STEP 3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wash itself feels mild, yet creamy, with some granules. I give my face a gentle rub for a couple minutes and rinse with cool water. With the plausibility of dry skin due to the Benzoyl Peroxide, I DO NOT recommend warm or hot water as it breaks down a very fine layer of epithelial lipids that keep skin balmy and protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(STEP 2) The Renewing Toner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Renewing Toner is definitely a vital component because its primary ingredient is Witch Hazel. It helps balance the facial PH (reducing oil) and hydrate the skin which is subjected to the Benzoyl Peroxide. When putting on the Toner, you should be able to feel the elasticity of your natural skin return and it should ameliorate any dryness or burning with a few swabs applied from a cotton ball. This step should not be ignored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Witch Hazel is an astringent which can be store bought at any old CVS/Walgreens/Walmart for a few dollars. I am currently experimenting with a bottle to see if there is any noticeable difference between AcneFree&#x27;s Toner and just a regular bottle of Witch Hazel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(STEP 3) The Maximum Strength Healing Lotion (Benzoyl Peroxide)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AcneFree has the 10% Benzoyl Peroxide (STEP 3) which is great. 10% is very potent as another reviewer already stated. It does pack a noticeable \\&quot;cool burning\\&quot; sensation and it does feel a little like sandpaper. If you don&#x27;t cake it on, it won&#x27;t dry your skin out. I would know because the skin around my mouth gets creases/laugh lines easily if my skin is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I advise to start with smaller/thinner applications of the Healing Lotion and let your skin adjust over a week. Like I said, the Toner should really be used in conjunction with the lotion. Another great thing about it (for me) is the bottle for the Healing Lotion seems to last really long. I have left overs from 3 boxes ago which I apply on my back and shoulders and chest with great results. Like I said, you don&#x27;t need to go overboard. If you find yourself just going through bottles, you might be using to much. Twice a day application should help a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STEP 4) The Retinol Complex&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works great to soften and nourish the skin. I recommend using it after your first week of just STEPS 1-3, to get your skin use to the products. I find myself using it at night and in the morning. The Retinol Complex says it is not to be used in tandem with The Healing Potion (10% Benzoyl Peroxide). What I do is I substitute the Retinol Complex for the Healing Potion a couple days a week or when I have been getting exposed to really dirty conditions or harsh elements (e.g. exercise, winter, beach, dog). I do notice it keeps my skin supple and more colorful. I recently found out retinol is basically vitamin A which is crazy good for keeping skin young looking. My face suffers much less dryness and irritability when I apply it. The Retinol cream is viscous, but it blends into the skin very nicely. It is not oily or noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Insights&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years I have experimented with using The Antibacterial Wash, The Benzoyl Peroxide and the Retinol Complex completely by themselves. I have determined for myself that the while the Antibacterial Wash and Benzoyl Peroxide fight acne, it is the Retinol Complex and the Renewing Toner that will \\&quot;stabilize\\&quot; your skin. Without The Toner (STEP 2), the potency of The Wash (Step 1) and The Healing Lotion (STEP 3) may dry you out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing is if you make regular and -light- applications of all the steps, it does well.  The sad thing is, since the Renewing toner is basically like a liquid consistency, not cream, so it runs out faster than the other two steps. The Retinol Complex is also a smaller \\&quot;bottle\\&quot; so if you use it like the others, you&#x27;ll run out. I reserve it for night time applications as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had already tried Proactive and the regular Acnefree. I started SEVERE Acnefree since I had no where else to look in my budget after off brand homeostasis pills and whatnot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, Proactiv really does suck. I wish I had a box so I could compare active ingredients and topical strengths but I do not. Back when I was in High School it cost a silly price (39.99) and used a lot of celebrity endorsement to gain false credibility (catalogues featuring Vanessa Williams/Jessica Simpson/Avril Lavigne). I used it for a about half a year before ditching it with mediocre results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m not sure how they actually measured AcneFree Severe to be 4x better, but YES, it performed INFINITELY better than Proactiv for me. Excellent and cost effective product. It smells slightly but it is not a concern for me. While I gave it 5 out of 5 stars, I CANNOT speak for EVERYBODY&#x27;s skin. This supposedly niche product has performed very well in both fighting my acne and rejuvenating my skin for a $20 package ($18, now that amazon has the subscribe feature).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One kit will last me about 4-ish months. I presume the average/new user may consume it in about 2-3 months. I have learned how much my skin needs and how to effectively apply my products overtime. That will take some practice on your part. The Toner usually empties first but pour about 4-5 drops on a normal size cottonball and it should last closer to the other bottles. Just swab lightly so you can really cover on your face without having to apply more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-FINISHING REMARKS-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to lie, I do get a bump or a pimple here or there. This is not a miracle product, but it does exactly what I was hoping it could do: control my acne, prevent breakouts, and promote skin health. My face is much clearer and I have much more confidence because I know the regime will provide consistent results. I am not\\&quot;cured\\&quot; from acne but I cannot blame this product for that because I have a very active and somewhat stressful lifestyle filled with dirt and irritation. That being said, AcneFree SEVERE is 20 bucks and I&#x27;m still using it 2 years after I found it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Protip: Wash your pillow sheets often. All those dead hair and skin cells on your face and the rubbing of skin on dirty fabrics? Those will cause breakouts, just FYI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions feel to drop this review a comment I try to stay up to date.</li>
            <li> Truthfully, it&#x27;s the best over-the-counter acne treatment Ive used to date. I&#x27;ve tried proactive and basically everything else. It does dry out your face a bit, but I have super oily skin so that isn&#x27;t an issue for me. Only complaint I have is when I get busy or don&#x27;t stay at my place, thus forget/can&#x27;t use the treatment as recommended - I feel like I suddenly break out. Seriously, I went out of town for a weekend and forgot it, and by Sunday my face looked worse than it had in years, worse than before I had even started using it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bottom line. if you don&#x27;t have issues with dry skin you will probably love it, but just don&#x27;t stop using then... ha.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now 22 years old, and I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne for most of my life. I&#x27;ve tried everything from Proactive, to prescription pills, topical medicine from dermatologists, and most recently, MaxClarity. I wouldn&#x27;t say that I have extremely severe acne, however I am constantly plagued with cystic acne, whiteheads, or just ugly clusters of pimples. My acne usually forms around my mouth, chin and sometimes  my cheeks and will typically take weeks to heal. When I break out, my self esteem is pretty much non-existent and I hate going out because I think the only thing people see is my acne!!! Most recently I found temporary success using MaxClarity. MaxClarity made my skin soft, and at some points I was completely pimple-free, it was amazing! However, my clear face was short-lived, and I&#x27;d have a horrible acne flare-up that would take weeks to heal. In addition, I would always break out regardless during that time of the month. I was able to put up with the roller-coaster success of MaxClarity because sometimes I would have perfect skin that would boost my confidence...however, in the past couple of weeks my acne has been the worst it&#x27;s EVER BEEN!!! I began to question whether my skin could no longer be helped by MaxClarity. I became desperate for another skin regimen. I&#x27;ve read though probably hundreds of amazon reviews for various acne products trying to find something that might work. That is when I stumbled on Acnefree Severe. I read all of the amazon reviews for this product and decided it was the most feasible to get in a short amount of time to start treating my horrible acne ASAP, plus it had the most positive reviews of any acne product. Now, I&#x27;m nearing the end of the first week of using Acnefree Severe. I have to say, so far, it seems awesome!!! Within the first 2 days, I could see that it was starting to dry out my pre-existing acne. Within 4 days, the acne inflamation was almost 90% decreased!!!! My face is looking clearer already. I&#x27;ve been following the instructions dilligently, and just today purchased the spot acne treatment and sulfur mask to see if that will speed up results. Ultimately, I can say that for only 5 days of use, I&#x27;m already seeing results!!! I&#x27;m hoping that within 2 weeks my skin will be completely clear (seeing as how my progress is now). While I am still forming a few pimples (although less red, not cystic, and not as obvious), I assume that this is just a result of Acnefree purging my face of any soon-to-form acne. My face is feeling soft, my acne is less red and inflamed and easy to cover up with make-up. I&#x27;ve rarely seen a product produce noticeable results in such a short amount of time after using it. Ultimately, I would suggest this product to anybody that can have fairly severe breakouts, but breakouts that have been temporarily manageable in the past. The chemical strength of Acnefree is probably NOT ideal for somebody with the occasional pimple or hormonal flare-up. I&#x27;m really hoping that this product works in the long run! I will make sure to write another review in a couple weeks to document the affectiveness of this product. As someone who has been struggling with acne for years and wondering why I&#x27;m not the lucky girl that has pimple free skin with no effort, I hope this product works!!!    It has now been about 4 weeks since I started using Acnefree Severe. For the record, my skin looks amazing!!!! My previous breakouts are completely cleared up at this point, and any acne marks are noticeably faded/continuing to fade. For anyone beginning to use this product, GIVE IT TIME. Even if your skin isn&#x27;t responding to the product as quickly as others, it seems as if AcneFree takes time (although honestly not that much compared to other products) to fully clear skin. One absolute recommendation when using this product is to use a VERY GOOD moisturizer day and night. The strength of the chemicals will likely dry out and irritate most peoples&#x27; skin, so a oil-free, strong moisturizer willhelp combat that dryness. In addition, after a couple weeks of use I noticed that the Step 4 retinoid cream wasn&#x27;t doing much for my skin, in fact it seemed to make my forehead break out a little. I changed the routine so I use Steps 1 &amp; 2 at night, and then apply the acne spot treatment (sold separately) to any acne. This allows me to skip the 10 minute waiting time after application of Step 2, and it seems to be helping my skin along even more. However, this may not work for everybody, so I would recommend experimenting with this step if you find Step 4 isn&#x27;t useful. As someone who has been struggling with acne for so long, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results AcneFree Severe has given me. At this point, I would STILL recommend AcneFree to anyone similarly struggling with acne and self-esteem. I hope this product works for you too!!    3/6/12  It has now been almost 3 months since I started using this product. Let me just say, that as someone who has struggled with acne for SO LONG and have broken down crying because of the horrible acne on my face, I can say now that my face is the best it has ever looked! I still use steps 1,2&amp;3 in the morning, 1&amp;2 at night with the Acne Spot Treatment. So far, my skin has been almost 100% clear, with only a few pimples arising now and then. I find that using the acne spot treatment at night instead of step 4 clears up any stray pimples extremely quickly (2-3 days). I would still absolutely suggest using a good moisturizer morning and night to combat the dryness of the benzyl peroxide. When I had horrible acne before, I&#x27;d have to constantly run to the mirror to cover up my spots with concealer, in addition to wearing lots of foundation. Now, my skin looks amazing with just a thin layer of light foundation and a little bit of concealer to cover up fading acne marks, plus it looks good ALL DAY. I am no longer self conscious and can be more myself without worrying about how people see me. If you are struggling with frequent breakouts that don&#x27;t seem to be clearing up, I would HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS PRODUCT. It is absolutely amazing, I can&#x27;t even say enough about it. The key to any acne product is that it works in the long term, and so far it seems to be doing just that. Please please please give this product a try because I have a feeling it will help you just as much as it helped me :)    2/22/2016    Now 4 years after trying Acnefree Severe, my skin has never been so clear and my confidence so high while going out in public without makeup. As with all things skin related, improvements can take time. I never saw a 100% clear-up and sustained results until about a year ago. It is KEY to wash your face using the Acnefree kit every single day, morning and night. I cannot stress that enough. If I skipped a night here and there due to laziness, the occasional pimple would pop up that could take up to a week to go away. Granted, I&#x27;m incredibly spoiled now being used to having no pimples and getting one can freak me out. I do notice that even with that occasional pimple, it does clear up in a matter of days (no picking at or messing with it required), and no red spots or marks are left behind. It&#x27;s pretty amazing.  Like a lot of the other reviews have said, this treatment will leave your skin extremely dry, to the point of discomfort. I use 100% pure intensive healing moisturizing balm (pasting the link below). This balm is seriously amazing because you only have to use a small amount, the small jar will last you months because of that, and the balm consistency is SO MUCH MORE hydrating than a regular lotion. It can leave my face a little shiny, but nothing a little powder won&#x27;t fix :)     [...]    Seriously guys, I have had so much success with AcneFree that I&#x27;ve felt the need to come back to this review multiple times since I first posted it 4 years ago and let you know how it&#x27;s gone. Sure, maybe it won&#x27;t work for everybody/every skin type, but it&#x27;s worth a shot. Consistent use is absolutely key.Just give it a chance!!! I&#x27;m posting a picture too taken today so you can actually see what it&#x27;s done for my skin.</li>
            <li> Since my 20&#x27;s I&#x27;ve struggled with cystic acne (I&#x27;m now 48), with bouts of one to two cysts at any given time.  Usually one is healing while a new one is forming.  They are painful, disfiguring and slow to heal.  Took 2 rounds of Accutane which was supposed to cure me, but didn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve developed my own \\&quot;surgical\\&quot; intervention when possible, but the cyst has to follow a specific pattern to open with a sterile needle.  If all else fails I go to the dermatologist for a steroid shot.  For some reason, I&#x27;ve gone through a worse episode than normal so I bought AcneFree on 5/21  I&#x27;m four weeks in and this last week my face has begun to clear - no new cysts and the old ones healing more quickly than usual.  In addition, the quality of my skin is improving.  I&#x27;m also pleased that I&#x27;ve not experienced extreme dryness as others report.  So far I am a happy customer.    July 28th, 2009 update - still no new blemishes.  Face is clear for the 1st time in months.  Still a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many acne products such as Proactiv, Daniel Kern&#x27;s, and other various products with salicylic acid (Stridex pads) and the likes, and I found this to work the best out of all of them. It doesn&#x27;t slightly reduce the size of white heads, but rather, completely eradicates any trace of it, and results are delivered in just a couple of days.    Some word of caution, however.    This stuff is very concentrated, and you should follow the directions VERY carefully. 10% benzoyl peroxide, in abundance over a long period of time, has the potential to leave scars, so don&#x27;t glob a lot of this stuff over a whitehead hoping to make it go away overnight.    Also if you live in a hot area and find yourself sweating a lot (Arizona), keep this stuff AWAY from any articles of clothing, because it can and will bleach your clothes very badly. Even the act of wiping the sweat off your face and wiping it off on your shirt will leave a bleach mark that will not come out.    I&#x27;ve been using this stuff since 2008, and it has not failed me yet. Just be aware that it&#x27;s strong stuff that shouldn&#x27;t be underestimated.</li>
            <li> About a 3weeks ago I started using this product. I have hormonal acne which is one of the hardest forms of acne to treat on skin, because the problem is from within. Now when I say my skin was bad, it was so bad I can&#x27;t go anywhere without makeup.  When I started using this product i saw a little difference by a week. It wasn&#x27;t that noticeable, but I noticed my skin was drying up. I continued using it, but my skin never got excessively dry. Its just perfect. I noticed that I totally stopped breaking out, and no the spots are disappearing. I can&#x27;t remember the last time i washed my face without feeling acne/pimples on my face. I cant actually say that now.  I believe people that don&#x27;t have severe acne get their skin dried out too much.  This is a great product and as it says its better than proactiv. I have used proactiv and didn&#x27;t see much of a difference. This product made all the difference.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> Ok. So I am in my mid 30&#x27;s and have been dealing with breakouts for the past 10 years.They are getting worse as I get older. I have tried numerous acne treatments ,including Proactive..which I spent lots of money on and it did NOTHING for me.  I bought this and after 3 days of use , my face felt like it was on fire and I actually think I had chemical burns on my face. I have VERY sensative skin and was using it as directed. My face became very,very itchy and I think by me scratching at it so much and then applying the product - I burned my skin. I took a break from it for 3 days and then only used it once a day. Now after 2 weeks ,my face is REALLY clearing up! I have not had any bad reactions since and my skin feels really smooth and just looks better overall.  I would suggest if you have sensative skin like me to only use the face wash once a day.It also seems that step 2 really irritated my skin so I haven&#x27;t been using that.    Overall - I am happy with this product and will continue to use it...just gave me a little scare in the beginning!</li>
            <li> I started using this product 2 months ago when I was 5 months pregnant. The product says not to use while pregnant unless consulting physician but I was comfortable with using it since my face ALWAYS breaks out horribly when I am pregnant, and this is the third time so this is nothing new to me. I have used Proactiv, clearasil, oxy pads, pretty much everything. At first I used the acne free system as directed, but it was too strong for my skin, my face became raw and BURNED like nothing else I have ever felt. So I stopped using the gritty lotion, except for on problem areas, and within 4 days i felt 100 percent better, and when the skin healed, the bad acne had cleared. Now With just using the wash, toner, and night cream, my face has made a dramatic turn around, I still get occasional pimples, on my cheek area and still have some minor blackheads but all in all this product worked good for me. My skin feels great, and definately smoother. I love how non-abrasive the wash is, it leaves my skin feeling fresh and not like I just scrubbed it with a brillo-pad. I will probably try to use the lotion again once I am no longer pregnant and see if I get a different reaction but for now the other 3 steps are working just great. I had also had some MINOR acne on my shoulders, within 1 week of using the system that had cleared up and I havent had any problems with my shoulders since. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to get rid of stubborn acne. You just have to remember that even though it may come over night, your acne is not going to cure over night, and acne products WILL dry your skin out and irritate it for a while, but that means that it is working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling with acne for over 3 years now.  I&#x27;ve tried Proactive and many other acne treatments.    And I finally found the solution to this acne maze.    I have been using \\&quot;AcneFree Severe Acne Treatment System\\&quot; for 2 days as of now, and I am seeing the difference!  I can see acnes disappearing! It works!!    Proactive didn&#x27;t work for me, but this one did!    While using PROACTIVE, I felt uncomfortable wearing the toner and lotion.. (It tends to make  my skin look greasy) but AcneFree doesn&#x27;t have that problem.    Definately recommended!</li>
            <li> It cleared my face out within days, however it has a slight tendency to dry my face out. Nothing that a bit of coconut oil didn&#x27;t fix though! Love my skin!</li>
            <li> I have tried it all and this is the only product that has worked for me.  I came across Acnefree while traveling through the U.S. last November and I have to say it is the best investment I ever made for my skin.   &lt;br /&gt;I normally don&#x27;t have the patience for a beauty regime that involves more than a couple of products so when I saw 4 items in the package I was skepticle whether I would stick to following the routine.  It really is very simple to use and doesn&#x27;t take more than a few minutes to apply after the skin has been cleansed.   &lt;br /&gt;I would say within a couple of days after commencing use of the products my breakouts were reduced to almost nil and shortly thereafter the problem was completely cleared.  My skin is still somewhat oily by the end of the day but my pores no longer get blocked. &lt;br /&gt;Thank you University Medical for making a product that actually delivers on its promise, is very reasonably priced and has given me the beautiful complexion I have tried for years to attain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne for years, but the past year it has become worse (painful nodules).  I tried ProActiv for about a year with minimal results.  I came across this product at Target and decided to try it (for 1/3 the price of ProActiv) and I am so glad I did.  It has dramatically changed my skin&#x27;s appearance as well as my confidence!  I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t get rid off all of my acnes. Thats impassivle.  But still, I can see the clear difference after I used this product. And I like it.</li>
            <li> I developed acne as an adult, in my mid twenties and I&#x27;ve been plagued by it since (I&#x27;m 35 now). Nothing spectacular, just a couple of zits on my forehead and shoulders, but enough to annoy me. I tried benzoate, retinol/tretinol and antibiotic treatments (minocyclin) with no significant success. I used this product for two weeks and I noticed an improvement. I still have acne, but less than before and the remaining zits seem to heal faster. Unlike other reviewers, I didn&#x27;t develop dryness, redness or any other kind of discomfort. In fact, my skin feels smoother and softer than before. I just hope the effects of the treatments will not diminish with time (it happened before with the antibiotic treatment, so I&#x27;m just praying this is gonna work).</li>
            <li> I am 22 and have batteling acne on and off since I was 14. During that time I have tried everythng including Proactiv... which really, dont waste your money! I was basically best friends with my dermatolgist who knew that my skin would need something new every other year, due to its becoming immuned to the medicine after awhile. But after m insurance got cancelled my acne medication prices sky rocketed... so I decided to play the over the counter game till I got insurance again.     I spent a few hours looking up my skin type online... I looked up all the active ingredients of most acne medications and then spent a few hours in CVS reading the packaging over every acne clearing medicine on the shelf. This is the one I settled on seeing that it had the strongest chemicals in a single system than anything else. I bought with it the acnefree sulfur mask and after 2 months bought the acnefree scar fading cream. I also own an exfoliator by St. Ives, a cucumber rejuvenating peel-off mask and use Neutrogena Acne free foundation when I put make up on (it has saylic acid in it, one of the low doses of acne treatment). With this particular combination of things I have been acne free. It is a long a process and my skin needs so many products to stay healthy and not have a break out... but this product really is the best... I noticed it working after 2 weeks.    Here are some tips I have had to find out the hard way about acne breakouts:  1. The number one thing I have to advice girls to do is to start a birth control pill or patch. The moment I stop my acne flares very badly. It takes about 3 months for it to show up on your skin, but its the best way to regulate skin condition.  2. If you get cheeck acne like I do... pay attention to cleaning your cell phone often... or putting it on speaker as often as possible, of just holding it a bit away from your face when you talk.   3. Clean your pillow cases as often as you can! Think about it... your laying with your face and hair smooshed against something for 8 hours at a time.  4. Keep your hair back when ever you cantieing it back and pulling back bangs... just styled your hair and don&#x27;t want a big rubber band kink in it? Just use a piece of ribbon and pull it back gently till your ready to go out and just use a small bobby pin to pull the bangs. (Not only does your hair lock in oils... but think of all those chemicals you spray in it that rubs off on your face!)  5. Avoid putting on make up till you really need to... I highly highly highly recommend Neutrogenas Liquid Foundation that actually has acne medicine it. You can find it at your local drug store... this is the only kind of make up that dosnt cause a break out of any sort.  6. Touch your face as little as possible during the day.  7. Watch what you eat. Some people say chocolate... but I swear for me its shrimp! But I guess for different people really you can have different reactions... but shrimp will cause a flare up within a day... they are bottom feeders... so I am just eating the dirt that they eat off the bottom of the ocean.  8. Try a skin vitamin! Vit. E, Biotin, and flax will really help skin a lot! Anything with omegas in it makes skin and hair stronger and healthier. I love Avacados!    Those are my tips... I am just a normal person who has been very observant of my skin and have made coorelations between breakouts and the things I have done... it dosn&#x27;t hurt to make your own diary and mark your own findings. :)</li>
            <li> Okay, first of...this kit is an awesome deal for the price! for less than $25 dollars, without the hassle of prescription, and typically found at any pharmacy store like Walgreens, Target etc., it is such a convenient!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Caution with step 3: the first night I&#x27;ve used the product, my face was really tender and a little inflamed. My skin was tremendously dry. (So, just FYI...if you have a function or a party that you need to go to, consider using this afterwards, because it takes a few days for your face to clear the stubborn acnes and other after effects) I can almost tell, I used the Step 3 lotion more than what I should. AVOID the eye and lip area, especially if you have sensitive skin! But after a couple of days, I can definitely tell some amazing results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ANYONE SUFFERING WITH \\&quot;SEVERE ACNE\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a fraction of the cost, it&#x27;s worth having clear skin all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inferiority Complex...GONE!</li>
            <li> I have tried several products over the last few years (to include oral and topical prescription medications) and nothing seemed to work. I even visited an \\&quot;acne forum\\&quot; to read suggested products and made purchases based on those recommendations, although my skin only improved slightly - and at the expense of being embarrassingly dry and flakey.    I thought I would give this product a try and sure enough, it has been amazing. My skin started showing immediate signs of improvement within days and by the end of ONE WEEK, the majority of my blemishes were gone. Nearly a month later, my skin looks practically flawless. All of this without bad flaking or additional breakouts first.    For the first time in years, my skin looks healthy and glowing. If you have been struggling to find a product that works, I highly recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li> They are fast at shipping, always on time, quality is always good, you get what you pay for, and the price is always the best. I would highly recommend buying off of Amazon.</li>
            <li> Yes I love this product , been using this for months and have gotten great results.</li>
            <li> First of all, as other reviews have mentioned this product is much better than proactive. You will see results with this quickly but it&#x27;s not the silver bullet for acne issues. I used this for about two months and saw a noticable improvement but my skin was still not where I wanted it to be.    With that said, this product in combination with Clarisonic did absolute miracles for me. My skin looks the best it has ever looked in my entire life. If you are using this product and looking for something else to get your skin that extra mile (consistantly), invest in a Clarisonic.    Pros:  Price  Availability  It WORKS    Cons:   Time consuming  Need to be consistant  Not perfect on it&#x27;s own  May be too strong for some peoples skin</li>
            <li> I had acne since I was 14, I&#x27;m 45. I tried everything including Skin Dr&#x27;s and products from the skin Dr.  They work for a while but very expensive as the Dr wants me to see him on monthly bases.      I wanted to find a solution to my acne without the Dr. I tried Proactiv and it was good but very expensive. I got the 4 piece sensitive skin + the Mask at a Proactiv kiosk at the mall and it was $80.00.   I needed to find something I can afford! I read all the reviews for skin care and AcneFree Severe kept coming up.  I gave it a try and  within a week it cleared my face!!! Even the Skin Dr products were not that fast!! The price is about $21.00 in Target. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now. You must use it twice a day. I also use the Sulfar Mask and the Scar Fade &amp; Erase to remove scars and redness marks from the acne. The Mask is amazing! its 3.5% sulfur and copper, Better than the proactiv Mask and it&#x27;s only $6.00. When Put it overnight on the cyst and it will heal faster.sensitive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 23 and have had acne issues since I was about 17, started mild, then got bad starting about age 19. I have used Clearasil, Pro-Active, Oxy, and countless other treatments, but this product has worked the best for me. I would say when using mild acne treatments i would get about a lot of pimples with a bunch of redness on my face. After using this product I get about 4-5 pimples a month and little to no redness on face. For a lot of the month my skin looks great with no visible acne!   I have been using Acne Free Sever for about 8-12 months now and it has proven to work well for me. I do caution others those (as many other reviewers have pointed out) THIS STUFF IS POTENT. The lotion burned for about the first week of application, then my skin got used to it. Another suggestion that I highly recommend would be using an oil free moisturizer with the product. Now I know a lot of guys don&#x27;t use moisturizer, but honestly guys, this product WILL dry out your skin and which would you rather have, dry flaky skin or smooth soft skin?   Overall I really like this product, but I am currently looking for other products. I know its wierd to write in a review with a 5 star rating, but the truth of the matter is that this stuff is about the strongest thing you can get over the counter. If something less potent can get me close to the results of the product, I&#x27;m going to use it as I&#x27;m sure it would be better for my skin. But if you have tried a bunch of other products and they didn&#x27;t seem to work for you, or if  regular strength Acne Free worked well, but just not well enough this may be the product for you.</li>
            <li> I started getting acne in my early 30&#x27;s. I tried so many acne systems over 9 years (I&#x27;m 39 now), including Pro Activ and nothing worked - until now!  I put off adding a review right away (even though I noticed results immediately) because I wanted to be sure I was going to have positive results long term.  I&#x27;ve been using Acne Free Severe for about 6 weeks now and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Immediately, it started to heal the pimples I had (large cyst like pimples).  And, it keeps new pimples from appearing.  Before using Acne Free it seemed like each morning, I woke with a new red spot on my face.  I used to run to the mirror as soon as I got up to see what was there, now I am rest assured to only find a clear, smooth face!  Not only did it clear my pimples, but it has really started to repair damage done from pimples I&#x27;ve had in the past. I have experienced NO dryness and no redness!  But, you should only use this if you truly have \\&quot;severe\\&quot; acne and severely oily skin. I always seem to run out of the toner before the rest of the products.  Saw a you tube video where a customer recommends using witch hazel as toner until the other 3 products run out!  Was glad for that tip and thought I&#x27;d share.  I&#x27;m so grateful for this product!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> So far so good, I can see an improvement of my acne (under my chin) using this product, but as I woke up after applying it on my second day I saw my t-shirt on the mirror and its collar was totally bleached !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several products in the past and this one seemed to worked the best to help clear up my very mild blemishes around my nose and does it pretty quickly. I barely been using it a week. I actually liked the morning lotion which does burn a little and feels somewhat sandy when applied, but it&#x27;s better than the oily feel I get with other products.     Also, you&#x27;re better off finding this at Walmart where I got mine for less.</li>
            <li> This system works very well on my adult acne. It hasn&#x27;t cleared my skin entirely, but the severity of breakouts have definitely decreased.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my son about 6 weeks ago.  Within a few days his pimples starting clearing up.  He had a very bad case of acne.  It is now 6 weeks later and his pimples are not totally gone but his acne is much less severe than it was.    At first his face burned and dried out a little, but his face now seems used to the product.  The #2 gets used up much quicker than the rest of the products.      When he misses a day using all of the steps, we notice the difference.    Hopefully, in another few months all of his pimples will be gone.  If not, at least his face looks MUCH BETTER than before.</li>
            <li> My acne has been halted, but my face looks worse than it did before the treatment.  Your face will feel like it is on fire!!!  I now break out in places where I have never had acne.  Very stringent process everyday!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it for 4 days and my acne is getting worse.  I read the reviews before ordering them,I don&#x27;t know what these people are talking about but I definitely do not recommend this to anyone .</li>
            <li> I am 35 years old and have been suffering from acne since I turned an adult. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 days and I see improvements I never got with Proactive or from my dermatologist. The irritating bumps and whiteheads are disappearing but I must say that the step 3 lotion can irritate and burn all day. Do Not get it anywhere near your lips or eyelids!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to continue with it. I long for the day when my skin is clear and I don&#x27;t have to wear make-up to &#x27;hide&#x27; flaws and black marks over my face. I pray this works for me in the long run</li>
            <li> So I used this product faithfully for 3 months. It worked at first. It started drying my face out and so did a few of the pimples. As I kept using it (2 weeks in)I started getting the really bad, painful under the skin kind of pimples! I never had those before. My face had less visible pimples but way more painful bumps that were so huge that you really cant cover up with any kind of makeup. I kept using it thinking this would pass but it didn&#x27;t. I now have deep scars from those humongous pimples that I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten had I not used acne free!!</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin (its crazy). It took two weeks for the system to dry my skin out and for me to see results. Proactive/Clearasil could not make a dent in my skin after 2 months. This stuff is EXTREMELY potent and you will feel it after the first application.     Your skin will dry out and start flaking at which point I suggest you do STEP 3 less or start using an oil free moisturizer. Also, do not put this stuff near your eyes they will burn.  After 2 weeks my skin started healing extremely fast. New acne was reduced to nothing and old acne started clearing up.     Few things to note:     1. DO NOT PUT THIS ANYWHERE NEAR YOUR EYES   2. Step 1 - I used a stronger exfoliating scrub with the cleanser provided (extremely oily skin)   3. Step 4 - Skin feels amazing after waking up. Make sure your face is dry completely before applying     Also, if you have sensitive skin I suggest you go with something more mild. This stuff is strong as advertised.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did not work for me. I wish I could give a reason as to why, but I cannot. What I can tell you is that I have been using it for approx. three months faithfully, only to find that the most it did was transfer my acne colonies in a different direction. Yes, that&#x27;s right--when one colony disappeared, another appeared just slightly n/s/w/e from the original position. It was very frustrating; I resorted to sleeping in different positions and other potentially helpful measures, but to no avail. Here are the specs of my skin:    1. I have extremely dry skin  2. I have extremely NON-sensitive skin  3. I have acne just about everywhere  4. I rarely go out in the sun  5. I rarely have any stress    I have moved on to another skin care regimen that is doing wonders to my face. Let&#x27;s hope it doesn&#x27;t just \\&quot;re-transfer\\&quot; like this one did!:)</li>
            <li> My skin is very oily and in the summer prone to severe acne. I researched many products and decided to give this a try....so far I am very satisfied! I tried Salycic Acid in Clearskin, Clearisil, and Oxy and they all failed. So I was convinced my next step would be benzyol peroxide. Within after the first day my red blemishes stopped hurtin and began to dimish Quickly! It&#x27;s been exactly 7 days and I do not have a new pimple at all. My oily skin slowly but surely has decreased a little.    NOTE: I do follow the instructions exactly as given and use no other product on my face except for eye makeup    I still have huge visible pores and will focus on minimizing them later . However my acne is under control and hope it stays that way. Thanks to AcneFree!    I do not give the product a full 5 stars only because it does not do everything I want. However it does do what it advertises which is clearing the skin of acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had acne, but even now at 30 years old, it started to get worse!  Nothing would work, and I found this by luck at a expensive store, and IT WORKED!  My skin is pretty tough, so it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all.  I don&#x27;t know if this product helped, but I  use ALBA  aloe &amp; green tea oil-free moisturizer after I put on the three step.  The moisturizer is EXPENSIVE, but it soothes the skin, and smells great! I also use Clearasil Ultra Rapid Ultra pad. To get that deep down clean just in case the face wash missing anything. For me my face has never been clearer.  Now that I&#x27;ve run out, I&#x27;m starting to break out again.  So I guess I should have some on backup for next time.  I put the codes for the other two products down below for anyone who wanted it.  So once again..    1. Wash your face with a face scub  2. Use the Clearasi Ultra Cleansing Pads to get that deep down clean or anything you missed  3. Use the Acne treatmen, and Repair Lotion  4. Use Alba Aloe &amp; Green Tea Mosiurizer    After my face stared to clear up, I found that ANY face scrub will due, and you could actually skip the repair lotion and use the Alba Moisturizer by itself,, but Unfortunately you can&#x27;t buy the acne medication by itself,, but regardless, it&#x27;s worth it to get the best skin possible for me.

            <li> My daughter used this product for about three days.  Yesterday she started with a rash which then turned into a really bad chemical burn on most of her face!  It didn&#x27;t really help the acne, her skin looked way better before using this.  Now not only does she have the burn, but also patches of dry white flaky skin that will not go away!  I guess if you want to burn a layer of your skin off, this is the product to use.  Be very very careful if you use this!  Her face is a hot mess.  The burn is very red, rashy, and really painful.</li>
            <li> Let me give a super brief background about myself. YAZ birthcontrol and Bare Minerals destroyed my face: cystic acne, red crusty, flaky, oily, disgusting. It was horrible time in my life, super embarrassing.I have always had moderate to severe acne, from High school til now- I&#x27;m 23 years old. I have tried: antibiotics/differn, clean and clear &amp; clear advantage acne kit, clearasil ulta acnes solution kit,lush,and OF COURSE PROACTIVE, which sucks the most by the way.  Then I found Acne Free Severe Treatment. Simply the best and within 10 days a major improvement. However within those first 10 days it can be a scary process. The first 1-5 days more pimples came out from the woodwork, there were all over my face! But I still religiously did all the steps and by the 10th day, my skin was clearer! All but one pimple was left. My skin feels soft and clean.     Most reviews says it dries out your face, my face is was super oily so it didn&#x27;t start to feel dry until the 7th day. Now I incorporate oil free moisturizer in the morning. Once a week i also use a exfoliant, if its needed.    BUY A WHITE TOWEL, Benzoyl peroxide will destroy you&#x27;r towels, but its worth it. :]    AVOID the eye area. Thin skin beneath my eyes became a bit flaky but now i just avoid the eyes: problem solved.     first i wet my face do step 1  dry my face do step 2  brush teeth, you want your face completely dry from the toner before proceeding to step 3  once face is completely dry do step 3    wait an hour or right before i leave for school/work i put on my moisturizer</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about a week and I have seen an amazing improvement. Overall, it is a great product and if you have mild or moderate acne I would highly recommend this.    I never had an acne problem until I came to college, and the last 6 months have been a struggle with acne. I used the original 3-step Acnefree since middle school and it worked fine all through high school too, I always had a clear face.    When I went to college I got horrible acne (in my opinion, it was probably considered mild or mild-moderate). Anyways I always had acne and I just couldn&#x27;t do anything about it. Finally I just decided to get the Acnefree severe, even though I technically didn&#x27;t have severe acne. I was hesitant at first because people said it burned your face and is only for people with severe acne. However, I have not experienced these issues and my face is completely clear. It is slightly drying, but just use a good moisturizer once a day and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> Worked wonders that many others could not do!  Cleared in two weeks what even prescribed had not done after years of trying. My skin looks better now than it has looked in over 10 years!!!</li>
            <li> I had severe acne since I was 10 years old. It&#x27;s been over a decade and my skin keeps having break-out. It never stopped and I was hopeless. I have tried many products, including Proactiv and the regular AcneFree for the last decade. However, nothing really worked, until I found it. Why did I not find it earlier?! Why did I wait this long to see it after my skin has been damaged by acne scars. All the acne is gone, I mean, seriously my skin is completely clean! Guys, just try it once, just once and see how it will change your confidence and smile. Make sure you use the Toner and the Moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Like every other acne product i&#x27;ve ever tried that didn&#x27;t work, this was no exception. Product did not help me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had severe acne on my back for about a year in a half. I never had it before now, so it was incredibly frustrating. I tried everything to make my body go back to normal but nothing would work and it just kept getting worse. I decided to try this product and within one week all the tiny bumps on my back are gone, the rest of it is getting smaller and smaller. This is a great product I strongly suggest it. I also started to get mild acne on my face a few months ago and it is getting smaller and less noticeable but it definitely dries out my face. I put extra moisturizer and vaseline on the worst of it which seems to be doing an okay job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been suffering from acne for a few years now and tried just about all the drugstore acne products sold but nothing ever worked. Almost a week into the treatment and my skin was completely clear. Even my friends noticed the change in my skin! I think I used a bit too much though when I got a rash on my upper cheeks. But I used moisturizing cream for a few days and it was fine after that. Just make sure not to use to much of the product; a little really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use in place of the Clinique Acne Solutions kit, because the Clinique kit is expensive. This kit did not do hardly anything for my adult acne. The night treatment, when put directly on a pimple, did nothing to reduce it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The facial wash didn&#x27;t seem to clean my face, and it wouldn&#x27;t remove any makeup that I had on. Honestly, none of the products seemed to work (and in fact made my acne worse) and I ended up getting a Neutrogena face wash/mask that cleared up my skin in a few days.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter. She tried the cleanser before and it is working fine so I bought the whole system.  However, she got allergic reaction and has to stop.</li>
            <li> The very first week I used this I noticed results. Amazing results, at that. Not dryness, and my acne was clearing up very quickly.       I have acne mainly on my forehead and nose, and I also have very oily skin on my nose. It definitely got rid of the acne on my forehead, but did nothing for my nose.        About a month after I started using it, my acne started coming back. It was worse then it was when I started using this system.       I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not effective, but it didn&#x27;t work consistanly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been only using this product for a week now and it seems to be working well. I&#x27;m nervous to get too optimistic because products tend to work for a while and then stop on me. I will have to update this review in a month.    Overall I would say that I have moderate acne, with cystic acne flare ups. many small bumps under the skin that don&#x27;t become full fledged white heads, uneven skin texture and color, but not much scarring. I started the program with three nodules that have seemed to calm down quite a bit. What I have noticed is the discoloration from past acne flareups seems to be fading which I am very happy about.    I have not had any sensitivities to the product. I like the combination of calming, natural ingredients in the composition of each product. I had tried Pro active in the past and it did not work for me, but I think I needed something a little stronger. I am hoping that this combination will work better for me.     Good price, and I like that it&#x27;s available at the store...Though I had to go to three stores to find it! Guess it must work well if it&#x27;s getting sold out. May be easier to order on line in the future, but I wanted to try it right away to see if it worked.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on Amazon, I went out to Target and bought this product. It&#x27;s been two months now, and my skin has not improved at all. I&#x27;m still breaking out, and even more of my face is covered with acne!</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product that has cleared my skin. I honestly picked it out of all the products because it was in a bright package and on sale. I am very glad their marketing worked! I tried proactive (worked for a month then just started to dry and deteriorate my skin) and Nutregena, I even saw a dermatologist and was given prescription strength medications lotions and even birth control for acne. None of it worked nearly as well as this. It has even started to get rid of some of the scars that past acne break outs left.  I wish I had one of those before and after pictures. I encourage people to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had clear skin all my life and after turning 20 I started getting some mild acne on my back and shoulders and I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to that as long as my face was clear and all of a sudden boom ! My beautiful skin is infested with cysts and almost any kind of acne that exists, I would all bouquet of acne like 5-10 at the same spot. I used ProActive and almost any other OTC products I could find, nothing would help. I came across this product and believe it or not this was like last Acne Medicine that I hadn&#x27;t tried from CVS pharmacy and I thought well it&#x27;s not going to help anyways and I gave up already and just accepted the fact that my face wouldn&#x27;t be as it used to. Sounds familiar? First week, OMG First week and it&#x27;s all gone. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and been following all the directions and using it 2 times daily and I&#x27;ve had some acne scars, they are clearing up too ! This product gave me confidence I had and took all that frustration out of my life, now I can look in the mirror and see myself again and not the acne infested face. I&#x27;ve been following healthy diet and trying to avoid acne causing foods as much as I could and it worked. All of it&#x27;s said there are some downsides too. First of, these medications are very potent and my left eye been itching since I started using this product because I think I accidentally applied some around my eye. Other than that I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product and would recommend to anyone with moderate - severe acne. I would also recommend you putting aloe gel on your face because it really soothes and makes the redness and irritation go away.</li>
            <li> Great product works excellent</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a few week and my face looks its best in years. Ive been using proactiv for a while and I wasn&#x27;t getting the reults I hoped for, this product went beyond expectations. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My son and I both suffer with acne. I am now 34 yrs old and I have used almost every product on the market. I get extreme breakouts and so does my son. I have tried proactive, clear skin and so many other products on both myself and my son and none of them have worked as well as this has. We have been using this for almost two months now and have noticed clearer skin. My son took before pictures and a new one and was surprised at the differences. I would like to say thank you to Acne Free, you have given my son his confidance back. He now thinks he is sexy and for that I know this product works!!!!</li>
            <li> First off, this is my mother&#x27;s account. I am an 18 year old male who has a history of bad acne because of genetics. Before using Severe Acne Free, I used to go to a dermatologist because of never ending acne. I&#x27;m very happy to say that this Severe Acne Free System definitely works, my skin is clearer than ever. I was going to a dermatologist monthly for less than a year but it became to pricey with the expensive doryx pills, various topical creams [epiduo gel then atralin] and glycolic acid face wash. After putting my dermatologist visits on hold because of the expenses, my acne did not fail to come back. It came back and it felt worse and more of a hassle. I tried all the tools for acne I had including Proactiv and leftovers from the derma but nothing was really clearing up my acne. Over my winter break, it got really bad. Didn&#x27;t feel like going out in public anymore. Acne, pimples that resembled cysts, dry raw skin, black/white heads...the worst. My mom read reviews for Severe Acne Free and was convinced it would help, so we found a set at Walmart for $21.87. I used it and the steps were similar to Proactiv. There are 3 steps for the morning and 4 at night. I used the 4 steps when I first got it and the next morning my face felt smoother and the right side of my face looked almost clear. I was amazed at how fast it worked because of the severity of my acne the day before. I got and used Severe Acne Free System on 12/30 [evening treatment] and it&#x27;s 1/3 right now and my face has diminishing pimples on my cheeks and is not dried up nor feeling greasy but for the most part my face is pretty cleared up in only 5 days. I feel that its secret is the 4th step that you apply at night which Proactiv didn&#x27;t have. It really gets at any pimples that are already there and any pimples that are just starting to form. I conclude with this-I went to a dermatologist, the results started happening within a month. Severe Acne Free results happened the next day for me. Huge price difference. All there is to say is that it works!    This is his mom now...for over the counter product, this is excellent! No, we&#x27;re not being paid to recommend this product or write this. We&#x27;re just sharing our experience. My son&#x27;s face isn&#x27;t completely cleared of blemishes yet but for him it&#x27;s a major improvement. He&#x27;s happy that those gigantic red cysts had gone down a lot. He just has to keep at it...To compare a $21.87 product to his derma treatment, here&#x27;s the breakdown: his monthly doctor&#x27;s visits [$160 each visit], prescription oral pills [Doryx] cost $421/30 pills/month, glycolic acid face wash cost $25 [lasted about 3 months] sold at the derma&#x27;s office and his 2 topical gel/cream [epiduo and atralin]cost &gt;$100/tube....no wonder our Aetna&#x27;s health fund was consumed in 7 months. We started paying our other medical expenses after that in full from our own pockets because we haven&#x27;t fulfilled our deductible for the year....Bottomline, this works and my son is back to going out in public with us or his friends without hiding his face in a hoodie all the time! Give it a try, it might work for you.....Oh, 1 last note, use a white or cream colored towel and be sure that you&#x27;d be wearing a sleepwear you don&#x27;t mind being damaged by benzoyl peroxide...</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old, oily skin and always experienced blackheads around my nose area, but lately I began to get big cyst like pimples around my cheeks and chin. I&#x27;ve had this product for almost two month now and I must say it works wonders with oily skin, it has gotten my oil under control and it has helped with my blackheads, although they are not completely gone. My big cyst-like pimples are non-existent now, and my pore size seems to have minimized which is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was VERY tempted to stop using this product during my first week of use because my skin dried out SOOO much it was ridiculous, my entire face felt like SANDPAPER and LOOKED LIKE SANDPAPER-- no kidding! but I continued and the dead skin soon just went away, but it also caused my skin to itch (this only happened during my sandpaper phase). After using the kit for two weeks straight I decided to slow down on the use and began to alternate steps 3 and 4 each night. Normally you are supposed to use step 3 during the day and step 4 at night but since my acne is under control I decided to use the medications only at night (alternating each night) but I still continue to use the face wash twice a day and always follow with the toner. I found this routine to work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also its recommeded to use sunscreen during the day... I found the BEST suncreen for oily, acne-prone skin \\&quot;Neutrogena Clear Skin Sunblock Lotion SPF 55.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this kit! --oh and I have previously used proactive and it did NOT work at all on me.</li>
            <li> I start to use them two months ago. They work very well. I am comfortable with them so far. The only concern I have is that whether they have side effects.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. I was completely clear of acne in one month. I live in the carribean and ordered it front amazon.com. I&#x27;ve tried Accutane, Proactiv (twice), prescription drug, antibiotics etc. But nothing worked as quickly and completely as Acnefree. Thanks! Wish I had a before and after picture. Just need to get rid of the acne scars, can&#x27;t use hydroquinione so I&#x27;m at a lost. But the acne is gone. Yeah!!</li>
            <li> I began using this product on Tuesday June 12, so it&#x27;s been one week today that I started. I am one of those people who have tried NUMEROUS acne products, from over the counter to prescription with no results. I have not yet tried Proactiv because I don&#x27;t want to shell out the money for a membership without knowing how it will work for me. I tired this product because it was a little cheaper and didn&#x27;t require a membership. I love it! I don&#x27;t have \\&quot;severe\\&quot; acne like what is seen in the Proactiv \\&quot;before and after\\&quot; commercials, but do get regular breakouts. I have noticed with this product that my face cleared up nicely. However, I tend to get the large, painful cyst-like pimples under the skin that never go away. Normally it takes about two weeks for one of these to clear up (with or without treatment). While using this product, one of these cysts popped up on Sunday, by Tuesday (today) it is nearly gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product seems to be more of a retroactive treatment than preventative, because I am still getting a pimple or blemish here and there, but it clears them up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product dries out my skin a bit. So after I apply the stages and let each dry, I apply a layer of Cetaphil facial moisturizer which has SPF and won&#x27;t clog pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a decent product just wish it didn&#x27;t dry my face out and wish it prevented acne, not just cleared it up.</li>
            <li> This stuff broke my skin out! after about three days it began to peel my skin. I had to stop using it and go back to my other way of clearing my acne, don not buy this stuff&gt;</li>
            <li> Well.. I&#x27;m on day 3 of using this product and so far I LOVE it. Already my face is looking and feeling better. I have very oily skin, and I have new breakouts almost daily - ah the wonders of genetics. After my first use my skin felt great, and over the last few days I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts, and the ones I have seem to be getting smaller. I have to say, I&#x27;ve used a million acne treatments, and this is one of the first ones I&#x27;ve ever used that didn&#x27;t make my face 10 times worse before it got better.. We&#x27;ll see if that turns out to be a good thing or not.     All in all, so far my face is feeling so much better. My breakouts started clearing up almost immediately, and no more have formed. Even my mom commented that it seemed to be working. I&#x27;m loving this product so far, and will definetly continue to use it. I&#x27;ll let you know how it goes when i&#x27;ve been using it longer.</li>
            <li> Let me start this out by stating that I am in my 30&#x27;s and have tried every acne product known to man for about 15 years. I have seen a dermatologist, resorted to birth control and used everything from neutrogena to murad, as well as proactiv. None of these worked for me, and most actually made my skin worse.     When you&#x27;re in your 30&#x27;s and are STILL dealing with acne, you start to wish for wrinkles, because who has wrinkles and acne, right?!?! I was starting to think I would be one of the few dealing with both, and that was a pretty depressing prospect.     I usually check out reviews on everything before I buy it, but when I saw this product at target, and saw that it was marketed specifically for severe acne, I bought it without knowing a thing about it (sidenote: this product was 21.99 there).     I know it sounds crazy, but I saw a difference in my skin the next day, after only applying it before I went to bed. Prior to purchasing this, I had just had a terrible experience with Burts Bees acne products, which had made my skin red, even more oily, and had produced terrible pre-pubescent breakouts along both sides of my chin. After one application of acne free, the redness was reduced significantly, and some of my more painfull bumps had gone down in size...which is huge.     I was ecstatic, but had experienced these results with other topical treatments, only to be let down a week or so later, when my skin would eventually return to its angry self. So I waited two weeks before sharing my review.     It is now three weeks after starting application, and my skin has honestly never been so clear. I still have a few bumps, but compared to what I was dealing with before, I&#x27;ll take them. Because this is a benzoyl peroxide based product, after a few weeks my skin became really tight, and that led to a few minor bumps. I started using an oil free, fragrance free moisturizer (olay regenerist), and that cleared everything up.     My husband has remarked on how much brighter my skin looks, and I am over the moon. I have even gone to the grocery store without makeup (and not wanted to die of humiliation). If you have skin like mine, you know what a huge, amazing thing this is.     Prior to using acne free, I had small bumps, whiteheads, and periodic cystic bumps that were super painful. It may not have looked severe to other people, but it felt pretty darn severe to me after dealing with it for so long. I would absolutely, whole heartedly reccomend this product to anyone dealing with acne. Just invest in some great moisturizer if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my nephew, he tried everything over the counter.This one really worked for him-and it was the only one. In 3 days his face was clean. He loves it!</li>
            <li> Great product. I would buy this product over and over. It works great with my skin and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> My son has tried every product on the shelves and also a number of prescription drugs and creams.  Nothing helped.  I bought him AcneFree Severe Acne Treatment and his face has cleared up within a week.  I&#x27;m amazed!  I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars at dermatoligists that couldn&#x27;t help!  I highly recommend this product.  My daughers, who don&#x27;t have severe acne, love the regular AcneFree Treatment system.  They don&#x27;t need the severe product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for one of my teenage sons, who has had trouble tolerating many of the prescribed pills to help clear his acne. We have gone through several wash/cream regimens but with no real results. The product kit arrived yesterday and he began to use it as directed. No lie- today his face has noticeably fewer whiteheads and is less oily. His skin does not appear irritated and he did not complain of any burning with it&#x27;s use. I learned that one of the recommended treatments by dermatologists is to use Retin A, which is a primary ingredient (retinol) in the Acne Free Severe Treatment. Definitely worth a try for stubborn acne, and for those who cannot or do not want to go the \\&quot;pill\\&quot; route. So far very happy with the immediate results!</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of Proactive, which I have used in the past with good results.  While Proactive dried my skin out, it did nothing like this product. I still have just as many breakouts, but now my skin is also dry, peeling and itchy.  It also has made my skin red and blotchy.  Plus there is No money back garuntee.  BAD product, go for Proactive instead.</li>
            <li> I orignially used Pro-Active.  I am 39 and NEVER got pimples as a teen.  I tried pro-active and it worked great.  I found AcneFree and it said it worked better and faster than Pro-Active and was less expensive.  I tried it and my clear skin (from using Pro-Active) broke out in pimples.  To be fair, I tried it for a month.  My face never got better.  I went back to Pro-Active, gave AcneFree to a friend for her son to use and it didn&#x27;t work on him either.  Once again my skin is clear.  Pro-Active may cost more, but it is much more effective on my skin.  I am not saying that this won&#x27;t work for you, but it DEFINATELY did not work for me or my friend&#x27;s 15 year old son.....</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product online. I used to get one pimple at a time. Hence I thought I need to use a complete system to cleanse, tone and treat my skin. after using this product my chin and cheeks are full of acne.  I don&#x27;t know where I went wrong.  My skin was super itchy and dry in the first two weeks. I accidently applied it around my eyes and next morning my eyelids were swollen up.  My skin feels like its burning when I apply this product.  If it cleard my acne I would continue to apply the product to the affected areas. but instead I have more acne.  So I just bought a local brand acne cream which has 10% benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> i am 44 years old and have suffered with severe breakouts for all of my adult life. i have tried everything from proactive to expensive prescription meds and very fancy dermatological treatments and peels. i don&#x27;t see my dermatologist anymore, though he was sweet. perhaps if he were cuter... i digress. my skin was becoming worse with pustule breakouts all along my nose and chin. i felt embarrassed to leave the house since i didn&#x27;t want anyone to see me. i tried the acne free severe treatment and i started to see results within a few days. in two weeks my skin had cleared and within a month was cleared completely. my skin is not sensitive so i didn&#x27;t experience any burning or itching. i think that the negative reviews on this product are from people with overly sensitive skin. there&#x27;s nothing that works for everyone, but it&#x27;s great for me. i&#x27;ve been using it for over five months and while i&#x27;ll get an occasional pimple it&#x27;s completely manageable. all the other things i&#x27;ve used worked initially but stopped working after only two or three months.  the last skincare regimen i used cost over $1100. it worked a full four months before losing its potency. i&#x27;m going to try switching over to the regular acne free kit for maintenance to be sure my skin doesn&#x27;t somehow get \\&quot;used\\&quot; to the acne free severe. try this, i hope it works out for you.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I cant live without it! I had terrible acne as well as scars and it cleared up my acne within two weeks. However as for the scars there are slowly fading away. I don&#x27;t use the retinol complex in the package because i don&#x27;t like the way it feels on myskin. I would recommend this to anyone who have severe acne. THIS STUFF WORKS. TRY IT!! USE a moisturizer with it as well! it can be drying but oily skin is the cause to breakouts!</li>
            <li> For bad, painful acne this is the right product. I have used Proactiv for over a year and still had blemishes, with Acne Free my face cleared up in two weeks! I mean clear. During the first three days your skin is very dry- I would suggest a light oil free moisturizer with sunscreen after the regimen, in the morning only. The first use (at night) did cause minor facial swelling that subsided in about the time it took me to shower. As with anything new some adjustment is required- your skin is the largest organ in the body! Some suggestions that I have found to help    1. Wash hands frequently-the oils from our hands feed growing pimples. If you can&#x27;t wash your hands frequently use a alcohol based sanitizer, this will help minimize the oil in your fingertips.   2.Try not to touch your face, especially during the first week of treatment as this will irritate the obstructions.  3.Before washing your face, take a hot washcloth and drape it over your face (this will open the pores) for about a minute. Then apply the face wash, let the skin dry before applying the toner. Again let the skin dry before applying the repairing lotion. At night, is is very important to wait 10 minutes before applying the night serum-wash your hands again before the last step at night as 10 minutes is enough time for your fingers to build up oils and you will be touching your face again. I hope this helps, and good luck to clear skin.</li>
            <li> I have three girls, they love this product, and in the past have used  Pro-active only to have dry skin, and irritation.  I have set up for auto delivery, so they do not run out.</li>
            <li> Some people have bad reviews for this probably because they havent ever dealt with a medication as strong as 10% BP thus the peeling. If you have been using BP products for a while around 5 and 10% then you will be fine and this product will work very well for you aside from some drying. The best part about it is you can wear the repair lotion all day without ever being able to see it. Although i still have a little acne ive noticed a huge positive change in the Size and swelling as well as the amount.</li>
            <li> I used the original acnefree and felt I needed something a little stronger. As soon as I started using acnefree severe I started seeing results, however after about a week of using it my skin began burning and having dry spots. My skin usually tolerates acne treatments pretty well, but step 3 the day time lotion was just too harsh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 and I have had mild acne for ten years. I have tried other products like ProActice, and prescription drugs and I am regretful to say this product as failed as well. It is extremely potent and after 5 days of use my skin&#x27;s texture has completely changes and not for the better! My skin feels coarse, dry, and flaky.     I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for mild acne, I would try something a little less extreme. I&#x27;m going back to exposed skin care. I will keep you posted!</li>
            <li> I have only been using Acne Free Severe for a few days.  I have used the original Acne Free product for the past year or so.  I had run out of the original and went to my local Walmart to pick some up.  They only had the Acne Free Severe product.  It was late, I was tired and decided I would try this.  My acne is far from severe, but I was desperate.  So far, it works better than the original.  I am very cautious about how I use this, and the original product, on my face since my skin is quite sensitive.  This is the only brand I have been able to find that works for me...even ProActive wouldn&#x27;t work for me.  The AcneFree Severe comes with the same 3 step bottles as the orginal (step 1: cleans, step 2: tone, step 3: repairing lotion) but comes with an addition step, step 4: Retinol Renewal Complex.  I have not tried step 4.  I would much rather have the AcneFree Terminator blemish cream than the Retinol Renewal Complex.  The terminator with the 3 steps seems to work best with my skin.  Is there a bit of burning, itching and irritation?  I won&#x27;t lie...yes there is.  I have not noticed any drying with the severe though, which with my sensitive skin, surprises me; however(!), I read the directions and ingredients very VERY closely.  When I first started using the original AcneFree, I did all 3 steps every morning and every night...and my face was red, irritated and dry.  The thing is, I found out WHY my face was acting this way.  Yes there is going to be a bit of red, burning/itching irriation because it&#x27;s the medicine WORKING, and IMO is barable.  The one that I found unbearable was the drying.  What a lot of people don&#x27;t realize (and I was one of them) is the drying is coming from the lotion.  It&#x27;s got Benzoyl Peroxide in it, which is the reason your skin is drying out.  \\&quot;But the bottle says to use it every morning and night\\&quot; &lt;--this is where I think a lot of people make their mistake.  Yes the bottle says this, but it also says if drying and irritation occur to reduce to once a day, which I did.  I only use the repairing lotion at night, and within a few days the drying went away and I now have very soft skin.  So whether you are using the Severe, Original, or Sensitive AcneFree, make sure you are not overdoing the lotion because this is your culprit to the skin dryness.  I use Step1 and 2 twice a day along eith the Terminator Belmish Spot Cream (which you may have to buy separately for like $5, but if you&#x27;re lucky and look around sometimes you can find it added on to the kit as a \\&quot;bonus\\&quot;, but beware...they do up the price on the kits with the added bonus). The AcneFree Severe started working in one night.  I had a blemish on my chin that appeared the day before I bought the kit and after only 1 night and 1 morning of using it, it has gone down significantly (makeup wouldn&#x27;t cover it the first day I got the blemish, the day after I started using the Severe kit, makeup covered it beautifully).  So would I recommend it to others?  Yes, but use it diligently (especially the Severe), and remember what I mentioned about the lotion (use only once a day, not twice like the bottle suggests).</li>
            <li> Well I can finally say Ive found something that works. Ive had mild to severe acne since 13 and Im 27 now. My acne would come and go but I could never find anything that kept it from coming back. I was alway looking for stuff that reacted to the acne and not to prevent it. I have sensitive skin so anything I use has to be mild, non irritating and not greasy. I saw the reviews on amazon but I was so fed up that I just went to another store to buy it instead of waiting for it to be delivered. I was concerned about the benzyl peroxide because of my sensitive skin and let me say my concerns were justified. At first my skin started to turn red and dry out on my forehead and near my chin. I counter acted this with stopping the treatment for two days and used a good moisturizer. This got my skin back to normal with minimal acne present. I really like that they include the retinol for use at night. If you are not familiar with retinol do some research on it. It has shown to reduce winkles and make skin look younger but also it helps with preventing acne. Im not sure of the quality of the Vitamin A in the retinol cause the package is only 20 and some retinol can be pretty pricey for quality stuff but I must say it works. The benzyl peroxide repair lotion is nice not only cause it puts moisture it but also works to prevent acne from forming in the day. Now if you work in an environment where you sweat be careful cause benzyl peroxide will stain clothes. Also, be sure to wash your face of the benzyl peroxide lotion before bed cause you might stain your pillows. So far Im pretty happy with the results and I will continue to use this product. If it stops working I will try to remember to come back and update this review.</li>
            <li> I always thought that I&#x27;d \\&quot;grow out\\&quot; of acne after my teen years, but here I am nearly 30 and still struggling with bad acne!  I&#x27;ve tried it all - dermatologist cream perscriptions, proactive and all the other products that you see in the stores.  I found what worked best for me was to purchase the strongest products I could find in the stores, but it never REALLY cleared up my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until a few months ago when I decided to try the AcneFree Severe system.  My skin is almost completely clear now!  I do still get the occasional break out, but my skin is 10X better than it has EVER been.  Any pimples that I do get are typically smaller and go away faster than they used to.  This stuff is awesome - it actually works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple warnings and tips:&lt;br /&gt;-AcneFree Severe is strong and it will dry out most peoples skin.  I have very oily skin, but this product has helped dry out my skin greatly!&lt;br /&gt;-AVOID the eye area, as that skin is extra sensitive and dries out easily.&lt;br /&gt;-Invest is a good moisturizer!!  Use it wherever you skin gets dry.  I usually only have to use it around my eyes, and sometimes on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;-If you wear makeup, use a make-up removing wash (non-acne-medicated) first, then wash with the acnefree cleanser.  I found that the acnefree cleanser doesn&#x27;t remove makeup without using a LOT of it.  So, wash the makeup off with a make-up removing cleanser first, then use the AcneFree system.  I use L&#x27;Oreal Skin Genesis http://www.amazon.com/LOreal-Paris-Genesis-Minimize-Cleanser/dp/B001FQPPWQ/ref&#x3D;sr_1_7?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1295409617&amp;sr&#x3D;8-7</li>
            <li> This seemed like it was working for awhile. No problems the first week. It did end up bleaching my towels and some of my clothes but I think that&#x27;s because your supposed to let it dry for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At about the second week, I started to get what felt like a rash. I thought it would go away but it ended up being a burn on my my neck. I stopped using the product and after a week the burn mark went away. My acne was pretty bad but I guex not \\&quot;severe\\&quot; so maybe that&#x27;s why it ended like that. Either way, I stopped using this product.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, this product works. Im 33 and have been dealing with acne forever. Ive tried everything but Accutane.</li>
            <li> This acne system works great on my skin!  At first I was worried because it seemed to be making me break out even more than I already did, but after about 2 weeks, my skin has completely cleared up!  It seemed to bring every blemish I had to the surface, but I just continued to do the steps and eventually it worked great!  What I like best about this is that it got rid of the blackheads as well.  I have tried almost everything (ProActive, Skin ID, Clean &amp; Clear, Clearasil Acne, etc.) and this has worked the best for me!</li>
            <li> I ordered this a very long time ago, and still have not received it. On Amazon it was listed in stock, so it was surprising when I received the email about it being delayed. I have since seen it in my local drugstore for the same price. Perhaps when it finally arrives it will be fantastic, but I have been asked to review it now, and this is my experience so far.</li>
            <li> I believe I have found a GREAT product for my stubborn acne!  Finally a product that will not miss a single acne.  I&#x27;ve tried many acne products in the past even the ones talked about on T.V.  The past acne systems I&#x27;ve used would always leave one or two acne bumps behind and I hated that because I thought they were supposed to keep my skin completely clear!  Well I&#x27;m happy to say that AcneFree Severe has done and is continuing to do an amazing job!  I love it!  I can purchase it whenever I want without having to buy it every 3 months or so like other products.  It really does get the job done.  I love it.  I am oily skin type with moderate acne.  And walking out with a clean and clear face definitely brings my confidence level up.  I&#x27;m amazed with this product, I truly am!  :D</li>
            <li> I have had acne issues since I was 12 and I am severely allergic to most soaps and most acne products so I was seriously scared to even try this but I started using this product the night I got it, Friday, its Monday and I noticed my face is already looking better. And I have not had an allergic reaction so I am really happy I found a product that I use and that actually works.</li>
            <li> I put it on last night and again this morning. A few minutes later it started stinging around my eyes. When I looked in the mirror and all around my eyes was deep red. I washed it all off as soon as possible. But it still stings and is very red.</li>
            <li> I have acne that is resistant to a lot of different types of remedies, so i figured \\&quot;what do i have to lose by using a new product?\\&quot; I went to Target and bought this AcneFree Severe Acne kit for about $25, and crossed my fingers. I got home, and immediately used it. The first thing i noticed that made it awesome was that a few hours after i used it, my skin just felt better... it was something i could tell. The next day, i could tell that this product went straight to work. I have been using it for about 2 and a half weeks, and already i have more confidence because my face has cleared up about 85%! i would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is tired of going through Neutrogena, Noxzema, Clearasil, etc. with little to no results. the ONLY thing that i noticed (which is contradictory to other reviews i&#x27;ve seen) is that my skin is oilier pretty early on in the day, but that can be taken care of with oil-blotting sheets.  &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. Within minutes of putting it on my skin starts clearing it up. However, I do NOT have severe acne. I don&#x27;t know how it would work with that.</li>
            <li> For the first two weeks of diligent use, my acne became worse. However, I continued using it because what a lot of acne medications do first is bring all impurities to the surface as part of ridding your acne. My skin did improve, but by the time the bottles were nearly empty and six weeks had gone by, my skin was exactly the same as when I started the system. This product didn&#x27;t do anything for me except waste my time. Right now, I am trying Proactiv, and just by comparing both system&#x27;s ingredients I have a feeling that their \\&quot;Better than  Proactiv\\&quot; statement is false. I will write my review for Proactiv within the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen both positive and negative reviews for this product.  Since twelve years old, I have had issues with acne, particularly blackheads.  I tried Proactiv for six months and I didn&#x27;t really notice any change in my acne.  After several years, I decided a month ago to try AcneFree Severe, simply because it&#x27;s supposed to work well against stubborn cases.  So far I&#x27;m pretty impressed; I started off with worse acne, but things have settled down.  I&#x27;m not completely clear, but much better than I was with Proactiv.  It can dry out skin, so I make sure to use a moisturizer, and that eliminates it.      Keep in mind, I&#x27;m not saying Proactiv doesn&#x27;t work--it does for some people, I&#x27;m sure.  But AcneFree seems to be working for me.</li>
            <li> Do NOT waste your money on this! I am 28 years old and have always had oily/problem skin. The benzoyl peroxide in the face wash and \\&quot;day cream\\&quot; burn and sting when you apply. Also you can&#x27;t realistically apply the day cream during the day as it leaves a messy white residue on your face. My face never felt clean using this product and I continued to break out. I would use the spot treatment on existing treatments and I would have to say that is the only semi good product they offer: it dries up an existing pimple faster as opposed to using nothing at all. If you expect this to stop your acne it won&#x27;t, benzoyle peroxide is awful for yous skin and known to cause thin skin and premature aging. As a side note I have started using Lerosett, an organic clay mask/face wash skin care line and let me tell you it is amazing! I have cystic acne and it works. If you are looking for something on the cheaper side try Aztec healing clay, does wonders. :)</li>
            <li> A third of what we pay in drug stores! A really good by!</li>
            <li> This made my face worst</li>
            <li> I suffered from moderate to severe acne for YEARS. I tried every product on the market - Clean &amp; Clear, Proactiv, Neutrogena, Murad and even insanely over-priced Dermalogica. I had mainly white heads, with a few cystic bumbs. I also had DOZENS of tiny bumps on my forehead. I tried steaming my face a lot, applying clay masques, different vitamins, drinking apple cider vinegar (yuck!), and watching what I ate. No matter what I did, there was no change in the appearance of my skin.    I then discovered this kit. I used it morning and night...simple enough. At first it didn&#x27;t seem to be working, all it did was dry out my skin a lot. However, after about 2 weeks of religiously using this product, my skin was clearing up...FAST. My acne scars were fading and the amount of acne I had diminished by half by the 3rd week. It is so simple to use, as well.     --Step One: Antibacterial Cleansing Wash    The texture of this is very creamy with tiny microbeads in it. It is a good exfoliant for everyday use, but I would recommend to also exfoliate with something more abrasive, once a week. No unpleasant scent, whatsoever.    You can feel your pores opening up in the shower as you rub this into your skin. After just using the face wash alone, your skin will feel 10 times cleaner! I love this stuff.     --Step Two: Corrective Toner    After getting out of the shower, with my face freshly washed with Step One, I apply the toner with a cotton pad. It gets absorbed into the skin VERY quickly, so you don&#x27;t have to wait around for it to dry. It is very cooling and refreshing.    --Step Three: Maximum Strength Repair Lotion    This stuff works GREAT, but I do think there are some cons about it.  The texture is nice when going on- creamy and cool. However, it leaves a thin layer behind. It is not visibly noticeable, but if you apply makeup soon after...your makeup will not go on smoothly. So, I would recommend waiting at least a half hour before applying makeup.     I also use this lotionas a spot treatment. Before I go to bed, I cover any zit I have with it and let it sit overnight. The size and redness of the pimple is greatly reduced the next morning.     Step Four: Retinol Corrector    I&#x27;ll be honest, I am not a huge fan of this step. Step Three is supposed to be used in the morning after Step Two, while Step Four is supposed to be used at night after Step Two. However, I usually use Step Three morning and night and only use the Retinol Corrector if my skin is feeling a little tight and dry.     This lotion is not oily whatsoever and really does a great job at fixing the moisture balance without causing a breakout like most face lotions I have used.          I have now been using this kit for about 6 months now and my acne scars are nearly completely gone and I rarely have a breakout. When I do, it is usually around the time of my period or if I am extremely stessed. Other than that, this product maintains my clear skin perfectly!</li>
            <li> After years of acne and being told I would have to go birth control or Acutane if I really wanted to take care of the problem, I tried this product and IT WORKED. For very little monetary cost and NO health side effects, this product took care of my acne. Anyone with acne will appreciate how much that means!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took one star off b/c after applying the Repair Lotion in the a.m., sometimes my foundation doesn&#x27;t go on evenly, so that&#x27;s a little inconvenient. (Not inconvenient enough to make me stop using it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> AcneFree product worked better than other products I used in the past. Non drying to the face.  I recommend AcneFree to people who have tried other non effective acne products on their faces.</li>
            <li> This product works great in the first few weeks.   It got rid of all my acne.  Although my face burned, hurt, very dried out, flakey, red..  And after about a month, It no longer works, my acne is getting worse than its ever been in my life.  If you want quick results for something i would try this product, but if you want long term results, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> i used to use practive and it used to keep my skin clear but with like few zits here and there but i stopped using proactive a while ago. i started using acne free severe for 4 days and i see a lot of reviews saying that it clears up MOST acne in 1-3 days :/ but my acne is still here, im not breaking out but i still have acne that i had before but some of my dark spots are disappearing and my brother keeps making fun of my face :( im using in the morning steps 1,2,3 and at night steps 1,2 and 4. do u think i should keep using it because its only been 4 days? or just stop using and find something else?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S im 15 years old btw</li>
            <li> This stuff is a lifesaver, hands down. I am 33 and have moderate adult acne. For the past three years I have been seeing a dermatologist and have been on Epiduo, Retin-A, Tarzorac, oral antibiotics, you name it. I have also tried ProActive and Skin ID. I was afraid my only resort would be to go back on Accutane. Accutane treated my acne as kid, and I was acne-free for years, but they say that people often have to do a second round of treatment 10 - 15 years later. Well, that&#x27;s me. The problem is that the side effects can be horrible, it has been linked to Chrohn&#x27;s disease and you have to wait a long time after treatment before you can try to have kids. With my wedding less than a year away, I was desperate.   I decided to try this product, and WOW! It took about two and a half weeks or so before I really noticed a huge difference. Now I am practically acne-free! This stuff is drying, so I often use a non-comedogenic moisturizer after the toner step to help offset the drying. Now that I am pretty much clear, I only use the products every couple days, using milder alternatives in between.   My acne is not the kind that causes massive scars, but rather is just the small persistent bumpy kind. I tried the severe acne formula first because nothing else seemed to be working on the persistent buggers and I wanted a strong first attack. Now I may switch to the milder formula for maintenance.  I strongly suggest anyone who is desperate for acne relief to try this product. I also bought the AcneFree Therapeutic Sulfur Mask and use it once or twice a week. I can feel a difference after using it and I do believe it helped in healing my acne substantially.   I cannot tell you how relieved I am that I have a chance of walking down the aisle acne-free. I was so upset with how my skin looked before this product, and now my confidence is back up and I am excited again!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and have been dealing with acne for several years to no avail, and have tried things like:  - Sitting in the sun  - All kinds of facial scrubs  - LED Light Therapy   - Wearing SPF forever  - Avoiding Dairy/Having a clean diet  You aren&#x27;t alone. I always had a white head problem around my mouth area, but it recently broke out bad all over my face for reasons I don&#x27;t know. It was always moderate but it moved to severe within 2 weeks for the first time since my teenage years. I went out on a limb and bought this product... And wow... It worked wonders. I&#x27;m a very pale person and by day three alone my previous blemishes have almost disappeared entirely! I&#x27;m getting zero breakouts, and my skin feels smooth and soft.   The only draw back so far is that my face is turning red for a couple hours after treatment like I have a mild sunburn. Even burns a little. But from other reviews I hear it just passes, and if you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ll do just about anything.   Would recommend to anyone with two thumbs up. If nothing else worked and you can&#x27;t afford accutane, try this out. Seriously.</li>
            <li> Only acne treatment that works on both my kids, unlike Pro Active this works fast and skins stays pretty clear.</li>
            <li> Have not used long enough to give fair rating. Stubborn Acne takes time to heal.</li>
            <li> I started using the acnefree severe system a little over a month ago, maybe two months now and it&#x27;s been working great for me. For the most part, it has stopped breakouts from emerging. I replaced the toner with the Neutrogena rapid clear 2 in 1 toner when the one that came with the system ran out. So far so good! I&#x27;m really happy with this product. I can honestly say that I noticed a difference in a few days with the acnefree than I did in months with Proactiv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does tend to make my skin dry after using step 3 and/or step 4 so I&#x27;ve been using the say yes to tomatoes balancing moisturizer and it&#x27;s helped quite a bit. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have tried about 100 different products (including this one) to treat my acne...as well as going to 3 different dermatologists and nothing worked. I FINALLY found a product that has worked for me and I&#x27;ve been telling everyone about it. My sister has started using it as well and her acne cleared up in less than a week. It was crazy. I wouldn&#x27;t waste you money on anything else before you try what I&#x27;ve been using.    Just copy the link below into your browser and check out their website.  (I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to put a link in here?!?)    [...]</li>
            <li> This stuff worked wonders for my skin. I was taking a supplement called Vitex (for PCOS and hormonal imbalance) and it caused my skin to go from breaking out 1-2 times a week to breaking out 2-3 times a DAY!!!! My skin was in a horrible condition and everything I tried was just making it worse, not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided to try AcneFree Severe and I&#x27;m glad I did. I started seeing results in just a few days!! The breakouts I had started to disappear and they weren&#x27;t as red or inflamed either; this kit did a great job of soothing them. It did not dry out my skin at all. As a matter of fact, it kept my face moisturized and feeling smooth (a big difference from how it was previously).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did take about a 6 weeks for my skin to totally clear up from this kit. After that, I kept using it just to maintain the few breakouts I was still getting. The kit is really easy to use and comes with clear, easy-to-follow directions. None of the products irritated my skin any more than it already was. I do notice that I go through the toner and spot treatment a lot quicker than the cleanser and retinol complex. For some reason, I seem to use more of those two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people do not respond to Benzoyl Peroxide, but for those that do this is a great kit!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start with a little background about me.  I have had acne issues since I turned 16.  I only really had it on my face but I got a lot of it and they never really seemed to go away.  My breakouts would mostly be on my cheeks, chin, forehead and around the edges of my nose.  I took many trips to the dermatologist&#x27;s office with him promising me one day where I&#x27;d have clear skin like the Photoshopped models that were hanging all over his wall.      My family knew too many people that were on Accutane that had issues with it so I never got to try that remedy.  My immune system is horrible and that&#x27;s half of what my problem was (or so I think).  My immune system got bad throughout my life from having too many antibiotics.  It got to the point where the antibiotics were also killing my good bacteria so common colds would even take me 1 month or more to get rid of.      I did, however, try multiple solutions in high school to fix my acne-related issues.  I tried pills, topical creams, lotions, special face wash, mud masks (I&#x27;m a guy so this was awkward), even my girlfriend&#x27;s concealer to try to cover up the issue.  I was determined to get rid of it but nothing was working.  I figured my only true way out was to grow out of it or get some kind of laser skin treatment.      I&#x27;m very tall at 6&#x27;8\\&quot; and I have very large pores.  My skin is very oily and where some guys have a 5 &#x27;o clock shadow I have a 5 &#x27;o clock glaze.  When I finally got the ability to start growing facial hair it was helpful in covering up some key areas of my face.  After college, my skin seemed to start improving.  Maybe I was in the sun more, maybe my diet improved, maybe I was just finally growing out of acne.  It was never great or gone but it seemed to at least finally be manageable.     Fast-forward to 2 months ago.  I&#x27;m 29 and living the healthiest life I&#x27;ve had in as long as I can remember.  I&#x27;m finally eating 3 meals a day (compared to 1), eating less junk food, drinking less pop (soda) and yet somehow I got hit by the worst breakout of my life.  At one point in the midst of this breakout I counted 35 separate zits or red spots on my face.  Some started as white heads, some were just red bumps, some just red marks but the key point was that none of them were going away.  I&#x27;d pop the white heads and within 2 days they would be full-size again and now spreading like an infection across my face.      Hiding it was not a possibility anymore.  There was no makeup or magic solution to fix this problem.  I had no idea and still have no idea what the root of the problem was...I just needed to find a way to get rid of it.  I got a face wash/lotion combination called Rapid Clear from Neutrogena that was supposed to help bad breakouts like this one.  I went through that tube of face wash faster than I ever had before in my life (washing my face 3 times a day) and using the lotion when specified.      After one month of using this special combination I barely noticed any kind of difference.  What else could I try?  I happened to be at Wal-Greens one day about 5 weeks ago and saw the AcneFree Severe to Clear System and bought it for $30 after reading some quick reviews.  I know what you&#x27;re thinking...after all this it&#x27;s time to finally get to the review!    A lot of people mentioned how quick they noticed a difference and for me it was the same way.  I was completely blown away.  After just 2 days I already began to notice that the overall redness was diminishing and I did not seem to be getting any new red spots on my face.  Now it was time to see if the system could clear up the monstrosity that my face became.  I followed the directions and used it exactly as prescribed for 3+ weeks.  My skin is very oily, as mentioned earlier, but apparently not very sensitive.  I never had any issues with my skin feeling like it was burning, nothing ever felt like it was on fire (no matter how close I got to my eyes) and my skin did not dry out anymore than usual.  We have hard water at my house so my skin is always dry when I get out of the shower.      I love how this system has 4 separate parts that you can use whenever you want.  Granted, you&#x27;ll definitely run out of the face wash a lot sooner than everything else but by that point you should be able to just use a regular face wash again.  So how good was it?      -- After 2 days, I noticed redness going away.  -- After 1 week, I noticed swelling dying down.  -- After 2 weeks, I noticed entire sections of my face starting to heal.  -- After 3 weeks, I noticed my skin feeling the softest and smoothest it&#x27;s been since before hitting puberty.   -- After 5 weeks and current time, I notice that I&#x27;m no longer needing facial hair to cover anything up on my face.  This is by far the best my skin has ever looked in my adult life.  For the first time ever that I can remember, I can walk out of my house with confidence in how my skin looks.  A \\&quot;breakout\\&quot; for me now means one whitehead that goes away in 2 days.  I wish I could show pictures of what my skin looked like before and what it looks like now.      Words truly can&#x27;t explain how satisfied I am about this product.  It&#x27;s the only thing that actually worked and it seems to have even \\&quot;cured\\&quot; whatever skin infection I&#x27;ve been dealing with since I was 16.  You can buy this system in some places for $20 and for the price of an average dinner, drink, &amp; dessert at a decent restaurant you can get the best looking skin in your life!     I only write reviews for products that I either COMPLETELY LOVE or COMPLETELY HATE.  This is one of those things that I wish I could give 6 stars out of 5.  I feel bad for the people that did not get the same results but I can definitely attest to the fact that it DOES work for some people.  Absolutely incredible!</li>
            <li> This product cleared my face with consistent use after about two months. Wish there was a  noncomedogenic moisturizer included.</li>
            <li> I love this system. I started to see results in 3 days. It is not as harsh as I have read in other reviews. I experienced no burning or redness. The only down fall was the Step 3 product witch is a moisturizer and medicine, tend to make my skin oily and shine. My face is naturally very oily so if yours is I would use very little moisturizer, not much is needed. That is why I gave it 4 stars. But overall Iam very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I&#x27;m 21 and I have a moderate amount of acne. I tried this product first (other than different types of soaps and cleaners) and it worked VERY well. I was thrilled with it. After a while i found some proactiv on a major sale so I figured I&#x27;d try it out. I don&#x27;t think it worked nearly as well as this product. plus this one smells better. you also get more with this product than proactiv. Hands down, i&#x27;d buy this over proactiv and I&#x27;d suggest it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a week now and I am noticing a huge difference in my Acne.  Not only has it reduced the amount of white heads appearing on my face daily, but it is fading red marks remarkably well.  I&#x27;m 27, so some acne products currently on the market don&#x27;t work very well for me.  It has been about 11 days since i&#x27;ve begun using this product and I have noticed a huge difference.  I&#x27;d say the only issue I had at first was dry, flaky skin.  It was pretty bad.  I usually supplement other non-comodogenic lotion (CeraVe Lotion) + Jojoba oil after applying the lotion that is provided in this kit.  Problem solved.  I am looking forward to how my skin looks at the end of the month!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!! I bought this for my 13 year daughter who has severe acne. Her acne is so bad they are big red bumps all over her face, and back. The acne is super painful for her. After buying this product we saw an improvement within 5 days!! She was so happy. My daughter has been using this everyday and her acne is almost gone. Foe the price and the results... this product is a must have if you are suffering from acne. My daughter is so happy and confident now!!</li>
            <li> First off, ive never bought any acne products in my life, so I can&#x27;t compare. I didn&#x27;t want to pay for pro activ, so i looked for something I could get retail, i studied this ratings for some time. Picked this kit up at Walgreens. Used it for 7 days, after the 7 days, my acne is clear,and it made my skin real smooth, But i think too smooth. I stopped using the product since now my skin gets real tight on my face after water hits it, and i dry it, and my skin on my face is getting red and burns when i rub any     wash cloth. So as of now i duno what is the cause. Unless its my skin rebuilding, or what. But this product did work for me, but now i feel pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had chronic, painful acne for five or so years (I&#x27;m 18) with no improvement shown after trying various over-the-counter face washes/treatments. My doctor has prescribed oral antibiotics which did show some improvement but not for a good stretch of time. AcneFree Severe Acne Treatment has shown tremendous progress over the course of a couple months of faithful use. While it wasn&#x27;t as miraculous as I had hoped in terms of speed of improvement, after a significant amount of use, I&#x27;m finding far less breakouts occurring and the ones that do crop up disappear quicker. I don&#x27;t see myself switching to any other acne treatments as the results I&#x27;ve seen here have been unparalleled by anything else I&#x27;ve used (that&#x27;s Proactiv included). I&#x27;ve just started using AcneFree&#x27;s Scar Fade and Erase treatment and in under a week of use I&#x27;m seeing much improvement. I recommend this product wholeheartedly.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon AcneFree Severe because Clean n&#x27; Clear Advantage was out of stock (which, by the way, worked to a point then became completely ineffective). I wanted to give my skin a break from ProActiv, which I have been using for about 7 years and was working, but I think my skin started to become immune to it. I figured that if it worked, I would just make the switch, especially since it was only $20 and some change. WELL... so much for that!!! After 3 days, I had to stop using it because 1) the smell was HORRIBLE, 2) it made my skin feel like sandpaper, and 3) the lotion was soo thick, heavy, and gritty and left a white residue on my dark complexion. I would NOT recommend this product, especially if you plan to wear some sort of concealer or make-up; the lotion does NOT leave your skin smooth. Also, make sure your skin condition is indeed severe; that may be why it didn&#x27;t work so well for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my granddaughter.  I have not seen much improvement.  In all fairness to the treatment system, I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s using it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I only started breaking out with acne in my early thirties.  After trying the Loreal adult acne system for 2 months &amp; Proactiv for 6 months with minimal results, I decided to give this a try.  Yes, it made my skin very dry the first few weeks but I used a moisturizer over it kept using it and got fantastic results.  I had the hard, large painful nodules on my face and this not only cleared them but I don&#x27;t even break out anymore.  One kit lasted me 6 months and my skin is soft &amp; smooth.  After the acne went it away, it did leave behind the black marks but Avon&#x27;s skin brightener faded those out almost overnight.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product, it gives the same feeling as proactiv in which your skin becomes smooth and soft. At first I was scared to use it because i seen a couple reviews that said it burned their skin and made their face red. None of this happened to me, i guess only if you have an allergic reaction or really sensitive skin. I started to see results in a couple days and i like the fact that it did not make my skin dry. Better than proactiv because you wont keep getting billed every month, you can order it when you need. The price is also reasonable and worthy.</li>
            <li> This was the best acne system I have every used!  It is better than ProActive and other over the counter medicines.  After one/two days you can see the blemishes starting to go down and after a week or so o using it you have virtually no or very small blamishes.  I also have very sensitive skin and this caused little drying for me.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Takes a time to get use to and will make face a little red. But pimples and black heads leaving.</li>
            <li> Since I was a teen, I&#x27;ve suffered with acne vulgaris.  I have a list written down of 25 different acne treatments I&#x27;ve tried.  AcneFree was the only thing that worked for me.  If you do NOT have sensitive skin but have acne that NEVER goes away...this is your answer.  Hands down.  I have tried every home remedy out there, from garlic to apple cider vinegar, with no results.  These chemicals work.  My acne vulgaris is gone and I have a clear face today, thanks to AcneFree.</li>
            <li> Works great and so inexpensive on Amazon.  Compare it to Pro-Active and it costs WAY less but just as effective.</li>
            <li> IF YOU ARE OF MEDITERRANEAN HERITAGE (I&amp;#34;M GREEK) AND HAVE STUGGLED WITH ACNE PRODUCTS FOR YEARS, BUY THIS AND CLEAN AND CLEAR ADVANTAGE ACNE CONTROL MOISTURIZER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This combination got rid of my acne that i&#x27;ve struggled with for over a decade with. I&#x27;ve probably spent around a little under $1000 trying to get rid of it. Also, my skin was red and itchy for maybe three days at the beginning and I just kept going. I&#x27;m not going to recommend you go through it, because I don&#x27;t want to be held accountable for you getting hurt ( or worse) from an allergic reaction, but I personally got through it just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Clear-Advantage-Control-Moisturizer/dp/B001E96LQS/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1438033542&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;clean+and+clear+advantage+acne+control+moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people struggling with acne in general: I learned about this from a friend of mine which is also Greek and which had acne as bad as I did. Whatever you do with your hair/skin/face, etc. I recommend you consider where in the world your particular ancestors lived and compare the environmental factors they were disposed to with where you currently live. For instance, my ancestors: the Greeks, lived in the Mediterranean for thousands of years and were disposed to that sort of climate. Find a friend (or better yet, a sibling) with similar ancestry to you who has already overcome your problem and ask them how they&#x27;ve done it. This won&#x27;t always work, but it should help steer you in the right direction, and sometimes give you much better information than a dermatologist (for free!). And if you&#x27;re Greek (and Orthodox), don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re being irreligious by using evolutionary theory---evolution was largely founded by the church and today is accepted by both the Orthodox and Catholic church. Use it. God Bless, everybody.</li>
            <li> Ive used Proactive and had awesome results but after a few months clear skin I started developing small oil bumps all over my forehead. I just assumed that I had been on it too long and my skin had gotten used to it. My sister had recommended this and we pretty much have the same type of skin...extremely oily. I can wash my face and and hour later it looks as if I dipped it in grease. (shrug).     It worked wonders for me. I go through the toner really fast though....(still have half of the lotion and face wash).    I definatly recommend it. I also bought the scar fighting solution they have. I use this on weekends with just a oil of olay bar to give my face a rest from the ingredients in the system that dry my face out.    It also helps a little with my back and shoulder acne.</li>
            <li> AcneFree Severe Acne Treatment is the best product on the market. I have never had a acne treatment work so well for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 43, female, have had mild cystic acne off and on for 17 years, and in the last few years my go-to remedies (antibiotics and Retin-A) completely stopped working. Two months ago, my acne was getting so bad that I didn&#x27;t want to leave the house. Since no \\&quot;one\\&quot; product had ever worked, I decided to try three products together, and 4 weeks later, my acne is gone. Here are the three products: Yogi Skin DeTox Tea, Acne Free Maximum Strength, and the 0.5mm MT Skin Roller. It took a full 4 weeks to get consistently clear skin. I did get one bump around the two week mark, and I had some old bumps that took a full 4 weeks to clear up. Here&#x27;s what to do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Drink two cups of Skin DeTox tea daily.(Tastes great hot or cold.)&lt;br /&gt;2.Use the Maximum Strength Acne Free system morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;3. At night, use the MT Roller once a week all over your face over the Acne Free Retinol Complex. Apply a little extra Retinol Complex to problem areas after rolling.&lt;br /&gt;4. At night, use the MT Roller over the Retinol Complex every other day between weekly rollings ONLY on problem areas. You can stop doing this once the problems clear up, or roll only when problems surface.&lt;br /&gt;5. After the first four weeks, continue to use the roller weekly with the Retinol Complex or other products to remove old acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;6. Use a 15-30 spf sunscreen daily. The roller and Retinol Complex will increase sun sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I used the DeTox tea and Acne Free products for two weeks without rolling, and I saw improvements to my skin tone and texture right away, but the deep cysts remained. It wasn&#x27;t until I started rolling with the MT Roller that the cysts started shrinking or came to the surface of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this works for other people, particularly people over 40. The MT Roller will be too harsh on 20-something skin. Go easy with the roller if you are under 40 and roll less frequently. Keep a sanitary environment when rolling and clean your roller afterward. Don&#x27;t roll on broken skin or white pustules. See other websites on how to use and clean your roller. I soak mine in alcohol for 15 minutes after rolling.</li>
            <li> I have always had minor issues with acne, at least since my teen years.  I have tried ALOT of different products.  AcneFree works well for me, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a cure-all.  I have determined that staying clear is a lifestyle, no one thing will cure your outbreaks.  Here&#x27;s my regimin that I use along with this product;&lt;br /&gt;I...&lt;br /&gt;-use a scent/dye free laundry detergent (I like All Free and Clear)&lt;br /&gt;-wash my sheets weekly and my towels daily&lt;br /&gt;-use a good non-comedogenic foundation (I like Physicians Formula)&lt;br /&gt;-eat a nutrional diet&lt;br /&gt;-use vitamin supplements. My morning supplements are (I prefer GNC brand) B-Complex and Iron.  My evening supplements are Super Omega Fish oil, Basic Antioxident and Acidophilus.&lt;br /&gt;-drink plenty of water.  I drink about 2 liters/day of regular tap water.&lt;br /&gt;-exercise a few times/week to keep your body in tune and to sweat your toxins out!&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the long and short of it. I definitely recommend this product.  But, as I said, you need to make it part of your healthy lifestyle for the best results.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t classify my skin as \\&quot;severe\\&quot; at all, in fact, my skin tends to be clear most of the time.  I&#x27;ll get the occassional pimple or blackhead here and there, but nothing severe whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using this product because my brother (who also has good skin) was raving about how this product heals his blemishes and keeps his skin healthy and clear.  After watching him use the product for several weeks, I noticed a dramatically improved complexion.  His face was simply rejuvinated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then decided to take the plunge and try it for myself.  This product was simply amazing.  The four-step process is simple to follow and feels excellent on my face.  My blackheads:  gone.  Any new ones:  gone.  My skin:  clear as can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone seeking to keep their skin healthy and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution:  If your face is mild to dry, make sure you use a moisturizer between the morning and evening sessions.  I began to get very dry skin during the first few days, but using the moisturizer helped immensly.</li>
            <li> Love. Face looks fresh and clean. Saw real results after two weeks of using this product. Will definitely continue to use</li>
            <li> First off I want to explain that I have had terrible acne off and on (mostly on though) for the past 8 years.  I had to be put on Accutane my sophmore year for 6 months in high school and then again my freshman year of college for another 3 months. I have been struggling ever since then and needed an alternative to dermatoligist bills and prescriptions for acne treatment. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was having extremely painful and frequent breakouts in the later half of last year and in early November I happened to stumble upon this product.  I had my doubts because I had already given Proactiv a couple of tries in the past. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The first week of using the 4 products in the package my face became EXTREMELY dry! At first I was worried because it would always be a little red and irritated for the first hour or two after going through the routine.  However, within 4 days ALL of my blemishes (big and small) had cleared up! Within a couple of weeks my skin even became smoother, softer, and more even-toned.  Trust me, if you have problem skin and want to try something new, this product is definitely worth a shot! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, I love that you can buy this in pretty much any Walgreens and Walmart so it&#x27;s very convenient...no waiting for it to be delivered.  I purhased mine at Walmart for $20-something in November 2006 and still have more than half remaining of each product in the pack.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thank you University Medical for making an affordable product that actually works! Best of luck to all of you who are struggling with acne...and don&#x27;t mark this one off your list!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t order this offline, but I got it at my local Target. First of all I&#x27;d liked to state, I don&#x27;t really have severe acne but I&#x27;d occasionally get 2-3 really bad pimples and it&#x27;s so embarassing. But this helps! I saw some results the very next day. But along with it working it causes dry skin, but nothing a little lotion couldn&#x27;t fix. So if you have sensitive skin I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this, I&#x27;d recommend the non-severe version.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne on and off all my life. I&#x27;m pushing 50 and it&#x27;s still part of my life. My Mom&#x27;s the same way. Always saw a bottle of Physoderm on the sink growing up. It never fixed her acne, yet she swore by it. The only active ingredient in this product is exactly that. Benzoil Peroxide (please excuse the spelling)I am really depressed that I listened to the advertisement on the box, that it was better &amp; faster than Pro Active. I wish I&#x27;d have bought the Pro Active...$20 down the toilet. My acne has gotten worse the first week of using this product. Anyone wanna buy it for $10? I barely used it, but I forgot to mention how unsettling it was to open a box with a little tab of tape at each end and no seals on the tubes and the under the lid foil on step 4 was part way open and there was no foil under the other three lids. LOVELY. Makes me think the kid packing it decided to sneak into the john and test it out first. Not meant to be funny. I wish I could return it actually. I&#x27;m angry  This is what I bought:  [[ASIN:B000NWETC0 AcneFree Severe Acne Treatment System, 1 system]]</li>
            <li> I have had acne since I was 12 years old and it has become very severe in the last few years with hormones surging due to multiple pregnancies.  I have been using pro-active for years and it has been useless.  I have cystic acne that is extremely painful and the dermatologist had given me pills and creams that didn&#x27;t seem to help the acne at all.  I saw the acnefree severe product at Target and thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try one more product.  I have to say it has been a miracle.  My face is clear and I haven&#x27;t had one cystic pimple since.  I will have a little tiny pimple every one in awhile, but that&#x27;s no big deal since I am used to constant awful break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is drying so I cleanse and tone with the acnefree product in the morning and use my own moisturizer and then at night I cleanse, tone, and put the lotion on.  Then the alternating night I cleanse, tone skip the lotion and use the step 4 product.  You are never supposed to use step 3 the lotion and step 4 together.  I don&#x27;t use their lotion in the am because it feels to gritty under makeup.  The alternating seems to keep my face from drying out too bad. Use moisturizer...it is crucial! The products are staining to materials so be careful what you touch after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you how excited I am about this product.  I was about to go on acutane because I was so depressed about my skin.  I have very oily skin so I needed something to keep it under control. I&#x27;d recomend that everyone try it since it is very affordable and easy to find in the drug stores.  No one should have to walk around feeling ashamed of their skin. I feel like I got my life back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased by this product. I have the type of acne that usually pops up right before my monthly cycle, then takes forever to heal, and this product starts making a huge dent in the acne overnight. I&#x27;ve been able to prolong the life of the package that I bought by only using it when I start to break out. It&#x27;s been working really well for me. It hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin, which is really surprising. The lotion does tend to make my face a little greasy, so I try not to use very much of it.  I&#x27;ve only had one problem: one night when I first started using it, I was really tired and in a hurry to go to bed. I forgot to wait at least 10 minutes between steps 3 and 4, and I ended up turning my pillow case orange. I&#x27;ve been really careful to follow the directions exactly since then and haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li> I have been having problems with acne, mostly my cheeks and chin area, after stopping birth control age 28.  I was miserable and embarrassed by my face. I am soooo happy that I bough Acnefree Severe.  In just 3 days my face it 80% completely clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was scared from some of the reviews about it being really harsh on skin, peeling, burning etc.  If you just take it kind of slow at the beginning and use only the minimal amount each time then you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day I only used 1,2,3 day and night to get my face introduced to it.  The the second night I used 1,2,4 (do not use 3 and 4 together).  Also, be sure to apply sparingly.  A little bit goes a long way. Dab a small amount and use one or two fingers to massage it.  I think if you oversaturate your face with this stuff you can actually cause damage and/or experience a worsening effect before it gets better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning if you do get irritated red spots just use 1 and 2 on that area until it settles back down before you start putting 3 or 4 in that area again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scars/blotches on my face are disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband noticed my face looked better in just one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from acne since puberty but the condition worsened to become cystic close to a year ago. I&#x27;ve tried everything from dermatologists to every OTC medication and topical on the marke with varying degrees of success. Nothing worked better than this. I woke up to 10-15 active cysts and whiteheads and used this product in desperation.  Within 4 days I noticed a huge difference in the condition of my skin. Within 1 week my face was approximately 95% clear of acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have the dark spots which take forever to clear, which is typical for African -Americans. I do warn people to find an excellent non-comedogenic moisturizer and commitment to drinking tons of water prior to starting use of this product. I have extremely oily skin and still suffered through painfully dry skin through the first week of use.  Whatever you do, do NOT use this product within an inch of your eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister because nothing else has worked for her. This started to work and her acne was clearing up but then it just stopped working and all of her acne came back. YES, She was still using it the same. Don&#x27;t know what the issue was, however I&#x27;m upset I lost money over another failing product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s honestly the only cheap thing that works so its kool ✔</li>
            <li> ok, i must warn you that i may sound like an infomercial, but i am hooked on this product for my acne problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have tried proactiv, murad, another acne kit that i can&#x27;t think of the name in addition to separate topicals (e.g. noxzema, clearasil, etc.) and none have given me the results that this product gives.  i have even tried the milder version of the acne free system and didn&#x27;t have as good results as i get with the severe acne free system.  i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for those with dry or sensitive skin and acne.  this is a very drying formula that works on my very oily face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i never thought of my acne as severe, but i would always have a big zit in one place or another on my face that would leave big scars after the zit went away.  now, i have not had a breakout since using this product (3 months).  i hope it works for you!</li>
            <li> OMG!  I love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve tried alot of different things, and at first they all would work.  I am one of those people that gets those mounds on their face.  I don&#x27;t get just a little pimple, they are almost like boils.  They&#x27;re marble size, red, irritated.  And I can&#x27;t stop touching them, which makes them worse.  I&#x27;ve done Clinique&#x27;s 3 step system, neutrogena, clearasil, noxema, and the original Acne free.  At first my skin gets clear, and tighter, not as oily.  But after a month or so, it&#x27;s back to bad skin. Just not as bad.  This stuff I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 months and I love it.  My skin is clear, it&#x27;s not as oily, I actually have people tell me how good my skin looks!  I haven&#x27;t heard that since I was a teenager (I&#x27;m 30 now).  At first this stuff was kinda strong and irritated my skin.  I just use the soap at night and noxema in the morning.  I do the toner in the am and pm, with the lotion.  Can&#x27;t say enough good about this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pretty much used everything, but nothing worked, until I tried out this product.  My T-zone is oily, but the rest of my face is a bit on the dry side, so when I first used this product it dried out my face so much to the point it stung really badly.  So I decided to just use the soap on my T-zone for a while, and I got used to it- now i can use it on my whole face, but I only use it on my T-zone bc that&#x27;s only where I have acne problems. Anyways, this product actually works.  I give it 5 stars because it cleared up my face, something I&#x27;ve been longing for for over 3 years.  I am so happy.</li>
            <li> Okay so im 18 ans just recent started getting mild to severe acne all over my face. Mainly my cheeks and chin. I started getting dark spots all over my face for picking at my pimples. I tried over the counter treatments i tried spot treatments and though they they vanish SOME pimples more and more and more just kept appearing i was extremely depressed . I decided to try this product!!!!!!!! At first i noticed a difference i was breaking out alot less my pimples would dry out and eventually leave. BUT my skin gets tooooooooooooooooo oily. Its disgusting. I dont know why but instead of over drying like some people says it does it just makes my face ao greasy though my face is clearing up having greasy face is so embarrassing and makes my face look so unhealthy idk what to do. Im afraid if i stop using this product my breakouts will begin again but i need to keep this oil under control. I reccommend this product to people who do not have such oily skin, it works!!!! REMEMBER TO ALWAYS USE SUNSCREEN if you do not use sunscreen your fAce will itch and burn</li>
            <li> i tried calling several dermatologists and couldn&#x27;t get in for 2 months! lame. so i decided to take action before that and try this product. i&#x27;ve only been using for a week and i can already see a difference. my skin is fine, no rashes or irritation. very happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> from time to time i get breakouts on my forehead. I bought this product hoping to shorten the time i have these breakouts, or stop them all together.. I tried it once and noticed i was getting WORSE acne. I thought it was part of the process. After a week or two, I really didnt see a difference other that the huge cystic pimples i now had from this stuff. I stopped using it..every now and again Ill get frustrated with the few pimples i get so ill think &amp;#34; no way it could have been acnefree making it worse ill try it again&amp;#34;... well EVERY TIME i tried it again, I would get MUCH WORSE ACNE. No idea what it is. but i KNOW its from this product.. used it 7 seperate times, worse acne every time.</li>
            <li> I  only had a few  pimples on my face before using this product, after I began to use this product my pimples turned so dark I had to use skin bleaching cream to get rid of the dark spots. After that experience I donated the rest to  my best friend and she began to get black spots on her face also. Paid 30+ dollars for this at my local walgreens  and was very pissed. Anywho, finally went to proactive and my face was back to normal about a month later.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s acne did not clear up as I was hoping it would. It is better, but still pretty active.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv, and multiple other OTC acne products, I tried Acnefree and it worked better than anything.  I then decided to try the \\&quot;Severe\\&quot; and it is the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty young but I recently bought this product and I used it today. within the hour my skin looks less red and more clear! MAKE SURE YOU READ THE DIRECTIONS. The directions says never to use steps 3 &amp; 4 together so maybe that is where some people went wrong. I really suggest the product for quick results! I hope I helped!</li>
            <li> I will start this review by saying I have tried so many difficult products in an attempt to resolve my mild adult acne -- nothing worked until I finally gave in and tried AcneFree. The name and branding are so generic, I had skimmed over it on the shelves for years, but after giving it a go, my only regret is not getting started earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Situation&lt;br /&gt;I am a 32-year-old female who has experienced moderate adult acne. My skin wasn&#x27;t too problematic as a teen, but around the age of 23, I started experiencing regular breakouts -- primarily a combination of those awful cystic bumps and generally clogged pores. Initially it did seem to flare up around my period, but over time I started noticing that I had steady acne with worsening cystic bumps based on hormone fluctuations. Not fun! After giving so many different products (prescription and non-prescription) a go, religiously using AcneFree has cleared my skin up to a point where it is smooth, clear and clean enough that I rarely wear makeup anymore. (And actually receive compliments on what pretty skin I have!) Here are some helpful tidbits from my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Expect things to get worse before they get better. I know the packaging claims clearer skin in three days. I found this to be true, right before I turned a corner for 2 weeks of major breakouts. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a consensus between dermatologists about whether a &amp;#34;purge period&amp;#34; really exists, but in my experience it was very real. I made a commitment to stick with AcneFree for at least 3 months before dropping it. Luckily, my purge period was only two weeks. (Which seems to be pretty standard for more people.) If you decide to use AcneFree, make a commitment not to panic for the first month. It will not be fun, but once your skin gets rid of all the gunk it has been hanging onto, the transition into clearer skin is practically magical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Follow the regime religiously. That means not skipping your nightly wash, tone and treat when you come home from the wine bar and just want to fall into bed. You MUST be militant about following the steps morning and night. (I&#x27;ve found that the results are&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. When I do wear makeup, I like to use a gentle cleansing bar to remove the makeup before I go through the AF steps. Poppy Soap makes an amazing line (her tea tree oil bar is especially nice for acne-prone skin) of natural, organic bars that contain essential oils and gentle ingredients. I scrub up with that, rinse, then follow up with AF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I&#x27;ve found I use the system at different rates. If I am out of toner, I will use witch hazel in its place (the primary ingredient in the AF toner), while I am finishing up the others and preparing to order another kit. I have not found that this substitution makes any difference. My skin remains happy (and it&#x27;s super cheap and available at just about every local drugstore.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Amazingly, I did not find this line to be drying at all (which is surprising because my skin usually reacts to acne cleansers by getting red, itchy, dry in patches, oily in others.) I will typically moisturize with Clinique&#x27;s gel moisturizer to keep my skin hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a completely awesome product and a godsend for my skin. There is hope!</li>
            <li> Love it! This was way more effective than Proactiv for me... and way more affordable (especially if you order on amazon and not in supermarkets where it&#x27;s triple the price!). There was a little discomfort the first week I used it, which my sister who gave it to me told me about. It was too much for her since she has pretty good skin other than the occasional blemish, though if she waited it out she would have adjusted too. Glad she didnt though, cause my skin was really bad and this was just what I needed. I will say, it is pretty strong but my usually sensitive skin can handle it. You can always skip a day of the medicated lotions and it&#x27;s still effective... but anyway, flash forward to today, having been on it about 6 weeks now. After clearing out some REALLY congested pores, aka having to deal with some new pimples popping up (nbd! This all happened during that first week, so be patient!) my skin began to  not only clear, but it&#x27;s smoothing out and the tone is evening out now... something I thought I&#x27;d be stuck with even if I could stop the breakouts! I&#x27;ve dealt with very bad cystic acne and tried it all and this stuff is worth trying!</li>
            <li> Wonderfull acne treatment.  It can heal any kind of acne.  It will clean up and heal severe acne after using it about 4 to 6 weeks.  I definitely recommend this product to anyone who has the problem with pimple, severre acne.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, however this product deserves 5 stars. I used to use proactiv for about 3 years when my acne got bad but eventually like many customers I got tired of the hidden fees and overcharges. My skin wasn&#x27;t working well with salicylic acid, so I purchased the AcneeFree treatment system with benzoyl peroxide and it works amazing. It took about a week for my acne to go down and now it helps to control it. I love the pH toner it&#x27;s much better than the proactiv one. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a week. I bought this because I didn&#x27;t want to wait for proactive to ship. I have more painful breakouts now and are very embarrassing. Also my face is very oily all day long. Never had this problem before. I will throw this away and order proactive like I should have.</li>
            <li> Been using AcneFree for 3 weeks now. It works about the same as Proactiv, but more affordable. I rather use this than pay $65 to $100 for over priced products that do the exact same thing. The AcneFree wash works great for your face and body. Now i don&#x27;t have to buy $15 a bottle products for both areas. So glad i found this product! Now it&#x27;ll cost me $25 to $30 for 2 kits every 60days to keep my acne under control! Thank you AcneFree!</li>
            <li> Completely cleared my skin! I love this stuff. It takes a little bit of effort considering it is a 4 step process, but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I am entering my freshman year of college in the fall and have struggled with acne for 7 years now. I have tried every possible face wash and medicine induced cream and nothing ever worked. Things like Proactive irritated my skin and I was some how allergic to the Clinique products. I saw Acne Free on an ad while I was looking at some other face wash products and decided to read more about it. After reading some pretty good reviews I bought the severe treatment because I have struggled with breakouts for a very long time. The first time I used the product was at night and I saw results first thing in the morning! All of my spots were smaller and not a single one was bright red. I have used this product 2 times daily for a total of 2 weeks now and all of my acne is gone! The best thing about this product is that &amp;#34;a little goes a long way&amp;#34;. You don&#x27;t have to use half the bottle at once to get rid of your spots, it honestly takes a dime sized amount to cover your whole face and sometimes that&#x27;s too much. I absolutely love Acne Free and would recommend it to anyone who is suffering with acne or break outs.</li>
            <li> Product Received was EXPIRED</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s acne did not clear up as I was whising it would. He has been using it for almost a year and the acné is still pretty active.</li>
            <li> Just as described, Works the way it should. great shipping time and good tracking. overall happy with this product, would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have to say...this stuff is beyond amazing!!! I have had horrible acne all my life, and by horrible I mean everything from cystic acne, blackheads to whiteheads and everything in between. I had horrible scarring and my face always looked swollen it was so red. The only makeup I wear is mascara, I don&#x27;t use any cover up or anything so I had to do something...I&#x27;ve tried everything imaginable, different face washes, home remedies, even going to the doc to get injections and going on birth control. NOTHING HELPED! Then I found this, I was skeptic but as soon as I tried it I fell inlove. It only takes about 3 days to see amazing results. My skin is now clearer than it&#x27;s even been, except for the occasional breakout. My scarring has faded significantly, my face looks baby soft! This stuff is wonderful!!! I definitely recommend it! I just hope they never discontinue it</li>
            <li> The 24 acne free system did not work for me like I would have hoped. Made my face very dry and then it burned and it broke out even more. Will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even describe how much this worked for me. First of all when I went to buy it, it&#x27;s was only $5.00 dollars at five below. When I bought I was like yeah right, this just might be another knock off thing like proactive. So I got home and used the night one because it was night and when I first used the cleansing wash I could tell a difference right there and then. When I woke up the next morning I could see a huge difference! I am so happy to find this because my friends would be like why is your head so bumpy and don&#x27;t you have face wash? But God answered my prayers right on time so that by the end of summer break,when I go to school I can be a brand new person!</li>
            <li> It really did helped clear the acne that I had. My only complaint is that it really dried out my skin and gave me flakes, but I guess that&#x27;s to be expected from a severe acne treatment.</li>
            <li> i picked this product up at wal mart for cheap and just like all acne treatments they clame them to be the miricle cure! but wrong my face broke out even more with cystic acne and i had massive bumps that were very red. i stopped using this product and the redness has began to fade and the cystic pimples have decreased a lot i am positive this product caused this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 35 years old and I&#x27;ve had severe acne since I was about 14.  I took antibiotics as a teen for it...it hasn&#x27;t remained at THAT severe level, but I still have quite a bit of issues with my complexion, especially considering at my age its usually not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided to try something more expensive so I saw this at Walmart and picked it up.  Wow!!!  My face is REALLY looking better.  Yeah I still get a pimple or two here or there but overall my complexion is so much improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few thoughts...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the toner goes way faster than everything else.  My kit has lasted about 2 months and I&#x27;m about ready for a new kit.  But after like 3 weeks I needed to order more toner, so I just got the regular AcneFree toner, a big bottle of it, on Ebay.  It works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the toner....Its AMAZING how much dirt it takes off your face, even right after I&#x27;ve scrubbed my face in the shower!  No wonder I was breaking out....there&#x27;s so much dirt hiding here and there in my pores and face its not even funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway...also beware that the cleanser and the morning lotion contains benzoyl peroxide and it WILL bleach your towels, pillowcases, and clothes if you are not careful.  The night cream contains retinol and that does not bleach, and the toner is just soothing and cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how the retinol smooths your skin at night and the toner also feels great...and the peroxide works during the day.  I have not had my face irritated or dried out at all using this.  Before I replaced the toner, I tried some Neutrogena acne toner and it dried out my face and I started breaking out.  When I went back to using all four steps of the AcneFree, I cleared back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing is I&#x27;d like to use this on my chest as well but I&#x27;m afraid of bleaching my clothes so I do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I&#x27;m really happy with this and would recommend it to anyone, and am getting ready to buy my second kit.</li>
            <li> This product is unbelievable! My son is 15 years old, African American, and had a severe case of acne on both sides of his face and on his forehead. We tried numerous creams, cleansers, soaps, and home remedies found on the Internet. Nothing worked! Finally in desperation, I bought this product because I thought it was \\&quot;Proactiv\\&quot;; I misread read the advertising slogan as the product title. When I realized my mistake, I started to return it to the store, but decided to see if there were any online reviews. Since everyone was raving about it, we decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s been two weeks and the acne is completely gone. Everyday you could see improvement: first the pimples diminished, then the black scarring started to fade, and now it&#x27;s as if he never had acne. I don&#x27;t know if \\&quot;Proactiv\\&quot; works, but \\&quot;AcneFree Severe\\&quot; definitely does!</li>
            <li> Seriously - Stop wasting your time on BS products.  If you&#x27;ve landed on this page, you are fortunate.  This product outperforms every single product and DOCTOR I have talked to about my skin.  I didn&#x27;t develop acne until the ripe age of 26. YES, 26!!!! WTH, right??  At least I only had to deal with one awkward phase of life at a time, not all at the age of 16 -- so anyways, I tried everything until I noticed my sister&#x27;s skin had cleared entirely after using this product.  She doesn&#x27;t even need to wear face make up anymore. Yes, it cleared up that much.  I decided to give it a whirl ... I mean why not, I had already spent so much money on other products, what&#x27;s another 25 bucks right?  Hands down, the best $25 dollars I ever spent.  I got my glow back, my self esteem, my energy... all for less than an hour&#x27;s work.  I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with my skin, it&#x27;s even better now than it was before I started breaking out.  I barely wear any face make up, just some powder and blush and it looks so smooth.    The only qualm I have is the process.  You have to be dedicated and go in with the mindset that this is a 3 stop process and it does take time.  It&#x27;s not just washing your face and slick on some moisturizer.  It is really CLEANING your face with the face wash, using the toner.  Letting that dry entirely and then either putting on the moisturizer in the morning, or the overnight cream at night.  This should be put on very generously.  I&#x27;ve noticed the more I put on, the clearer my skin is in the morning.  This also has to dry before hitting the pillow to avoid a mess.    Also, as another reviewer wrote, this is not for you if you have the rare breakout.  The medicines are potent and it will dry out your skin the first week you use it.  Keep lip balm handy as it dries out your lips too.  This only lasts about the first week or two though and after that you&#x27;ll be glad you stuck to it.  Also, keep out of your eyes -- don&#x27;t even get close because it will irritate your undereyes as well. I speak from experience :/</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I had acne around my chin and lower cheeks, and I just bought this 3 days ago. In 3 days of use my acne has probably improved by about 50%. There are no new pimples and the old ones are slowly fading. It&#x27;s also helping with my overall skin time because my face doesn&#x27;t get all oily in a few hours now. I&#x27;m in my 20s and have had acne on my chin and cheeks for about 2 years now. This is a life saver, first time I&#x27;ve written a review for anything.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had hoped it would work for my 15 year old son, but it really didn&#x27;t work at all. In fact, I believe it made it worse. After using the product for about 3 weeks or so, the acne just wasn&#x27;t improving. I heard about the purging period but there just seemed to be no end in sight for him. We followed the instructions to the tee. Now it has been at least two weeks since he stopped using it and his acne is just slightly improving from the huge amount he got from using this product. As we approach summer I am hoping the sun will dry some of it up. So we continue our search for a better product, for him anyways.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for the first time ever and it worked great -  my pimples were clearing up and my skin was really soft, so I didn&#x27;t think that there woulb be a problem purchasing a second shipment.  WRONG!!!  For some reasin, the second time around, my face got really dry, to the point of itchiness and I was scratching it like crazy!!!Not sure if the items were expired, but I don&#x27;t think that i&#x27;ll be buyinfg this product again -  lack of consistemncy :(</li>
            <li> Works better than Proactiv and the value is amazing.</li>
            <li> i have used the regular type of this product for a few years. We ordered this &amp;#34;Severe&amp;#34; one by accident, but are using it anyway. It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the regular one.</li>
            <li> This product is worth a try. I&#x27;m 25 years old with moderate adult acne (chin area/few break out spots on side of cheeks) and AcneFree severe is one of the few things that actually gets my skin clear. If I stop, the acne comes back. I also flare up during my &#x27;time of the month&#x27;, which I hate, but this product helps keep that at bay as well. My skin tends to get dry if I use it twice daily for days on end, so I use it once daily. I did try to use regular AcneFree but it didn&#x27;t work as well. To me, the scent is subtle and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin red.. except for my forehead, for some weird reason. Good product, I&#x27;m too lazy to try anything else and this works so I&#x27;ll be sticking to this for a while. :)</li>
            <li> I want to start out by saying I don&#x27;t have severe acne all over my face just my chin mainly. Nothing completely got rid of it. I decided to try this based on the reviews. I got it at target for $21 dollars. I have been using this for 3 days and I can truly say that I can already seen a difference. The only down side is that this product is a bit drying but nothing a little moisturizer can&#x27;t fix. Hopefully it will totally clear up completely. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Great price. Fast delivery. But didnt work that well for me.</li>
            <li> I have been waiting 3 weeks for this product and still nothing.  I will not order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit two weeks ago at my local Target store. I was ecstatic the after just 24 hours of use, all of my breakout significantly diminished and I had no new break outs forming. Fast forward 2 days, and I was not so happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 days of use (as directed) my skin became so dehydrated, dry, and scaly. I have combination skin, so dryness usually isn&#x27;t a problem for me. My skin was rough to the touch, I had dry patches all over my chin and nose, and my makeup did not apply well on my skin. I thought the powerful system might have been shocking my skin since it has a larger dose of treatment than what I&#x27;m used to. So I tried toning back the face wash and toner to once a day and continued using the moisturizers as directed, and that didn&#x27;t help at all. Messing with the steps actually caused my skin to have new breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I will not be continuing to use this system. I might try to use the products here and there so my money isn&#x27;t completely wasted. But if the frustration and lack of results continues, I will just throw this away.</li>
            <li> Good product works very fast, and better than proactive.</li>
            <li> it is not working on my skin type.but it could work some types of skins.for me westing money and time.</li>
            <li> Doesnt burn my skin even during a workout or after a workout or when i start sweating like that its only really one step you have to wash off so i can use the scrub in the shower put the rest on and then go to work havent been long enough to be acne free yet but i feel like its working my skin feels good (side note do not use a lot of this more cream doesnt mean more acne removal give this about a 3 month test and see if you see a difference oh and dont skip a day)</li>
            <li> My sister recommended this to me a long time ago, and then this Fall I relented and bought this instead of Neutrogena Advanced Solutions (which I&#x27;d been using with some success for 2 years). I am amazed at the difference. The retinol can be over-drying if it&#x27;s used every night, at least that was the case for me. But, if I follow through with each step and keep up the routine, my face is quite clear. This works better for me than the stuff I was getting from the doctors. I give it 2 thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a few weeks upon the first few days of use I notice my skin was not as oily as normal and does not shine as much as it normally would. I have noticed my skin is  a lot smoother and is very effective on picking up dead skin that causes the skin to feel smoother which is always a good thing you want for you skin and any acne products you use!</li>
            <li> I have tried Proactiv. I have been on birth control. I had just made an appointment to go see a doctor because of my scne. I am 24 and I have NEVER had acne so bad. I am in medical school so I thought, well it is stress. I also get bad cystic acne with my period. When I tried this yesterday I thought...well maybe it will help a little. I woke up this morning and literally said WOW when I looked in the mirror. Yes some little bumps are still there, but compared to what was...O M G all I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li> So Ive been using this for about three weeks and I havent really seen a change in my face. I have bad acne that comes and goes and when I got this in at the time my face was pretty bad broken out. Though I havent gotten any new brakeouts the ones I already had really havent gotten much better. Im still using it hoping that it might take a few weeks for it to really kick in but I really dont have a whole like ot faith in it now. Oh and whatever you do dont get it near your eyes. I got it just under my eyes and that part of my face was on fire for two days!</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews but given how much I rely on reviews, I figured it was about time I started contributing!  I had fairly heavy acne growing up, especially in my t-zone, which came under control when I began birth control pills when I turned 18.  For the past 10 years, I have been fortunate enough to not have difficulties with acne except for the occasional zit.  However, a few months ago I stopped taking birth control and I was dismayed to see that the acne had returned, albeit not as bad as when I was a teenager, and had moved more to my jawline/cheeks.  I began washing religiously and using toner but it didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference - as soon as one would go away, two more would pop up.  At 28, I felt that I was TOO OLD to be having these problems!  But there they were.  I tried ProActiv for a month and was pretty pleased with the results.  It cleared the majority of my acne and the big cystic ones stopped coming.  However, I was still regularly getting very small zits which would typically clear within a few days.  All in all, I was pleased and figured I could deal with the occasional small zit that could be covered relatively easily with make up.  After about 3 weeks, I noticed that my supply was getting low and it was time to re-order.  I wasn&#x27;t crazy about spending all that money, but was happy with the results so I was ready to do it......until I read the reviews for Acne Free Severe.  I was hesitant to try it.  I didn&#x27;t want to go back to the way my skin was and I figured if I was pleased, why rock the boat?  In the end, I decided if I was going to get a long-term regime, I should at least try the product that was MUCH cheaper than ProActiv and I am SO HAPPHY that I did!  Within 3 days of using AcneFree, it cleared the small zits that ProActiv couldn&#x27;t seem to keep under control.  I have been using AcneFree day and night for the last 5 weeks and have not had a single new zit.  It also seems to be lightening the scars left from previous breakouts.  Ihave not had the problems of the product severely drying out my skin as others have noted.  I use steps 1 and 2 each morning when I wake up and each evening.  In the mornings, I follow with step 3 and at night, I skip step 3 and use step 4.    A few observations:  - AcneFree is not great at removing make up.  I have to start with a make up remover (I use Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser) or I have to use 3-4 pads with toner on it to remove everything.  If I start with the make up remover and follow with the 3 AcneFree steps, I get a great cleaning and starting with the make up remover only adds a minute to the routine.  - I was a bit concerned after switching from ProActiv to AcneFree because I felt the AcneFree wash did not have as many grains as the ProActiv and was concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t work as well - it works BETTER.  If you&#x27;re switching from ProActiv, don&#x27;t let that concern you.  - AcneFree didn&#x27;t come with the many instructions provided by ProActiv.  Having using ProActiv, I knew that I needed to wash with a dime sized amount.  I wonder if those who have had issues with this product drying their skin out are using more than that?  - AcneFree will bleach your clothes or towels if you&#x27;re not careful.  Its not as obvious as when you get cleaning products on your clothes that have bleach on it, but I do notice a slight fading on some of my towels.  I don&#x27;t particularly mind because the towels I use for drying my face aren&#x27;t my &#x27;nice&#x27; towels, but this is something to remember.  - You do tend to go through the toner more quickly than the other products.  I am going to take the advice of another reviewer and pick up the Thayers Witch Hazel to use in its place.  - Make sure you never use all four steps or you will likely dry your skin out.  It should be steps 1+2 and then 3 OR 4.  This has worked so well that my husband, who has always used Retinol A cream (which is not covered by insurance due to him not being a teenager) has decided to switch to this product.I am very excited to have found this product and I am planning on using it long-term.  The price is great for the product - At this rate, it looks like I will go through a package about every 2-2.5 months which makes it less than half the cost of ProActiv for the same amount of product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had severe acne problems since HS and I could never get rid of it even into adulthood. I did use Accutane, but stopped because I was not fond of the side effects. This product has been great! After a week of using the product, I noticed a HUGE difference in my skin. After a few weeks following the directions, my acne cleared. My friends and family commented on how quickly my acne went away. Since I do not want to strip my skin, I now use the product once every other day as part of my regimen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 8 days. Some people may say it&#x27;s too soon to review; however, \\&quot;some people\\&quot; do not have acne as bad as I DID. I&#x27;ve got that- \\&quot;made an appt. with a dermatologist, but he was too busy to see me so I had to see the physician assistant instead; when I got to the office, she took one look at my face and said \\&quot;\\&quot;oh my God, I&#x27;ve got to get the doctor for this\\&quot;\\&quot; -kind of skin. I have cystic acne combined with REALLY sensitive skin. I can&#x27;t even spray perfumes on certain parts of my body without it breaking out really, really bad. Complete strangers walk up to me and ask me what am I using on my skin. How embarrassing is that? I wake up EVERY morning with whiteheads and/or blackheads on my face. My chest and back look like my face x20. Antibiotics,Proactive,and Murad only made the situation worse. I stopped eating fatty foods and I lost weight, but the acne continue to get worse the older I get. I drank only water for months at a time, but that did no good. Finally, hundreds of dollars later, I decided to give this product a try. This is the best my skin has looked in over 15 years. I was a skeptic, but trust me, this works.</li>
            <li> It has cleared probably 80% of my acne before I even finish the box. This is the only product that ever worked for me. It is not drying, not irritating. I especially like the retinol formula. I see improvement every morning I look at the mirro. Now I can see hope that my acne will be completely eliminated soon. I will continue to use this product as a preventative.    Update in Oct, 2014:    After using this for several months, I realized that it does not solve my acne problem long term.   After doing lots of research I realized that my diet did not have enough good fat and protein to help the body to fight infection and cell regeneration. This is what I add that help my skin problem long term: Vit D, K, N A cystein, MSM, curcumin. And I increase my consumption of good fat, protein. I eat my fat and protein early in the day with bile and HCL.     I figured out a home made recipe to get rid of old skin. N A cysteine(Lef.org, as the powder is very fine that can dissolve in water completely), vitamin C powder, sea salt in some water. It peeled like cracy the first two weeks. I then add some astaxanthin which also fades dark spot. Add some Vit E and CoQ10, lecithin and some essential oils will also help skin cell regeneration. Mix enough for one week in a small cup and refrigerate. It took about three months for my skin to gradually clear. Now, another three months, my skin keeps on improving.</li>
            <li> It is working amazingly well! Couldn&#x27;t be happier. I had some HUGE pimples and after 2 days of use they were almost flat.</li>
            <li> Buy this at walmart. Works wonders! My skin is cleared in a matter of days! I can&#x27;t go without it!</li>
            <li> I used this regimen like clockwork to the T for 2 weeks and saw no change, just irritation. Everyone is different though.</li>
            <li> I happened upon this product listing and decided to curiously read the reviews because I have used it before myself and it was horrible. If you go in the sun, you can&#x27;t use it....well, is that to say that you have to live in the deep caves under earth, who never goes in the sun? Also, despite using it anyway (and during the winter so there was no issue of sun) the first time I used it my skin began to smooth but not without an intense and dangerous burning of my skin, I mean 911 burning and my skin dried so much that I had to use healing ointments to soothe it. Then, I shelfed it for a while because I couldn&#x27;t take it but decided that upon my reuse of it, I would not use the entire system mixed because it&#x27;s too intense; I opted to use the wash and only the on the spot treatment and it did not do anything for the acne whatsoever!! So I switched out and used the wash with the lotion that comes in the set with the wash (the spot treatment is bought seperately by the way).....still no results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I actually noticed that my skin was having more of a breakout than what I had to begin with; keep in mind that I don&#x27;t have major or even consistent acne issues. For my skin to experience a major breakout because of the product I chose to clear up a small issue, that did it for me. Never again!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item about 2 and a half months ago. I will admit I did skip a few days at a time sometimes, but this product definitely showed nice results. Lately (I&#x27;m 27) I have had breakouts due to my hormone levels changing and wanted to try something without having to waste my money. I am very skeptical on anything I buy. So I only purchase items with a large review community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a little over two months and this product helps clear my skin, and leaves it feeling very smooth. The only thing I would want different is, if it helped with red blotches. But we cant find all our skin solutions all in one product! lol. It did what what it advertised, and it didn&#x27;t burn, or make my skin itchy, dry, or flakey. No bad smells either, I know some of you are big on that. Everything feels and smells great. I&#x27;d recommend giving it a try. Best of luck to you all.</li>
            <li> A few months back I had moderate acne breakout and it wouldn&#x27;t go away. After using this system my acne didn&#x27;t vanish, but did reduce considerably. The downside of this product was that my face became addicted to benzoyl peroxide treatments. Once this kit was used up, I didn&#x27;t order a new one and my acne came back. This will happen with any product that has b.p., so I&#x27;m not holding it against AcneFree. It does its job, but I preferred Equate&#x27;s acne treatment system to this because that got rid of all my acne.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my wife it starts working when it&#x27;s finished so buy at least two packs too start</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading some reviews and liking the price.  But it was a waste of money and didn&#x27;t make any positive difference for my daughter.  It actually dried out her face and almost \\&quot;burned\\&quot; it.  She has switched to ProActive and loves it.  I was optimistic it would work, but am disappointed.  I wish I could return it and get a refund, but Amazon says no.</li>
            <li> So I haven&#x27;t used the entire system but the spot treatment is amazing! It only took one night to reduce my giant  pimple. It&#x27;s not harsh and is pretty cheap. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a fast problem solver.</li>
            <li> I had very high hopes for this product, as I know many other users did. This stuff actually seem to make my acne worse. It was more \\&quot;severe\\&quot; on my skin, and didn&#x27;t help my severe acne. :(</li>
            <li> Good seller,  no problem at all</li>
            <li> This is a must buy product for acne,. Ive try diff acne tx, it makes my pimple erupt like volcano, then I bought thus product right away,. Within 4hrs,. My acne calms. It does works!</li>
            <li> I am 31 years old and I have suffered from terrible acne since my early teens. I have tried every kind of product out there including both doctor-prescribed and over-the-counter. Nothing has ever cleared up my acne until I tried this product. This is the clearest my skin has ever been in my entire life!!! I also bought the AcneFree Terminator 10 spot treatment to treat specific breakouts. I think this is the cheapest The only drawback is the benzoyl peroxide will take the color out of your bed sheets, towels, and clothes. Other than that, I couldn&#x27;t be happier! This product has been life-changing for me!!!!! Better yet, it&#x27;s one of the cheapest acne systems out there!!</li>
            <li> After having spent \\&quot;too much money with dermatologist\\&quot;.  My 17 year son bought this out of desperation on one of our vacations. The results have been amazing!!!!  Unfortunately it is not available where we live so I have to buy it on line.</li>
            <li> so far i like the product because my face start to clearing out!!!</li>
            <li> For the price, I was skeptical.  But I decided I had little to lose.  Within 2 days my blackheads were cleared up.  I have large pores and always hated the way my skin looked. My breakouts were always large and painful.  Within a week my acne (and scars) were improving and my face didn&#x27;t feel like an oil slick. &lt;br /&gt;It did dry my skin, but I used a facial lotion with a sunscreen on top of this treatment program. And honestly I&#x27;d rather have dry, clear skin than oily acne skin.  I can finally leave my house without make up on and not feel like everyone is staring at me.  This product was very worth the money spent. I&#x27;d encourage anyone to at least try it.</li>
            <li> The product is strong so be careful if you have sensitive skin. But it worked for me and my friend. The company actually refunds if your are not satisfied in anyway.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product because I was really breaking out everywhere, making it very embarrasing when working in a medical environment and just being around family.  I have tried various products, and none have worked for me.  I bought this product and have used it for about 18 hours and my face is really much more clear.  I had painful nodules on my face and they are practically gone.  The swelling is gone and less painful.  I have used this product 3 times and It works just as it says. Results seen by next day.  I love it, and you will too!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 14 year old granddaughter who had a bad case of acne and she has been using it for 10 days and her acne is almost gone.  It is wonderful.</li>
            <li> With four acne prone teenagers, our family has tried just about every acne product on the market. Proactive worked well with two of our children but is rather expensive.  With one son nothing worked, not even prescription meds; that is until we tried AcneFree Severe.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so you may need to try several products to find something that really works for you.  However, I highly recommend trying AcneFree Severe before purchasing Proactive. This product may be too strong for someone with a pimple or two, but worked wonders for a very difficult case of acne.</li>
            <li> This was by far the worse acne treatment system. I followed the directions absolutely correcly but it just made my face worse and some days dry and other days greasy. Don&#x27;t waste your time, money, or looks... go with something else.</li>
            <li> I have had acne for a long long time, many years. Thought it would dissapear after teenage years but i guess not, 26 years old now. I got scars from them too. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of stuff and i really love this product. It really improves my skin. Not just takes away the acne but it looks and feels better too. My skin does not get irritated from it. It doesn&#x27;t dry it out like other products can. It really works for me and my skintype. I tried the acnefree not severe one but acnefree severe works best for me.</li>
            <li> I used to have some acne when I was a teenager but I got the worst acne ever in my mid 20s. I tried everything for years with no results until I saw this product and decided to give it a try. I saw results quickly. Actually, the first couple of days it dried my skin up a little bit and I got a bad burning around my eyes. But the instructions clearly say not to use the product on the eyes area and I did, so it was my fault, (and I also overused it on my urge to get rid of my acne no matter what) Anyway, as soon as I saw the product dried my skin up, I just easily worked it out by following the instructions on how to use the product plus using some good day/night moisturizers by The Body Shop (I love their products).  My skin began to look much better in a few days, the repair lotion really works. My severe acne disappeared and now I just have to cope with few regular breakouts like once in a while and I can fight them with the repair lotion. I think this stuff really kills acne bacteria and most of the time prevents breakouts from attacking again!  But remember, you must follow the instructions and not overuse it cause it can burn your skin! and you need to use it constantly and be patient to get the best results!. One more thing, we are all different and every skin type may show a different reaction to this product, so, even though I can tell the product has been working awesome for me since I got it, this is just and opinion/advice according to my personal experience.  As I mentioned it before, bear in mind that acnefree might dry up your skin, but you can work it out with a moisturizer and that&#x27;s a whole lot better than fighting acne!</li>
            <li> do not use this product has a safety recall from all walmart stores i work there and had to take them off the shelves</li>
            <li> I have been trying different products for face acne for several years now, including a prescription from a dermatologist. This is probably the most effective thing I&#x27;ve tried yet. Sometimes I have to use a lotion, to counteract the drying out of skin, but it still seems to be doing something. It seems to last a fair amount of time, maybe 2 months for one person, for the cost of it. You will also need cottonballs to apply one of the tubes that comes in it.</li>
            <li> For over a year, I have been buying this product every 1 1/2 months. While I still get acne breakouts even with the product, I get maybe 1-3 new breakouts a day on average vs several or over a dozen new breakouts per day when I used other products. I was on  dermatologist prescribed kits that cost a fortune and tried a few different antibiotics, and it did not seem to work. I love this product.    However, I noticed the price says it costs $63 which is horrendous.    I buy it at target for $21.89 or cvs for $30 if they are sold out at target. Kmart also has it for $30 but you have to order it online &amp; have them ship it to store. Even Christmas tree store has it for $28-29 if those 3 options are not available/ if they run out.    P.s. If you run out of 1 or 2 items like face wash or toner, you can buy them SEPARATELY online for cheaper &amp; have it shipped to you.    [...]  [...]</li>
            <li> It really help my teenage daughter clear her face!</li>
            <li> Works so great! People noticed a difference in my acne very quickly. However, DO NOT BUY FOR OVER $25!!! You can go to Walmart and pay $18 or Target and pay about $25. Just but it instore, it will be much cheaper!</li>
            <li> Because is the best product a ever tried. I thought was never going to get rid of my moon face, but guess what IT WORKS!! thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> I get hormonal acne and this is by far the only thing that helps keep my skin tame. Yeah, nothing works perfectly but this is nearly perfect. I&#x27;ve been using it for 4-5 years now and every time I try to switch to something else (usually because AcneFree is sometimes impossible to find) I regret it. I was using ProActive before and it worked ok but it&#x27;s ridiculously expensive (maybe they should stop spending money on their celebrity ads), Aveeno and Neutragena work alright too but AcneFree products just work better.</li>
            <li> I used ProActive for about 10 years in my 20&#x27;s for mild adult acne and people would literally stop me on the street to compliment my complexion. Im now pushing 40 and am yet again dealing with acne! In CA you can get ProActive at any mall kioak AND customize the set. Where I live now that isnt an option and I dont want to deal with ProActive&#x27;s auto ship/pay program so I tried Acne Free. First of all on Amazon it is $14.00 cheaper than any of the retail stores (Walmart, Rite Aid &amp; Kmart).You can&#x27;t really beat the price. And I have noticed an overall improvement of my skin tone/complexion and people have mentioned that I am glowing again! HOWEVER, Acne Free is NOT proactive; if you dont use it ever single day or indulge in a Butterfinger or two, you WILL get new breakouts. Furthermore it makes my skin excessively oily like the days of puberty! But I figure I&#x27;d still rather be using zit cream as opposed to wrinkle cream so I&#x27;ll continue to buy it. Like I said, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> worked ok for about 3 days &amp; after that no difference</li>
            <li> I will just start this review by saying that I do not normally write reviews. But this stuff deserves one!! I have struggled with acne since I was about 13 years old. I would say that I have mild-severe acne, although it has gotten a little better over time. One day at Target, I was browsing the Acne aisle as I normally do to try to find yet something else to try. (I have gone to the dermatologist as well, without 100% results). I decided to use some of my Christmas money to try AcneFree Severe. I am so happy I did!!! I have so much more confidence now... I almost spent $80.00 on the Clinique Acne Solutions and am happy I tried this before hand! In one day, my redness was gone. After about a week, my acne started to dry up and go away (without over-drying the rest of my face). I now make sure that I use this stuff religiously morning and night!! I also bought \\&quot;The Terminator\\&quot; Which is 10% Benzoyl Peroxide ($5) as well for acne spots that come up during the day (Just be careful how much you use...read the instructions on the box). I would suggest anyone and everyone with mild-severe acne to try this!! It&#x27;s honestly the best I have found!! Go out and buy some...you will be ecstatic with your results! :)</li>
            <li> **I highly recommend this product!  **Be patient with it! Initially made my acne worse and took 6 weeks to show results, but was incredibly effective!  Details:  I have had moderate to severe acne for about 6-7 years. I have tried:  -clindamycin  -differin  -tretinoin  -benzoyl peroxide  -birth control pills  -several types of oral antibiotics  -sulfacetimide  Many dermatologists have recommended Accutane, but that is where I drew the line - too risky and requires blood draws every 3 weeks. After several years of ineffective prescription treatments, I just used over the counter acne products, which also didn&#x27;t work but I supposed couldn&#x27;t hurt, and accepted the fact that I have acne and will hopefully grow out of it one day. I didn&#x27;t.  At 24, getting tired of constantly worrying about my face and piling on makeup to hide it, I decided to give AcneFree Severe a shot. At first, my acne got worse!! I used it exactly as directed for a month and saw no improvement, so was beginning to be once again discouraged. BUT, the website stated that for severe acne, the product would not show results for 6-8 weeks. So I hung in there with it, and now, after about 6 weeks of using the product, MY SKIN LOOKS AMAZING! I have not had skin this clear since high school and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> I look like the \\&quot;after\\&quot; picture in a Proactive commercial! Except this time the results are real!  The AcneFree treatment system comes with great products that help your skin. The PH balancing part if this system is amazing and completely changed the the look and feel of my skin! The wash works really well and leaves my face feeling clean without ruining my skin. I you have acne you know how hard it is to find a soap that doesn&#x27;t undo all the work your treatments are doing. The over night cream is the one step I cut out once in a while. It stops your face from drying out but occasionally leaves my face feeling slightly oily. And, of course, last but not least, the cream. I put this on my entire face, back, and chest every morning. Then I leave it in my purse and use it as a spot treatment if I feel a new breakout attempting to surface during the day. This product truly stops a zit in it&#x27;s path. I no longer feel helpless when I feel a zit coming.  AcneFree uses Benzoyl Peroxide to treat you acne instead of Salicylic Acid, which is the active ingredient in many if not most of your over the counter acne treatments. I have found this to be very helpful in and of it&#x27;s self but if you&#x27;ve already tried treatments with benzoyl peroxide I would still say this product is worth a try.  About me and my skin: I&#x27;m 22 I did not have a lot of acne in high school but in college I started breaking out all the time. I tried many treatments, with no results. This product totally turn my skin around. I would recommend it to anyone!  My final note is be sure to be consistent (at least a first).  In the slue of acne treatments this product is a standout! I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> The only OTC product that really works for my 17 year old son!  He plays football and after hours in a dirty, sweaty helmet, his chin and forehead would be awful, just covered in pimples.  We had tried so many other  products, including ProActive, and this system is the best. We have been using AcneFree Severe for over a year now and it really works. He did have a little burning and drying at first, but only for the first few days. It is like night and day. I can tell when he slacks off and doesn&#x27;t do all 4 steps, because he will start breaking out.  But once he starts using the this product as directed, all 4 steps, twice a day, his skin clears up. His skin looks really great and his confidence has grown. If you have sensitive skin, I would try the regular version or the sensitive skin version of AcneFree.  I was purchasing this at our local WalMart $22, but I am going to start using the subscribe and save option to get it for $18.97 and ship it to him when he goes off to college next year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about a year. It&#x27;s the only product that&#x27;s completely cleared my face up. I never even considered myself having severe acne, but I always had something or other in some place or another. Everything I tried never got rid of *all* of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like? It&#x27;s four steps. Thats a lot of time, many nights I forget to use the last step (to use 10 mins after the toner). I&#x27;m not very consistent with using it, which is probably why other things never really worked that well. But it cleared up my acne, if I become too inconstant (not using it at least once a day) acne will pop back up. If I start using it consistently again the acne will clear up pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always considered my skin normal, not very oily or dry. My skin never became very dry because of this product. If my skin ever becomes very dry though, I&#x27;m pretty quick to apply another lotion to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all though, it works. It works really good. Even when I say screw it and don&#x27;t follows all of it&#x27;s rules is still works pretty well. Not prefect, if you don&#x27;t do everything, but still better than the rest if your inconsistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: 2 or 3 years later... I can no longer use this product. It causes my face and eye to swell. I don&#x27;t know why or when it started. But I had to start using it. I was not using it consistently at this point, but rather just when break outs occurred. But after my last time of using it and my face swelling up... I just bit the bullet and threw all my stuff away.</li>
            <li> I have had awesome results in just two weeks ! I have tried Pro-Active, for me, this works MUCH better ! My face was a little dry and itchy the first week - but that went way and so did the blemishes.</li>
            <li> I had very severe acne. Especially on 2 chin, and some areas on my neck. not on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;When i received this product, i used about 10 days following the normal direction. No difference shown.&lt;br /&gt;Later, about 10 days after i decided to skip STEP 2 (ph balancer) and 4 (retinol) for while. So i just used STEP 1 after then STEP 3 (high amount). I especially used 1 hour before when i go to sleep. It dries in up to 30 minutes. So you wouldnt wipe it off on your pillow when you at sleep.&lt;br /&gt;Soon i purchased ACNEFREE GREEN TEA MOISTURIZER, i m using it now though.&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS JUST MY DIRECTION THOUGH.&lt;br /&gt;STEP 4 direction was \\&quot;only apply at morning\\&quot; - but you cant apply at morning because this treatment lotion is too white and doesnt absorbs quickly as like Proactiv STEP 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want to tell those who gave 1 star on feedback:&lt;br /&gt;JUST USE STEP 1,2,3 , few days later step 2 will finishes (i mean it will run off) then just use STEP 1 and 3, 8.10 am MORNING step 1, very little amount of STEP 3, THEN evening 7 pm when i came back from my work JUST STEP 1, BEFORE SLEEP 11 or 12 pm STEP 1 with HIGH AMOUNT OF STEP 3. THEN WAIT FOR 30 minutes. DRY OFF. SLEEP. (I&#x27;m using step 4 once a week, not every night)&lt;br /&gt;STEP 4 IS JUST FOR FIXING THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE FROM STEP 3. Use it when you needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above direction is for only who has REALLY SEVERE ACNE (I MEAN SEVERE.. REAL SEVERE, not just 5 or 6 pimples , im talking about 20 or more big zits, cyst, pain under face, WHO cried several times alone in the toilet because of acne.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this direction will help you guys. Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;REMIND: I&#x27;M NON BENZOYL PEROXIDE ALLERGIC, i&#x27;ve normal skin (slightly oily), AND i&#x27;m not a ACNEFREE staff who just advertising this product. I&#x27;m advertising it because this 20$ product bring me back, which is saved my life.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with mild acne since I have graduated high school. Once I started breaking out, I began using the original acnefree kit. It made my skins worse, but I still gave it a try. Now that my acne became severe, I decided to go a step up and get this product. This product has left me with red skin, bad acne, and more acne scars. To add up, the only this product has done is bleach my hair and clothes. this product smells really bad! Dont get this product expecting hope, cuz i bet these positive comments about it are from paid spokespeople.</li>
            <li> i have bought this product in the past at a store, and it worked for me once. this time, not at all lol maybe they changed the ingredients? But this did not work at all</li>
            <li> I used this for three months. I was better off before, actually. I have constant breakouts.  I would get really strange pimples the likes of which I&#x27;ve never seen, using this stuff. I got a bunch of cysts, which would get very infected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe you should just go to a dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, benzoyl peroxide should just be used as a spot treatment. Not a lotion. Or else you will prematurely age your skin and it will look like an orange. And you will still have pimples.  But if you have so many pimples, maybe the lotion makes sense. Only, this product doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.  (I would say I&#x27;m an 8 out of 10, as far as \\&quot;severity\\&quot; goes, with 10 being the most severe acne.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is actually helping is this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash your face with oatmeal. Just raw oatmeal.&lt;br /&gt;Change your sheets.&lt;br /&gt;Scrub with baking soda.&lt;br /&gt;I know you&#x27;re going to pick at your face, but try not to. If you&#x27;re going to, then first try applying a heated spoon to your zit. (Don&#x27;t burn yourself.)  Then apply lemon juice.  This shrinks your pores as well.&lt;br /&gt;Leave used teabags on your zits.&lt;br /&gt;Eat lots of coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;Put coconut oil on your face at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mess around with these things until you find a combo that&#x27;s right for you. Your skin looks better, like, instantly, and it just keeps getting better. But be careful because all that scrubbing can irritate your skin.  I&#x27;m still not 100% clear, but people compliment me on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, just see a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I dont leave comments often but after one week my skin feels amazing. Tried everything over the sun anf nothing has worked this well. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I honestly couldn&#x27;t believe it.... I didn&#x27;t have horrible skin to begin with, but I got a new haircut where my hair hit the sides of my face / forehead a lot more and I started getting painful breakouts on my temples, adn along my jawline and on my forehead.... plus for some reason my nose and chin started getting really bad blackheads. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I got this stuff thinking why the hell not and it&#x27;s been 5 days and my skin is sooooo freaking soft and clear.   I would honestly call it a miracle product because it&#x27;s ridiculous how awesome it works.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The all day lotion (step 3) is a little bit harsh on my skin, it&#x27;s the 10% benzoil (sp?) peroxide, but it gets the job done so so so so so well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Used as directed and did not see a change, just made my skin very dry.</li>
            <li> Okay so I found this product at a local Walmart, and I saw that it said \\&quot;BETTER\\&quot; than proactive. So in result I picked it up and brought it home. Later on I used it and I regret it. It made my face peel and itch. This product has made me very angry and I urge you all not to buy it.!! You have been warned. :)</li>
            <li> I HAVE TRIED A LOT OF ACNE TREATMENTS OVER THE LAST YEAR THAT MY SEVERE ACNE STARTED. RODAN FIELDS UNBLEMISH, MURAD, NEUTORGENA, CLEARASIL, WEXLER, OXY, STRIDEX. PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING BUT PRO ACTIVE BECAUSE AT THE TIME IT WAS ONLY  AVAILABLE ON A MONTHLY REFILL BASIS. I GAVE EACH TIME TO WORK. I WAS GETTING AT LEAST ONE PIMPLE EVERYDAY. I DECIDED TO GO BACK TO USING THE ACNE FREE SEVERE KIT, I WAS USING IT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO; AND IT CLEARED UP MY FACE FAST AND NO DRYNESS OR REDNESS! MANY OF THE OTHER PRODUCTS IRRITATED AND DRYED MY SKIN SO MUCH IT WAS CRACKED AND PAINFUL ALONG WITH THE PAINFUL OUTBREAKS. I SAW IMPROVEMENT ALMOST IMMEDIATLY. I ALSO HAD CYSTIC OUTBREAKS AND THEY DID TAKE A LONG TIME TO CLEAR UP WITH THIS PRODUCT, BUT HAVE HAD NO NEW ONES SINCE STARING THE REGIMIN.FOR MY CYSTIC OUTBREAKS I STARTED USING DERMADOCTOR WRINKLE REVENGE AND BUILT UP TO LEVEL THREE. I USE IT BEFORE USING THE ACNE FREE CLEANSER. I NOW HAVE ZERO BREAKOUTS AND ZERO CYSTIC ACNE. MY FACE DOESN&#x27;T HURT FROM BREAKOUTS AND IRRITATION. UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE SCARRING FROM MY SEVERE ACNE. I WISH I WOULD HAVE TRIED THIS FIRST. BUT MY SELF ESTEEM IS THROUGH THE ROOF COMPARED TO WANTING TO PUT A BAG OVER MY HEAD A YEAR AGO. IF YOU HAVE SEVERE ACNE GIVE IT A TRY, FOLLOW DIRECIONS ON BOX. DEFINETLY WORTH A TRY THE PRICE IS REASONABLE, I SHUDDER TO THINK OF HOW MUCH MONEY I WASTED ON OTHER PRODUCTS. BEST WISHES</li>
            <li> I have had acne problems for YEARS. Now, at 17, I was really becomming irritated with my acne and nothing working.  Venting out my frustrations to my mom, she found this for me.  I had tried proactive as well as prescribed medicines from my dermatologist.  I was a hesitant at first for buying this poduct because of the number of people who did give it a poor review.  My mom and I sat down and read all of the reviews and came up with the conclusion that the majority of the people who gave it bad reviews had had progress with proactive.  With that being the opposite for me as well as the product being realtivly cheap, I decided to try it.  I got it later the next day from my local drug store and used it that night.  The next morning, I could already tell a difference!  The redness had decreased a considerable amount, and my acne keeps going away day by day.  I love this product and it is really a confidence booster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Proactive about 5 years ago, which didn&#x27;t really work too well for me, but I thought that&#x27;s how things just were.  Then tried AcneFree, and I had less pimples, but still about 3-5 a week.  Then, I tried some all natural cleanser in a black bottle, and while my face FELT better, I still got pimples, and bad pimples.  Went back to Target to buy AcneFree, but found AcneFree Severe.  Been using the severe for about 12 months now, and have gotten about 2-4 pimples a MONTH, and not bad ones either.  AND I only wash in the mornings, and don&#x27;t even use step 4.  When I do get that bad pimple once in a blue moon, I use AcneFree Terminator 10, which also works GREAT, but is hit and miss honestly.      AcneFree Severe has changed my skin, and my life.  I don&#x27;t go a day without using this product.  If you are buying for a teen or are a teen yourself and don&#x27;t like to wash your face, just bring Step 1 in the shower with you.  Turn the water to cool/warm, rinse your face to open the pores.  Put 1 dab on each your left and right cheek and your forehead.  LIGHTLY wash your face and rub in Step 1.  Then, rinse off with the shower water, and DAB your face dry.    When you get out, use step 2 and step 3 with cotton PADS.  Step 2 will go a lot faster than the other steps, but you can go on their website or call the company directly and buy just that step.    I HIGHLY recomend this product</li>
            <li> This acne system works fairly well. I&#x27;ve got adult onset, and after being off Rx acne meds for a couple years this is the best OTC stuff I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s not a miracle, and it&#x27;s not as good as combining a sulfer wash with retin-a and benzoyl peroxide - but my skin looks better than it has in awhile.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this acne treatment. This product cleared up my severe acne and help lighten my dark spots as well. I am really happy I made this purchase. I recommend this treatment for anyone who is suffering from acne in general. This product helps all skin colors and skin types. I really hope that you found this review helpful.</li>
            <li> I waited 6-8 weeks before reviewing this product because I wanted to give it the entire chance before deciding if it was working or not. (The product states it may take up to 8 weeks to work fully for severe acne.) I used the product diligently, twice a day as directed, all steps. I would consider myself having moderate to severe acne -- usually peaking during PMS and less severe during the rest of the month. I am 31 years old and have had acne since a teenager. I took accutane in my early 20s but I think hormones continue to get the best of my face and it reappeared a few years later. I used Proactiv previously which seemed to help at first but quickly lost its vigor and I felt like the only thing it was good for was bleaching my towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I run across Acne Free which seemed to have pretty good reviews &amp; thought it was worth a try. I started the product during PMS (which may or may not have been a good idea). I consider myself to have sensitive skin but didn&#x27;t have any problems with this product itching, peeling, redness or anything. Maybe my skin was previously conditioned by the Proactiv but it was fine nonetheless. Here is a warning for people who actually have pretty bad skin: the first week, my skin was a nightmare. It reminded me of my teenage days when I would have 8-10 (or more) pimples at a time - rather than my usual 4-5 during PMS. However, I actually felt like it was doing something: purging the impurities, bringing it all to the surface - unlike Proactiv. After about a week and a half of madness, things started to clear up like magic. I had a blissful period of 3 weeks with nary a pimple. Then PMS rolled around again &amp; the breakout began -- but much, much less severe.  For the weeks following, I would say that I have experienced about 1 pimple per week on average. The pimples that I do get are much smaller, surface quickly and go away quickly. There has been a significant improvement in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with the product because I have seen an overall improvement in my skin and I believe it&#x27;s probably the best product out there.product because I have seen an overall improvement in my skin and I believe it&#x27;s probably the best product out there.</li>
            <li> This product is much cheaper than Proactive and works just as well.  I recommend this product.  It&#x27;s so much more affordable and comes with the 4th product.  Be sure to always use sunscreen with either this stuff or with Proactive.  Sunscreen should always be the 4th step.</li>
            <li> This acne kit effectively reduces severe acne. I would definitely recommend using 2 to 3 times a week in order to get the best results. Use it daily and it may be too much acne medication for your skin! I&#x27;ve done it and it dried my skin out to the point where it hurt to smile or make any facial expressions. The cleanser is a white liquid formula with no scrubbing beads, but you can feel the medication working on your pores as your scrub. So that&#x27;s Step 1. I believe Step 2 is what contributes to most of the dryness because it&#x27;s a toner with alcohol as one of the main ingredients. Steps 3 &amp; 4 are just day and night acne lotions for the face, the last steps of the regime that help restore some of the moisture that was lost during Steps 1 &amp; 2. Overall, a very effective acne kit. Most definitely will purchase again!</li>
            <li> This worked well for a while. I&#x27;m not sure how strong the formula actually was. The toner (step 2) would sometimes hurt if you got it on the actual breakouts. Also I&#x27;m pretty sure that step 3, whatever it is, made me breakout even more. I ended up just using the wash and the step 4 stuff at night. Also if you want to use the whole system as intended make sure you have cotton balls or pads for the toner (step 2).</li>
            <li> I love this product! I USED TO have SEVERE cystic acne. I tried EVERYTHING, topicals pills, and antibiotics. This is the only thing that has worked for me EVER. I will continue to use this product. I definitely recommend this product, especially if you are ineligible to take accutane, or don&#x27;t want to mess with that stuff. I have been acne free for 4 years now!</li>
            <li> I am almost on my 3rd week of using this product, it has greatly improved some of the areas on my face. I&#x27;ll continue to use it and hopefully it&#x27;ll take care of the rest.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t magic but it was better than other products that our daughter had been using. We&#x27;d buy it again but I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d argue that you should buy it.</li>
            <li> I dont know what makes this so different then other things I have tried... But it is amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried ever store brand, birth control, doxycycline, new make up, no make up, dieting, and so on and so forth. This was the only thing I avoided because the \\&quot;severe\\&quot; thing scared me. I used a 10% benzyl peroxide product before and it did nothing. So why is this so amazing? I feel stupid for waiting until now to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With in two days my zits were dried up, and I only have one now. I used to have around 5 at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this, most products I use work for a short time, and then my skin wins the battle with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is dry too! I know most benzyl peroxide treatments work best for oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my skin is soft, and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Acnefree!</li>
            <li> I received this product quickly and in great condition. I have had acne for over a decade and this product has cleared my skin quickly. Within a week of using the product my acne was under control. I have had one break since using it and I believe it is because I slacked off using it for a few days. Great product. Highly suggested.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and 2/3rds less the price of big box stores!</li>
            <li> i love this stuff and the price is GREAT</li>
            <li> It seems like this stuff works better than proactiv for acne.</li>
            <li> i love it. only wash that has actually reduces acne completely but after i ran out then i got all of it back&lt;br /&gt;so&lt;br /&gt;i bought natures cure pills and it has worked out amazingly</li>
            <li> Acnefree severe really is great and works well but I can buy it at Taget or from acnefree website for 25-30 bucks. Whats up with that!?</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she says it really works great. She has not had success with much else.</li>
            <li> do not buy! it is short on dates and it seems like there are sending old products! i wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this items.!</li>
            <li> should try 3 months. its same as workout. see the pics. it works for me. thanks. .  :  )  hope the pics help you.&lt;br /&gt;++++++++++++++ use this after SHAMPOO (and conditioner )+++++++++&lt;br /&gt;++++++++++++++if you want to cure your back++++++++++++++++++</li>
            <li> WAY Overpriced!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great! Totally recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I found the entire system at Dollar Tree a week after it arrived! I went and bought 8 for $8. Check Walmart.com too</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother. He has always had bad breakouts. After only a week, I could tell it was working! I could see more skin than redness on his face. It seems to be working!</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t worked for me at all!! Not happy with THE &amp;#34;GUARANTEED&amp;#34; RESULTS!</li>
            <li> I bought AcenFree so I could clear up dark spots and get rid of small breakouts. Works perfectly! My skin is clearer and softer!</li>
            <li> I never have had bad acne problems, a couple here and there when I was younger. But last week about 10 Very Bad pimple cystic-like bumps came up on my face.... Not only were they embarrassing, but they were so painful! I tried Neutrogena, Camphor oil, teatree oil, ect! Nothing was working! The bad part is that we&#x27;re only 2 days away from seeing Alan Jackson in concert and I couldn&#x27;t imagine going looking this bad! My husband looked up Acnefree on the internet by reviews and purchased it yesterday from our local discount store since there was not enough time to get it through Amazon. I used it as directed and almost immediately the pain eased up and my face is already healing!!! I know I&#x27;ll have to cover the redness with make-up, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore and looks 75% better!...I can&#x27;t Wait to go to the concert now :) I Love It!&lt;br /&gt;Also wanted to say that I haven&#x27;t had the dryness problem people are talking about and I&#x27;m forty-ummmm,...a bit older ;)</li>
            <li> I was having problems finding a series of products that worked in unison with each other and this was finally the product I was looking for. I doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin but still clears out my skin. I only wish they provided more toner. That, for some reason, empties out way before the other bottles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin, and when I was in high school I played on the football team which required me to wear a helmet that was always sweaty and bacteria-infested from prior play. I developed terrible breakouts and tried many different types of salicylic acid treatments that all failed miserably. I found this product and decided to give it a shot because I had seen good reviews of it, and within 3 weeks, my acne had cleared up and the harsh scarring was slowly going way. I now use the less severe version to keep my acne away, because it isn&#x27;t as harsh as this is made for clearing away very bad cases of acne. IMPORTANT: find a good lotion that is oil and fragrance free and is good for sensitive skin, because this product will leave your skin very dry (to rid the acne) and that&#x27;s not good in the long run to healthy skin and kind of defeats the purpose of the product. After the third step/cream in the product&#x27;s process, use lotion (I use [[ASIN:B000052YKI Purpose Dual Treatment Moisture Lotion with SPF 15 4 fl oz (120 ml)]], highly recommended) and you will see results, I certainly did.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old daughter has struggled with acne since she was 12.  She has seen two dermatologists, the best of the best here in Los Angeles.  We even changed her diet.  And yes, we also tried Proactiv which did not work.  Went the natural approach at one time also including different vitamins, etc.  The dermatologists prescribed washes, face creams, etc.  At one point one of the tubes of the prescribed cream was costing over $200 for a one and one half month supply.  And of course, with all of this, she continued to experience severe breakouts, especially on her forehead.  While walking through Walgreens, I happened to notice the box of Acne free and for some weird reason, told myself why not.  We had tried most everything out on the market all to no success. I stood in her bathroom watching as she did exactly what the box said to do.  When she woke up in the morning, the acne had definitely started to subside.  Within a week, the huge breakouts are now no more, and are starting to fade.  She did get one whitehead, but that&#x27;s been about it.  I cannot believe what is happening to her skin.  I highly recommend this product, and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Great product.  On time delivery</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright, it does work but not that effectively. I think other products work better (although a little more expensive) and kinder on your skin than this one.</li>
            <li> Product that works very well</li>
            <li> Great products. Zits were gone in two days. Try it you&#x27;ll like.</li>
            <li> From my point of view - those specifics are useless. And more - they create problems.</li>
            <li> For all those ppl out there with systic acne this is a God sent. I had breakouts in my t zone constantly. Along with my lower neck plus those horrible bulbs of deep acne thay would leav my face with giant bruises and purple knots. After using this for three Weeks the results where amazing but still not what I wanted. I still had breakouts and I was determined to have perfect skin. So I began mixing this product with others. (yes I know your not supposed to) but I did find the perfect combonation for my skin and hopefully someone elses as well. First step is to throw away step 1 (the facial cleanser) and replace it with morning burst detoxifying facial wash. Use everything else as directed and add terminator 10 (an acne cream distributed by acne free). I used this combo for about four Weeks mind you my skin did get really dry the third week. To curb that I bought some cheap non oil bassed lotion from target and cacked on my face at night before I went to bed. witch cleared it right up. I have know been using acne free for four months and like the name I am acne free and know I only use the terminator 10 to keep my acne under control only using the full regimen once a week and my skin is covergirl commercial flawless. I will forever use this product! And on a side not the L&#x27;oreal youth code dark spot corrector works incredible well with acne free.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for something that would work, but unfortunately, this set up is complicated, and after all that, just doesn&#x27;t work.  It did dry my face out, however.</li>
            <li> I am 21 years old and have struggled with acne most of my life. I had my acne under control with Benzamycin, a product prescribed by my dermatologist when I was 13. However, it began getting worse over the past year, and spiraled out of control when I stopped using Benzamycin and tried to fill in with OTC products. Unfortunately, when I went back on the Benzamycin it no longer worked to clear up the acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has done WONDERS for my face. In several weeks the product cleared up the cystic acne I had all over my chin and lightened the scars from old spots at the same time. Not only does it lighten old scars, but it seems to reduce the amount of scarring of \\&quot;new\\&quot; acne. New is in quotations because, while I do still have acne coming in, I believe that most of the pimples that are showing up on my face are from cysts that were under the skin for a long time and beginning to surface. I do use this product in combination with another retinol product, Atralin, which is prescribed by my dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to emphasize that this has made a difference in my cystic acne. I was diagnosed with PCOS this year, and am fairly certain that the acne I struggle with is a result of hormonal imbalances. While this may not work for everyone&#x27;s hormonal acne, I think it is worth a shot if you are struggling with moderate cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this product is it does cause your face to dry out, and you will need a good moisturizer. My face feels a lot better, but sometimes I look in the mirror and I have dried skin all over my chin! Its a little embarrassing, but I&#x27;d rather have that then struggle with acne everyday. It seems to be a harsh product, but if you can stand the burning over the first few uses and are willing to accept drier skin, try this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product after reading the reviews as a last resort, and I do not regret it! I only hope that it continues to work and my body doesn&#x27;t build up a tolerance to it. AcneFree Severe may not be or everyone, but it has certainly worked for me. It has not completely cleared my face, but made a significant difference in a few weeks, and continues to make a difference after approximately 7-8 weeks. I liked it so much that I felt like I had to go out of my way to write a review - a first for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a side note - I bought this at a local Meijer for $24.99. The companies selling on Amazon seem to have higher prices for this item, so you may be able to find a better value at your local supermarket.</li>
            <li> This product  is  Okay It DIDNT Stop ME From BREAKING Out But It Did slow  It Down  HOWever  It DIDNT  Do Anything For THE Dark  Acne  Scars I Had before</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of things for cystic acne and this product has worked faster and shown more results than any nonprescription item I&#x27;ve ever tried. And it doesn&#x27;t cause flaky skin.</li>
