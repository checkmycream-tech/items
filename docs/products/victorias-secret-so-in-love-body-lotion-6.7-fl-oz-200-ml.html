            <li>FIRST I WILL SAY THAT THIS IS MY FAVORITE PERFUME/LOTION SET EVER.  </li>

            <li>I love this product so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why Victoria&#x27;s Secrets stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore because it is one of their best!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty light fragrance.</li>
            <li>The aroma that emerges from the movement of the sheets is soothing and sweet.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t care for it at all but will give it to someone else who likes that old flower kind of fragrance.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and fresh - not the overpowering cotton candy smell.  </li>
            <li>I layer this lotion and love the way it softly scents my skin.</li>
            <li>Mmmmm, it is so luscious to lather on my skin after spritzing with the body mist; my early morning treat is light and refreshing before my long commute to work--I love the scent that consumes the car.  </li>
            <li>It arrived earlier than expected, so i loved it even more.</li>
            <li>THE SERVICE WAS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC, AND THE PRODUCT WAS OF COURSE BRAND NEW.  </li>
            <li>I received it as a gift several years ago and fell in love with the scent.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED</li>
            <li>Its hard to find it in stores at a good price now.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone who wants to smell like an angel.</li>

            <li>Since they no longer sell it she was happy to receive this on a random day throughout the week.</li>
            <li>Brand new as the seller said it would be.</li>
            <li>i love this so much, wish that it wasn&#x27;t discontinued, cause it is hard to find.</li>
            <li>This is such a light smell and it last all day, makes your skin feel like silk, I would recommend this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sweet smelling and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mother since it is her favorite lotion at Victoria Secret.</li>
