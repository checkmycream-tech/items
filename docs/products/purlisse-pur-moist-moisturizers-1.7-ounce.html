            <li>/&gt;Overall, a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Felt great, loved the smell.</li>
            <li>One of the best moisturizers available!</li>
            <li>One of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve ever used (though I do top it off with a sunscreen for daytime use).</li>
            <li>i bought it because i received a sample of it before and loved it...</li>
            <li>and it was now on sale for a good price.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Hyaluronic acid is a great moisturizer; it&#x27;s a polymer that holds onto a lot of water molecules in its chemical structure and is used in many anti-aging preparations.</li>

            <li>i love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Im 25 now and man, am i glad i started then!</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>Was nice until it stop working</li>
            <li>Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used by far.</li>
            <li>The smell isnt strong nor does it smell too much like an SPF which is wonderful!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>One of my most favorite moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I have fallen in love with this since then.</li>
            <li>Received in my Ipsy Bag and just love it.  </li>
            <li>Had to order more.  </li>
            <li>Got this in my ipsy bag &amp; I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I received a sample in my glam bag and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li>(So basically, safe for vegans if that&#x27;s an issue.)</li>
            <li>I have a couple more tubes of this</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Purlisse.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Nice, light moisturizer, no sticky residue.</li>
            <li>therefore I was very hesitant about trying this, but I am so glad I received a sample in my beauty box!!</li>
            <li>I sampled it with my Ipsy Glam bag, and loved it so much I had to order it when the sample ran out!</li>
            <li>Not greasy or dry perfect.</li>
            <li>Works great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I use it before my BB Cream - my skin is hydrated, and it&#x27;s great for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It was also thoughtfully gift wraped.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and the sample size has lasted me a while.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased that there are no artificial dyes, as dyes sometimes irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received this moisturizer as a gift and at first, i was okay with it.</li>
            <li>Im fair with red undertones and semi-sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I actually have combination skin but have been having good results with it anyway.</li>
            <li>I will totally be buying more of this and using it forever!</li>
            <li>and I may save it for winter time, as hyaluronic acid moisturizers are definitely great for dry skin (more of a problem for me in the winter because I&#x27;m outside walking my dog a lot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A good day moisturizer, it&#x27;s nice and light, absorbs quickly into skin, and provides a nice base for foundation.</li>
            <li>Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>I found this product made my skin so soft and I love the way it feels on my face.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to see so many plant extracts because this is not a highly-fragranced product.</li>
            <li>I rarely ever leave a review for a product</li>
            <li>product is readily absorbed, not greasy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and you can feel the relief from it right away.</li>
            <li>Purlisse is hands down the best facial moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I really liked that it is a moisturizer with anti-aging qualities, it was just the right consistency - not too heavy, not too light.</li>
            <li>certainly will buy again!</li>
            <li>I really like that it does not feel oily thereby keeping my makeup fresh and not cakey.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy a full size since the texture is super light, it is a perfect base for setting loads of makeup on and is an all-day moiusturizer that goes so well with my naturally oily skin.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve used this moisturizer my face is super soft and no flakes at all.</li>
            <li>I use heavy moisturizers at night during the summer and light during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the product: This is a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have clear skin and rarely ever break out</li>
            <li>And I like that this company appreciated my business.</li>
            <li>Just watch out if you are sensitive to silicones because this contains a few (cyclopentasiloxane, dimethicone, cetyl dimethicone).nation skin but have been having good results with it anyway.</li>
            <li>I received this originally in my monthly ipsy bag as a sample to try and ultimately bought it here on amazon.  </li>
            <li>Normally I need additional product to feel hydrated</li>
            <li>my face looked normal.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels new.</li>
            <li>I have super uber sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to breakouts and really dry.</li>
            <li>I have never been a fan of moisturizing my face because of how sensitive my skin is.</li>
            <li>and this makes it so soft and moisturized</li>
            <li>Ipsy subscriber - and OH WOW.  </li>
            <li>You can put sunscreen and makeup on after using this with no trouble at all (I&#x27;ve been doing so for some time</li>
            <li>You can put sunscreen and makeup on after using this with no trouble at all (I&#x27;ve been doing so for some time</li>
            <li>However,  i started using this moisturizer daily when i ran out of my cetaphil and over time, i found that this product made my skin really really oily</li>
            <li>The winter is so rough on my skin, my face will get right feeling and itchy and as soon as I use Purlisse that feeling goes away</li>
            <li>My skin is usually pretty dry and flakey.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested in getting 4-5 beauty items to your door every month for only $10, use the following link &amp; check ipsy out!</li>
            <li>I have super duper sensitive skin which reacts to any little change.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with dry skin my whole life.</li>
            <li>like it enough to repurchase - but with all these full sized samples, that will be some time in the distant future!</li>
            <li>Since in started this beauty ritual my skin has not only been clear but is softer.</li>
            <li>I remember being a young teen when I met a woman who told me she was 36</li>
            <li>Needless to say, Ive tried every kind of moisturizer I could get my hands on</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fairly thick lotion (as facial moisturizers go) but spreads easily and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin sticky.</li>

            <li> I no long have dry patches on my face!</li>
            <li> I have tried various moisturizers and lotions and still have dry flaky skin.</li>

            <li> and it took a long period of time for my skin to absorb it.</li>
            <li> The cream goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It did not make my acne-prone skin break out, did not make me too oily or dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> ; and she said, &amp;#34;moisturize.&amp;#34; From then on I have moisturized every single day.</li>
            <li> A little truly goes such a long way.  </li>
            <li> If you subscribe to any of the beauty box programs that abound, I guarantee you&#x27;ve within the last few months</li>
            <li> A little will go a long way.</li>
            <li> A small dot is enough to cover face and neck.</li>
            <li> My eye are can be quite sensitive and in the past eye creams would dry out the delicate skin.</li>
            <li> If i could give this product half or even no star at all</li>
            <li> I use heavy moisturizers at night during the winter as well as in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I received the .5 oz size in my Ipsy bag a few months ago.</li>
            <li> Here are the ingredients, since they&#x27;re not currently available on the product page:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t comment usually.  </li>
            <li> I am in my late 30s and needed to start moisturizing at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my .5 oz bottle and used it every day for at least a month.  </li>
            <li> Finding a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin has been extremely difficult.</li>
            <li> but, it is way to expensive</li>

            <li> One of my most favorite moisturizers. Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Was nice until it stop working and I broke out with irritated skin</li>
            <li> Love this! Doesn&#x27;t get oilly!</li>
            <li> Works great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Purlisse is hands down the best facial moisturizer I have ever used. I have never been a fan of moisturizing my face because of how sensitive my skin is. I have clear skin and rarely ever break out but the only times I have was from using a moisturizer therefore I was very hesitant about trying this, but I am so glad I received a sample in my beauty box!! I am in love with this great moisturizer and will continue to use it from here on out. It&#x27;s not greasy and you can feel the relief from it right away. The winter is so rough on my skin, my face will get right feeling and itchy and as soon as I use Purlisse that feeling goes away and my skin feels new. Love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> i love this moisturizer! i bought it because i received a sample of it before and loved it... and it was now on sale for a good price.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s nice and light, smells great and is not oily! works great with my face composition!</li>
            <li> I discovered a sample-size purlisse in my May 2014 Ipsy glam bag &amp; I have fallen in love with this since then. I decided to buy a full size since the texture is super light, it is a perfect base for setting loads of makeup on and is an all-day moiusturizer that goes so well with my naturally oily skin. I recommend purlisee to everyone to try atleast once.</li>
            <li> I received a sample in my Ipsy subscription and am very impressed with the product. I am in my late 30s and needed to start moisturizing at night. I found this product made my skin so soft and I love the way it feels on my face. Will be reordering.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Received in my Ipsy Bag and just love it.  Had to order more.  I have dry, sensitive skin and this makes it so soft and moisturized and I don&#x27;t break out.  Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> I have super duper sensitive skin which reacts to any little change. Finding a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin has been extremely difficult. Until I found this. Great lightweight moisturizer and NO BREAKOUTS!!</li>
            <li> I remember being a young teen when I met a woman who told me she was 36 (she looked about 27). I asked her &amp;#34;how do you do it?&amp;#34; and she said, &amp;#34;moisturize.&amp;#34; From then on I have moisturized every single day. Im 25 now and man, am i glad i started then! Needless to say, Ive tried every kind of moisturizer I could get my hands on and this is one of my favorites!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About my skin: Im fair with red undertones and semi-sensitive skin. I use heavy moisturizers at night during the winter as well as in the mornings. I use heavy moisturizers at night during the summer and light during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the product: This is a light moisturizer. A little will go a long way. The smell isnt strong nor does it smell too much like an SPF which is wonderful! After I let it soak in a bit, it doesnt get oily and it plays well with just about all of my foundations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly will buy again!</li>
            <li> Got this in my ipsy bag &amp; I absolutely love it. Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used by far.

            <li> If you subscribe to any of the beauty box programs that abound, I guarantee you&#x27;ve within the last few months you&#x27;ve run into Purlisse. Whether you want to or not, you VILL try this moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, it&#x27;s a good experience. A good day moisturizer, it&#x27;s nice and light, absorbs quickly into skin, and provides a nice base for foundation. It also has a humectant that binds water to the skin, making it excellent for the Sahara of face (or in the winter.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it enough to repurchase - but with all these full sized samples, that will be some time in the distant future!</li>
            <li> I received a sample in my glam bag and fell in love with it. I have super uber sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to breakouts and really dry. Since in started this beauty ritual my skin has not only been clear but is softer. My face is not dry and flaky and it layers well under makeup. I will definitely be purchasing again. It was also thoughtfully gift wraped. And I like that this company appreciated my business.</li>
            <li> On time and in perfect shape, happy shopper. Product is awesome.</li>
            <li> I received this originally in my monthly ipsy bag as a sample to try and ultimately bought it here on amazon.  I really liked that it is a moisturizer with anti-aging qualities, it was just the right consistency - not too heavy, not too light. It did not make my acne-prone skin break out, did not make me too oily or dry out my skin.  Has virtually no smell.</li>
            <li> I received the .5 oz size in my Ipsy bag a few months ago. My skin is usually pretty dry and flakey. Since I&#x27;ve used this moisturizer my face is super soft and no flakes at all. It goes on so smooth and the sample size has lasted me a while. I will totally be buying more of this and using it forever!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t comment usually.  Another Ipsy subscriber - and OH WOW.  This moisturizer is AMAZING.  A little truly goes such a long way.  I&#x27;ve had my .5 oz bottle and used it every day for at least a month.  I use it before my BB Cream - my skin is hydrated, and it&#x27;s great for my sensitive skin.  TRY IT.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this. Hydrating, non-greasy. I no long have dry patches on my face!</li>
            <li> I have an over-abundance of Pur-Lisse because of beauty subscription boxes. I finally got around to trying it. It&#x27;s a very nice moisturizer. Here are the ingredients, since they&#x27;re not currently available on the product page:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water (Aqua), Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate, Dimethicone, Dicaprylyl Maleate, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, PEG-100 Stearate, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Tocopheryl Acetate, Hydrolyzed Lupine Protein Octenylsuccinate, Hydrolyzed Algae (Seasilk) Extract, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, White Tea Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Blue Lotus Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Butylene Glycol, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Aminomethyl Propanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Geraniol, Limonene, Lemon Peel Oil, Orange Oil, Bergamot Fruit Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Cymbopogon Martini Oil, Lime Oil, Juniperus Mexicana Oil, Tagetes Minuta Flower Oil, Michelia Alba Flower Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to see so many plant extracts because this is not a highly-fragranced product. I&#x27;m pleased that there are no artificial dyes, as dyes sometimes irritate my skin. This contains hyaluronic acid (as sodium hyaluronate), but according to the Pur-Lisse website, they don&#x27;t use animal-derived ingredients, so the hyaluronic acid must be from a bacterial source. (So basically, safe for vegans if that&#x27;s an issue.) Hyaluronic acid is a great moisturizer; it&#x27;s a polymer that holds onto a lot of water molecules in its chemical structure and is used in many anti-aging preparations. I have a couple more tubes of this and I may save it for winter time, as hyaluronic acid moisturizers are definitely great for dry skin (more of a problem for me in the winter because I&#x27;m outside walking my dog a lot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This says for normal to dry skin. I actually have combination skin but have been having good results with it anyway. It&#x27;s a fairly thick lotion (as facial moisturizers go) but spreads easily and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin sticky. You can put sunscreen and makeup on after using this with no trouble at all (I&#x27;ve been doing so for some time now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great moisturizer. Just watch out if you are sensitive to silicones because this contains a few (cyclopentasiloxane, dimethicone, cetyl dimethicone).nation skin but have been having good results with it anyway.

            <li> Great moisturizer! I sampled it with my Ipsy Glam bag, and loved it so much I had to order it when the sample ran out!</li>
            <li> one of the best moisturizers. my face is sensitive, dry, and acne prone. this stuff helps everything! I got it in an ipsy bag and once I ran out, I bought another one. its definately something I cant go without. try it!!</li>
            <li> For my combination skin, Purlisse is the best moisturizer I have come across to date. It&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and is perfect for morning and night use.</li>
            <li> I rarely ever leave a review for a product but i absolutely hated this product. I&#x27;ve received this moisturizer as a gift and at first, i was okay with it. i compared this moisturizers with my Cetaphil daily moisturizer and saw no difference, beside the price. However,  i started using this moisturizer daily when i ran out of my cetaphil and over time, i found that this product made my skin really really oily and it took a long period of time for my skin to absorb it. The oiliness of it also irritated my skin and as a result, my skin started to break out. If i could give this product half or even no star at all i would but i can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Felt great, loved the smell. Normally I need additional product to feel hydrated but I only needed this one. LOVED IT</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Purlisse. I first used this moisturizer when I received it in a Pop Sugar box a few years ago. I have been hooked since. One of the best moisturizers available! I also use it for an eye cream and it works wonder. My eye are can be quite sensitive and in the past eye creams would dry out the delicate skin. This has never cause an issue and smooths excellent. The cream goes a long way. A small dot is enough to cover face and neck.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with dry skin my whole life. I have tried various moisturizers and lotions and still have dry flaky skin. It looks like dandruff on my face. I have bought more expensive moisturizers and they burned.  This one is Heaven sent within a week my face looked normal. Not greasy or dry perfect. I will be ordering this product for life.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. One of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve ever used (though I do top it off with a sunscreen for daytime use).</li>
            <li> product is readily absorbed, not greasy but, it is way to expensive</li>
            <li> Nice, light moisturizer, no sticky residue. Great under foundation! I really like that it does not feel oily thereby keeping my makeup fresh and not cakey.</li>
