    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>These are awesome!  </li>
            <li>For me, this is the perfect soap!</li>
            <li>Wonderful fragrance, every time I use this.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I like the soap - great scent!</li>
            <li>This is excellent hand soap and the smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>The best part...</li>
            <li>EO products are wonderful.</li>
            <li>it has great refill options and the containers and plungers</li>
            <li>and the peppermint is a great smell.</li>
            <li>The product is really great - smells so good</li>
            <li>Cute bottle and smells wonderful</li>
            <li>Refreshing tea tree &amp; peppermint feels especially good for washing one&#x27;s face, but equally pleasant for hand-washing.</li>
            <li>EO makes great hand soaps with great scent, but I&#x27;m giving this a 3 star rating because their foaming hand soaps are so much better!</li>
            <li>Regardless, it smells to good to resist and I&#x27;m a product whoore</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a bit of a bulky design and doesn&#x27;t look good on the counter.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good soap, too.</li>
            <li>The smell is exquisite and the soap is non-drying, even when you wash your hands many many times a day.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this soap!</li>
            <li>Great smell and easy on the hands</li>
            <li>This lathers well, Smells great, and rinses easily.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use very much and it leaves a very pleasant smell without dryness.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;d recommend you try out the pumps to try out the soap, and if you like it, purchase the refill bottles and use your own pump.</li>
            <li>I found a bottle of this at a specialty store and tried it out because I liked the peppermint smell.  </li>
            <li>So its kind of a pain to use.</li>
            <li>Great soap with a great fragrance and no messy soap dish!</li>
            <li>for example, the Eucalyptus is lovely and warming in cooler weather, and the Tangerine Vanilla (I think it&#x27;s called) is nice in warmer weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love, love, love the smell of this soap!  </li>
            <li>The aroma of this soap is wonderful without being overpowering and it doesn&#x27;t take much to get you clean.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell of this soap and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li>Also, the pumps pump out WAY more soap than I need.</li>
            <li>Better than anything you&#x27;ll get at Trader Joes &amp; for 1/2 the price.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I prefer it much more than the fruity and flowery smells of some leading brands.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent of this soap and so doesn&#x27;t my family.  </li>
            <li>I love this EO Peppermint &amp; Tea Tree soap - I&#x27;ve used it for about 4 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I ended up buying more online.  </li>
            <li>Almost a spearmint feel to it; very cool and comforting.</li>
            <li>The packaging is elegant and it delivers a perfect portion of soap to wash with, so no excess waste.</li>
            <li>but I use it as a face wash and my skin is now blemish free with no irritation like most face wash products full of chemicals</li>
            <li>If you enjoy the breezy freezy smell of peppermint</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and smells terrific.</li>
            <li>I have fragrance allergies, and so I am always looking for something family and guests will enjoy that does not trigger my allergies.</li>
            <li>Many times we have given it as a gift and everyone commented on how much they love it.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t squirt out very much soap and then the top seems to get locked easily.</li>
            <li>This has a really pleasant scent, and does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li>This soap is lightly, vert pleasantly scented, and concentrated enough that you don&#x27;t require an abundance</li>
            <li>I love it so much!  </li>
            <li>It has a very soft/mild peppermint scent that I just love.  </li>
            <li>but really doesn&#x27;t do much more than that.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the product itself is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not only suitable for hands - I use it as my daily face wash, and it does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>product works good, smells good - one issue, 2 od 3 botlles were broken during shipping.</li>
            <li>, we have sensitive skin in our family and this is very easy on your skin.</li>
            <li>the blue color is kind of cool.  </li>
            <li>I know that tea tree oil has been used as a natural cleanser for hundreds of years, so I feel confident that I am killing all the bugs on my hands whenever I wash them.    </li>
            <li>Saw this in the men&#x27;s room at a local restaurant, and loved it so much I took a pic</li>
            <li>It has a very gentle peppermint scent.</li>
            <li>I was about to keep them for myself rather than give as gifts when my mom finally found a cleaner that took most of the marker off.</li>
            <li>Glad I subscribed to getting regular shipments that way</li>
            <li>Leaves your hands softly scented and clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>None of them left my skin in as good a condition as this EO Peppermint &amp; Tea Tree hand soap, so I went back to using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin (red hair freckles) and not only is this great hand wash</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this soap and my hands feel soft and clean after using it, plus it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>The 3 bottles of soap came with one top loose, so soap leaked in the package.</li>
            <li>Really unique &amp; much better than ordinary store-bought pump hand soap.</li>
            <li>It does not dry my skin out like many face washes do (even those that are marketed as being gentle on sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Potential for the packaging if the label weren&#x27;t so huge-</li>
            <li>I bought the huge bottle to refill the smaller pump bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who uses it loves it!</li>
            <li>it really isn&#x27;t drying.</li>
            <li>The bottle is also lovely with the deep blue color.  </li>
            <li>Its a miracle the top pumps didn&#x27;t break-off and make a mess.</li>
            <li>So what I wanted was a all natural soap that cleans very well and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands smelling like a perfume shop all day.</li>
            <li>I have tried some organic/natural soaps that don&#x27;t clean or dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it probably not good for you, but I it all gets washed into the environment which definitely isn&#x27;t good.    </li>
            <li>I guess everyone&#x27;s taste is different, because my family really doesn&#x27;t like the smell of this soap.  </li>
            <li>The soap is nice, but the dispensers seem to be broken or something.</li>
            <li>skin is pretty sensitive as well as breakout-prone, and is \\&quot;combination skin\\&quot; with an oily t-zone and \\&quot;normal\\&quot; cheeks (which become dry cheeks in the winter), but the EO Peppermint &amp; Tea Tree soap has not caused any adverse reactions to my skin.  </li>
            <li>few months ago, I wondered if my facial skin would do any better if I returned to using a liquid soap that was specifically branded as a \\&quot;face wash\\&quot;, so I tried several that were recommended by the customer reviewers on makeupalley, skinstore, sephora, and the like, as well as recommended by the skincare/cosmetics expert Paula Begoun on her beautypedia website.  </li>
            <li>, I love and regularly use a few varieties of the EO shower gels and bubble bath formulas (on my body skin only) --</li>
            <li>/&gt;FYI, most stores only carry a few of the items/\\&quot;flavors\\&quot; made by EO, but their entire range of products is described on (and sold via)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used similar soaps in the past that took ton of it to clean your hands</li>

            <li> This stuff is kind of expensive!</li>
            <li> I bought the 3-pack to give single soaps as gifts and they arrived in packages of 3 but the barcode on each had been marked through with a big black marker and the marker had smeared all around the label, not giving it the prettiest appearance.</li>
            <li> The shipping was a mess however - we bought 9 bottles and they basically threw them in a big back with about 15&amp;#34; of brown paper - why I don&#x27;t know as the paper did nothing and the bottle obviously flew all over inside the box during shipping.</li>
            <li> This soap has long been one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I have smell sensitivities to anything that is not natural or has chemical/perfume smell in it.  </li>
            <li> All the perfumes, \\&quot;anti-bacterial\\&quot; additives (regular soap is *already* anti-bacterial), and other stuff that I cannot recognize is in my soap.</li>
            <li> And they do not irritate, nor dry my hands.</li>
            <li> I often get dry hands after washing, but not with this soap.</li>
            <li> , this soap is quite sudsy, and one bottle lasts a long time (if you can get the hang of pressing down on the pump only partially, so just the amount you need comes</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if the tea tree oil in this product is killing any acne bacteria and therefore reducing facial breakouts, but I think it might be helping me a little in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and then you spent forever trying to rinse it off.</li>
            <li> No more shopping around for different flavors.  </li>
            <li> I plan to try other offerings as well...</li>
            <li> this is the soap to have in your bathroom, kitchen or any other place people wash hands.</li>
            <li> A soapy mess when we opened the amazon box.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this instead of the Nature&#x27;s Gate soap we usually buy, based on the Amazon reviews.  </li>
            <li> In addition, it has natural anti-bacterial agents, not the bad stuff that harms our streams and waterways after going through the sewer systems.  </li>
            <li> But the biggest issue is the scent is not great.</li>
            <li> Over the years, soap has gotten way too complicated.</li>
            <li> (This is my understanding; correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.)</li>
            <li> I know that it will help to use this product during cold and flu season because of the anti bacterial products of tea tree oil.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love the smell of this soap and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. I like the ingredients and all of that BUT the soap is semi-drying. Regardless, it smells to good to resist and I&#x27;m a product whoore so I woudl recommend this hand soap.</li>

            <li> Wonderful fragrance, every time I use this. Almost a spearmint feel to it; very cool and comforting. Refreshing tea tree &amp; peppermint feels especially good for washing one&#x27;s face, but equally pleasant for hand-washing. Really unique &amp; much better than ordinary store-bought pump hand soap. I only wish the bottles were larger; I&#x27;d recommend buying quantities of 6 at a time.</li>
            <li> I found a bottle of this at a specialty store and tried it out because I liked the peppermint smell.  The bottle is also lovely with the deep blue color.  I have ended up purchasing this soap in bulk I love it so much!  No more shopping around for different flavors.  Love this stuff.  I have it in every bathroom!</li>
            <li> This soap has long been one of my favorites. The smell is exquisite and the soap is non-drying, even when you wash your hands many many times a day.  I only give it 4/5 stars b/c I bought the 3-pack to give single soaps as gifts and they arrived in packages of 3 but the barcode on each had been marked through with a big black marker and the marker had smeared all around the label, not giving it the prettiest appearance. I was about to keep them for myself rather than give as gifts when my mom finally found a cleaner that took most of the marker off. Phew. Other than that, the product itself is great.</li>
            <li> I avoid all handsoaps that are so flowery, that you feel like your dipping yourself in a toxin or the smell lasts forever. This soap is lightly, vert pleasantly scented, and concentrated enough that you don&#x27;t require an abundance</li>
            <li> The 3 bottles of soap came with one top loose, so soap leaked in the package. Otherwise, I like the soap - great scent!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin (red hair freckles) and not only is this great hand wash but I use it as a face wash and my skin is now blemish free with no irritation like most face wash products full of chemicals</li>
            <li> I was looking for a hand soap that had peppermint in it.  This soap fills the order.  You don&#x27;t have to use very much and it leaves a very pleasant smell without dryness. I plan to try other offerings as well...</li>
            <li> Initially I had stumbled on this hand soap at a discount store.  I loved it so much I ended up buying more online.  It has a very soft/mild peppermint scent that I just love.  I prefer it much more than the fruity and flowery smells of some leading brands.  In addition, it has natural anti-bacterial agents, not the bad stuff that harms our streams and waterways after going through the sewer systems.  (This is my understanding; correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.)</li>
            <li> Leaves your hands softly scented and clean feeling.  I know that it will help to use this product during cold and flu season because of the anti bacterial products of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> The product is really great - smells so good - my kids keep washing their hands just to smell it!  The shipping was a mess however - we bought 9 bottles and they basically threw them in a big back with about 15&amp;#34; of brown paper - why I don&#x27;t know as the paper did nothing and the bottle obviously flew all over inside the box during shipping. Its a miracle the top pumps didn&#x27;t break-off and make a mess.</li>
            <li> The soap is nice, but the dispensers seem to be broken or something. They don&#x27;t squirt out very much soap and then the top seems to get locked easily. So its kind of a pain to use.</li>
            <li> This is excellent hand soap and the smell is wonderful. I bought the huge bottle to refill the smaller pump bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who uses it loves it!</li>
            <li> EO makes great hand soaps with great scent, but I&#x27;m giving this a 3 star rating because their foaming hand soaps are so much better!</li>
            <li> The aroma of this soap is wonderful without being overpowering and it doesn&#x27;t take much to get you clean. I&#x27;ve used similar soaps in the past that took ton of it to clean your hands and then you spent forever trying to rinse it off. Glad I subscribed to getting regular shipments that way I should never run out.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this soap and so doesn&#x27;t my family.  I have tried some organic/natural soaps that don&#x27;t clean or dry out my skin.  Not this one.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap! I decided to use a more organic product after a recent proposition passed requiring stores to post rather unsettling notices over the hand soap aisle warning customers that the commercial products contain chemicals known to cause cancer and birth defects. I love the smell of this soap and my hands feel soft and clean after using it, plus it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> This soap rocks. We initially purchased it at our local co-op when it was on sale. If you enjoy the breezy freezy smell of peppermint this is the soap to have in your bathroom, kitchen or any other place people wash hands. We have also used it in the shower. Many times we have given it as a gift and everyone commented on how much they love it. A couple of them now use it exculsively. The best part...it really isn&#x27;t drying. I use it on my face even in the height of winter dryness. Put it to the test against any commercial soap you can pick up at the local mega store or drugstore. We did and we keep settling back to it. The packaging is elegant and it delivers a perfect portion of soap to wash with, so no excess waste. PLUS it has great refill options and the containers and plungers have lasted well for us.</li>
            <li> I love this EO Peppermint &amp; Tea Tree soap - I&#x27;ve used it for about 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not only suitable for hands - I use it as my daily face wash, and it does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the tea tree oil in this product is killing any acne bacteria and therefore reducing facial breakouts, but I think it might be helping me a little in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago, I wondered if my facial skin would do any better if I returned to using a liquid soap that was specifically branded as a \\&quot;face wash\\&quot;, so I tried several that were recommended by the customer reviewers on makeupalley, skinstore, sephora, and the like, as well as recommended by the skincare/cosmetics expert Paula Begoun on her beautypedia website.  None of them left my skin in as good a condition as this EO Peppermint &amp; Tea Tree hand soap, so I went back to using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is pretty sensitive as well as breakout-prone, and is \\&quot;combination skin\\&quot; with an oily t-zone and \\&quot;normal\\&quot; cheeks (which become dry cheeks in the winter), but the EO Peppermint &amp; Tea Tree soap has not caused any adverse reactions to my skin.  It does not dry my skin out like many face washes do (even those that are marketed as being gentle on sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike some organic soaps, this soap is quite sudsy, and one bottle lasts a long time (if you can get the hang of pressing down on the pump only partially, so just the amount you need comes out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;Also, I love and regularly use a few varieties of the EO shower gels and bubble bath formulas (on my body skin only) -- for example, the Eucalyptus is lovely and warming in cooler weather, and the Tangerine Vanilla (I think it&#x27;s called) is nice in warmer weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I did not have a favorable impression of their hand / body lotions, though (too oily and didn&#x27;t absorb well for me), and their peppermint sanitizing spray caused a rash on the backs of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, most stores only carry a few of the items/\\&quot;flavors\\&quot; made by EO, but their entire range of products is described on (and sold via) the manufacturer&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> I like this hand soap a lot.  It has a very gentle peppermint scent. I&#x27;m thinking of giving it for Christmas gifts this year.</li>
            <li> Saw this in the men&#x27;s room at a local restaurant, and loved it so much I took a pic so I could buy some. I often get dry hands after washing, but not with this soap. It&#x27;s great and smells terrific.</li>
            <li> Great smell and easy on the hands, we have sensitive skin in our family and this is very easy on your skin. and the peppermint is a great smell.</li>
            <li> I have fragrance allergies, and so I am always looking for something family and guests will enjoy that does not trigger my allergies. This has a really pleasant scent, and does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love the smell of this soap!  I have smell sensitivities to anything that is not natural or has chemical/perfume smell in it.  This does not!  and it&#x27;s good soap, too.</li>
            <li> Cute bottle and smells wonderful but really doesn&#x27;t do much more than that. It&#x27;s not antibacterial so we can&#x27;t use it by the kitchen sink or in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> EO products are wonderful. This lathers well, Smells great, and rinses easily.</li>
            <li> Great soap with a great fragrance and no messy soap dish!</li>
