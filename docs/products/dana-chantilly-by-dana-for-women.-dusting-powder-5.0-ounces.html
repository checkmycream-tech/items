            <li>pretty enough to leave out.</li>
            <li>I love this bath powder and find it more difficult to locate at local stores.</li>
            <li>I guess this old fashioned lady will be seeking a new perfume and cologne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my mom&#x27;s favorite and so hard to find.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, feminine odor does not interfere with</li>
            <li>Not too heavy and not too light.  </li>
            <li>My 93 year old mother had requested this for Mother&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fragrance as much as her last purchase did five years ago.  </li>
            <li>I started using Chantilly products nearly 70 years ago.  </li>
            <li>I have been wearing &amp;#34;CHANTILLY&amp;#34; since I was 15 years of age, I am now 76 years old.</li>
            <li>so I was surprised to find it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Not too terribly expensive, and worth every penny and more.</li>
            <li>Over the time, I tried other fragrances, but rediscovered Chantilly a few  years ago when my own granddaughter told me she was using it.l  </li>
            <li>All I need is a boyfriend who will buy this for me in the future and my life will be complete!</li>

            <li> I liked the texture of this powder, but hated the smell.  </li>
            <li> She used to wear it when I was little</li>
            <li> /&gt;The powder puff always had a little piece of ribbon making it easier to pick up and hold.</li>
            <li> I even make little pockets of it and hang them in my closets.</li>
            <li> I would spray a little on in the morning and it would linger all day.  </li>
            <li> It is the only one that I can use over and over and never get tired of the smell of it.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that my original receiving date was not met, but after one short email, the problem was solved immediately.  </li>
            <li> It took a little longer than usual for it to arrive, but it came just as they said it would.  </li>
            <li> The fregrance was not as pronounced as I remember it in past purchases.</li>
            <li> even if it&#x27;s been around for years and getting hard to find.</li>

            <li> used this as a teen and am back to using it again</li>
            <li> Scent is lovely...new for me.  But the puffs in these boxed ones are always the &amp;#34;hairy&amp;#34; type.  I guess I like what you might call the old-fashioned type...plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I really like the powder. I have used it for years, and my store stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this powder and it seems harder and harder to find locally. Amazon is a life saver with great prices.</li>
            <li> The item was exactly as described. Once again I was able to fnd  an item on Amazon that I couldn&#x27;t find locally.</li>
            <li> Love Chantilly - have used for about 40 years-could not find for a few years.</li>
            <li> Just what my wife wanted</li>
            <li> Smells great, but found it cheaper at Walmart</li>
            <li> This is a great product that is getting harder and harder to find.. Still love the smell of Chantilly.  Use it every day.</li>
            <li> luv this powder, have for years</li>
            <li> This is something I wanted for a Christmas gift and it was priced the same as I could get at several other local stores but I found it very convenient to have it delivered right to my home.</li>
            <li> I love Chantilly.  It&#x27;s soft, feminine odor does not interfere with&lt;br /&gt;my perfume and frankly, I feel lovely when I use it.</li>
            <li> I love the gentle smell of this powder.  It reminds me of the love of my grandmother.  She used to wear it when I was little and it brings me such comfort to wear it now.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised.  All good.  Thanx.</li>
            <li> My wife really loves this product, and I really like the smell, so I always purchase it for her as a gift whenever she runs out.  It is always on the top, or near the top, of her wish list, and I am very happy to oblige.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Birthday gift for my Mom.  She used to wear this but now can&#x27;t find it in stores.</li>
            <li> My Mom&#x27;s second favorite.  Uses it daily.</li>
            <li> I have used Chantilly perfume off and on when I could find it, but had never seen the complementary dusting powder before. I love Chantilly Dusting Powder. It has a beautiful scent and it makes me feel so pampered after a shower or a bath. My skin feels  very soft when I use the powder and it makes me feel attractive, too. All I need is a boyfriend who will buy this for me in the future and my life will be complete!</li>
            <li> even if it&#x27;s been around for years and getting hard to find. Good for freshening up with its light scent. Thanks for carrying it.</li>
            <li> My Mom really liked it!  Glad it was offered.  And it smelled the way I remembered that it did-- very pleasant.</li>
            <li> always my favorite and it&#x27;s hard to find in stores. it smells so wonderful,I even use it between baths. Great&#x27;</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 different perfumed powders. This one is the best smelling - hands down. Box is very comfortable- easy to open. Most likely I will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> A very nice scent for powder.  Not too heavy and not too light.  I actually purchased 3 of these as I was already aware of how great this powder was from past use.  I would certainly buy this powder again (&amp; again &amp; again &amp; again).  I so love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this powder. It has a light beautiful smell that makes you feel pretty.  After bath powder that I never want to be out of.</li>
            <li> Woman, age 77.  LOVES IT!</li>
            <li> This was my Aunt&#x27;s signature fragrance, and also a favorite of mine.  I like to wear in the fall and winter months, especially around the holidays.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and recently ordered this from Amazon as I could not find it locally. I am very disappointed that the dusting powder puff tore up the first time I used it. I have been able to use a safety pin to hold it together but would like for Amazon to notify the company they need to do a better job.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that my original receiving date was not met, but after one short email, the problem was solved immediately.  As for the product itself.  I have used this before and it has become my favorite scent.  Yes, I absolutely love it.  Who would II recommend it to?  All my friends and family.  My all time favorite is Heaven Sent by Helena Rubenstein, but it is no longer available anywhere.</li>
            <li> My 93 year old mother had requested this for Mother&#x27;s Day. She had used it for years but hadn&#x27;t had it in recent years.  I was unable to locate this product in either PA or DE.  I tried all the drug stores, department stores and outlets.  When I finally checked on Amazon there it was.  You made my Mom a happy lady.  THANKS!</li>
            <li> The fregrance was not as pronounced as I remember it in past purchases.( Which I prefer)&lt;br /&gt;The powder puff always had a little piece of ribbon making it easier to pick up and hold.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is mild and not overpowering.  Delicate and smells expensive.  Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> comes in nice hard plastic case. pretty enough to leave out. scent is still a classic. nice powder puff inside too</li>
            <li> My Mom loves this powder.  The only thing she&#x27;s noticed is it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold it&#x27;s fragrance as much as her last purchase did five years ago.  Yes, it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ve turned into my grandmother because I love this stuff. Wonderful classic smell. Really does remind me of the elder ladies in my past.</li>
            <li> really disappointed zero smell .</li>
            <li> Love this powder!  Gave to four friends as gifts and they love it too.  Not too terribly expensive, and worth every penny and more.</li>
            <li> I just love this dusting powder.  Such a light, sweet feminine scent, and so pleasant after a shower.  It comes with a generous puff with a ribbon on the back that you can use to make application easier.  The container is pretty too, and looks very nice displayed in the bathroom.  Chantilly is truly a classic scent.  Would make a great gift for a lucky recipient.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This powder smells so good, and is like velvet on my skin.  I will purchase this again and again!  Thanks for a great transaction with fast shipping and prof. pkg.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for myself because I love chantilly.  I mix this with other unscented powder to make it last longer because it does cost.</li>
            <li> I have been using this powder for years.  It is the only one that I can use over and over and never get tired of the smell of it.  I even make little pockets of it and hang them in my closets.</li>
            <li> This package arrived within the given time frame and was exactly as described. I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> The powder was perfect but the perfume was not... At all.</li>
            <li> This is my very favorite bath powder and I had been looking to buy some locally, but no luck.  I checked Amazon, and there&lt;br /&gt;it was at a very reasonable price.  Will order more in the future for sure.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love, love, love!  Better priced than in the stores!</li>
            <li> This body powder is excellent for every day or evening wear.  The fragrance will go with almost any perfume because it is not over-bearing.  Also, the price was good, too.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.  I have been wearing Chantilly for years.  It has always been a light enough scent that did not provoke the allergies of my family; and I always received compliments on how good I smelled.  I would spray a little on in the morning and it would linger all day.  However, Chantilly used to be made by Houbigant; but is now being made by Dana.  While the scent is close, there is a great difference in the product.  While its odor is not offensive, it definitely is not the same product.  Further, the scent lasts for only minutes.  I guess this old fashioned lady will be seeking a new perfume and cologne.</li>
            <li> Its a really nice light smelling powder. Its not strong and its great for when you get out of the bath. The container it comes in is very pretty. Nice gift. The shipping was pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I have used this dusting powder for more years than I can count and it always leaves me feeling fresh and dry. It has a pleasing fragrance.</li>
            <li> Older ladies love it.  Gave as gift for Xmas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my mom&#x27;s favorite and so hard to find.  She was so surprised and happy to receive it.  I&#x27;m glad you had it for her.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for our oldest grand-daughter who adores the scent and feels so luxurious using it.</li>
            <li> The powder is nice, but the puff came apart after the third use.</li>
            <li> I liked the texture of this powder, but hated the smell.  It stunk like something that reminded me of moth balls.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> I started using Chantilly products nearly 70 years ago.  Over the time, I tried other fragrances, but rediscovered Chantilly a few  years ago when my own granddaughter told me she was using it.l  I don&#x27;t generally wear perfume or cologne, but I do enjoy using the Chantilly dusting powder.</li>
            <li> I have used Chantilly powder for many years. It is lightly scented. This is why I like this powder as I have allergies and I can tolerate this. I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Excellent bath powder!</li>
            <li> I was glad to find this.  It is a scent I always loved and just have not seen in powder form in a long time.</li>
            <li> My mom has been looking for this in stores for a while to no avail,  I found them on Amazon! She was very surprised when she opened her Christmas gifts.  Hard to find items in stores is easy when shopping with Amazon!</li>
            <li> I use mine after I apply the Chantilly Deodorant. The fragrance lift my spirits and begins my day in style.  Ease, comfortable, lovely scent, how could my day be anything but floating on a Chantilly Cloud.</li>
            <li> great product.  Like new</li>
            <li> I love this bath powder and find it more difficult to locate at local stores. Rapid shipment and good pricing.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing &amp;#34;CHANTILLY&amp;#34; since I was 15 years of age, I am now 76 years old. I always go back to Chantilly.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite bath powder.</li>
            <li> I have always thought the scent of Chantilly so sexy and feminine. One of my favorites. And I absolutely don&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;dressed&amp;#34; unless I use talc/bath powder after a shower. I&#x27;ve never been disappointed in Chantilly.</li>
            <li> Chantilly has always been a favorite bath powder.  It smells nice without being overpowering.  It comes in a pretty dusty pink plastic container with the power puff included.  Another nice item to give as a gift.  It is packaged very nicely.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.  Great scent.</li>
            <li> Chantilly has always been my favorite bath powder.  For several years I could not find this product in stores so I was surprised to find it through Amazon.  If you like a powder with a soft pleasant scent you will love this powder.  It took a little longer than usual for it to arrive, but it came just as they said it would.  I am happy with the purchase and plan to order from this company again.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister and she loves it.  It has a very nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> My bride has used this for years. great price and shipping.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments from people re: the fragrance after I have used this dusting powder, and I enjoy the silky feel of it as well.</li>
            <li> My grandma&#x27;s favorite scent.&lt;br /&gt;Great size and great price</li>
