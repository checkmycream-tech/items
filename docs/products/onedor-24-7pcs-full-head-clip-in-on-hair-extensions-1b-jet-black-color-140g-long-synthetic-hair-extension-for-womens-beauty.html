            <li>Great for night outs.</li>
            <li>Great extension for the one piece i got.</li>
            <li>and thickness is great.</li>
            <li>good quality.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my sister for her birthday she loved it</li>
            <li>Perfect timing and exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>The synthetic is really nice though.</li>
            <li>The price is great and they were delivered so fast.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m in love and the length</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>the hair got here quick !</li>
            <li>Hair is cheap n tangles a lot</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty good for synthetics , thank god I finally got them</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like real hair, it feels like really super smooth barbie hair.</li>
            <li>These are great if you have naturally thin hair like me, and the price is phenomenal for the quality.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s good for the amount you paid.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re  ok , I have typed thin hair so it looks good in a pony tail</li>
            <li>and they look like real hair!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really soft and I am happy with the color, of course it is black.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>But if I wanted to wear them to look real or natural, you&#x27;d need to buy 2 sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I have to say they were thin but good thing</li>
            <li>I have to dull the shine a bit to better blend in my hair</li>
            <li>shiny and soft .</li>
            <li>very unexpectedly early .</li>
            <li>With heat resistant synthetic, they can only stand so much.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look puffy like most extensions that are too thick.</li>
            <li>I mean, if you&#x27;re looking for some quality extensions, they&#x27;re gonna be more than 10 bucks.</li>
            <li>My daughter liked how easy to use the clips were but found the hair to be thin and hard to brush.</li>
            <li>The extensions are VERY thin, good for the look I was going for, the &amp;#34;Scene&amp;#34; look, fuller on top, thin on bottom.</li>

            <li> The hair is sorta thin (good for me because I have thin hair).</li>
            <li> But the thick one I had before I bought this one has maybe showed me I like this one because its not as puffy and large.</li>
            <li> They are EXTREMELY long, too.</li>
            <li> the hair was supper long .</li>
            <li> to her they were long preferably so i did trim them .</li>
            <li> And you can&#x27;t blow dry it.</li>
            <li> It says you&#x27;re allowed to add heat to it, but not much.</li>
            <li> There was less hair than I expected.</li>
            <li> &amp; actually quite thick .</li>
            <li> Like, down to my waist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little scared to straighten it.</li>
            <li> And not just a little.</li>
            <li> Perfectly thin enough</li>
            <li> I basically wasted money because I&#x27;m not able to wear them.</li>
            <li> The extensions were not at all as thick</li>
            <li> Never buying again total waste of money..:(</li>
            <li> They got nasty really quick  have to thrown them out</li>
            <li> and they are very thin....</li>
            <li> The hair comes out like crazy.</li>
            <li> Tangles SO BAD.. do not recommend.</li>

            <li> They&#x27;re  ok , I have typed thin hair so it looks good in a pony tail</li>
            <li> Okay, it&#x27;s not perfect. The hair is sorta thin (good for me because I have thin hair). It says you&#x27;re allowed to add heat to it, but not much. And you can&#x27;t blow dry it. They are EXTREMELY long, too. Like, down to my waist. So I like that. It doesn&#x27;t feel like real hair, it feels like really super smooth barbie hair. I&#x27;m a little scared to straighten it. Other than that, it&#x27;s good for the amount you paid. What was it, like 10 bucks. I mean, if you&#x27;re looking for some quality extensions, they&#x27;re gonna be more than 10 bucks. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have to say they were thin but good thing I read the reviews and bought two sets. They&#x27;re really soft and I am happy with the color, of course it is black. And if I need anymore I will be buying from Onedor again.</li>
            <li> Tangles SO BAD.. do not recommend.</li>
            <li> The extensions were not at all as thick I thought they would be. I basically wasted money because I&#x27;m not able to wear them.</li>
            <li> Crap..... They are not heat resistand and they are very thin.... Also the hair comes out a lot .... Never buying again total waste of money..:(</li>
            <li> good quality. fast shipping. would recommend. shiny and soft . can curl, braid, srtaighten, looks great any way. get a lot of compliments</li>
            <li> Works well. Great for night outs.</li>
            <li> My daughter liked how easy to use the clips were but found the hair to be thin and hard to brush.</li>
            <li> There was less hair than I expected. But the thick one I had before I bought this one has maybe showed me I like this one because its not as puffy and large. If you would like a fuller look maybe buy 2 of them.</li>
            <li> Great extension for the one piece i got. The description said 7 pieces and i only recieves one clip in extension. Not too impressed</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty good for synthetics , thank god I finally got them</li>
            <li> Bought it for my sister for her birthday she loved it</li>
            <li> The extensions are VERY thin, good for the look I was going for, the &amp;#34;Scene&amp;#34; look, fuller on top, thin on bottom. But if I wanted to wear them to look real or natural, you&#x27;d need to buy 2 sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they shed. I&#x27;m going to estimate that they last only 10-15 wears.</li>
            <li> They were just what I wanted. Perfectly thin enough and they look like real hair! It doesn&#x27;t look puffy like most extensions that are too thick. These are great if you have naturally thin hair like me, and the price is phenomenal for the quality. Great buy!</li>
            <li> the hair got here quick ! very unexpectedly early . perfect timing for my daughter to start school . the hair was supper long . &amp; actually quite thick . to her they were long preferably so i did trim them . but the look just like her hair . blends in well . no complaints , especially for the quality of 11$ ((:</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like them. The hair comes out like crazy. As soon as I opened them up the hair was already coming out of them. And not just a little. A bunch of hair. I don&#x27;t even use them.</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with these. The price is great and they were delivered so fast. Keep in mind that these are NOT human hair. The synthetic is really nice though. I haven&#x27;t tried heat styling yet but remember when you use heat to use low heat. With heat resistant synthetic, they can only stand so much. Anyway, I&#x27;m in love and the length and thickness is great. I have to dull the shine a bit to better blend in my hair but I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect timing and exactly what I ordered. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> They got nasty really quick  have to thrown them out</li>
            <li> Hair is cheap n tangles a lot</li>
