            <li>that&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li>I was given a jar to try and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I have since been trying to find a good moisturizer that does not have a greasy feel and that absorbs into the skin immediately.  </li>
            <li>If any of you readers have a good suggestion, I would appreciate the input.</li>
            <li>This cream is moisturizing and feels good</li>
            <li>I trust this brand, feel like good quality and a sigh of safety for skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it had good reviews and is cheaper than Olay.  </li>
            <li>5 times what this cost and this is every bit as good.</li>
            <li>It goes in so smoothly and is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Tried it for a good couple of weeks and had to stop.  </li>
            <li>Just as good as Olay&#x27;s scultpting cream which by the way is $10.</li>
            <li>Like that it contains no parabens and my face feels good when I put it on every morning.</li>
            <li>good on my face.</li>
            <li>This is fairly inexpensive and ffeels grest going on.  </li>
            <li>Good moisturizer for over 50.</li>

            <li>Good quality ingredients.  </li>

            <li>Replaces primer, and is good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>Have finished a jar and its good on my skin.</li>
            <li>Always a good product.  </li>
            <li>Eucerin cream might be a good product for wrinkles but not for those with acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>This has a really good rating and is a good price</li>
            <li>Feels good on your skin.</li>

            <li>I love Eucerin body lotion, so when I was looking at face creams on Amazon, I couldn&#x27;t get over the price, I figured if it didn&#x27;t work for me, that I wasn&#x27;t out mucho $$$, I am amazed with this cream!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell I have it on, but my face seems to love it!</li>

            <li>First of all, I would like to add that this product is excellent!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>It feels safe!</li>
            <li>Already ordered one more!</li>
            <li>I can tell the difference in my skin already - so glad I found this!  </li>
            <li>stock up on Amazon if you love it!</li>
            <li>The first day I used it, I was highly impressed as it really moisturized the wrinkles and provides an excellent shield.</li>
            <li>I brought it reading the review and worth it , as it worked very good on my skin and keeps it moisturised all teh time.</li>
            <li>because this isn&#x27;t amazing.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m always looking for an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a shot, and I can honestly say it&#x27;s working AMAZING.</li>
            <li>The price is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Feels nice on skin.see no difference of wrinkles at all.</li>
            <li>Nice creams for the wrinkles</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s sturdy and feels nice in your hand.</li>
            <li>(or maybe they&#x27;re just nice?).</li>
            <li>nice product.  </li>
            <li>This is a really nicely priced alternative.  </li>
            <li>Superb quality (my wife said that) and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>This cream is astounding, I use it after I wash my face and before makeup and even nighttime.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>It does provide nice moisture though.</li>
            <li>Loving this cream.</li>
            <li>Seems to work nicely.</li>
            <li>Kind of drying, not moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product that is not very expensive.  </li>
            <li>I had never used this item but wanted to try it and got a great bargain..arrived safe and sound</li>
            <li>But I am so glad I stumbled upon this lovely product!</li>
            <li>:  I use a q-tip to get it out of the jar--that way my fingers aren&#x27;t contaminating the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update December 2016:  Still the best cream that I have ever used for sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>This cream is a dream - there is no odor, it is excellent for sensitive skin (everything bothers my skin - except this)</li>
            <li>It is nice and creamy, and I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>, I won&#x27;t know how effective it is until I have more defined lines on my face</li>
            <li>I had been using Arbonne Nutrimin C Night Cream for years and liked it, but decided to ditch it mostly because I didn&#x27;t want to be using anything with retynol (Vit A).</li>
            <li>Also really excellent for sensitive skin--I have had no problems with it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good go&#x27;s on smooth.</li>
            <li>I noticed no reduction in my very fine lines and started to get acne on my forehead.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Also it make skin very smooth without using scrubs.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this and try it as I am always looking for a good &#x27;anti aging&#x27; skin cream and the reviews sounded great with a product that was very affordable to boot.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and it gives a lot of moisture to my skin w/o ever causing breakouts.</li>
            <li>MY make-up lasts longer when I use this under, better than a primer.</li>
            <li>I feel like I even get better sleep when I put it on than when I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>sure about the benefits of Q10.</li>
            <li>The price is fabulous, too!</li>
            <li>I used to love Q10 Skin Solutions</li>
            <li>I love this face cream and pray it is not discontinued.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>love this day time moisturizer and have recommended it to my sister and my daughter</li>
            <li>really love this cream</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off buying a glycolic acid cream and using emo oil as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>; with time Eucerin Q10 Will get to be one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always trying out different stuff to find the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried this.</li>
            <li>So my 3 star rating is not so much for the product but for what I experienced it myself using it.</li>
            <li>yes I will be buying more through amazon&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Like all of us~I have used many wrinkle creams.  </li>
            <li>I found this one to be one of the better ones.  </li>
            <li>Eucerin is our defacto brand for cosmetically safe face lotion.  </li>
            <li>Love this cream.</li>
            <li>After reading up on the ubiquinone/coenzyme Q10, it seems that it is mostly a protectant enzyme, guarding the skin against further damage, so that (along with excellent moisturizing) is what I hope this product will continue to deliver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>love this product line and this product</li>
            <li>It works as advertised, just wish I got a bit more for my buck.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion if the product is advertised as Anti-Wrinkle it ain&#x27;t going to work and more than likely&lt;</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream more than a month now</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>No product has ever been able to do this for me.</li>
            <li>and I wake up with a healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>and most people still think I&#x27;m an undergrad when I&#x27;m on campus at my university</li>
            <li>The packaging isn&#x27;t the most hygienic.</li>
            <li>Have had many compliments since using this cream on my face.</li>
            <li>This is too greasy for me,  People seem to love it but not for me.  </li>
            <li>What more could you want?</li>
            <li>Love this Eucerin cream .</li>
            <li>Love all Eucerin face products.</li>
            <li>Canada used to sell this product but no longer does, I love it and will be ordering more.  </li>

            <li>I use it as night creme, and I wake up with my face smooth and no irritation!  </li>
            <li>This is the only cream that does not burn and feels wonderful around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and at a great price.</li>
            <li>my skin feels much better after using it.</li>
            <li>rating this &#x27;okay&#x27;</li>

            <li>I love it and its now a staple for me.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use Eucerin products for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping I can use it more in winter when my skin is drier.</li>
            <li>I have too many skin problems</li>
            <li>so my skin demands more than</li>
            <li>Since I have familial eczema, my skin is dryer than most.</li>

            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>Leaves no greasy spots and works well to make skin feel more youthful.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the one of the best.  </li>
            <li>Great creme, really moisturizes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about the wrinkle thing, but I am 67 and have more than I had 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li>What more do you want?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK hence the 3 stars.  </li>
            <li>Also, my skin feels nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, really moisturizes.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use this more often that 2 times a week or else</li>

            <li>I am going to finish the container and will probably purchase something else unless I start to see better results.</li>
            <li>I will update my review at that time :)    </li>
            <li>I may purchase this product again to give it more time.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles</li>
            <li>so I may be able to attribute some of that to this though mostly to genetics.</li>

            <li>perfect for dry winter chapped skin!</li>
            <li>I will look for something that better targets my issues: redness, drying, acne, AND fine line control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And she used it from last Friday, and she said that it&#x27;s very good.   </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic cream which I applies at night on top of my favourite vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li>and so far I am happy.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to find this at my local grocery store any more, so  I was happy to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect and even arrived way quicker than expected.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer for sensitive skin for before bed and under my makeup in the morning.</li>
            <li>and really just feels good on my face.</li>
            <li>She was also delighted to know that it is very inexpensive and can be found in drugstores and even Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>Will have to keep searching  for a good reasonable face moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Good, reasonably priced night cream.  </li>
            <li>Moisturizing but not greasy with mostly ingredients that have a familiar name.</li>
            <li>Very good quality, light weight enough for day wear.</li>
            <li>This cream is amazing, it&#x27;s rich without being super greasy and has vitamins (A, C, E), no oils, no parabens</li>
            <li>Bought for my girlfriend, got the package very quickly.  </li>
            <li>this stuff works noticeably well and very quickly.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer blends easily, without being too greasy.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs easily.</li>
            <li>Prefer olay 7 effects - much drier, more effective.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li>I am glad this product is so cheap because it is superior to other creams that I have paid much more money for!  </li>
            <li>I think the fine lines are softening as well.</li>
            <li>no change in wrinkles (fine lines or medium depth wrinkles) after 1 month of use</li>
            <li>Smooth applying, light, absorbs easily.</li>
            <li>This absorbed for me real good, I must be really dry!</li>
            <li>Also some fragrance free creams smell like oil to me</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and makes my skin so supple</li>
            <li>I have never had an adverse reaction to this cream which is excellent because my skin is so sensitive that most products cause it to break out or turn red.  </li>
            <li>Still have the final verdict out but am reasonably happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>A nice moisturizer, but I don&#x27;t really see any effect on wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly onto a cleansed and toned skin.</li>
            <li>The amount of product in the container is quite generous as well, so overall this is a great value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is light and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>I have used a great product (AOK from Germany) for last 40 years, but they no longer make it.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to find the product because I could not find it at my local stores.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, light scent, and skin feels  moisturized.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning my skin feels smooth.</li>
            <li>It is light and smooth and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Once, when I was having blood drawn, the hospital technician asked me what I used on my skin as she found it to be smooth and glowing.  </li>
            <li>, fragrance free</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect amount of moisture, it&#x27;s not too heavy.</li>
            <li>Also, an sunscnreen would make this more useful.</li>
            <li>but otherwise it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>Would not recommend to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a moisturizer that feels light on their skin.</li>
            <li>It feels light weight on skin too.</li>
            <li>My pores have shrunk in size, face is smooth and supple, and it stays moisturized throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I feel lightly uplift my skin all day.</li>
            <li>This cream works great for me, especially during these winter months.</li>
            <li>She liked this product so much that I decided to buy one for myself as well.</li>
            <li>I have a fair complexion and seem to have an adverse reaction to many beauty products,  especially those with perfumes and dyes.  </li>
            <li>Reasonable cost for such great results!</li>
            <li>Good for sensitive skin and the moisturizing lasts.</li>
            <li>It is really good for sensitive skin and isn&#x27;t too greasy.  </li>
            <li>I have also tried bottles of whatever is supposedly good housekeeping&#x27;s best and those failed miserably--not-to-mention they often have toxic ingredients in them.</li>
            <li>If you are a woman of color with sensitive skin in need of good moisturizer, try this one and you won&#x27;t regret.  </li>
            <li>Just kidding, but hey it makes my face feel smooth and fresh!</li>
            <li>and I am satisfied, easy to apply and very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Rich and creamy without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE Amazon and am on a first name basis with my UPS lady</li>
            <li>The consistency is rich and buttery and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich but non-greasy.</li>
            <li>This creeam is so rich and nourishing to skin.</li>
            <li>I would love to buy this in bulk in case they ever discontinue it (which has happened far too many times).</li>
            <li>Eucerin Sensitive Facial Skin Cream is perfect worn under make-up or after washing your face before bedtime.  </li>
            <li>This is easily solved by meticulous usage of fresh cotton swaps to remove the desired amount of product.</li>
            <li>Awesome thick cream, leaves your skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Light, not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>My skin type is normal to dry, and this is perfect for that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very mild and seeps into the skin right away.  </li>
            <li>what a great product ,my skin feels very soft ,and it doesn&#x27;t  bother my  very sensitive  skin  </li>
            <li>Pretty good so far.</li>
            <li>but this product is by far amazing</li>
            <li>My tried and true.</li>
            <li>I love how gentle this face cream is.</li>
            <li>Nice to have anti-wrinkle cream that is for sensitive skin and is fragrance-free.</li>
            <li>It is thick and creamy and it makes your face feel wonderful.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Where I think this cream is good, it doesn&#x27;t last throughout the day.   </li>
            <li>Found this at my local grocery store, looking for a good face cream.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good facial care cream for winter.  </li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>Best moisturizer I have used for sensitive, dry flaky skin that is prone to acne.</li>
            <li>Awesome for my sensitive skin, dry, oily, getting wrinkles but have pimples sometimes too, skin!</li>
            <li>All aside, the item arrived quickly and it is always a breeze ordering from here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the most expensive of creams, and who ever thought one so inexpensive could be so perfect.</li>
            <li>Matter of a fact if wrinkles are all you have got, be glad there are so many ills and deseases to confront you as you make this short journey in your life, just be yourself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m lucky in that I&#x27;ve been using moisturizers since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>Non-greesey, absorbs quickly, and almost matte finish.</li>
            <li>I am using this container quickly.</li>
            <li>I have tried night creams that are A LOT more expensive than this Eucerin Q10, but none impressed me like this one!!  </li>
            <li>SO glad to be able to get it from Amazon since I can;t find it locally</li>
            <li>I have super oily skin,i believe this product causes clogged pores which leads to the breakouts,i suggest you avoid if you have oily skin,i will continue to use this product of my neck and chest to get rid of it.</li>
            <li>I have mild acne problem</li>
            <li>My order was processed rapidly and service with Amazon was very good as usual.  </li>
            <li>I told her I had used Eucerin Q10 daily for about a month and was very pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li>I use this creme right before my foundation and it gives my foundation just the right amount of hydration to go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It is absorbed quickly into the skin, so it is not sticky or tacky at all.  </li>
            <li>I certainly can&#x27;t wear it during the day, but at night it works just fine.</li>
            <li>I have been told that I looked very young for my age for so many friends.</li>
            <li>Love it, skin is so soft !</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I need!</li>
            <li>Better to start young and prevent the wrinkles than to tackle them when they&#x27;re already there!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty picky!</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it for spot treatment under my eyes and on some of my fine lines until i run out, but not for my whole face.</li>
            <li>did not see much difference, but it&#x27;s light</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s impressively cheap, it moisturizes really well</li>
            <li>I love the texture, it immediately leaves my skin hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t use it and hope it useful.</li>
            <li>so my face feel fresh.</li>
            <li>I love that this is for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for like 3-4 days now, but I can honestly see a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended it since I am allergic and sensitive to most products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think if you normal, dry, combo skin that is not acne prone, this cream will work great for you.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also glad to see that Eucerin has taken the toxic parabens out of this skin cream, most of their other moisturizers are still loaded with them.</li>
            <li>This is the best cream that I&#x27;ve tried by far for my dry, sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my sis because she has sensitive skin and most anti aging products irritate her skin, but Eucerin is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin at all.</li>
            <li>put this right IN my eye--and still no irritation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of using many different lotions, so I&#x27;m unlikely to buy this again, as it&#x27;s neither an ideal night nor day lotion, even if it is a great value and a solid product.</li>
            <li>However, for those of us with very sensitive eyes and eyelids, I strongly recommend this product for every day moisturizing of that area of the skin.</li>
            <li>Great for dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Eucerin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Creme is one of the only cremes that I am able to use as I am allergic to so many things.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for my sensitive skin, and I can really tell a difference after just a few weeks of using it.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s best suited to those with dry skin OR for those of us who get dry skin largely during the fall/winter.</li>
            <li>A nice balance between a light moisturizer and a heavy cream.</li>
            <li>I have found my new &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; product and am looking forward to buying the Eucerin cleanser as well!!!</li>
            <li>yes i like it very much</li>
            <li>It feels moisture rich, but at the same time is feels light after application.</li>
            <li>However, so far I have not noticed any reduction in fine lines....</li>
            <li>No weird smell and I like the jar.</li>
            <li>This is going help prevent them from ever surfacing in the first place .</li>
            <li>Pretty luxurious for the price.</li>
            <li>No break outs and my skin is pretty fickle.</li>
            <li>First, the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li>Great thick cream, helps for forehead area</li>
            <li>comfortable to sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I felt after first use how my skin is getting nourished and softer in the morning.</li>
            <li>The thick texture makes it a great neck</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;JAR&amp;#34; packaging is very unsanitary!  </li>
            <li>Glad I can order online when necessary.</li>
            <li>Tried for the first time this cream</li>
            <li>Funny how that works huh???</li>
            <li>I did break out when I first used this</li>
            <li>Something to let you know that you are no longer seeing exact items from your search.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this creme and use it daily.</li>
            <li>But it does have a greasy feeling to it when i first put it on.  </li>
            <li>But i&#x27;m willing to get over that because it works well.</li>
            <li>She loved it so much that she did not go back to her old moisturizer and took mine when she went home for Christmas break.</li>
            <li>My skin used to be much more oily but as I&#x27;ve gotten older, it&#x27;s more to normal to dry in some spots.</li>
            <li>Also worked great with my daughter&#x27;s redness from dry facial skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it does not have any odor, fragrance free without any odd scents.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had a single problem, and it&#x27;s great for short term moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on the face, and moisturize the right way.</li>
            <li>I have to say that it stands up against the higher priced brands out there, and I have certainly tried many of these over the last 10 years.</li>
            <li>Friendly to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It has soften the many age lines, not so dry looking, and my skin looks more younger.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a pretty good moisturizer and in the process it does soften the skin a bit for a while and makes it appear a small amount healthier I guess</li>
            <li>About my skin: sensitive (will burn and itch with many products), very reactive (I&#x27;ll get acne at the drop of a hat), my skin is combination and runs drier in the winter (or rather, it&#x27;s probably normal in the winter) and VERY oily in the summer&lt;</li>
            <li>i say, i have acne prone skin and as i am getting older noticing wrinkles, this product i have been using for a month now and has helped clear out my cne and my fine lines are deminshing..</li>
            <li>It is what I expected, I am happy with it, wish there come in a bigger size, thanks.</li>
            <li>Love this gives moisture all day long.</li>
            <li>I am past 60 and my skin has never looked this good.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for good quality night creme since the past couple of years.  </li>
            <li>She also has sensitive skin and is super picky with her moisturizers too.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend this cream as I&#x27;ve tried absolutely everything out there to no avail until I gave it one more shot, and bought this.</li>
            <li>my large pores give me problems.  </li>
            <li>but this creme is my new favorite facial skin care product.  </li>
            <li>This is one of very few skin cremes on the market that I can use because I have allergic reaction to most skin products, even many purportedly made for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start by saying I have very sensitive skin, and this did not bother me, so that&#x27;s definitely a positive!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find an affordable face moisturizer that also has a good EWG rating.</li>
            <li>My skin type is sensitive acne prone with deep acne scars and very large pores that are easily clogged.  </li>
            <li>but now realize it just takes about thirty minutes for my skin to really absorb it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t decide how much I want to use this or if it works for me.</li>
            <li>I have used this cream for years, and I look younger than most of my friends, people are always surprised at my real age.</li>
            <li>I really think this cream has a lot to do with how my skin looks.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend both!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>Plus, it is reasonably priced and can be put on the automatic mailing system..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soothing to my parched skin.</li>
            <li>I have a greasy skin, so I don&#x27;t like to put that much.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>My wife says she loves this cream, it moisturizes the skin very well.</li>
            <li>I apply it nightly and wake up with a very moisturized face.</li>
            <li>More greasy than I expected.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li>They are absolutely the same--packaging and product itself.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its very moisturizing, and leaves your skin feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t break me out, and it&#x27;s very calming on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes very well without being greasy even though I am oily myself.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing abilities: from October-April my skin needs as much moisture as it can get.</li>
            <li>Gentle</li>
            <li>This is a very moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li>and since I didn&#x27;t notice much difference (if any), I stopped using them.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth and silky and dare I say younger?</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait to review it until I had really given it a chance.</li>
            <li>I use it at night and my skin feels very moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read that in reviews, but didn&#x27;t realize I had so much skin irritation until it was gone via this product.</li>
            <li>No irritating fragrances.</li>
            <li>It is a very &amp;#34;affordable&amp;#34; drug store</li>
            <li>and I feel like it really does reduce wrinkles</li>
            <li>When I run out I can really tell the difference.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for my combination skin in the cold of winter.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on my face</li>
            <li>Been using this for  6 weeks and haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a difference.</li>
            <li>No idea if it&#x27;s really preventing wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years and will continue to use it for its gentle hydrating, non irrtating, non-greasy,  moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very emollient.  </li>
            <li>I specifically searched for under eye cream and this product is what I ended up ordering (Yes I know its my fault for not reading more carefully, thus why the product gets the 5 stars).</li>
            <li>Really like it - I use it at night</li>
            <li>Will smooth lines with regular use.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and the product works like a charm.</li>
            <li>EXTREMELY sensitive skin (i.e. rarely wear makeup, can&#x27;t use any type of SPF-containing products, etc.).  </li>
            <li>Did I mention it is much easier on the pockets than say Elizabeth Arden?</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hydrating and lasts until the morning.</li>
            <li>Do not see much improvement for the dryness on my skin.</li>
            <li>Also I received my package fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Eucerin for several years, old friends can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m not showing more wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too heavy for use in the summer (not really a con, as the moisturizing properties are what make it ideal the rest of the year)</li>
            <li>The ingredients in this cream is a lot better than most of the drug store creams that contains parabens, fragrances and irritating</li>
            <li>Inexpensive light &amp; no harsh on my sensitive</li>
            <li>I am in my thirties and loved finding a cream that does seem to slow the aging process.</li>
            <li>It is also relatively thick and feels really good on your skin at night.</li>
            <li>Rich, odorless, tasteless, feels great on my skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good, simple moisturizer and it doesn&#x27;t contain toxic ingredients like a lot of other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>30 y/o, Caucasian fair skin, combination with oily T-zone, tendency to have dry patches on cheeks, and red undertones, very sensitive to new products, easily breaks out in response to topical oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I just got very very interested in taking care of my sensitive skin with proper product and after revewing so many different product</li>
            <li>I have very mild acne, oily skin that can dry out in some places.</li>
            <li>My skin is much smoother, healthier and my complexion (once riddled with dark spots) is more even now.  </li>
            <li>I like this cream very much and it agrees with my sensitive skin😊</li>
            <li>This is soft and creamy and very gentle.</li>
            <li>If the fine lines have diminished, it is very minor.</li>
            <li>Within a couple of days my pretty much clear (and I am</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about Q10 or if it may actually counteract the other two product, but so far so good...</li>
            <li>I use it mostly as an eye cream and it has been really helping diminish those little eye creases that arrived around my 30th bday.</li>
            <li>Feels like new Skin!  </li>
            <li>It is more refined looking and softer, with less visible pores.</li>
            <li>I apply it on my face, neck and upper chest after showering while my skin is still damp and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>My face is left feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I could feel my skin tightening particularly around the eyes.</li>
            <li>I put more on and it took a couple extra minutes to sink in because I still had last nights on.</li>
            <li>Definitely improves appearance of face making skin look healthy and younger.  </li>
            <li>Not sure that I look any younger, but it does feel nice!</li>
            <li>Goes on thick but feels good and gets face soft</li>
            <li>,so i stopped using the other products,and tested this product on certain areas on my face only,and sure enough those exact spots had the new abrasions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, but I&#x27;m hoping this will prevent them from coming!</li>
            <li>Thanks, Eucerin, for a product that TRULY is for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this moisturizer fulfills !</li>
            <li>Creamy texture is just right for my face--not too heavy nor too light.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I used to work at a high end spa</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and this product doesn&#x27;t irritate it like so many other products do.  </li>
            <li>A little greasy but ok.</li>
            <li>One lasts for a little more than three months for me.  </li>
            <li>This is a very affordable product &amp; works well on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would help but so far it hasn&#x27;t done much.</li>
            <li>Not sure how much coQ 10 they put in, but I have been using for 6 months and skin is noticably better.</li>
            <li>I finally ran out several days ago and this is the first time I&#x27;ve witnessed its true effects.</li>
            <li>Diesnt do miracles but makes skin looks much better in a few uses</li>
            <li>Wrinkles are part of the normal aging process</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry skin and must moisturize twice daily or more often.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not oily, as your skin sops it right up.</li>
            <li>Eucerin Q10 is very easy to use, only one step to the whole face, not like other facial products, sometimes it takes 5 steps to cover the whole face.  </li>
            <li>cheaper than a new wife.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a few days and already I feel as though I won&#x27;t have as many wrinkles in old age as I otherwise would have.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, I swear this has helped with my hormonal adult acne, as it seems to calm my skin.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t roll off like some night creams, keeps my mature skin fresh and dewy until the next day.</li>
            <li>(I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>however i have very oily,sensitive skin that can easily get a small break out.</li>
            <li>Has worked well so far and hasn&#x27;t made me break out!</li>
            <li>I have been a big fan of Eucerin daily protection lotion SPF30 for many years and decided to try their facial creme.</li>
            <li>For truly sensitive skin (allergic to all fragrance, Balsam of Peru, gluten, dairy, etc), this cream is a life saver!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Finally, a product that does exactly what it advertises.  </li>
            <li>I am only on my first jar of the anti-wrinkle cream</li>
            <li>Not sure what all the hype is about; I like the feel and weight of the product, but it doesn&#x27;t do much for even light wrinkles.</li>
            <li>This goes on smoothly, but is a pretty thick cream, so if you&#x27;re looking for something lightweight, try another product.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin, even as a adult, and this hasn&#x27;t caused any flare-ups or sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>I think it slowly helps with fine lines even around my eyes (it may work as well as my Boots 7 eye cream)!</li>
            <li>It actually does what it claims and has made my 70-year old skin much more pliable and less wrinkled.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accept that that the fine wrinkles were very slightly diminished, but the announced &#x27;sensitivity&#x27; advertisements about not making irritations or comedones is complete LIES!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only rating it 4 because I have no high hopes for actually working on real wrinkles, maybe fine lines.</li>
            <li>However, I do notice when my skin is super dry in the winter months, my wrinkles were accentuated, therefore, my goal is to look for facial creams that can alleviate my super dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have mature, fair skin of Irish descent that tends to dry out in the harsh winters we experience here in the Northeast.  </li>
            <li>Has a light vanilla ordor, just need a little.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice much difference in fine lines or wrinkles, but I&#x27;ve only been using it a few weeks.</li>
            <li>less in quality than the original version</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t clear the redness like some folks said.</li>
            <li>It leave my skin soft, but never oily, and it does not clog my pores - all at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Bought it on Amazon and has been wonderfully surprised, The cream keep my skin reasonably moist , therefore prevented worsening of wrinkles and saved me money at the same time.</li>
            <li>My face feels soft and looks quite radiant after about one week of use.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The whole jar it last me about 4months...</li>
            <li>As far as the anti-wrinkle properties I wouldn&#x27;t say it works miracles with all wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>So I decided to try this product that is similar and quite reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and some products burn my face.  </li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This creme actually works very well</li>
            <li>Sensitive skin here</li>
            <li>Helps hold in moisture at night for soft skin.</li>
            <li>As far as the anti-wrinkle claim, I haven&#x27;t seen any changes so far.</li>
            <li>It works well for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I am 67 years old and have always taken care of my complexion and skin.  </li>
            <li>I figure, if this stuff is gentle and works, why pay for a second product?&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>This AM my face was sooo soft.</li>
            <li>but I like it so far.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for the second time, I am using it as a night cream, don&#x27;t see the wrinkles disappearing, but my skin is much softer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This creme is soft and creamy.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I checked the ingredients and it&#x27;s mostly natural stuff, like cocoabutter.</li>
            <li>My eyes are extremely sensitive, so I use this for under eye cream day and night.</li>
            <li>As a 37 year old woman I need to find a moisturizer that wasn&#x27;t greasy, but moisturized and helped with my oncoming wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Having sensitive skin a lot of products make me break out.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and supple from this product.</li>
            <li>I really doubt it will end up in the discards pile until the last morsel has been used on your skin.</li>
            <li>I am a 34-year-old woman with sensitive skin that is breakout prone, and I&#x27;ve not had any problems with my skin since using this moisturizer (going on 5 years now).</li>
            <li>My eyes are particularly sensitive.  </li>
            <li>No complaints thus far.</li>
            <li>I have Rosacea and thought that meant I could never use an anti-aging product because it would irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This cream works well for my sensitive skin after showers.</li>
            <li>This is for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>and I need the sensitive skin type.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wake up with the greasy feeling on my face; it feels soft and moistened -</li>
            <li>As far as the wrinkle reducing power, we&#x27;ll have to see.</li>
            <li>I ordered 5-6 sensitive skin cream in a month.</li>
            <li>I am so surprised.  </li>
            <li>I developed a rash.</li>
            <li>I happen to have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Allergy prone and sensitive skins tend not to do well with added fragrance.).</li>
            <li>Always leaves my face soft with no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I swear it keeps my young.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and just use it as a nighttime moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and loved it but was unable to find it in the store when I ran out.  </li>
            <li>I just love this cream it is not too thick or too watery</li>
            <li>Makes my facial skin look younger since it&#x27;s not reacting to chemicals and parfum in most other creams.</li>
            <li>I use it in place of far more expensive, but not more effective, night creams.</li>
            <li>The BHA and the retinol are pretty heavy hitters and if I use other creams on top of them, my skin will burn and turn red and my eyes sting an water</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still getting older and no tub of cream is going to turn back the hands of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have several glabella wrinkles, and multiple horizontal wrinkles on my forehead, and these have stayed exactly the same.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started using this cream at night only and have noticed more of a difference than I ever have from any product I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>My skin still peels during the day and T-zone produces too much oil because my skin is dry, despite that I have this thick cream sitting on top of my face.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>Well, i don&#x27;t know too much about Cosmetics, only know that this brand is German brand, maybe will buy again in future, thanks.</li>
            <li>It works really well for my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing for dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this creme feels upon application as well as all day long.  </li>
            <li>something more expensive, something more gimmicky.</li>
            <li>Overall, if you normal skin like me, you might want to seek out a lighter moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I increased my washing and toner regimen for a couple of days after I quit using the product and my skin is back to normal.</li>
            <li>After buying all these products for several years now I see the deal is as companies must look at the results under a \\&quot;ULTRA POWERFUL beam electron microscope\\&quot; to measure any actual results and what WE GET can&#x27;t be seen with the naked eye.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t kind it in regular drug stores.</li>
            <li>so my skin is already looking pretty rough.</li>
            <li>The reason why I don&#x27;t think this is an unbelievably great face creme like other reviewers is because it&#x27;s very thick and does not provide enough hydration for my face.  </li>
            <li>My skin is also very dry, and this is a nice thick, unscented cream that moisturizes without leaving a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>The new version is different ..</li>
            <li>It adds much needed moisture to my increasingly dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Eucerin Sensitive Facial Skin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Creme, 1.7-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li>Eucerin Sensitive Facial Skin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Creme, 1.7 Ounces]]  </li>
            <li>She had me write down the name and said she was going to go right out and buy some.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, and it certainly helps with dryness.</li>
            <li>Better late than never!</li>
            <li>Different from the old version!</li>
            <li>In the past, Shisedo was my only choice but the price tag is getting higher and higher.</li>
            <li>It is a shame that a lot of people people waste their money in more expensive brands at the department stores, which is a rip off, and they miss the chance to find a lot better products at a local pharmacy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lazy and just use clean hands.</li>
            <li>I am very young but spent too much time in the sun as a teen</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through a whole bunch of moisturizers trying to find one that would keep my face hydrated without causing too much oil and shine in some areas and dry and flakiness in other areas of my face.</li>
            <li>1.I wash my face daily with the sensitive soap from clinique.  </li>
            <li>Not knocking this as a skin crème, especially for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 70 years old and look 10 to 20 years younger.</li>
            <li>This product makes my facial skin soft and moist looking.</li>
            <li>I especially like its sensitive skin feature.</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely sensitive with red spots and this cream doesn&#x27;t help to relief that like it&#x27;s advertised.</li>
            <li>Sensitive skin all my life and finally something that works and doesn&#x27;t irriate me.</li>
            <li>I noticed some smoothing of my skin, but rapidly developed  inflammatory reddened skin and had to discontinue... close but not enough.</li>
            <li>This is my second jar of eucerin Q10 sensitive cream.  </li>
            <li>As far as a wrinkle remover, I give it a bit of a lower ranking for me personally.</li>
            <li>is thick and &amp;#34;creamy,&amp;#34; but sort of light in texture.</li>
            <li>It is pretty thick so does not take much.</li>
            <li>I like this - not too expensive, goes on nicely, and does seem to keep my face looking a bit &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It is thick and I was worried, as I have super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a hot mess.</li>
            <li>My skin is a little sensitive, especially near the eyes and this product has caused no problems at all.</li>
            <li>It is also great as an under eye cream if you mix it with a little water to make it less thick.  </li>
            <li>my only complaint is I prefer a light feeling lotion on my face.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month every day--in the mornings under foundation, and at night after cleansing, exfoliation, toner, serum and ampoule.&lt;br /&gt;Right after ordering the product on Amazon, I realized that I actually had zero cream left, and went out to Walgreens and purchased a jar of this stuff in store, thinking I could give the Amazon one to my husband if I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>but I have dry and very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I started washing my face, and after using this I&#x27;ve had positive line decrease and it seems my face is less breakout prone.</li>
            <li>So many eye creams claim they are for sensitive skin, but 90% of them still cause my eyes to be red, puffy and tired all day long.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know if it will help the ever-increasing number of expression/sleep lines, but since my skin over the past year has moved from oily to more dry -</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take long to sink in, and if I touch my face hours later, it still feels very soft.  </li>
            <li>The first few times I applied it</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate</li>
            <li>I will probably try to repurpose the jar for something; just not sure what as of right now.</li>
            <li>I have Rosacea, dry, irritated sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My cheeks are quite dry and sensitive but this product fights both those problems.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something moisturizing for my dry and sensitive skin, but this just seems to sit on my skin and not soak into it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for a few months and the outcome is positive.  </li>
            <li>I am a guy in my late 20&#x27;s with super sensitive combination skin: oily on my forehead, dry at my eyelids and upper lip.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry and sensitive skin, which always leaves me trying different skin cremes.</li>
            <li>My cheeks are red, sensitive, dry and peels a lot.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and plumps up tired old skin to improve appearance.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say that I have seen much of a difference except for maybe a little bit of improvement.</li>
            <li>, i figured it must be the other new product cleansers and toners i was using</li>
            <li>I have very dry flaky red sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>it is very well priced, and you only need a a little bit.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that after applying, this product is very soothing to my exfoliated skin and tones down redness or pinkness!</li>
            <li>No flaking due to harsh chemicals, smoother, more supple skin, and less redness.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It leaves my skin feeling wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love Eucerin products!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> However, once I received this product, it was amazing!!</li>
            <li> It is very good for your wallet.    </li>

            <li> But as for any long-lasting properties, I feel good nutrition works the best.</li>
            <li> excellent product at a good price</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this after I had a chemical peel, so I figured if it was good after that, it would be good anytime!!  </li>
            <li> I do not detect a scent which is great because I can&#x27;t stand perfumed face cream.  </li>
            <li> and I must say I have seen a great improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> but my face feels great in the morning.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in my skin but felt great.</li>

            <li> The cream is great</li>
            <li> So, I feel somewhat qualified to say this is great.</li>
            <li> This works great as wrinkle cream and just lotion.</li>

            <li> that&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> I was given a jar to try and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I have since been trying to find a good moisturizer that does not have a greasy feel and that absorbs into the skin immediately.  </li>
            <li> If any of you readers have a good suggestion, I would appreciate the input.</li>
            <li> This cream is moisturizing and feels good</li>
            <li> I trust this brand, feel like good quality and a sigh of safety for skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it had good reviews and is cheaper than Olay.  </li>
            <li> 5 times what this cost and this is every bit as good.</li>
            <li> It goes in so smoothly and is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Tried it for a good couple of weeks and had to stop.  </li>
            <li> Just as good as Olay&#x27;s scultpting cream which by the way is $10.</li>
            <li> Like that it contains no parabens and my face feels good when I put it on every morning.</li>
            <li> good on my face.</li>
            <li> This is fairly inexpensive and ffeels grest going on.  </li>

            <li> Have finished a jar and its good on my skin.</li>
            <li> Always a good product.  </li>
            <li> Eucerin cream might be a good product for wrinkles but not for those with acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> This has a really good rating and is a good price</li>
            <li> Feels good on your skin.</li>

            <li> I love Eucerin body lotion, so when I was looking at face creams on Amazon, I couldn&#x27;t get over the price, I figured if it didn&#x27;t work for me, that I wasn&#x27;t out mucho $$$, I am amazed with this cream!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell I have it on, but my face seems to love it!</li>

            <li> stock up on Amazon if you love it!</li>
            <li> The first day I used it, I was highly impressed as it really moisturized the wrinkles and provides an excellent shield.</li>
            <li> I brought it reading the review and worth it , as it worked very good on my skin and keeps it moisturised all teh time.</li>
            <li> because this isn&#x27;t amazing.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m always looking for an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a shot, and I can honestly say it&#x27;s working AMAZING.</li>
            <li> The price is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Feels nice on skin.see no difference of wrinkles at all.</li>
            <li> Nice creams for the wrinkles</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s sturdy and feels nice in your hand.</li>
            <li> (or maybe they&#x27;re just nice?).</li>
            <li> nice product.  </li>
            <li> This is a really nicely priced alternative.  </li>
            <li> Superb quality (my wife said that) and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This cream is astounding, I use it after I wash my face and before makeup and even nighttime.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> It does provide nice moisture though.</li>
            <li> Loving this cream.</li>
            <li> Seems to work nicely.</li>
            <li> Kind of drying, not moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that is not very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I had never used this item but wanted to try it and got a great bargain..arrived safe and sound</li>
            <li> But I am so glad I stumbled upon this lovely product!</li>
            <li> :  I use a q-tip to get it out of the jar--that way my fingers aren&#x27;t contaminating the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update December 2016:  Still the best cream that I have ever used for sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> This cream is a dream - there is no odor, it is excellent for sensitive skin (everything bothers my skin - except this)</li>
            <li> It is nice and creamy, and I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> , I won&#x27;t know how effective it is until I have more defined lines on my face</li>
            <li> I had been using Arbonne Nutrimin C Night Cream for years and liked it, but decided to ditch it mostly because I didn&#x27;t want to be using anything with retynol (Vit A).</li>
            <li> Also really excellent for sensitive skin--I have had no problems with it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> good go&#x27;s on smooth.</li>
            <li> I noticed no reduction in my very fine lines and started to get acne on my forehead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Also it make skin very smooth without using scrubs.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this and try it as I am always looking for a good &#x27;anti aging&#x27; skin cream and the reviews sounded great with a product that was very affordable to boot.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff and it gives a lot of moisture to my skin w/o ever causing breakouts.</li>
            <li> MY make-up lasts longer when I use this under, better than a primer.</li>
            <li> I feel like I even get better sleep when I put it on than when I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> sure about the benefits of Q10.</li>
            <li> The price is fabulous, too!</li>
            <li> I used to love Q10 Skin Solutions</li>
            <li> I love this face cream and pray it is not discontinued.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> love this day time moisturizer and have recommended it to my sister and my daughter</li>
            <li> really love this cream</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off buying a glycolic acid cream and using emo oil as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> ; with time Eucerin Q10 Will get to be one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always trying out different stuff to find the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried this.</li>
            <li> So my 3 star rating is not so much for the product but for what I experienced it myself using it.</li>
            <li> yes I will be buying more through amazon&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Like all of us~I have used many wrinkle creams.  </li>
            <li> I found this one to be one of the better ones.  </li>
            <li> Eucerin is our defacto brand for cosmetically safe face lotion.  </li>
            <li> Love this cream.</li>
            <li> After reading up on the ubiquinone/coenzyme Q10, it seems that it is mostly a protectant enzyme, guarding the skin against further damage, so that (along with excellent moisturizing) is what I hope this product will continue to deliver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> love this product line and this product</li>
            <li> It works as advertised, just wish I got a bit more for my buck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion if the product is advertised as Anti-Wrinkle it ain&#x27;t going to work and more than likely&lt;</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream more than a month now</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> No product has ever been able to do this for me.</li>
            <li> and I wake up with a healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> and most people still think I&#x27;m an undergrad when I&#x27;m on campus at my university</li>
            <li> The packaging isn&#x27;t the most hygienic.</li>
            <li> Have had many compliments since using this cream on my face.</li>
            <li> This is too greasy for me,  People seem to love it but not for me.  </li>
            <li> What more could you want?</li>
            <li> Love this Eucerin cream .</li>
            <li> Love all Eucerin face products.</li>

            <li> This is the only cream that does not burn and feels wonderful around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and at a great price.</li>
            <li> my skin feels much better after using it.</li>

            <li> I will continue to use Eucerin products for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping I can use it more in winter when my skin is drier.</li>
            <li> I have too many skin problems</li>
            <li> so my skin demands more than</li>
            <li> Since I have familial eczema, my skin is dryer than most.</li>

            <li> What more can I say?</li>
            <li> Leaves no greasy spots and works well to make skin feel more youthful.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the one of the best.  </li>
            <li> Great creme, really moisturizes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the wrinkle thing, but I am 67 and have more than I had 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li> What more do you want?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK hence the 3 stars.  </li>
            <li> Also, my skin feels nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, really moisturizes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this more often that 2 times a week or else</li>

            <li> I am going to finish the container and will probably purchase something else unless I start to see better results.</li>
            <li> I will update my review at that time :)    </li>
            <li> I may purchase this product again to give it more time.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles</li>
            <li> so I may be able to attribute some of that to this though mostly to genetics.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I found this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet, but I like how my face has a healthy glow.  </li>

            <li> Odor free, absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> love the way it feels and doesnt leave my face greasy</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands and none have compared.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> Love that it has no scent.</li>
            <li> so cannot tell if it is good defense against wrinkles, but I discontinued use on my face as it felt too greasy and does not seem to absorb right away.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to use this cream.  </li>
            <li> Very rich and creamy.  </li>
            <li> This is a very rich creme.  </li>
            <li> The cream is very rich and buttery.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> I ordered this one on Amazon because of all the high ratings and great reviews.</li>
            <li> This product keeps the skin fairly moist and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Grease free, light, light smell, good all-day moisture.</li>
            <li> good seller, good facial cream</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this cream and the price is right!</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> even great on my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> perfect for dry winter chapped skin!</li>
            <li> I will look for something that better targets my issues: redness, drying, acne, AND fine line control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And she used it from last Friday, and she said that it&#x27;s very good.   </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic cream which I applies at night on top of my favourite vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li> and so far I am happy.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to find this at my local grocery store any more, so  I was happy to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect and even arrived way quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> In the meantime, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer for sensitive skin for before bed and under my makeup in the morning.</li>
            <li> and really just feels good on my face.</li>
            <li> She was also delighted to know that it is very inexpensive and can be found in drugstores and even Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> Will have to keep searching  for a good reasonable face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Good, reasonably priced night cream.  </li>
            <li> Moisturizing but not greasy with mostly ingredients that have a familiar name.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, light weight enough for day wear.</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing, it&#x27;s rich without being super greasy and has vitamins (A, C, E), no oils, no parabens</li>
            <li> Bought for my girlfriend, got the package very quickly.  </li>
            <li> this stuff works noticeably well and very quickly.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer blends easily, without being too greasy.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs easily.</li>
            <li> Prefer olay 7 effects - much drier, more effective.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> I am glad this product is so cheap because it is superior to other creams that I have paid much more money for!  </li>
            <li> I think the fine lines are softening as well.</li>
            <li> no change in wrinkles (fine lines or medium depth wrinkles) after 1 month of use</li>
            <li> Smooth applying, light, absorbs easily.</li>
            <li> This absorbed for me real good, I must be really dry!</li>
            <li> Also some fragrance free creams smell like oil to me</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and makes my skin so supple</li>
            <li> I have never had an adverse reaction to this cream which is excellent because my skin is so sensitive that most products cause it to break out or turn red.  </li>
            <li> Still have the final verdict out but am reasonably happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> A nice moisturizer, but I don&#x27;t really see any effect on wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly onto a cleansed and toned skin.</li>
            <li> The amount of product in the container is quite generous as well, so overall this is a great value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is light and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have used a great product (AOK from Germany) for last 40 years, but they no longer make it.  </li>
            <li> I am happy to find the product because I could not find it at my local stores.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, light scent, and skin feels  moisturized.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning my skin feels smooth.</li>
            <li> It is light and smooth and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Once, when I was having blood drawn, the hospital technician asked me what I used on my skin as she found it to be smooth and glowing.  </li>
            <li> , fragrance free</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect amount of moisture, it&#x27;s not too heavy.</li>
            <li> Also, an sunscnreen would make this more useful.</li>
            <li> but otherwise it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a moisturizer that feels light on their skin.</li>
            <li> It feels light weight on skin too.</li>
            <li> My pores have shrunk in size, face is smooth and supple, and it stays moisturized throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I feel lightly uplift my skin all day.</li>
            <li> This cream works great for me, especially during these winter months.</li>
            <li> She liked this product so much that I decided to buy one for myself as well.</li>
            <li> I have a fair complexion and seem to have an adverse reaction to many beauty products,  especially those with perfumes and dyes.  </li>
            <li> Reasonable cost for such great results!</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive skin and the moisturizing lasts.</li>
            <li> It is really good for sensitive skin and isn&#x27;t too greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have also tried bottles of whatever is supposedly good housekeeping&#x27;s best and those failed miserably--not-to-mention they often have toxic ingredients in them.</li>
            <li> If you are a woman of color with sensitive skin in need of good moisturizer, try this one and you won&#x27;t regret.  </li>
            <li> Just kidding, but hey it makes my face feel smooth and fresh!</li>
            <li> and I am satisfied, easy to apply and very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rich and creamy without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE Amazon and am on a first name basis with my UPS lady</li>
            <li> The consistency is rich and buttery and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rich but non-greasy.</li>
            <li> This creeam is so rich and nourishing to skin.</li>
            <li> I would love to buy this in bulk in case they ever discontinue it (which has happened far too many times).</li>
            <li> Eucerin Sensitive Facial Skin Cream is perfect worn under make-up or after washing your face before bedtime.  </li>
            <li> This is easily solved by meticulous usage of fresh cotton swaps to remove the desired amount of product.</li>
            <li> Awesome thick cream, leaves your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Light, not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> My skin type is normal to dry, and this is perfect for that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very mild and seeps into the skin right away.  </li>
            <li> what a great product ,my skin feels very soft ,and it doesn&#x27;t  bother my  very sensitive  skin  </li>
            <li> Pretty good so far.</li>
            <li> but this product is by far amazing</li>
            <li> My tried and true.</li>
            <li> I love how gentle this face cream is.</li>
            <li> Nice to have anti-wrinkle cream that is for sensitive skin and is fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> It is thick and creamy and it makes your face feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Where I think this cream is good, it doesn&#x27;t last throughout the day.   </li>
            <li> Found this at my local grocery store, looking for a good face cream.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good facial care cream for winter.  </li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I have used for sensitive, dry flaky skin that is prone to acne.</li>
            <li> Awesome for my sensitive skin, dry, oily, getting wrinkles but have pimples sometimes too, skin!</li>
            <li> All aside, the item arrived quickly and it is always a breeze ordering from here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the most expensive of creams, and who ever thought one so inexpensive could be so perfect.</li>
            <li> Matter of a fact if wrinkles are all you have got, be glad there are so many ills and deseases to confront you as you make this short journey in your life, just be yourself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m lucky in that I&#x27;ve been using moisturizers since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> Non-greesey, absorbs quickly, and almost matte finish.</li>
            <li> I am using this container quickly.</li>
            <li> I have tried night creams that are A LOT more expensive than this Eucerin Q10, but none impressed me like this one!!  </li>
            <li> SO glad to be able to get it from Amazon since I can;t find it locally</li>
            <li> I have super oily skin,i believe this product causes clogged pores which leads to the breakouts,i suggest you avoid if you have oily skin,i will continue to use this product of my neck and chest to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> I have mild acne problem</li>
            <li> My order was processed rapidly and service with Amazon was very good as usual.  </li>
            <li> I told her I had used Eucerin Q10 daily for about a month and was very pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li> I use this creme right before my foundation and it gives my foundation just the right amount of hydration to go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> It is absorbed quickly into the skin, so it is not sticky or tacky at all.  </li>
            <li> I certainly can&#x27;t wear it during the day, but at night it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I have been told that I looked very young for my age for so many friends.</li>
            <li> Love it, skin is so soft !</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I need!</li>
            <li> Better to start young and prevent the wrinkles than to tackle them when they&#x27;re already there!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pretty picky!</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it for spot treatment under my eyes and on some of my fine lines until i run out, but not for my whole face.</li>
            <li> did not see much difference, but it&#x27;s light</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impressively cheap, it moisturizes really well</li>
            <li> I love the texture, it immediately leaves my skin hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use it and hope it useful.</li>
            <li> so my face feel fresh.</li>
            <li> I love that this is for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for like 3-4 days now, but I can honestly see a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended it since I am allergic and sensitive to most products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think if you normal, dry, combo skin that is not acne prone, this cream will work great for you.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also glad to see that Eucerin has taken the toxic parabens out of this skin cream, most of their other moisturizers are still loaded with them.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream that I&#x27;ve tried by far for my dry, sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my sis because she has sensitive skin and most anti aging products irritate her skin, but Eucerin is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin at all.</li>
            <li> put this right IN my eye--and still no irritation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of using many different lotions, so I&#x27;m unlikely to buy this again, as it&#x27;s neither an ideal night nor day lotion, even if it is a great value and a solid product.</li>
            <li> However, for those of us with very sensitive eyes and eyelids, I strongly recommend this product for every day moisturizing of that area of the skin.</li>
            <li> Great for dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Eucerin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Creme is one of the only cremes that I am able to use as I am allergic to so many things.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for my sensitive skin, and I can really tell a difference after just a few weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s best suited to those with dry skin OR for those of us who get dry skin largely during the fall/winter.</li>
            <li> A nice balance between a light moisturizer and a heavy cream.</li>
            <li> I have found my new &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; product and am looking forward to buying the Eucerin cleanser as well!!!</li>
            <li> yes i like it very much</li>
            <li> It feels moisture rich, but at the same time is feels light after application.</li>
            <li> However, so far I have not noticed any reduction in fine lines....</li>
            <li> No weird smell and I like the jar.</li>
            <li> This is going help prevent them from ever surfacing in the first place .</li>
            <li> Pretty luxurious for the price.</li>
            <li> No break outs and my skin is pretty fickle.</li>
            <li> First, the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> Great thick cream, helps for forehead area</li>
            <li> comfortable to sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I felt after first use how my skin is getting nourished and softer in the morning.</li>
            <li> The thick texture makes it a great neck</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;JAR&amp;#34; packaging is very unsanitary!  </li>
            <li> Glad I can order online when necessary.</li>
            <li> Tried for the first time this cream</li>
            <li> Funny how that works huh???</li>
            <li> I did break out when I first used this</li>
            <li> Something to let you know that you are no longer seeing exact items from your search.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this creme and use it daily.</li>
            <li> But it does have a greasy feeling to it when i first put it on.  </li>
            <li> But i&#x27;m willing to get over that because it works well.</li>
            <li> She loved it so much that she did not go back to her old moisturizer and took mine when she went home for Christmas break.</li>
            <li> My skin used to be much more oily but as I&#x27;ve gotten older, it&#x27;s more to normal to dry in some spots.</li>
            <li> Also worked great with my daughter&#x27;s redness from dry facial skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it does not have any odor, fragrance free without any odd scents.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a single problem, and it&#x27;s great for short term moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on the face, and moisturize the right way.</li>
            <li> I have to say that it stands up against the higher priced brands out there, and I have certainly tried many of these over the last 10 years.</li>
            <li> Friendly to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It has soften the many age lines, not so dry looking, and my skin looks more younger.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a pretty good moisturizer and in the process it does soften the skin a bit for a while and makes it appear a small amount healthier I guess</li>
            <li> About my skin: sensitive (will burn and itch with many products), very reactive (I&#x27;ll get acne at the drop of a hat), my skin is combination and runs drier in the winter (or rather, it&#x27;s probably normal in the winter) and VERY oily in the summer&lt;</li>
            <li> i say, i have acne prone skin and as i am getting older noticing wrinkles, this product i have been using for a month now and has helped clear out my cne and my fine lines are deminshing..</li>
            <li> It is what I expected, I am happy with it, wish there come in a bigger size, thanks.</li>
            <li> Love this gives moisture all day long.</li>
            <li> I am past 60 and my skin has never looked this good.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for good quality night creme since the past couple of years.  </li>
            <li> She also has sensitive skin and is super picky with her moisturizers too.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend this cream as I&#x27;ve tried absolutely everything out there to no avail until I gave it one more shot, and bought this.</li>
            <li> my large pores give me problems.  </li>
            <li> but this creme is my new favorite facial skin care product.  </li>
            <li> This is one of very few skin cremes on the market that I can use because I have allergic reaction to most skin products, even many purportedly made for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I have very sensitive skin, and this did not bother me, so that&#x27;s definitely a positive!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find an affordable face moisturizer that also has a good EWG rating.</li>
            <li> My skin type is sensitive acne prone with deep acne scars and very large pores that are easily clogged.  </li>
            <li> but now realize it just takes about thirty minutes for my skin to really absorb it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t decide how much I want to use this or if it works for me.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for years, and I look younger than most of my friends, people are always surprised at my real age.</li>
            <li> I really think this cream has a lot to do with how my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend both!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> Plus, it is reasonably priced and can be put on the automatic mailing system..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soothing to my parched skin.</li>
            <li> I have a greasy skin, so I don&#x27;t like to put that much.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> My wife says she loves this cream, it moisturizes the skin very well.</li>
            <li> I apply it nightly and wake up with a very moisturized face.</li>
            <li> More greasy than I expected.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li> They are absolutely the same--packaging and product itself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its very moisturizing, and leaves your skin feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t break me out, and it&#x27;s very calming on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes very well without being greasy even though I am oily myself.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing abilities: from October-April my skin needs as much moisture as it can get.</li>
            <li> Gentle</li>
            <li> This is a very moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li> and since I didn&#x27;t notice much difference (if any), I stopped using them.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth and silky and dare I say younger?</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait to review it until I had really given it a chance.</li>
            <li> I use it at night and my skin feels very moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read that in reviews, but didn&#x27;t realize I had so much skin irritation until it was gone via this product.</li>
            <li> No irritating fragrances.</li>
            <li> It is a very &amp;#34;affordable&amp;#34; drug store</li>
            <li> and I feel like it really does reduce wrinkles</li>
            <li> When I run out I can really tell the difference.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for my combination skin in the cold of winter.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on my face</li>
            <li> Been using this for  6 weeks and haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a difference.</li>
            <li> No idea if it&#x27;s really preventing wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and will continue to use it for its gentle hydrating, non irrtating, non-greasy,  moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very emollient.  </li>
            <li> I specifically searched for under eye cream and this product is what I ended up ordering (Yes I know its my fault for not reading more carefully, thus why the product gets the 5 stars).</li>
            <li> Really like it - I use it at night</li>
            <li> Will smooth lines with regular use.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and the product works like a charm.</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY sensitive skin (i.e. rarely wear makeup, can&#x27;t use any type of SPF-containing products, etc.).  </li>
            <li> Did I mention it is much easier on the pockets than say Elizabeth Arden?</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hydrating and lasts until the morning.</li>
            <li> Do not see much improvement for the dryness on my skin.</li>
            <li> Also I received my package fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Eucerin for several years, old friends can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m not showing more wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too heavy for use in the summer (not really a con, as the moisturizing properties are what make it ideal the rest of the year)</li>
            <li> The ingredients in this cream is a lot better than most of the drug store creams that contains parabens, fragrances and irritating</li>
            <li> Inexpensive light &amp; no harsh on my sensitive</li>
            <li> I am in my thirties and loved finding a cream that does seem to slow the aging process.</li>
            <li> It is also relatively thick and feels really good on your skin at night.</li>
            <li> Rich, odorless, tasteless, feels great on my skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good, simple moisturizer and it doesn&#x27;t contain toxic ingredients like a lot of other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> 30 y/o, Caucasian fair skin, combination with oily T-zone, tendency to have dry patches on cheeks, and red undertones, very sensitive to new products, easily breaks out in response to topical oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I just got very very interested in taking care of my sensitive skin with proper product and after revewing so many different product</li>
            <li> I have very mild acne, oily skin that can dry out in some places.</li>
            <li> My skin is much smoother, healthier and my complexion (once riddled with dark spots) is more even now.  </li>
            <li> I like this cream very much and it agrees with my sensitive skin😊</li>
            <li> This is soft and creamy and very gentle.</li>
            <li> If the fine lines have diminished, it is very minor.</li>
            <li> Within a couple of days my pretty much clear (and I am</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about Q10 or if it may actually counteract the other two product, but so far so good...</li>
            <li> I use it mostly as an eye cream and it has been really helping diminish those little eye creases that arrived around my 30th bday.</li>
            <li> Feels like new Skin!  </li>
            <li> It is more refined looking and softer, with less visible pores.</li>
            <li> I apply it on my face, neck and upper chest after showering while my skin is still damp and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> My face is left feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I could feel my skin tightening particularly around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I put more on and it took a couple extra minutes to sink in because I still had last nights on.</li>
            <li> Definitely improves appearance of face making skin look healthy and younger.  </li>
            <li> Not sure that I look any younger, but it does feel nice!</li>
            <li> Goes on thick but feels good and gets face soft</li>
            <li> ,so i stopped using the other products,and tested this product on certain areas on my face only,and sure enough those exact spots had the new abrasions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, but I&#x27;m hoping this will prevent them from coming!</li>
            <li> Thanks, Eucerin, for a product that TRULY is for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this moisturizer fulfills !</li>
            <li> Creamy texture is just right for my face--not too heavy nor too light.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I used to work at a high end spa</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and this product doesn&#x27;t irritate it like so many other products do.  </li>
            <li> A little greasy but ok.</li>
            <li> One lasts for a little more than three months for me.  </li>
            <li> This is a very affordable product &amp; works well on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would help but so far it hasn&#x27;t done much.</li>
            <li> Not sure how much coQ 10 they put in, but I have been using for 6 months and skin is noticably better.</li>
            <li> I finally ran out several days ago and this is the first time I&#x27;ve witnessed its true effects.</li>
            <li> Diesnt do miracles but makes skin looks much better in a few uses</li>
            <li> Wrinkles are part of the normal aging process</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and must moisturize twice daily or more often.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not oily, as your skin sops it right up.</li>
            <li> Eucerin Q10 is very easy to use, only one step to the whole face, not like other facial products, sometimes it takes 5 steps to cover the whole face.  </li>
            <li> cheaper than a new wife.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few days and already I feel as though I won&#x27;t have as many wrinkles in old age as I otherwise would have.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, I swear this has helped with my hormonal adult acne, as it seems to calm my skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t roll off like some night creams, keeps my mature skin fresh and dewy until the next day.</li>
            <li> (I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> however i have very oily,sensitive skin that can easily get a small break out.</li>
            <li> Has worked well so far and hasn&#x27;t made me break out!</li>
            <li> I have been a big fan of Eucerin daily protection lotion SPF30 for many years and decided to try their facial creme.</li>
            <li> For truly sensitive skin (allergic to all fragrance, Balsam of Peru, gluten, dairy, etc), this cream is a life saver!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Finally, a product that does exactly what it advertises.  </li>
            <li> I am only on my first jar of the anti-wrinkle cream</li>
            <li> Not sure what all the hype is about; I like the feel and weight of the product, but it doesn&#x27;t do much for even light wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This goes on smoothly, but is a pretty thick cream, so if you&#x27;re looking for something lightweight, try another product.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin, even as a adult, and this hasn&#x27;t caused any flare-ups or sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> I think it slowly helps with fine lines even around my eyes (it may work as well as my Boots 7 eye cream)!</li>
            <li> It actually does what it claims and has made my 70-year old skin much more pliable and less wrinkled.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accept that that the fine wrinkles were very slightly diminished, but the announced &#x27;sensitivity&#x27; advertisements about not making irritations or comedones is complete LIES!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only rating it 4 because I have no high hopes for actually working on real wrinkles, maybe fine lines.</li>
            <li> However, I do notice when my skin is super dry in the winter months, my wrinkles were accentuated, therefore, my goal is to look for facial creams that can alleviate my super dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have mature, fair skin of Irish descent that tends to dry out in the harsh winters we experience here in the Northeast.  </li>
            <li> Has a light vanilla ordor, just need a little.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice much difference in fine lines or wrinkles, but I&#x27;ve only been using it a few weeks.</li>
            <li> less in quality than the original version</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t clear the redness like some folks said.</li>
            <li> It leave my skin soft, but never oily, and it does not clog my pores - all at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Bought it on Amazon and has been wonderfully surprised, The cream keep my skin reasonably moist , therefore prevented worsening of wrinkles and saved me money at the same time.</li>
            <li> My face feels soft and looks quite radiant after about one week of use.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The whole jar it last me about 4months...</li>
            <li> As far as the anti-wrinkle properties I wouldn&#x27;t say it works miracles with all wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to try this product that is similar and quite reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and some products burn my face.  </li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This creme actually works very well</li>
            <li> Sensitive skin here</li>
            <li> Helps hold in moisture at night for soft skin.</li>
            <li> As far as the anti-wrinkle claim, I haven&#x27;t seen any changes so far.</li>
            <li> It works well for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I am 67 years old and have always taken care of my complexion and skin.  </li>
            <li> I figure, if this stuff is gentle and works, why pay for a second product?&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> This AM my face was sooo soft.</li>
            <li> but I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for the second time, I am using it as a night cream, don&#x27;t see the wrinkles disappearing, but my skin is much softer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This creme is soft and creamy.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I checked the ingredients and it&#x27;s mostly natural stuff, like cocoabutter.</li>
            <li> My eyes are extremely sensitive, so I use this for under eye cream day and night.</li>
            <li> As a 37 year old woman I need to find a moisturizer that wasn&#x27;t greasy, but moisturized and helped with my oncoming wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Having sensitive skin a lot of products make me break out.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and supple from this product.</li>
            <li> I really doubt it will end up in the discards pile until the last morsel has been used on your skin.</li>
            <li> I am a 34-year-old woman with sensitive skin that is breakout prone, and I&#x27;ve not had any problems with my skin since using this moisturizer (going on 5 years now).</li>
            <li> My eyes are particularly sensitive.  </li>
            <li> No complaints thus far.</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea and thought that meant I could never use an anti-aging product because it would irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This cream works well for my sensitive skin after showers.</li>
            <li> This is for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> and I need the sensitive skin type.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wake up with the greasy feeling on my face; it feels soft and moistened -</li>
            <li> As far as the wrinkle reducing power, we&#x27;ll have to see.</li>
            <li> I ordered 5-6 sensitive skin cream in a month.</li>
            <li> I am so surprised.  </li>
            <li> I developed a rash.</li>
            <li> I happen to have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Allergy prone and sensitive skins tend not to do well with added fragrance.).</li>
            <li> Always leaves my face soft with no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I swear it keeps my young.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and just use it as a nighttime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and loved it but was unable to find it in the store when I ran out.  </li>
            <li> I just love this cream it is not too thick or too watery</li>
            <li> Makes my facial skin look younger since it&#x27;s not reacting to chemicals and parfum in most other creams.</li>
            <li> I use it in place of far more expensive, but not more effective, night creams.</li>
            <li> The BHA and the retinol are pretty heavy hitters and if I use other creams on top of them, my skin will burn and turn red and my eyes sting an water</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting older and no tub of cream is going to turn back the hands of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have several glabella wrinkles, and multiple horizontal wrinkles on my forehead, and these have stayed exactly the same.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started using this cream at night only and have noticed more of a difference than I ever have from any product I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> My skin still peels during the day and T-zone produces too much oil because my skin is dry, despite that I have this thick cream sitting on top of my face.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Well, i don&#x27;t know too much about Cosmetics, only know that this brand is German brand, maybe will buy again in future, thanks.</li>
            <li> It works really well for my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing for dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this creme feels upon application as well as all day long.  </li>
            <li> something more expensive, something more gimmicky.</li>
            <li> Overall, if you normal skin like me, you might want to seek out a lighter moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I increased my washing and toner regimen for a couple of days after I quit using the product and my skin is back to normal.</li>
            <li> After buying all these products for several years now I see the deal is as companies must look at the results under a \\&quot;ULTRA POWERFUL beam electron microscope\\&quot; to measure any actual results and what WE GET can&#x27;t be seen with the naked eye.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t kind it in regular drug stores.</li>
            <li> so my skin is already looking pretty rough.</li>
            <li> The reason why I don&#x27;t think this is an unbelievably great face creme like other reviewers is because it&#x27;s very thick and does not provide enough hydration for my face.  </li>
            <li> My skin is also very dry, and this is a nice thick, unscented cream that moisturizes without leaving a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> The new version is different ..</li>
            <li> It adds much needed moisture to my increasingly dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Eucerin Sensitive Facial Skin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Creme, 1.7-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> Eucerin Sensitive Facial Skin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Creme, 1.7 Ounces]]  </li>
            <li> She had me write down the name and said she was going to go right out and buy some.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and it certainly helps with dryness.</li>
            <li> Better late than never!</li>
            <li> Different from the old version!</li>
            <li> In the past, Shisedo was my only choice but the price tag is getting higher and higher.</li>
            <li> It is a shame that a lot of people people waste their money in more expensive brands at the department stores, which is a rip off, and they miss the chance to find a lot better products at a local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lazy and just use clean hands.</li>
            <li> I am very young but spent too much time in the sun as a teen</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a whole bunch of moisturizers trying to find one that would keep my face hydrated without causing too much oil and shine in some areas and dry and flakiness in other areas of my face.</li>
            <li> 1.I wash my face daily with the sensitive soap from clinique.  </li>
            <li> Not knocking this as a skin crème, especially for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 70 years old and look 10 to 20 years younger.</li>
            <li> This product makes my facial skin soft and moist looking.</li>
            <li> I especially like its sensitive skin feature.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive with red spots and this cream doesn&#x27;t help to relief that like it&#x27;s advertised.</li>
            <li> Sensitive skin all my life and finally something that works and doesn&#x27;t irriate me.</li>
            <li> I noticed some smoothing of my skin, but rapidly developed  inflammatory reddened skin and had to discontinue... close but not enough.</li>
            <li> This is my second jar of eucerin Q10 sensitive cream.  </li>
            <li> As far as a wrinkle remover, I give it a bit of a lower ranking for me personally.</li>
            <li> is thick and &amp;#34;creamy,&amp;#34; but sort of light in texture.</li>
            <li> It is pretty thick so does not take much.</li>
            <li> I like this - not too expensive, goes on nicely, and does seem to keep my face looking a bit &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It is thick and I was worried, as I have super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a hot mess.</li>
            <li> My skin is a little sensitive, especially near the eyes and this product has caused no problems at all.</li>
            <li> It is also great as an under eye cream if you mix it with a little water to make it less thick.  </li>
            <li> my only complaint is I prefer a light feeling lotion on my face.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month every day--in the mornings under foundation, and at night after cleansing, exfoliation, toner, serum and ampoule.&lt;br /&gt;Right after ordering the product on Amazon, I realized that I actually had zero cream left, and went out to Walgreens and purchased a jar of this stuff in store, thinking I could give the Amazon one to my husband if I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> but I have dry and very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I started washing my face, and after using this I&#x27;ve had positive line decrease and it seems my face is less breakout prone.</li>
            <li> So many eye creams claim they are for sensitive skin, but 90% of them still cause my eyes to be red, puffy and tired all day long.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know if it will help the ever-increasing number of expression/sleep lines, but since my skin over the past year has moved from oily to more dry -</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long to sink in, and if I touch my face hours later, it still feels very soft.  </li>
            <li> The first few times I applied it</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate</li>
            <li> I will probably try to repurpose the jar for something; just not sure what as of right now.</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea, dry, irritated sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My cheeks are quite dry and sensitive but this product fights both those problems.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something moisturizing for my dry and sensitive skin, but this just seems to sit on my skin and not soak into it.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few months and the outcome is positive.  </li>
            <li> I am a guy in my late 20&#x27;s with super sensitive combination skin: oily on my forehead, dry at my eyelids and upper lip.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry and sensitive skin, which always leaves me trying different skin cremes.</li>
            <li> My cheeks are red, sensitive, dry and peels a lot.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and plumps up tired old skin to improve appearance.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say that I have seen much of a difference except for maybe a little bit of improvement.</li>
            <li> , i figured it must be the other new product cleansers and toners i was using</li>
            <li> I have very dry flaky red sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> it is very well priced, and you only need a a little bit.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that after applying, this product is very soothing to my exfoliated skin and tones down redness or pinkness!</li>
            <li> No flaking due to harsh chemicals, smoother, more supple skin, and less redness.  </li>
            <li> It is thick but not heavy on the face and doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent.</li>
            <li> The anti-aging ingredients in this are Coenzyme Q10 and Biotin, but the amount of these active ingredients are so trace and minimal that it really doesn&#x27;t make a big difference.</li>
            <li> Well first let me say,i don&#x27;t have wrinkles or hard lines(im</li>
            <li> Because I only use it around my eyes, this jar will probably last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Before then, I had to carry a face lotion with me all day because the area above my upper lip would dry and flake.</li>
            <li> So far, half of a container later, I have not had any breakouts or problems.  </li>
            <li> I not only broke out but had a strange blotchiness that never seemed to go away.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see results.</li>
            <li> This product is the only thing that has been consisten in my arsenal over the long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first she did complain that it was too thick on application, but that soon was abated once I told her to dilute it with water.</li>
            <li> Bottom line: not bad not great</li>
            <li> However, I have noticed that since using this at night, and the Eucerin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Lotion SPF during the day, that the crows feet around my eyes are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Richer in consistency for extra dry condtions.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too oily or leave your skin dry after an hour of moisturizing, then you&#x27;ve definitely found the one!</li>
            <li> After using for a few days I bought several additional jars as I do not want to run out of Eucerin Q10 Ant-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Creme.</li>
            <li> I have also tried other more expensive q10 products.</li>
            <li> but I wish they would improve their search engine to show you only items that you are searching for and then maybe draw a line and show you other items that are similar.</li>
            <li> This is the only one that keeps my very dry skin nourished and hydrated during winter time.</li>
            <li> This said, it&#x27;s still much cheaper than the regenerist brand, so I guess I shouldn&#x27;t complain TOO hard</li>
            <li> so I had been using this for a long time.</li>
            <li> One jar lasts a long time.    </li>
            <li> so a jar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I spent tons of time sorting and reading reviews to figure out what to try next.</li>
            <li> but I think I will be repurchasing this when my current jar is empty.</li>
            <li> I use this product at night and it keeps my skin hydrated and moisturized all day long.  </li>
            <li> just a dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have not tried it long term</li>
            <li> It has also calmed the redness in my skin from minor irritations and dryness.</li>
            <li> can use for a long time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too heavy for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It is a thick consistency and hydrates very well for me.</li>
            <li> And despite that fact that I am 58 years old, I have very few wrinkles, and I&#x27;m often mistaken for someone much younger.  </li>
            <li> I am not going to say that this is not a good product given the positive reviews</li>
            <li> I cannot use any other product Only this one.   </li>
            <li> now I don&#x27;t have an excuse to not use night cream!</li>
            <li> Like all moisturizers, it helps dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin sometimes cracks when the weather is dry and is a bit itchy when I don&#x27;t keep it moisturized.</li>
            <li> My skin is still dry and does flake in places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it around my eyes every morning and night (as eye creme), and I apply it anywhere on my face that has dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, dry and peeling on my cheeks and chin, but a bit oily on my t-zone.</li>
            <li> I use it on my neck and the dry parts of my face each night.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have dry skin and</li>
            <li> Non greasy, and works wonders for all dry skin.</li>
            <li> started using this about seven years ago and, though I have strayed a few time seeking the next big thing</li>
            <li> Recently, I had to purchase a few extra jars because my daughters were stealing from my stash.</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> She puts a little on at night (a little goes a long way) and uses her face&#x27;s natural oils in the morning.</li>
            <li> I usually try something different when I run out of my current stuff</li>
            <li> Not sure what all the big deal is about this face cream, it is just a basic moisturizer</li>
            <li> Now that my heat is on every day my skin is very dry.</li>
            <li> I am in my thirties and have very dry skin after using Accutane.</li>
            <li> I initially thought it was a little greasy</li>
            <li> it is worth the price and is not near as expensive as man other  face creams</li>
            <li> It feels like this one gives least amount of stress to my sensitive face.</li>
            <li> I have been using Eucerin cream for the last few months</li>
            <li> : no SPF/sun protection (though this product is not really meant for this purpose)&lt;br</li>
            <li> This does cause some shininess on my forehead, but I have learned to dilute it some via applying it with slightly wet hands.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> I actually started using this after a recommendation from my dr when I was using acne cream that dried my face.</li>
            <li> It is thick, creamy and feels soft but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> It may not sound a lot as a 1.7 oz jar, but it doesn&#x27;t require you to put on so much on your face since it massages quite thick on the face.</li>
            <li> If you use too much, you are going to have a thick greasy fatty alcohol layer (hydrogenated alcohols) sitting on your face.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> I was really hesitant to buy a product called &amp;#34;creme&amp;#34; for my face because I was concerned that a thick creme would feel heavy and greasy-</li>
            <li> I will certain update when I see dramatic changes.</li>
            <li> Normally, I don&#x27;t need that much extra moisture, but I am guilty of over-exfoliating which has reduced freckles but dries my face out.</li>
            <li> use this one because it does NOT do what they all say they will of course, but this one is at least less expensive and does as much or more than the pricier ones.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> That being said, it is certainly a lot better than all those Retinol anti-aging products which are way too harsh and cause horrible irritation.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small bit to do its wonders</li>
            <li> Extremely moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;Better than the $100 night cream,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, sinks in and goes to work!</li>
            <li> I noticing the difference between other creams I have used.</li>
            <li> This was not exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if I like it yet because I have only had it for a couple weeks</li>
            <li> I will bought other products of Eucerin for myself.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I bought this cream because of all the raving reviews on Amazon.com and on other websites.  </li>
            <li> Shipped after due date</li>
            <li> I gave up all other moisturizers for this one about 15 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Amazon on the other hand gets a 1 star for search features.</li>
            <li> Also, the jar is really small compared to my previous face lotion,  but you need so little for coverage that I think it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Sometimes if my skin feels particularly dry, I will put a dollop on my palm along with a few drops of jojoba oil and rub together before smoothing on to increase the protection factor.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but have combo skin, which makes it difficult to find a facial moisturizer that works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a SMALL amount of cream, however instead of spreading it on your entire hand, dollop a small amount on your fingers, rub on a few fingers only, then apply.</li>
            <li> At 27, my fine lines aren&#x27;t too bad</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t interact negatively with my other products: I use Paula&#x27;s Choice 2% BHA liquid every night, followed by Skinceuticals Retinol 1% every third night.</li>
            <li> You just need a little bit not much.   </li>
            <li> My jawline and chin started to get tiny little clogged pore bumps and some past hormonal acne discoloration started to redden up.</li>
            <li> I will not go to expensive skin cremes again, no need really while I use Eucerin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even noticed that a couple of slightly dark spots on my face have lightened up.........</li>
            <li> She loves the hydration she receives from this, only complaint is that she wishes it wasn&#x27;t so greasy.</li>
            <li> My delicate eye area absorbs the product instantly.</li>
            <li> Left me hydrated for at least 4 hours at a time.</li>
            <li> The good thing is it has not made matters worst.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using morning and evening and have noticed a smoothness, softness and the redness is toned down to almost nothing.</li>
            <li> so my skin gets dry and peels, which results in excessive oil production.  </li>
            <li> Midway through the day I blot my face with a tissue,  but other than that it doesn&#x27;t seem heavy.  </li>
            <li> I use very little at night because it takes a long time to absorb on my skin and still when I go to bed it feels heavy.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased it at.</li>
            <li> I feel like as soon as I started to use this, instead of a Curel brand moisturizer, my skin was less irritated.  </li>
            <li> So using a BARRIER type of face cream does not adequately provide moisture on my face.  </li>
            <li> Both are less than $15.</li>
            <li> No miracles here at all, and DOES NOT reduce, much less eliminate wrinkles at all either</li>
            <li> and as the skin plumps as it takes on the moisture, it looks like it has less wrinkles</li>
            <li> /&gt;To test if it was this product causing the breakouts I switched out this Eucerin wrinkle cream for  another moisturizer and maintained the same routine for two weeks (the acne cleared up and was no more than usual).</li>
            <li> I have accidently (I&#x27;m older and blind without my glasses)</li>
            <li> 51) complexion was just a mess.</li>
            <li> I only give it 4 stars because the condition of the item (packaging and sealing) was not good.</li>
            <li> As a twenty-something, my salary, which is not so measly but also far from allowing me to spend $20+ on anti-aging creams, had me limited to the &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; options.</li>
            <li> I only use a small amount of this cream and it forms a thick layer on my skin and makes my skin look matte.  </li>
            <li> I started using this among other products and started to notice i would get small breakouts</li>
            <li> It claims visible results within 5 weeks, so I&#x27;ll have to wait a little longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy.</li>
            <li> This does feel heavy and a little greasy</li>
            <li> The area around my eyes always seem to be dry and all other eye creams I had used just burned and irritated my skin around my eyes and just made it worse.</li>
            <li> Some reviews said they find it too heavy for daytime use,  but it is working for me for both day and night.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really really really heavy moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> My T-zone started to overproduce oils after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> that I was using everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Eucerin for a few months and have not had any breakouts.</li>
            <li> Been using for a few years and will continue to use.  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed a slight \\&quot;glow\\&quot; that I haven&#x27;t seen in years!</li>
            <li> This product is very thick, but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> greasy at all, no strong fragrance and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t credit the retinol or BHA with preventing the wrinkles as I just started those two products within the past few months.</li>
            <li> It can be a touch on the heavy side, but I just use a small amount and dab my face after 10 minutes with a cloth, no problem.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and have noticed I have fewer wrinkles or at least less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Thick, creamy with little smell.</li>
            <li> Has very little sent.</li>
            <li> I am not sure of the anti-wrinkle effect yet.</li>
            <li> Small</li>
            <li> I have tried a few skincare lines over the years but never really liked any of them</li>
            <li> NO WRINKLES removed or lessened as usual, but in this country ....</li>
            <li> i &#x27;ve applied it several times, but can not absorb and i feel ichy, i feel sorry</li>
            <li> I then switched back to the Eucerin cream while maintaining the same facial routine as before and, within a week, my face broke out terribly again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> used this product on one side of my face for a few days!</li>
            <li> It feels very heavy and greasy on combination skin type, I can&#x27;t stand it even as an evening cream.</li>
            <li> I am not sure of the amount of Q10 in this product, as I did not notice a dramatic decrease in wrinkles after half the jar is gone.  </li>
            <li> Also, when my nose is really red, dry, and raw from having a cold, I find that this is gentler than other creams that burn and sting really bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in drugstores for some reason, but I would not know what to do if this moisturizer disappeared.</li>
            <li> Hard to find Q10 in an affordable brand.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding one</li>
            <li> Hard to find at retail stores.  </li>
            <li> As a woman of color, it is hard to find products that correct some of the skin problems we face.  </li>
            <li> but it does no harm at least.</li>
            <li> It is a thick, creamy consistency, butter-yellow in color, and does not have a fragrance that I can tell.  </li>
            <li> This is a thick lotion</li>
            <li> : thick and luxurious texture&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its thick, and feels like it leaves a film on your face.</li>
            <li> She used to complain that my moisturizers were too thick and that she could feel it on her skin after application.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that the appearance and skin tone have evened out slowly.</li>
            <li> Its not too thick and can be used day or night.  </li>
            <li> you will see what I mean.</li>
            <li> the morning I just wash my face with cold water then pat to dry, I apply again the creme.   </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not greasy, the fragrance is subtle and I am planning on purchasing again.  </li>
            <li> but it definitely is not a good product for me.</li>
            <li> It irritated and made my skin break out with no good results of use</li>
            <li> i usually use expensive moisturizers but after a friend raved about this I decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Feels thick but not greasy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thick and greasy for my face (and causes me to breakout), but it works well on my feet!</li>
            <li> This is a very thick moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s the chemicals in the cream, not sure but will finish the product because I would hate to see it go to waste.</li>
            <li> I usually buy my face creams from dermatologist or try to find the brands on amazon that I buy at the dermatologist, which are very expensive.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Is that weird?</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find but Amazon came through.</li>
            <li> I was initially skeptical of the claim that it won&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li> I like the extremely faint shea butter smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All this while our corrupt government does nothing to protect any of us and just screams at us to keep buying so they can get their hand-outs...</li>
            <li> However, I have combination/oily skin (aka tempermental, breakout prone skin that even freaks out over face wash) and sadly cannot use this on the rest of my face, as it gives me breakouts.</li>
            <li> It smells like a faint hint of vanilla.</li>
            <li> Lve it, i used this as a moisturizer on cold season it is work for me</li>
            <li> My skin is angry!</li>
            <li> have used very expensive creams and the Eucerin goes on just as smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had a bad reaction.  </li>
            <li> Too bad though.    </li>
            <li> think the bad reviews are from users who have oily skin?</li>
            <li> so bad I had to stop using Olay products.</li>
            <li> My acne was just as bad as before.</li>
            <li> I use it for a night cream and also under my base makeup.</li>
            <li> Any noticeable wrinkles that I have become very faint!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated nightcreams (I have combination - oily skin) because of the nasty greasy feeling I would get waking up in the morning.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Has worked well so far and hasn&#x27;t made me break out!</li>
            <li> Friendly to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the price. I initially thought it was a little greasy but now realize it just takes about thirty minutes for my skin to really absorb it. My face feels soft and looks quite radiant after about one week of use.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on skin.see no difference of wrinkles at all.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and it gives a lot of moisture to my skin w/o ever causing breakouts. MY make-up lasts longer when I use this under, better than a primer. It has a wonderful texture and feel to it. Thick, creamy with little smell. Not sure how much coQ 10 they put in, but I have been using for 6 months and skin is noticably better.</li>
            <li> I have been a big fan of Eucerin daily protection lotion SPF30 for many years and decided to try their facial creme. I love the texture, it immediately leaves my skin hydrated and soft. It&#x27;s not oily at all and really just feels good on my face. Also some fragrance free creams smell like oil to me but this one doesn&#x27;t. I feel like I even get better sleep when I put it on than when I don&#x27;t.  I am in my 30s, with medium skin.</li>
            <li> My tried and true. I love how gentle this face cream is. Everyone in my family who has tried it has loved. It goes on and stays on...all night. I wake up with moisturized dewy skin. No fragrance. Doesn&#x27;t cause irritation or breakout. Love! Love! Love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure about the benefits of Q10. And the anti-wrinkle claims. I&#x27;m still getting older and no tub of cream is going to turn back the hands of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this a while. Every now and then I would get lured into trying something else...something more expensive, something more gimmicky. But I always come back to this and ask myself why I strayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the price and regular delivery on Amazon Subscribe and Save. I&#x27;m never without a tub of this stuff.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes but feels like a film over my skin. I can&#x27;t decide how much I want to use this or if it works for me.</li>
            <li> Nice to have anti-wrinkle cream that is for sensitive skin and is fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin so I had been using this for a long time. I cannot use any other product Only this one.   1.I wash my face daily with the sensitive soap from clinique.  2.I apply the creme and massage it really good all the way to the neck to prevent it from sagging(turkey neck). You just need a little bit not much.   3.In the morning I just wash my face with cold water then pat to dry, I apply again the creme.   4. I apply the suntan lotion from Eucerin also after the creme.  5. The last thing that I do in my face because i dont use a lot of make up.I just put the powder all over my face. To keep so it does not look shiny.The whole jar it last me about 4months...It is very good for your wallet.    I have been told that I looked very young for my age for so many friends. I have four children and grown. Yes. It truly a blessing having this product.Thank you Eucerin and Amazon for having this product.[[ASIN:B001FB5IFA Eucerin Sensitive Facial Skin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Creme, 1.7-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for years, and I look younger than most of my friends, people are always surprised at my real age. This cream is a dream - there is no odor, it is excellent for sensitive skin (everything bothers my skin - except this) it is very well priced, and you only need a a little bit. One jar lasts a long time.    It&#x27;s hard to find in drugstores for some reason, but I would not know what to do if this moisturizer disappeared. It&#x27;s my standby product. I get compliments on my skin and lack of wrinkles all the time. I really think this cream has a lot to do with how my skin looks.</li>
            <li> Finally! An eye cream that doesn&#x27;t irritate my super-sensitive eyes. So many eye creams claim they are for sensitive skin, but 90% of them still cause my eyes to be red, puffy and tired all day long. This cream moisturizes perfectly, has no scent and stays put. My under eyes are getting dryer with age, and this cream is PERFECTION. The price is fabulous, too! I would love to buy this in bulk in case they ever discontinue it (which has happened far too many times).</li>
            <li> This is the best cream that I&#x27;ve tried by far for my dry, sensitive skin!  I use this every night after washing my face as part of my skincare regimen.  It is a thick, creamy consistency, butter-yellow in color, and does not have a fragrance that I can tell.  It goes on smooth and makes my skin so supple that when I wake up in the mornings my face still feels amazing!  I have never had an adverse reaction to this cream which is excellent because my skin is so sensitive that most products cause it to break out or turn red.  As far as the anti-wrinkle properties I wouldn&#x27;t say it works miracles with all wrinkles.  However, I have noticed that since using this at night, and the Eucerin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Lotion SPF during the day, that the crows feet around my eyes are less noticeable.  I highly recommend both!</li>
            <li> It is really really good!! I like it!!</li>
            <li> I have mature, fair skin of Irish descent that tends to dry out in the harsh winters we experience here in the Northeast.  I used to love Q10 Skin Solutions but it appears to be no longer manufactured.  So I decided to try this product that is similar and quite reasonably priced.  It is thick, creamy and feels soft but not greasy.  I do not detect a scent which is great because I can&#x27;t stand perfumed face cream.  I apply it on my face, neck and upper chest after showering while my skin is still damp and it absorbs quickly.  Sometimes if my skin feels particularly dry, I will put a dollop on my palm along with a few drops of jojoba oil and rub together before smoothing on to increase the protection factor.  It is also great as an under eye cream if you mix it with a little water to make it less thick.  I love this face cream and pray it is not discontinued.</li>
            <li> Five star moisturizer!  I have a fair complexion and seem to have an adverse reaction to many beauty products,  especially those with perfumes and dyes.  I find this moisturizer to be odorless, but pleasant.  Some reviews said they find it too heavy for daytime use,  but it is working for me for both day and night.  Midway through the day I blot my face with a tissue,  but other than that it doesn&#x27;t seem heavy.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and will be purchasing again.  Also, the jar is really small compared to my previous face lotion,  but you need so little for coverage that I think it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost 2 month since I started using it. I think my skin looks somewhat smoother.&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy at all, no strong fragrance and inexpensive. I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Good results for the price point.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and some products burn my face.  My dermatologist recommended Eucerin Q10.  I like the texture of Eucerin Q10.  It is nice and creamy, and I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> This is a thick lotion so I use this at night.  It helps with dryness but doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  I also have sensitive skin and I haven&#x27;t had a bad reaction.  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Nice creams for the wrinkles</li>
            <li> Eucerin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Creme is one of the only cremes that I am able to use as I am allergic to so many things. This creme actually works very well and I love it. It only takes a small bit to do its wonders so a jar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Has a light vanilla ordor, just need a little.  I use the Eucerin lotion every morning and this at night and at 50, my skin looks very good. Reasonable cost for such great results!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic cream which I applies at night on top of my favourite vitamin c serum. I pair it with Eucerin lotion which I applies during the day. I have very dry flaky red sensitive skin. It heals my face in just three days. I am not sure of the anti-wrinkle effect yet. Have not seen that happen yet.</li>
            <li> very good product i say, i have acne prone skin and as i am getting older noticing wrinkles, this product i have been using for a month now and has helped clear out my cne and my fine lines are deminshing.. i only use this product at night for it does make my face a bit shiny.</li>
            <li> This is what I use for my nightly moisturizer.  It works well.</li>
            <li> love this day time moisturizer and have recommended it to my sister and my daughter</li>
            <li> really love this cream</li>
            <li> Can not tell any difference after a month of use. Too soon? Maybe a preventative. I do not know. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> This literally did nothing for my skin.  You&#x27;re better off buying a glycolic acid cream and using emo oil as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is a product I use, and the price is good.</li>
            <li> Still have the final verdict out but am reasonably happy with the product.  My order was processed rapidly and service with Amazon was very good as usual.  I fee; with time Eucerin Q10 Will get to be one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> Bought for my girlfriend, got the package very quickly.  And she used it from last Friday, and she said that it&#x27;s very good.   Well, i don&#x27;t know too much about Cosmetics, only know that this brand is German brand, maybe will buy again in future, thanks.</li>
            <li> This really works. Good for sensitive skin and the moisturizing lasts.</li>
            <li> I have been using Eucerin cream for the last few months and I must say I have seen a great improvement in my skin. It is more refined looking and softer, with less visible pores. I am past 60 and my skin has never looked this good. I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> Two weeks into program. Skin softer and smoother.  No miracles yet! Twice a day use.</li>
            <li> I love Eucerin body lotion, so when I was looking at face creams on Amazon, I couldn&#x27;t get over the price, I figured if it didn&#x27;t work for me, that I wasn&#x27;t out mucho $$$, I am amazed with this cream!</li>
            <li> It is really good for sensitive skin and isn&#x27;t too greasy.  Plus, it is reasonably priced and can be put on the automatic mailing system..</li>
            <li> A nice moisturizer, but I don&#x27;t really see any effect on wrinkles. Like all moisturizers, it helps dry skin. But as for any long-lasting properties, I feel good nutrition works the best. Not knocking this as a skin crème, especially for those with sensitive skin. I just don&#x27;t think there are any miracles out there in a jar.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THE CONSISTENCY OF THIS CREAM.  I HAVEN&#x27;T USED IT LONG-TERM YET FOR RESULTS THAT ARE NOTICED.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;m always trying out different stuff to find the best. I spent tons of time sorting and reading reviews to figure out what to try next. I&#x27;m glad I tried this. I usually try something different when I run out of my current stuff but I think I will be repurchasing this when my current jar is empty. I&#x27;ve only been using this at night after I wash my face but my face feels great in the morning. No weird smell and I like the jar. Is that weird? Its just a jar but it&#x27;s sturdy and feels nice in your hand. I will probably try to repurpose the jar for something; just not sure what as of right now. But the cr&amp;egrave;me inside...that&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in my skin but felt great.</li>
            <li> I am not going to say that this is not a good product given the positive reviews but it definitely is not a good product for me. I was so excited to get this and try it as I am always looking for a good &#x27;anti aging&#x27; skin cream and the reviews sounded great with a product that was very affordable to boot.  Within a couple of days my pretty much clear (and I am 51) complexion was just a mess. I not only broke out but had a strange blotchiness that never seemed to go away. I started using the cream again as I have it here but only on my neck. Too bad though.    So my 3 star rating is not so much for the product but for what I experienced it myself using it. All aside, the item arrived quickly and it is always a breeze ordering from here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  Rich, odorless, tasteless, feels great on my skin</li>
            <li> Extremely moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;Better than the $100 night cream, yes I will be buying more through amazon&lt;br /&gt;I think the bad reviews are from users who have oily skin?</li>
            <li> So far so good! Yay! Sensitive skin here so bad I had to stop using Olay products. I have found my new &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; product and am looking forward to buying the Eucerin cleanser as well!!!</li>
            <li> Love it, skin is so soft !</li>
            <li> Best time to use anti wrinkle cream is before you have wrinkles. This is going help prevent them from ever surfacing in the first place .</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I bought it through Amazon because I could not find it in the local stores I had previously purchased it at. It instantly moisturizes and restores the morning wrinkles you get from the pillow when you wake up!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product under my foundation for years.  I have very dry skin, and it certainly helps with dryness.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and loved it but was unable to find it in the store when I ran out.  I was so happy to see it on Amazon! I use it for a night cream and also under my base makeup. It never feels greasy, just moist and dewy.  Sometimes I just put it on and go without makeup during the day.</li>
            <li> Not a cream I like to wear during the day. It&#x27;s a bit heavy so I wear it at night to bed.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00005NAOD Eucerin Sensitive Facial Skin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Creme, 1.7 Ounces]]  I have Rosacea, dry, irritated sensitive skin. Almost everything aggravates it, but not this cream. It&#x27;s only been two weeks now, and I see a vast improvement! I&#x27;m using morning and evening and have noticed a smoothness, softness and the redness is toned down to almost nothing. It&#x27;s very soothing to my parched skin. I think the fine lines are softening as well. Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend this cream as I&#x27;ve tried absolutely everything out there to no avail until I gave it one more shot, and bought this. I&#x27;ve used the most expensive of creams, and who ever thought one so inexpensive could be so perfect. It&#x27;s not greasy, sinks in and goes to work! I have also noticed a slight \\&quot;glow\\&quot; that I haven&#x27;t seen in years!</li>
            <li> I have a greasy skin, so I don&#x27;t like to put that much. I like that I noticing the difference between other creams I have used. This one makes your skin feel softer. I&#x27;m using it for a week now and I really like it. I would buy it again...</li>
            <li> Love this gives moisture all day long.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sis because she has sensitive skin and most anti aging products irritate her skin, but Eucerin is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin at all.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I have used for sensitive, dry flaky skin that is prone to acne.</li>
            <li> Like all of us~I have used many wrinkle creams.  I found this one to be one of the better ones.  I was given a jar to try and loved it.  It is difficult to find but Amazon came through.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really really really heavy moisturizer. I certainly can&#x27;t wear it during the day, but at night it works just fine. I think it&#x27;s best suited to those with dry skin OR for those of us who get dry skin largely during the fall/winter. Overall, if you normal skin like me, you might want to seek out a lighter moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My wife says she loves this cream, it moisturizes the skin very well.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin! Helps hold in moisture at night for soft skin.</li>
            <li> Product recommended by our cosmetologist.  Great price too!</li>
            <li> Eucerin is our defacto brand for cosmetically safe face lotion.  Great value and not fancy, but you get everything you need!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second jar of this. I apply it nightly and wake up with a very moisturized face. I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, but I&#x27;m hoping this will prevent them from coming!</li>
            <li> excellent product at a good price</li>
            <li> More greasy than I expected.</li>
            <li> Love this cream. This is the only one that keeps my very dry skin nourished and hydrated during winter time. Also it make skin very smooth without using scrubs. Just keep buying again and again.</li>
            <li> I use this product at night and it keeps my skin hydrated and moisturized all day long.  My skin is sensitive and this product doesn&#x27;t irritate it like so many other products do.  I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Eucerin for several years, old friends can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m not showing more wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Feels like new Skin!  I use it every day under my make up and again to remove my make up at night!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I live in a very dry climate so I use this day and night.  Eucerin is the best.</li>
            <li> Pretty good so far. Feels thick but not greasy! Pretty luxurious for the price. No break outs and my skin is pretty fickle. 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see results. Will update.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion.  It is thick and creamy and it makes your face feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> From now on this will be the only cream I will be using.I&#x27;ve been using it for just 1week and I can see a difference on my face.I just love this cream it is not too thick or too watery it is just perfect.I especially love the price.I will be using this cream from now on.I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> A companion for the lotion.  Richer in consistency for extra dry condtions.</li>
            <li> My skincare stats: 30 y/o, Caucasian fair skin, combination with oily T-zone, tendency to have dry patches on cheeks, and red undertones, very sensitive to new products, easily breaks out in response to topical oil.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this cream about a month ago when I ran out of my Caudalie cream and didn&#x27;t feel like going back to Sephora for something else. I ordered this one on Amazon because of all the high ratings and great reviews. So far, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month every day--in the mornings under foundation, and at night after cleansing, exfoliation, toner, serum and ampoule.&lt;br /&gt;Right after ordering the product on Amazon, I realized that I actually had zero cream left, and went out to Walgreens and purchased a jar of this stuff in store, thinking I could give the Amazon one to my husband if I don&#x27;t like it. So I can comment on the difference between the in-store and Amazon creams: there is none. They are absolutely the same--packaging and product itself.&lt;br /&gt;So what ended up happening was when I received the online product, I ended up giving the store product to my husband after all, but not because I don&#x27;t like it--but because he himself ran out of his moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;This is a review of the online purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself is thick and &amp;#34;creamy,&amp;#34; but sort of light in texture. It goes on smoothly onto a cleansed and toned skin. I put it all over my face, including my T-zone, eyes and around the lips. I was initially skeptical of the claim that it won&#x27;t clog pores. However, since using it for a month now, I have not had any breakouts or detrimental changes to my skin. As far as the anti-wrinkle claim, I haven&#x27;t seen any changes so far. I have several glabella wrinkles, and multiple horizontal wrinkles on my forehead, and these have stayed exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;What I do like about this crème is its ability to moisturize so well without leaving a sticky or oily film. I have to say that it stands up against the higher priced brands out there, and I have certainly tried many of these over the last 10 years. The amount of product in the container is quite generous as well, so overall this is a great value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to continue using this product until it runs out. After reading up on the ubiquinone/coenzyme Q10, it seems that it is mostly a protectant enzyme, guarding the skin against further damage, so that (along with excellent moisturizing) is what I hope this product will continue to deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;Pros: thick and luxurious texture&lt;br /&gt;  does not cause breakouts&lt;br /&gt;  does not clog pores&lt;br /&gt;  does not make oily skin oilier&lt;br /&gt;  has ubiquinone/coenzyme Q10 for further skin protection from damage&lt;br /&gt;  excellent moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;  great price&lt;br /&gt;  generous amount of product&lt;br /&gt;Cons: no SPF/sun protection (though this product is not really meant for this purpose)&lt;br /&gt;  no change in wrinkles (fine lines or medium depth wrinkles) after 1 month of use</li>
            <li> Small but it lasts forever. It is what I expected, I am happy with it, wish there come in a bigger size, thanks.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry and sensitive skin, which always leaves me trying different skin cremes. My skin sometimes cracks when the weather is dry and is a bit itchy when I don&#x27;t keep it moisturized. However, once I received this product, it was amazing!! First, the price is unbeatable. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of $100+ skin cremes and this one beats them all.  Its very moisturizing, and leaves your skin feeling hydrated. I use this creme right before my foundation and it gives my foundation just the right amount of hydration to go on smoothly.  It doesn&#x27;t break me out, and it&#x27;s very calming on my skin.  If you&#x27;re looking for a hydrating face creme that ISN&#x27;T going to leave your skin feeling sticky cause it&#x27;s too oily or leave your skin dry after an hour of moisturizing, then you&#x27;ve definitely found the one! I am so picky and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this creme.</li>
            <li> Eucerin Q10 is very easy to use, only one step to the whole face, not like other facial products, sometimes it takes 5 steps to cover the whole face.  (I have very sensitive skin but I never have any problem with Ecerin Q10).</li>
            <li> Great and works wonders!!</li>
            <li> I brought it reading the review and worth it , as it worked very good on my skin and keeps it moisturised all teh time.</li>
            <li> My favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thick and greasy for my face (and causes me to breakout), but it works well on my feet!</li>
            <li> love this product line and this product</li>
            <li> Eucerin Sensitive Facial Skin Cream is perfect worn under make-up or after washing your face before bedtime.  It is light and non-greasy.  I&#x27;d be lost without it!</li>
            <li> what a great product ,my skin feels very soft ,and it doesn&#x27;t  bother my  very sensitive  skin  it is worth the price and is not near as expensive as man other  face creams</li>
            <li> this stuff works noticeably well and very quickly. great bang for the buck. just a dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Awesome for my sensitive skin, dry, oily, getting wrinkles but have pimples sometimes too, skin!</li>
            <li> I am glad this product is so cheap because it is superior to other creams that I have paid much more money for!  It works well for my sensitive skin.  I am so happy that I took the advice of others who had written reviews raving about the product.  Thank you all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had noticeable line decrease using this. To note, it must be used in the AM and PM for results. I started washing my face, and after using this I&#x27;ve had positive line decrease and it seems my face is less breakout prone. It&#x27;s a SMALL amount of cream, however instead of spreading it on your entire hand, dollop a small amount on your fingers, rub on a few fingers only, then apply. It works as advertised, just wish I got a bit more for my buck. This said, it&#x27;s still much cheaper than the regenerist brand, so I guess I shouldn&#x27;t complain TOO hard (hence the no star reduction)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion if the product is advertised as Anti-Wrinkle it ain&#x27;t going to work and more than likely&lt;br /&gt;do nothing but lay on your skin like a mast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay Regenerist  is the same way it actually feels like heat on your skin.  This one doesnt feel like that, it just feels like you are wearing a mask and the pores in your face are clogged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing the horrors of plastic surgery and the Contour debacle where threads are inserted into your skin to pull the face up... frankly just face the fact your never going to look like your were even in your 40&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time and nature will have their way with you.  Matter of a fact if wrinkles are all you have got, be glad there are so many ills and deseases to confront you as you make this short journey in your life, just be yourself.</li>
            <li> recommended by a friend</li>
            <li> This was not exactly what I was looking for.  I have not tried it long term so cannot tell if it is good defense against wrinkles, but I discontinued use on my face as it felt too greasy and does not seem to absorb right away.  I have used a great product (AOK from Germany) for last 40 years, but they no longer make it.  I have since been trying to find a good moisturizer that does not have a greasy feel and that absorbs into the skin immediately.  If any of you readers have a good suggestion, I would appreciate the input.</li>
            <li> I am still in the process of trying out this crème. The good thing is it has not made matters worst. I am happy to find the product because I could not find it at my local stores.</li>
            <li> I only give it 4 stars because the condition of the item (packaging and sealing) was not good. The cream is great but I just dont think I will buy this from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> This cream is moisturizing and feels good but I&#x27;m not sure if I like it yet because I have only had it for a couple weeks</li>
            <li> I think I was send an extra one, thank you seller! I have been using this cream more than a month now and so far I am happy. I will certain update when I see dramatic changes.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother and she like it. I trust this brand, feel like good quality and a sigh of safety for skin. I will bought other products of Eucerin for myself.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that is not very expensive.  The reviews on Amazon convinced me to purchase it.  Now I purchase several at a time.  I use it on my face and eyes every night.  My face is left feeling smooth and soft.  I am 67 years old and have always taken care of my complexion and skin.  So, I feel somewhat qualified to say this is great.</li>
            <li> love it. bought several times</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell I have it on, but my face seems to love it!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use it and hope it useful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since January 2015 and what a difference it has made in my skin! It moisturizes very well without being greasy even though I am oily myself. Over the months, it seems to have rebalanced my skin. I am not as oily as I once was. No product has ever been able to do this for me. It has also calmed the redness in my skin from minor irritations and dryness. I finally ran out several days ago and this is the first time I&#x27;ve witnessed its true effects. My skin is angry! Reordered immediately.</li>
            <li> I wash my face at night and apply anti-wrinkle cream.  I bought this because it had good reviews and is cheaper than Olay.  It feels too sticky to me, so I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.  There is no odor which is a plus</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> About my skin: sensitive (will burn and itch with many products), very reactive (I&#x27;ll get acne at the drop of a hat), my skin is combination and runs drier in the winter (or rather, it&#x27;s probably normal in the winter) and VERY oily in the summer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this about seven years ago and, though I have strayed a few time seeking the next big thing, I always come back to this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love:&lt;br /&gt;- The moisturizing abilities: from October-April my skin needs as much moisture as it can get. This keeps me moisturized all night and I wake up with a healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t break me out: this is always an issue for me and this stuff doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or exacerbate my acne at all.&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t interact negatively with my other products: I use Paula&#x27;s Choice 2% BHA liquid every night, followed by Skinceuticals Retinol 1% every third night. This cream is my last step. The BHA and the retinol are pretty heavy hitters and if I use other creams on top of them, my skin will burn and turn red and my eyes sting an water and it&#x27;s a hot mess. The Eucerin doesn&#x27;t cause any burning and is actually quite soothing. I don&#x27;t know much about Q10 or if it may actually counteract the other two product, but so far so good...&lt;br /&gt;- Gentle: I use this all around my eye area. I figure, if this stuff is gentle and works, why pay for a second product?&lt;br /&gt;- The price: If you can find another nighttime lotion that works as well as this for the same price or cheaper, I&#x27;ll cook you a four course meal, replete with wine pairings.&lt;br /&gt;- It seems to help with the wrinkles: I&#x27;ve been using it since I was 21 and now I&#x27;m approaching 29 and most people still think I&#x27;m an undergrad when I&#x27;m on campus at my university (or maybe they&#x27;re just nice?). I can&#x27;t credit the retinol or BHA with preventing the wrinkles as I just started those two products within the past few months. This product is the only thing that has been consisten in my arsenal over the long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t love:&lt;br /&gt;- The packaging isn&#x27;t the most hygienic. This is easily solved by meticulous usage of fresh cotton swaps to remove the desired amount of product. I&#x27;m lazy and just use clean hands. No infections so far.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s too heavy for use in the summer (not really a con, as the moisturizing properties are what make it ideal the rest of the year)</li>
            <li> This is a very moisturizing cream.  I would suggest only using it at night because it feels quite oily.</li>
            <li> Have had many compliments since using this cream on my face.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few skincare lines over the years but never really liked any of them and since I didn&#x27;t notice much difference (if any), I stopped using them. My skin used to be much more oily but as I&#x27;ve gotten older, it&#x27;s more to normal to dry in some spots. I started using this cream at night only and have noticed more of a difference than I ever have from any product I&#x27;ve used in the past. My skin feels so smooth and silky and dare I say younger? My skin is a little sensitive, especially near the eyes and this product has caused no problems at all. I&#x27;m super impressed and will continue to use it every night.</li>
            <li> This is too greasy for me,  People seem to love it but not for me.  Prefer olay 7 effects - much drier, more effective.</li>
            <li> You can see the results from this within weeks. It does the job it advertises it will do. What more could you want?</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a year now and as with all Eucerin products it is the best. There are products on the market that are selling for 5 times what this cost and this is every bit as good. I&#x27;m 70 years old and look 10 to 20 years younger. This product makes my facial skin soft and moist looking. The first few times I applied it I could feel my skin tightening particularly around the eyes. I use about a jar a month as I apply it morning and evening.</li>
            <li> Love this Eucerin cream . It goes in so smoothly and is a wonderful product. Love all Eucerin face products.</li>
            <li> Just got it, never tried before. Now that my heat is on every day my skin is very dry. This absorbed for me real good, I must be really dry! This AM my face was sooo soft. I put more on and it took a couple extra minutes to sink in because I still had last nights on. Can&#x27;t speak for wrinkles yet but I like it so far. I don&#x27;t smell anything that others smell. To me it has no smell, maybe I&#x27;m stuffy. I&#x27;m only rating it 4 because I have no high hopes for actually working on real wrinkles, maybe fine lines.</li>
            <li> It does not feel greasy and I don&#x27;t break out.  So win-win</li>
            <li> Hard to find Q10 in an affordable brand. This is my second purchase of this lotion. It goes on smoothly, light scent, and skin feels  moisturized.</li>
            <li> very happy !!!!&lt;br /&gt;excellent choice</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this stuff. Tried it for a good couple of weeks and had to stop.  My jawline and chin started to get tiny little clogged pore bumps and some past hormonal acne discoloration started to redden up. I increased my washing and toner regimen for a couple of days after I quit using the product and my skin is back to normal. I will continue to use it for spot treatment under my eyes and on some of my fine lines until i run out, but not for my whole face.</li>
            <li> did not see much difference, but it&#x27;s light so my face feel fresh.</li>
            <li> Its thick, and feels like it leaves a film on your face. I did not feel like my skin soaked it in.</li>
            <li> I see a definite difference in my face since I started using this on a daily basis over the last 60 days.</li>
            <li> perfect for dry winter chapped skin!</li>
            <li> Canada used to sell this product but no longer does, I love it and will be ordering more.  It feels like silk on your skin</li>
            <li> This works great as wrinkle cream and just lotion. I use am and pm. Sometimes mixed with sunscreen. It is pretty thick so does not take much. Does not irritate my skin like a lot of lotions do. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I had never used this item but wanted to try it and got a great bargain..arrived safe and sound..packaged well...I am now a fan of this creme and will order it again...Thanks</li>
            <li> Awesome thick cream, leaves your skin smooth. Just as good as Olay&#x27;s scultpting cream which by the way is $10. more.</li>
            <li> I find this to be an excellent skin care product for face and neck. Visibly reduces signs of wrinkles around my eyes and neck. Definitely improves appearance of face making skin look healthy and younger.  After using for a few days I bought several additional jars as I do not want to run out of Eucerin Q10 Ant-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Creme.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for the second time, I am using it as a night cream, don&#x27;t see the wrinkles disappearing, but my skin is much softer.&lt;br /&gt;I tried using it as a daytime moisturizer, but it made me perspire. A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> nice product.  fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It has soften the many age lines, not so dry looking, and my skin looks more younger.</li>
            <li> Creamy texture is just right for my face--not too heavy nor too light.  I use it as night creme, and I wake up with my face smooth and no irritation!  I especially like its sensitive skin feature.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive acne prone skin. The area around my eyes always seem to be dry and all other eye creams I had used just burned and irritated my skin around my eyes and just made it worse. This is the only cream that does not burn and feels wonderful around my eyes. Very moisturizing and at a great price. I have not used this all over my face because of the fear of a breakout. But for an eye cream it is great!</li>
            <li> I love that this is for sensitive skin I had a hard time finding one my skin feels much better after using it. I just have to get in the habit of using it every night my only complaint is I prefer a light feeling lotion on my face. This does feel heavy and a little greasy I will probably try another one for that reason.</li>
            <li> Great thick cream, helps for forehead area</li>
            <li> This cream works well on my face, neck and hands. It goes on smoothly. Doesn&#x27;t leave residue or grease on the surface. I have been using it for a few months and the outcome is positive.  Recently, I had to purchase a few extra jars because my daughters were stealing from my stash. LOL. Would definitely recommend this cream to others.</li>
            <li> I have been using Clinique and Biotherm face creams for years.  This is a really nicely priced alternative.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This creme is soft and creamy. I use it every night, it&#x27;s not greasy. When I wake up in the morning my skin feels smooth. My skin type is normal to dry, and this is perfect for that.</li>
            <li> comfortable to sensitive skin</li>
            <li> even great on my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally finished my bottle of this stuff. I wanted to wait to review it until I had really given it a chance. I&#x27;d say this lasted me about two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m rating this &#x27;okay&#x27; because this isn&#x27;t amazing. It didn&#x27;t clear the redness like some folks said. My acne was just as bad as before. I didn&#x27;t buy this for acne of course, I&#x27;m just letting those who suffer know this hasn&#x27;t helped it in any event. If the fine lines have diminished, it is very minor. My skin is still dry and does flake in places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say I love the feeling of this. I use it at night and my skin feels very moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I buy it again? No. I will look for something that better targets my issues: redness, drying, acne, AND fine line control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m lucky in that I&#x27;ve been using moisturizers since I was a teenager. At 27, my fine lines aren&#x27;t too bad but I&#x27;m always looking for an amazing product. If anyone has some suggestions for the issues I mentioned, please let me know!</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday.&lt;br /&gt;I have used very expensive creams and the Eucerin goes on just as smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Price is good.&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing I dislike about this product.&lt;br /&gt;The product meets all expectations.</li>
            <li> This goes on smoothly, but is a pretty thick cream, so if you&#x27;re looking for something lightweight, try another product. I use it at bedtime and wake up feeling like my skin has hydrated overnight. I have not noticed an increase or decrease in blemishes or zits. I don&#x27;t notice much difference in fine lines or wrinkles, but I&#x27;ve only been using it a few weeks. If I notice a change, I&#x27;ll update this.</li>
            <li> I feel like as soon as I started to use this, instead of a Curel brand moisturizer, my skin was less irritated.  It is light and smooth and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this anti-wrinkle cream during my quarter life crisis when I turned the ripe age of twenty-something (will not reveal). I was browsing all the anti-aging products I can buy on Amazon. As a twenty-something, my salary, which is not so measly but also far from allowing me to spend $20+ on anti-aging creams, had me limited to the &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; options. But I am so glad I stumbled upon this lovely product! It may not sound a lot as a 1.7 oz jar, but it doesn&#x27;t require you to put on so much on your face since it massages quite thick on the face. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now. I have to admit, I won&#x27;t know how effective it is until I have more defined lines on my face but it makes me feel relieved that I&#x27;ve found a product that will help me target the not-so-many/not-even-there wrinkles on my face.</li>
            <li> I love it. I use it around my eyes every morning and night (as eye creme), and I apply it anywhere on my face that has dry skin. It feels moisture rich, but at the same time is feels light after application. It&#x27;s a great product for a very reasonable price. I will definitely buy them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know if they actually help with wrinkles or not. I have used it over the only deep wrinkle on my face and I can&#x27;t say that I have seen much of a difference except for maybe a little bit of improvement. But I don&#x27;t care! I love this product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I had been using Arbonne Nutrimin C Night Cream for years and liked it, but decided to ditch it mostly because I didn&#x27;t want to be using anything with retynol (Vit A). I have also tried bottles of whatever is supposedly good housekeeping&#x27;s best and those failed miserably--not-to-mention they often have toxic ingredients in them. I have also tried other more expensive q10 products. Normally, I don&#x27;t need that much extra moisture, but I am guilty of over-exfoliating which has reduced freckles but dries my face out. I decided to try this product-- I look up every product on www.ewg.org and this one is just a 2. (Don&#x27;t buy the one with SPF, it&#x27;s a 5!) This is exactly what I need! Non-greesey, absorbs quickly, and almost matte finish. I think it slowly helps with fine lines even around my eyes (it may work as well as my Boots 7 eye cream)! I add a drop of rosehip oil to the cream while I&#x27;m applying to dilute the rosehip smell and get it on snoothly without the oilslick look. This product has no frangrance! I also noticed that after applying, this product is very soothing to my exfoliated skin and tones down redness or pinkness! I read that in reviews, but didn&#x27;t realize I had so much skin irritation until it was gone via this product. Anyway, I will buy again. I am using this container quickly. I do wish it came in a tube for sanitary purposes. Order from Amazon-- best prices!</li>
            <li> Eucerin Q10 is the best anti-wrinkle product I have ever used.  It actually does what it claims and has made my 70-year old skin much more pliable and less wrinkled.  It is a miracle cream!  Once, when I was having blood drawn, the hospital technician asked me what I used on my skin as she found it to be smooth and glowing.  I told her I had used Eucerin Q10 daily for about a month and was very pleased with its performance.  She had me write down the name and said she was going to go right out and buy some.  She was also delighted to know that it is very inexpensive and can be found in drugstores and even Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> I buy this face cream every winter. It works really well for my dry, sensitive skin. No scent, which is a bonus. Also, when my nose is really red, dry, and raw from having a cold, I find that this is gentler than other creams that burn and sting really bad. It is a thick consistency and hydrates very well for me.</li>
            <li> I am a guy in my late 20&#x27;s with super sensitive combination skin: oily on my forehead, dry at my eyelids and upper lip. I&#x27;ve gone through a whole bunch of moisturizers trying to find one that would keep my face hydrated without causing too much oil and shine in some areas and dry and flakiness in other areas of my face. The Eucerin finally allowed me to use a face lotion in the morning and last until I get home in the evening. Before then, I had to carry a face lotion with me all day because the area above my upper lip would dry and flake. This does cause some shininess on my forehead, but I have learned to dilute it some via applying it with slightly wet hands.&lt;br /&gt;What made me realize this product is great is that my girlfriend started using it! She also has sensitive skin and is super picky with her moisturizers too. She used to complain that my moisturizers were too thick and that she could feel it on her skin after application. When hers ran out, I told her to try mine. At first she did complain that it was too thick on application, but that soon was abated once I told her to dilute it with water. She loved it so much that she did not go back to her old moisturizer and took mine when she went home for Christmas break. Now I&#x27;m back on Amazon to buy another one and thought it was time to give this creme a raving review.</li>
            <li> Better late than never! This cream is amazing, it&#x27;s rich without being super greasy and has vitamins (A, C, E), no oils, no parabens, fragrance free it&#x27;s very gentle yet effective. I love it and its now a staple for me. I don&#x27;t know why Eucerin dosent advertise this face cream especally since it has vitamin C and E which is all the rage in anti-aging face products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that it needs to be in a tube not a jar because of the vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingrediants: Water, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Cocoate, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Stearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Octyldodecanol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ubiquinone, Biotin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Zea Mays (Corn) Oil, Beta-Carotine, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Trisodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Phenoxyethanol.</li>
            <li> I use this as a daytime moisturizer. Like that it contains no parabens and my face feels good when I put it on every morning.</li>
            <li> Very good skin creme. I felt after first use how my skin is getting nourished and softer in the morning. I will continue to use Eucerin products for sure. No irritating fragrances. I will not go to expensive skin cremes again, no need really while I use Eucerin.</li>
            <li> This is a very thick moisturizer. I can&#x27;t use it daily or it breaks me out. I&#x27;m hoping I can use it more in winter when my skin is drier.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, dry and peeling on my cheeks and chin, but a bit oily on my t-zone. I&#x27;ve tried Aveeno, Neutrogena, Almay, and Olay to name a few, as well as some very pricey recommendations from some dermatologist and esthetician friends, but nothing beats the feel of my skin when I use this product. It leave my skin soft, but never oily, and it does not clog my pores - all at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to find this at my local grocery store any more, so  I was happy to find it on Amazon.  This is a very affordable product &amp; works well on sensitive skin. I highly recommend this product. I hope Amazon continues to carry it,</li>
            <li> Excellent product, best price, fast delivery</li>
            <li> Like the lightness of the cream.  On my second jar.  Hard to find at retail stores.  I buy it here because of that.</li>
            <li> After I used it for one week, I &#x27;ve got pimple all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;No good on my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream because of all the raving reviews on Amazon.com and on other websites.  I was very excited to use this cream.  After using it for 2 months, here are my thoughts about this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the reasons why I give 3 stars:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The ingredients in this cream is a lot better than most of the drug store creams that contains parabens, fragrances and irritating chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;2) It is a very &amp;#34;affordable&amp;#34; drug store cream.&lt;br /&gt;3) It hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts on my face yet.&lt;br /&gt;4) The thick texture makes it a great neck cream.&lt;br /&gt;5) I like the extremely faint shea butter smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the reasons why I DON&#x27;T like it:&lt;br /&gt;1) The reason why I don&#x27;t think this is an unbelievably great face creme like other reviewers is because it&#x27;s very thick and does not provide enough hydration for my face.  I only use a small amount of this cream and it forms a thick layer on my skin and makes my skin look matte.  If you use too much, you are going to have a thick greasy fatty alcohol layer (hydrogenated alcohols) sitting on your face.&lt;br /&gt;2) I can&#x27;t use this cream during the day because it forms clumps with my sunscreen and foundation. So I can only use this cream at night.  My T-zone started to overproduce oils after a few hours.  I think this is because this cream only forms a BARRIER on your skin to prevent moisture loss, but it does not contain ingredients that penetrate my skin to keep it moisturized.  I use Tazorac for acne so my skin gets dry and peels, which results in excessive oil production.  So using a BARRIER type of face cream does not adequately provide moisture on my face.  My skin still peels during the day and T-zone produces too much oil because my skin is dry, despite that I have this thick cream sitting on top of my face.&lt;br /&gt;3) The &amp;#34;JAR&amp;#34; packaging is very unsanitary!  The packaging doesn&#x27;t protect the antioxidants (e.g. Q10, biotin) in this jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think if you normal, dry, combo skin that is not acne prone, this cream will work great for you.  I have too many skin problems so my skin demands more than this cream can provide.&lt;br /&gt;FYI:  My skin type is sensitive acne prone with deep acne scars and very large pores that are easily clogged.  My cheeks are red, sensitive, dry and peels a lot.</li>
            <li> I actually started using this after a recommendation from my dr when I was using acne cream that dried my face. Now I got my mother hooked onto it also. Her skin has been getting drier with age to the point that Dramatically Different Moisturizer by Clinique was not enough moisture. She puts a little on at night (a little goes a long way) and uses her face&#x27;s natural oils in the morning. Also worked great with my daughter&#x27;s redness from dry facial skin.</li>
            <li> I can always tell about a cream during the change of seasons. Where I think this cream is good, it doesn&#x27;t last throughout the day.   Since I have familial eczema, my skin is dryer than most. I need a moisturize that will last. This doesn&#x27;t do it, nor does hempseed oil, with its lipids that penetrate the skin.  Both of these WORK they just don&#x27;t LAST throughout the day.  I&#x27;ve read up on Na PCA and CeraVe. Since CerVe has a facial moisturizer with an SPF, I&#x27;ve got nothing to lose. Both are less than $15.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and I feel like it really does reduce wrinkles</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  When I run out I can really tell the difference.  Sometimes you can find it at Walgreens but not always.  Glad I can order online when necessary. Don&#x27;t slather it on - you don&#x27;t need too.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a number of years.  This is fairly inexpensive and ffeels grest going on.  Best of all,  it works!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this is the best cream I&#x27;ve ever used on it. I recommend it to everyone and they love it too! It&#x27;s the perfect amount of moisture, it&#x27;s not too heavy. I wish they had one with spf!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 20, and I noticed some wrinkles under my eyes. I decided to give this a shot, and I can honestly say it&#x27;s working AMAZING. I checked the ingredients and it&#x27;s mostly natural stuff, like cocoabutter. Wonderful. Absolutely wonderful. My winkles are already starting to fade and I feel so hydrated! I&#x27;ve only been using it for like 3-4 days now, but I can honestly see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is officially going to be my go-to cream from now on and I&#x27;ll def be repurchasing. Better to start young and prevent the wrinkles than to tackle them when they&#x27;re already there! I recommend this to EVERYONE 20+</li>
            <li> Perfect for my combination skin in the cold of winter.  This moisturizer blends easily, without being too greasy.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but have combo skin, which makes it difficult to find a facial moisturizer that works.</li>
            <li> good seller, good facial cream</li>
            <li> Not sure what all the big deal is about this face cream, it is just a basic moisturizer and that&#x27;s it. The anti-aging ingredients in this are Coenzyme Q10 and Biotin, but the amount of these active ingredients are so trace and minimal that it really doesn&#x27;t make a big difference. That being said, it is certainly a lot better than all those Retinol anti-aging products which are way too harsh and cause horrible irritation. I&#x27;m also glad to see that Eucerin has taken the toxic parabens out of this skin cream, most of their other moisturizers are still loaded with them. Bottom line: not bad not great just a basic skin cream so don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li> Great product, good transaction.  Value price.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> For truly sensitive skin (allergic to all fragrance, Balsam of Peru, gluten, dairy, etc), this cream is a life saver! Makes my facial skin look younger since it&#x27;s not reacting to chemicals and parfum in most other creams.</li>
            <li> This is one of very few skin cremes on the market that I can use because I have allergic reaction to most skin products, even many purportedly made for sensitive skin.  I was really hesitant to buy a product called &amp;#34;creme&amp;#34; for my face because I was concerned that a thick creme would feel heavy and greasy- but this creme is my new favorite facial skin care product.  I really like the way this creme feels upon application as well as all day long.  Thanks, Eucerin, for a product that TRULY is for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I like this - not too expensive, goes on nicely, and does seem to keep my face looking a bit &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Face doesn&#x27;t feel greasy</li>
            <li> Like it. Inexpensive light &amp; no harsh on my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I bought one more for my mom.</li>
            <li> I love this skin cream and so does my skin.  My dermatologist recommended it since I am allergic and sensitive to most products.  I love this product, it does not have any odor, fragrance free without any odd scents.  It It is absorbed quickly into the skin, so it is not sticky or tacky at all.  I use it on my face and neck.  .I do not wear any foundation and I have to say that the appearance and skin tone have evened out slowly. over time, I have been using it for a year now and will continue to use it.  I have received comments about my skin and some have starting using it because of that and they love it too.</li>
            <li> Grease free, light, light smell, good all-day moisture. Heckuva price! I will be using this as my regular face lotion from now on.</li>
            <li> I have tried night creams that are A LOT more expensive than this Eucerin Q10, but none impressed me like this one!!  I am so glad I decided to try this one out.  It is gentle on my face and I saw skin improvement in literally 2 days!  No flaking due to harsh chemicals, smoother, more supple skin, and less redness.  I will recommend this to my mom and sister!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this moisturizer fulfills ! Light, not greasy and absorbs quickly. Definitely will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Rich and creamy without feeling greasy.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Great night cream. I love the way it feels and it doesnt have a sent.</li>
            <li> I am in my thirties and have very dry skin after using Accutane. Been using this for  6 weeks and haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a difference. I use very little at night because it takes a long time to absorb on my skin and still when I go to bed it feels heavy. My skin is extremely sensitive with red spots and this cream doesn&#x27;t help to relief that like it&#x27;s advertised. Perhaps it&#x27;s the chemicals in the cream, not sure but will finish the product because I would hate to see it go to waste.</li>
            <li> I was 36 years all when I started used Eucerin products for my son when he was born 6 years ago. I like all their sking products, but for my personal use, Eucerin q10 antiwrinkle caught my attention. I had tried different products before I found this cream. I am 42 now and I must say that my face and neck look goood!! people tell me that  I look like I am im my 30&#x27;s and for me that is a compliment. I still don&#x27;t understand why I no longer find this cream at the pharmacy or wal-mart. It is a shame that a lot of people people waste their money in more expensive brands at the department stores, which is a rip off, and they miss the chance to find a lot better products at a local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Different from the old version! that I was using everyday. The new version is different ..less in quality than the original version</li>
            <li> I have used this for a year. My eyes are extremely sensitive, so I use this for under eye cream day and night. Haven&#x27;t had a single problem, and it&#x27;s great for short term moisturizing. No idea if it&#x27;s really preventing wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Very rich and creamy.  My dermatologist recommended this after I had a chemical peel, so I figured if it was good after that, it would be good anytime!!  I like it and have just ordered my second jar.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer for over 50.</li>
            <li> i usually use expensive moisturizers but after a friend raved about this I decided to give it a shot. I&#x27;m hooked. I love the consistency of the cream for both day and night use,</li>
            <li> Sensitive skin all my life and finally something that works and doesn&#x27;t irriate me. The nuetrogena one has irritated my skin to no end.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Eucerin. It works. What more can I say?</li>
            <li> Superb quality (my wife said that) and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Good price and a good product.  I will use it again.</li>
            <li> I noticed some smoothing of my skin, but rapidly developed  inflammatory reddened skin and had to discontinue... close but not enough.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing for dry sensitive skin. Shipped after due date but that was because it was around a holiday. No fault of shipper.</li>
            <li> Recommended by a dermatologist. velvety feel, non greasy or waxy...great under makeup. SO glad to be able to get it from Amazon since I can;t find it locally</li>
            <li> This is a lot like the Nivea Visage Q10 that stopped coming to the US and you can buy online still (made by the same company, Beiersdorf, in their factory in Poland). It&#x27;s impressively cheap, it moisturizes really well, you can use it morning or night, it has no fragrance or dye, so you can use it around your eyes without them getting red or swollen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives - it doesn&#x27;t have the immediate effectiveness that retinol products do, then again you can&#x27;t use those during the day. Also, an sunscnreen would make this more useful. I&#x27;m not a fan of using many different lotions, so I&#x27;m unlikely to buy this again, as it&#x27;s neither an ideal night nor day lotion, even if it is a great value and a solid product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very mild and seeps into the skin right away.  Leaves no greasy spots and works well to make skin feel more youthful.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for good quality night creme since the past couple of years.  This is definitely the one of the best.  Good quality ingredients.  It is gentle on the face, and moisturize the right way.</li>
            <li> I have very mild acne, oily skin that can dry out in some places. As a 37 year old woman I need to find a moisturizer that wasn&#x27;t greasy, but moisturized and helped with my oncoming wrinkles. This is a wonderful product to use day or night. It can be a touch on the heavy side, but I just use a small amount and dab my face after 10 minutes with a cloth, no problem.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and have noticed I have fewer wrinkles or at least less noticeable. Having sensitive skin a lot of products make me break out. This one doesn&#x27;t. A little goes a long way. I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Tried for the first time this cream and I am satisfied, easy to apply and very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Works! Diesnt do miracles but makes skin looks much better in a few uses</li>
            <li> No miracles here at all, and DOES NOT reduce, much less eliminate wrinkles at all either but it does no harm at least. It seems to be a pretty good moisturizer and in the process it does soften the skin a bit for a while and makes it appear a small amount healthier I guess and as the skin plumps as it takes on the moisture, it looks like it has less wrinkles but that is very short lived and only the very tiny wrinkles at that. NO WRINKLES removed or lessened as usual, but in this country ....companies can sell and say anything they want to and lie and mislead all they feel like while our government does NOTHING to anyone to protect it&#x27;s citizens.&lt;br /&gt;I use this one because it does NOT do what they all say they will of course, but this one is at least less expensive and does as much or more than the pricier ones. After buying all these products for several years now I see the deal is as companies must look at the results under a \\&quot;ULTRA POWERFUL beam electron microscope\\&quot; to measure any actual results and what WE GET can&#x27;t be seen with the naked eye. Funny how that works huh??? All this while our corrupt government does nothing to protect any of us and just screams at us to keep buying so they can get their hand-outs... It breaks my heart.</li>
            <li> Smooth applying, light, absorbs easily. I&#x27;ve used this for years and will continue to use it for its gentle hydrating, non irrtating, non-greasy,  moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li> Wow!  This stuff is great.  I use it on my neck and the dry parts of my face each night.  No odor at all.  I have already bought another jar of it.</li>
            <li> Great creme, really moisturizes.</li>
            <li> I gave up all other moisturizers for this one about 15 years ago.  I have extremely dry skin and must moisturize twice daily or more often. I don&#x27;t know about the wrinkle thing, but I am 67 and have more than I had 10 years ago.  But my skin still looks younger than others my age.  Good genes or good product?  This is Eucerin.  So it is hypoallergenic.  No perfumes.  My skin is soft and supple from this product. At this price, you should give it a try.  I really doubt it will end up in the discards pile until the last morsel has been used on your skin.</li>
            <li> can use for a long time</li>
            <li> i &#x27;ve applied it several times, but can not absorb and i feel ichy, i feel sorry it&#x27;s too greasy for my skin.</li>
            <li> After using this, nothing else compares for my skin. I am a 34-year-old woman with sensitive skin that is breakout prone, and I&#x27;ve not had any problems with my skin since using this moisturizer (going on 5 years now). It was recommended to me by a dermatologist. Also, somewhat related, I look 10 years younger than my age, and I think part of it is because I have taken care of my skin so I&#x27;m pretty picky!</li>
            <li> I have been through several jars of this product, and will continue to buy.  The consistency is butter-like, no fragrance, and it is one of the best under-makeup moisturizers that I have ever seen.  (don&#x27;t apply to your T-zone, though.)  Replaces primer, and is good for your skin.  It doesn&#x27;t take long to sink in, and if I touch my face hours later, it still feels very soft.  Amazon is the only place that I can get it besides my local Walgreens, where it sells for $13.  Also really excellent for sensitive skin--I have had no problems with it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  I use a q-tip to get it out of the jar--that way my fingers aren&#x27;t contaminating the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update December 2016:  Still the best cream that I have ever used for sensitive skin!  My eyes are particularly sensitive.  I have accidently (I&#x27;m older and blind without my glasses) put this right IN my eye--and still no irritation.  And despite that fact that I am 58 years old, I have very few wrinkles, and I&#x27;m often mistaken for someone much younger.  What more do you want?</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and have found it to be perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li> Found this at my local grocery store, looking for a good face cream.  My cheeks are quite dry and sensitive but this product fights both those problems.</li>
            <li> Love the price! I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months now. I use it mostly as an eye cream and it has been really helping diminish those little eye creases that arrived around my 30th bday. However, I have combination/oily skin (aka tempermental, breakout prone skin that even freaks out over face wash) and sadly cannot use this on the rest of my face, as it gives me breakouts. The up-side is that it lasts forever since I&#x27;m using it so sparingly! I definitely would recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> Well first let me say,i don&#x27;t have wrinkles or hard lines(im in my 20s) i use anti-wrinkles washes and creams to hopefully help prevent them in the future,so i can&#x27;t comment from an anti-wrinkle view point however i have very oily,sensitive skin that can easily get a small break out. I started using this among other products and started to notice i would get small breakouts, i figured it must be the other new product cleansers and toners i was using cause eucerin has never given me breakouts,so i stopped using the other products,and tested this product on certain areas on my face only,and sure enough those exact spots had the new abrasions. I have super oily skin,i believe this product causes clogged pores which leads to the breakouts,i suggest you avoid if you have oily skin,i will continue to use this product of my neck and chest to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use at night with my Paula&#x27;s Choice retinol serum.  I use it around my eyes.  It&#x27;s OK hence the 3 stars.  I don&#x27;t see any changes in my wrinkles or my hooded eye.  It is tinted yellow.  It&#x27;s very emollient.  There is no scent.  Because I only use it around my eyes, this jar will probably last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I did break out when I first used this but otherwise it&#x27;s fantastic. It is the richest cream I&#x27;ve ever used. We&#x27;ll see if it helps my wrinkes.</li>
            <li> Skin felt noticeably softer and smoother after one use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it.  It&#x27;s too heavy for my sensitive skin.  I was looking for something moisturizing for my dry and sensitive skin, but this just seems to sit on my skin and not soak into it.  I&#x27;ll use it for my feet!  Would not recommend to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a moisturizer that feels light on their skin.</li>
            <li> It helps release the wrinkles and keeps moisture all night</li>
            <li> Have finished a jar and its good on my skin.Its non-oily and smooths over well.It feels light weight on skin too.Makes my face look the way it used to look before i had my last baby and  the stress showed on it. Il recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a very rich creme.  Years ago Consumer Reports rated it as tops for actually helping wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and I have no problems with this lotion!</li>
            <li> This product gets 5 starts. its great though I only use at night as there is no spf. Amazon on the other hand gets a 1 star for search features. I specifically searched for under eye cream and this product is what I ended up ordering (Yes I know its my fault for not reading more carefully, thus why the product gets the 5 stars). This is not under eye cream. I LOVE Amazon and am on a first name basis with my UPS lady but I wish they would improve their search engine to show you only items that you are searching for and then maybe draw a line and show you other items that are similar. Something to let you know that you are no longer seeing exact items from your search.</li>
            <li> This is my second jar of eucerin Q10 sensitive cream.  I have this on auto ship.  This cream is calming to my skin. Does not break my skin out.  Absorbs well. Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this product for quite a while now.  Really like it - I use it at night and it&#x27;s not greasy, the fragrance is subtle and I am planning on purchasing again.  I&#x27;ve even noticed that a couple of slightly dark spots on my face have lightened up.........didn&#x27;t expect that!</li>
            <li> This is the only wrinkle cream that I have found that doesn&#x27;t make my acne flare up. Also, my skin feels nice and smooth. Not sure that I look any younger, but it does feel nice!</li>
            <li> A nice balance between a light moisturizer and a heavy cream. Great for dry sensitive skin. Will smooth lines with regular use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few days and already I feel as though I won&#x27;t have as many wrinkles in old age as I otherwise would have.  Just kidding, but hey it makes my face feel smooth and fresh!</li>
            <li> Great stuff, really moisturizes.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this cream and the price is right!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I use it all the time. It even takes the red out of my skin.</li>
            <li> Wrinkles are part of the normal aging process so I don&#x27;t believe my wrinkles could be erased by any cream. However, I do notice when my skin is super dry in the winter months, my wrinkles were accentuated, therefore, my goal is to look for facial creams that can alleviate my super dry skin. In the past, Shisedo was my only choice but the price tag is getting higher and higher. I&#x27;ve been using Eucerin body cream regularly but never knew it also makes facial cream until last November. Bought it on Amazon and has been wonderfully surprised, The cream keep my skin reasonably moist , therefore prevented worsening of wrinkles and saved me money at the same time.</li>
            <li> I am 24 and have been using anti wrinkle creams forever and they make me breakout.  This cream is astounding, I use it after I wash my face and before makeup and even nighttime.  It is thick but not heavy on the face and doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent. It&#x27;s perfect and even arrived way quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> This product is very thick, but a little goes a long way.  It adds much needed moisture to my increasingly dry skin.  I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin, even as a adult, and this hasn&#x27;t caused any flare-ups or sensitivity.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know if it will help the ever-increasing number of expression/sleep lines, but since my skin over the past year has moved from oily to more dry - I realized I needed a heavier cream.  No complaints thus far.</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea and thought that meant I could never use an anti-aging product because it would irritate my sensitive skin. That&#x27;s not the case with this. I absolutely love this creme and use it daily. It soothes my irritated skin and keeps it moisturized throughout the winter. My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t kind it in regular drug stores. Love this product! It&#x27;s a creme though in the truest sense. If you&#x27;re looking for a lightweight lotion this probably isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> yes i like it very much</li>
            <li> This cream works well for my sensitive skin after showers. I&#x27;ve used Eucerin for a few months and have not had any breakouts.</li>
            <li> The lotion seems extra oily which broke my skin out.  I used the remainder as a hand cream and still felt the extra oil.</li>
            <li> Oh wait  what wrinkles they are all gone. I think it is the COQ10. Absorbs nicely. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> First of all, I would like to add that this product is excellent! The price is reasonable and the product works like a charm. The first day I used it, I was highly impressed as it really moisturized the wrinkles and provides an excellent shield. I would definitely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> wife uses this product &amp; has almost no wrinkles, so I keep buying it for her....cheaper than a new wife.</li>
            <li> Lve it, i used this as a moisturizer on cold season it is work for me</li>
            <li> Always a good product.  I use it in place of far more expensive, but not more effective, night creams. Use it.....you will see what I mean.</li>
            <li> Do not use if you have acne prone skin. I ended up with a massive breakouts everywhere the Eucerin cream was used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To test if it was this product causing the breakouts I switched out this Eucerin wrinkle cream for  another moisturizer and maintained the same routine for two weeks (the acne cleared up and was no more than usual). I then switched back to the Eucerin cream while maintaining the same facial routine as before and, within a week, my face broke out terribly again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Eucerin cream might be a good product for wrinkles but not for those with acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> This is for sensitive skin.  I have sensitive skin.  I can&#x27;t use this more often that 2 times a week or else I breakout.  It does provide nice moisture though.</li>
            <li> Eucerin Q-10 is the ONLY eye care product that does not irritate my eyelids. As far as a wrinkle remover, I give it a bit of a lower ranking for me personally. However, for those of us with very sensitive eyes and eyelids, I strongly recommend this product for every day moisturizing of that area of the skin.</li>
            <li> I posted this in hopes that this review will help ladies of color like myself.  I have always had EXTREMELY sensitive skin (i.e. rarely wear makeup, can&#x27;t use any type of SPF-containing products, etc.).  Also, I have dry skin and my large pores give me problems.  As a woman of color, it is hard to find products that correct some of the skin problems we face.  However, this is not one of those.  I absolutely love this product.  Finally, a product that does exactly what it advertises.  I am only on my first jar of the anti-wrinkle cream and I have seen great results.  My pores have shrunk in size, face is smooth and supple, and it stays moisturized throughout the day.  I am in my thirties and loved finding a cream that does seem to slow the aging process. My skin is much smoother, healthier and my complexion (once riddled with dark spots) is more even now.  If you are a woman of color with sensitive skin in need of good moisturizer, try this one and you won&#x27;t regret.  Did I mention it is much easier on the pockets than say Elizabeth Arden?</li>
            <li> I like this cream very much and it agrees with my sensitive skin😊I like the way it goes on and especially that I don&#x27;t feel it!</li>
            <li> I always use this.  It works well and I need the sensitive skin type.</li>
            <li> I order this every 2 months for my mom and she swears by it! She loves the hydration she receives from this, only complaint is that she wishes it wasn&#x27;t so greasy.</li>
            <li> Loving this cream. Goes on thick but feels good and gets face soft</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and chose to purchase this on a snap decision. I&#x27;m so glad I did! It has proven to be our favorite morning moisturizer. I feel lightly uplift my skin all day. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It feels very heavy and greasy on combination skin type, I can&#x27;t stand it even as an evening cream. It now does a great job keeping my elbow moisturized, will not repurchase once it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months now. I like the price, and I like how this makes my skin feel. However, so far I have not noticed any reduction in fine lines.... at all. I am very young but spent too much time in the sun as a teen so my skin is already looking pretty rough. I was hoping this would help but so far it hasn&#x27;t done much. I am going to finish the container and will probably purchase something else unless I start to see better results. I will update my review at that time :)    update: not buying this again. I noticed no reduction in my very fine lines and started to get acne on my forehead. Guess this is too greasy for me!</li>
            <li> This product keeps the skin fairly moist and the price is very reasonable. I am not sure of the amount of Q10 in this product, as I did not notice a dramatic decrease in wrinkles after half the jar is gone.  I may purchase this product again to give it more time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated nightcreams (I have combination - oily skin) because of the nasty greasy feeling I would get waking up in the morning. This cream works great for me, especially during these winter months. I don&#x27;t wake up with the greasy feeling on my face; it feels soft and moistened - now I don&#x27;t have an excuse to not use night cream!</li>
            <li> It irritated and made my skin break out with no good results of use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I have very sensitive skin, and this did not bother me, so that&#x27;s definitely a positive! My skin is also very dry, and this is a nice thick, unscented cream that moisturizes without leaving a greasy feel. As far as the wrinkle reducing power, we&#x27;ll have to see. It claims visible results within 5 weeks, so I&#x27;ll have to wait a little longer. In the meantime, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer for sensitive skin for before bed and under my makeup in the morning.</li>
            <li> I ordered 5-6 sensitive skin cream in a month. I just got very very interested in taking care of my sensitive skin with proper product and after revewing so many different product I could not stop buying them becasue I wanted to experience myself how they worked.&lt;br /&gt;Among 5-6 different cream, this one is the one I am drawn every morning and evening. It feels like this one gives least amount of stress to my sensitive face. It feels safe! Already ordered one more!</li>
            <li> I am cautious about what items I put on my skin and always check the EWG before purchasing. This has a really good rating and is a good price so i purchased it.  My skin is definitely softer and overall i like the product.  But it does have a greasy feeling to it when i first put it on.  But i&#x27;m willing to get over that because it works well.</li>
            <li> Great lotion. Feels good on your skin.</li>
            <li> OK as a moisturizer. Why no UV protection in it?</li>
            <li> Seems to work nicely. Don&#x27;t like the smell, however.</li>
            <li> It is thick and I was worried, as I have super sensitive skin.  I cannot even wear night creams because they are too emollient.  So far, half of a container later, I have not had any breakouts or problems.  I am so surprised.  It seems to be keeping my face moisturized as well.  Great for the price.  I usually buy my face creams from dermatologist or try to find the brands on amazon that I buy at the dermatologist, which are very expensive.</li>
            <li> used this product for 2 weeks. I developed a rash. Not for me</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it. She uses this cream every night after Eucerin Cleanser. She liked this product so much that I decided to buy one for myself as well.</li>
            <li> Been using for a few years and will continue to use.  I LOVE it.  Smells OK (as in doesn&#x27;t have a smell), and does help wrinkles over time.  It also helps reduce my redness.  Skin feels nice and soft.  I happen to have really sensitive skin and this has never irritated it.  Lastly, I swear this has helped with my hormonal adult acne, as it seems to calm my skin.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing but not greasy with mostly ingredients that have a familiar name.</li>
            <li> I really like this. I don&#x27;t know if it does away with wrinkles or anything like that but I have dry and very sensitive skin and this makes it feel human. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, isn&#x27;t scented (what is it with manufacturers feeling they have to inject flowery scents into every creme and lotion? Allergy prone and sensitive skins tend not to do well with added fragrance.). This is soft and creamy and very gentle. It leaves my skin feeling wonderful.</li>
            <li> I can tell the difference in my skin already - so glad I found this!  I love Eucerin products!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy.</li>
            <li> Very good product as describe. God Seller A++++++</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good facial care cream for winter.  I also recommand it to my friend.</li>
            <li> Good product; good value.</li>
            <li> excellent facial moisturizer - heard that they are no longer making it...stock up on Amazon if you love it!</li>
            <li> Love this cream.  It works great and leaves my face feeling nice and supple.  I am fond of Eucerin lotion so I knew this would be a winner!</li>
            <li> Kind of drying, not moisturizing. Kind of disappointed. Will have to keep searching  for a good reasonable face moisturizer. It should not cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> A little greasy but ok.</li>
            <li> Have used this cream for years and it is prescribed by Dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. The consistency is rich and buttery and absorbs well.  It&#x27;s definitely not oily, as your skin sops it right up. It&#x27;s very hydrating and lasts until the morning. I don&#x27;t know if it does anything for wrinkles but I&#x27;ve used this for years and in my 40&#x27;s I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles so I may be able to attribute some of that to this though mostly to genetics.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd jar already.  One lasts for a little more than three months for me.  I apply it to my forehead, my neck and the area under my eyes every night. I see visible improvement on the areas that had noticeable wrinkles/lines after a couple of weeks. It&#x27;s rich but non-greasy. I have mild acne problem but this cream does not cause break out. The price is amazing.  I am so glad that I found this.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t roll off like some night creams, keeps my mature skin fresh and dewy until the next day.</li>
            <li> Its not too thick and can be used day or night.  Don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet, but I like how my face has a healthy glow.  Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still seeing if this is working. Just looking for a my wrinkle to improve but it takes time. Getting back with you soon.</li>
            <li> Works good go&#x27;s on smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Have been buying it for years and haven&#x27;t found anything else that compares.</li>
            <li> Have been using this crème for 12 years. Always leaves my face soft with no greasy feeling. LOL didn&#x27;t do anything for my elder wrinkles, nature is stronger.  Odor free, absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> loved it! love the way it feels and doesnt leave my face greasy</li>
            <li> Been using this for over ten years!! It is the only cream that doesn&#x27;t make me break out or greasy. I swear it keeps my young. I&#x27;m 39 and people think I look younger... The summer I use at nite, and winter I use it twice a day.... A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find an affordable face moisturizer that also has a good EWG rating. That&#x27;s why I love this product. It&#x27;s a good, simple moisturizer and it doesn&#x27;t contain toxic ingredients like a lot of other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Great, affordable cream.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t break out my skin. It is also relatively thick and feels really good on your skin at night. I can&#x27;t tell if the anti wrinkle thing is helping but I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and just use it as a nighttime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> THIS EUCERIN Q10 IS A GREAT CREME TO USE BEFORE YOU GOING TO BED AND BEFORE YOU GO OUTSIDE IN THE SUN.</li>
            <li> I use Eucerin daily lotion for my body, so I purchased this for my face to try it out. Do not see much improvement for the dryness on my skin.</li>
            <li> great moisturizer and seems to hide the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The item arrived promptly and was as described.</li>
            <li> Great product! The cream is very rich and buttery. Has very little sent. It smells like a faint hint of vanilla. I apply the cream only around my eye area. My delicate eye area absorbs the product instantly. The product helps deeply moisturize my skin. Any noticeable wrinkles that I have become very faint! It plumps up my skin. Does not irritate if the cream goes in your eye. You get a lot of product for such a low price. Also I received my package fast. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I used to work at a high end spa but this product is by far amazing and you can&#x27;t beat it for the price</li>
            <li> This creeam is so rich and nourishing to skin. It absorbs quickly and plumps up tired old skin to improve appearance. I&#x27;ve tried many brands and none have compared.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, light weight enough for day wear. Absorbs easily. Did not make my skin break out in to acne. Left me hydrated for at least 4 hours at a time.</li>
            <li> great moisturizing and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure what all the hype is about; I like the feel and weight of the product, but it doesn&#x27;t do much for even light wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The description on box says NON-COMEDOGENIC! That is a LIE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product on one side of my face for a few days! The comedones appeared on ONLY that side! Then I stopped. The comedones went away. Then I tied again, on only one side of my face! The comedones came back after a week.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accept that that the fine wrinkles were very slightly diminished, but the announced &#x27;sensitivity&#x27; advertisements about not making irritations or comedones is complete LIES! THROW THIS 60 dollar Product back at the seller rather than use it!</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It is perfect for my sensitive skin, and I can really tell a difference after just a few weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> Non greasy, and works wonders for all dry skin.</li>
            <li> Good, reasonably priced night cream.  Love that it has no scent.</li>
    </ol>
