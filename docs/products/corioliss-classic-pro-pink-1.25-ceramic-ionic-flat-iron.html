    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> My daughters and I have very curly hair and we have tried a variety of hair straightners.  They never work well and our hair looks frizzy. My friend recommended the Corioliss hair straightner and I bought it for my daughters for Christmas. We are so happy with it, because it made our hair so straight and it was so easy to use. The heat stayed consistent and it looks preaty too.  The dual voltage is a great feature and I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I ordered this straightener thinking it was the Corioliss Pro; I was too excited to see that I got it for such a great price that I didn&#x27;t see the \\&quot;CLASSIC\\&quot; in the title. While this straightener works well, it does tug on my hair. Not a lot, but enough for me to notice it. This straightener heats up quickly; the picture on the website is misleading, the straightener is hot pink (or fuchsia pink) instead of a light pink. The cord is very long and the it has a good weight to it. It&#x27;s not too heavy or too light (I prefer things with a certain weight so I could handle the items better). This overall is a good straightener, it just wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for (so it&#x27;s my bad on my part).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I ended up giving this to my cousin because it pulled out too much hair. She ended up giving it to someone else. Do I need to explain any further?</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron. It works perfect doing a great job smoothing my difficult hair while at the same time is very gentle to my hair, no breakage. My hair is silky, smooth, shiny and what&#x27;s best, no damage so I can use as often as my hair needs to. Definitely the flat iron I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time. Love the pink color as well, very feminine!</li>
            <li> I ordered my Corioliss Flat Iron, promptly received it, and it works great. Just the kind of buying experience you want to have. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST flat iron EVER invented!!! My hair is over processed and this iron seals in my split ends making my hair look even better than before ironing it! I would DEFINITELY recommend this iron to EVERYONE.</li>
            <li> My wife got that Hair Straightener after many years of straightening her hair using blowing fan.&lt;br /&gt;This works great!&lt;br /&gt;First whenever she needs to get ready she is able to do it fast and second its dead quite while the results are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one really worth the money.</li>
            <li> I got the product in a timely manner. I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for a month &amp; it gets my hair really straight! But the last time I used it the red light that indicates it is \\&quot;on\\&quot; keeps turning on &amp; off! I checked my outlets &amp; they work fine. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s some glitch or if my flat iron is defective. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love these flat irons for Christmas I got alot of people them for gifts.   I recommend your flat irons to ALL of my friends.   I&#x27;ve been using Corioliss flat irons since 2007. I&#x27;ve only had to replace mine once only because I dropped it, so it was my fault pretty much. Very durable. Real ceramic and all around the best flat iron I&#x27;ve EVER had.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron! Its small and lightweight but it gets the job done! I have a lot of really frizzy hair so it takes me a while to straighten my hair but with this iron it takes only about and hour! I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product considering the price I paid.  I would&#x27;ve been pretty upset if I paid full price and this was the product I received.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned. Wish I had known about it before I bought those others. It has 100% ceramic plates which is what creates the negative ions--from what I&#x27;ve read. The plates are floating, so you don&#x27;t have to squeeze down hard. You&#x27;ll like this one. Just don&#x27;t drop it; the ceramic is breakable.</li>
            <li> It heats up pretty fast as described.  I have frizzy, wavy and thick hair.  It does a really great job to keep it look shiny and striaght for the whole day.</li>
            <li> Amazing product for the price. Love the swivel cord. I can do my hair in a lot less time and can do a quick touch up the next day. The last flat iron I had would not keep the style (frizz and waves would set in within a couple hours). I would highly recommend this product! [[ASIN:B001G52G50 Corioliss Classic Pro Pink 1.25\\&quot; Ceramic Ionic Flat Iron]]</li>
            <li> Get a CHI. This thing does not run smooth through the hair and it compares to a drugstore conair iron.</li>
            <li> This product was not how it was listed. The straightener wouldn&#x27;t stay at the heat i set it. I have thick, coarse hair so I need it on the highest temperature. It would not hold and it turned off while I was using it. Also, its not the PRO, its the Classic.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best iron I have owned and I have tried many. Its well worth the price and I would definitely buy it again. I have gotten a few as gifts already!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought mine 6-7 years ago and it still works perfectly. It leaves your hair soft, silky, and shiny. Absolutely love this product! Better than the chi!</li>
            <li> As someone else mentioned below, this is not what I expected to receive. They should take the word \\&quot;Pro\\&quot; out of the description and update the picture. The Corioliss straightener I received was only the CLASSIC, not \\&quot;Pro\\&quot; and is a magenta color, not the light pink as shown. The straightener does work well (it&#x27;s a replacement for the one pictured that finally gave out on my after 5 years of use), just wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting to receive.</li>
            <li> but it works just fine for my hair i don&#x27;t recommend it for super curly hair because it does not do a good job with it if your hair is wavy or a little curly it works fine</li>
            <li> Love this iron, works quickly and leaves your hair super shiny and super soft. You will never go back to the slon to do your hair straight, I know I haven&#x27;t ::)</li>
