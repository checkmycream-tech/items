            <li> Then work approximately a dime size amount of #01, more or less depending upon the amount of hair you have, and work through hair.  </li>
            <li> Blow dry and/or iron.</li>
            <li> Loves this stuff for my very dry and frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of other products but this Redken one is what my hair seems to like!</li>
            <li> To use these products, since they don&#x27;t come with instructions, shampoo as usual, towel dry, use a leave-in conditioner.  </li>

            <li> I stocked up, but I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m going to do when I run out.  </li>
            <li> Hair looks sleek and shiny and stays that way for at least 2+ days.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just so expensive.</li>
            <li> So sad it is discontinued.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed they have stopped making it.  </li>

            <li> Great product wish they still made it</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I hate that it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I have used Redken products for many many years now.  I have tried a few others but nothing comes close to Redken.  I have very thick, italian curly and frizzy hair.  It makes it so smooth and shiny.  I will never try another product this is it for life.  PS  The shipping is extremely fast.  I will order from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> I use this before blowdrying my chemically treated hair, and it makes it softer, smoother, and silkier.  I feel like it helps protect from heat styling, but I still get split ends in the long run, so it&#x27;s hard to say for sure.</li>
            <li> I thought that they were two ounce bottles instead they are two one ounce bottles  I was mistaken about that</li>
            <li> Used this product for years. Easy smoothing for just a little shine, not heavy like some have found to be.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I use a small amount not even the size of a dime on my wet hair and it make it so soft.</li>

            <li> Loves this stuff for my very dry and frizzy hair.  So sad it is discontinued.</li>
            <li> I have always used this and Redken discontinued it. Glad I could get some more. It arrived very quickly too.</li>
            <li> I regularly purchase this Redken series #01 and #12 Redken Straight Align.  If you are like me with curly tending to frizz hair and live in South Florida and want to beat the weather this is the one for you.  #01 Glass Smoothing Serum as pictured provides you with great shine.  And #12 is a wonderful straightening and frizz preventing cream.  To use these products, since they don&#x27;t come with instructions, shampoo as usual, towel dry, use a leave-in conditioner.  Then work approximately a dime size amount of #01, more or less depending upon the amount of hair you have, and work through hair.  Next apply 1 pump, also depending upon amount of hair, of #12 and work that in.  Blow dry and/or iron. Hair looks sleek and shiny and stays that way for at least 2+ days.</li>
            <li> Very good, but expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of other products but this Redken one is what my hair seems to like! This deal for the 2 pack was great too.</li>
