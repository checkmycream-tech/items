            <li>REALLY, REALLY, REALLY GOOD</li>
            <li>but I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>The bottles came in the a nice, neat package.</li>
            <li>Work perfectly for the essential oils I&#x27;m using them for.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re satisfied with their performance.</li>
            <li>They may work good with a much thinner watery substance maybe??</li>
            <li>EASY TO USE AND</li>
            <li>Strong spray and no leaks.</li>
            <li>and they are strong, but they just stop functioning for some reason.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t actually used them yet, but they look like they will work great.</li>
            <li>Okay, anyhow, I ordered these to put my freshly squeezed lemon or lime juice in.  </li>
            <li>I poured them into these, labeled them, and now they are quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>SUPER FINE mist on the sprayers.  </li>
            <li>Good bottles for my essential oil sprays.</li>

            <li>They were packaged well and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Since I no longer make my own Deodorant, I ordered these to put my freshly squeezed Lemon or Lime juice in and store in the refrigerator, WHICH I NOW USE AS NATURAL DEODORANT, AND MIGHT I ADD THEY BOTH WORK</li>
            <li>Good strong sprayer and the lids seal tight as a drum.  </li>

            <li>exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>The bottles are cute, small, fit in one&#x27;s pocketbook, purse or pocket</li>

            <li>I bought these bottles to use with my essential oils and I really like them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried one of the 6 bottles so far</li>
            <li>After about a few days of use, the first bottle I used stopped working properly.  </li>

            <li> Great quality!  Nice for misting!  I use mine for rose water!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried one of the 6 bottles so far but I LOVE IT! The mist is awesome, and the size is perfect for in the go. I used it for mixing Essential Oils for bug spray. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> SO CONVIENT!  EASY TO USE AND SPRAYERS WORK WONDERFULLY!</li>
            <li> They are perfect. Just what I was looking for. They have been used quite a few times and work like they should. Seems to be of good quality. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great bottles and a great price.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Good bottles for my essential oil sprays. All the nozzles work, I had problems with other bottles that were identical to these but with different nozzles. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I love these little bottles for DIY deodorizers/personal scent mixes.</li>
            <li> I bought these bottles to use with my essential oils and I really like them. Strong spray and no leaks. They were packaged well and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Great shipping. The spray is a solid stream not  a must.</li>
            <li> Work perfectly for the essential oils I&#x27;m using them for.</li>
            <li> White disc on sprayer falls of causing the &#x27;spray&amp;#34; to become a dribbling mess. Just some of them. Can&#x27;t use them for my products because of this.</li>
            <li> Great little containers</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> This is just what I wanted to blend some essential oils for spray application. Haven&#x27;t actually used them yet, but they look like they will work great.</li>
            <li> We have used these for various liquids; none with oil for about a month with no problems. We&#x27;re satisfied with their performance.</li>
            <li> I had tons of splash on cologne bottles that I never used because they were inconvenient.  I poured them into these, labeled them, and now they are quick and easy to use.  Good strong sprayer and the lids seal tight as a drum.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Since I no longer make my own Deodorant, I ordered these to put my freshly squeezed Lemon or Lime juice in and store in the refrigerator, WHICH I NOW USE AS NATURAL DEODORANT, AND MIGHT I ADD THEY BOTH WORK REALLY, REALLY, REALLY GOOD AND THEREFORE I WILL NEVER MAKE MY OWN NATURAL DEODORANT AGAIN HAHAHAHAHA.  Okay, anyhow, I ordered these to put my freshly squeezed lemon or lime juice in.  After about a few days of use, the first bottle I used stopped working properly.  Then I tried another, with the same results.  The bottles are cute, small, fit in one&#x27;s pocketbook, purse or pocket and they are strong, but they just stop functioning for some reason.  I thought it was because the unseen pulp from my lemon or lime juice got stuck, so I rinsed out the nozzle and had the same problem. They may work good with a much thinner watery substance maybe?? I even tried widening the bottom opening of the straw part, but it&#x27;s so tiny, that didn&#x27;t work, so I cut a small piece off and they didn&#x27;t help either hehehehe.......These are not good for my freshly squeezed lemon or lime juice at all smh.</li>
            <li> Bought these to make spray blends for my essential oils. The bottles came in the a nice, neat package. The cap twisted on tightly. So far, the only issue I&#x27;m experiencing is when I shake the bottle to mix the blend, a small amount of liquid will leak from the spritzer. If the cap is on, the leak will stay contained in the cap. I haven&#x27;t tried any other bottles before to compare so it&#x27;s possible they may all do that. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great bottle.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price.  SUPER FINE mist on the sprayers.  Works well with &amp;#34;droppers&amp;#34;, too.</li>
