            <li>It&#x27;s a great bronzer</li>
            <li>The brush on the underside is a great bonus.</li>
            <li>It makes me tan and happy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff</li>
            <li>Definitely good for winter when paleness is a problem.  </li>
            <li>My GF liked this product and it looked good on her.</li>
            <li>The tray and brush are so cute!</li>
            <li>Love how this looks!</li>
            <li>i love this bronzer!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Nice shade for winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice shine dimmer, great for travel...only one item needed as blusher right there.</li>
            <li>and I have a very light complexion.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love how it feels and looks.</li>
            <li>I love Physicians Formula.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>really enjoyed this, it lasted all summer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a contour powder not a shimmer bronzer.</li>
            <li>but I like this much better.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found it on Amazon cheaper.</li>
            <li>Pretty colors and loved the shimmer, just broke into a million pieces</li>
            <li>on nicely with large brushes.</li>
            <li>Came in quicker then I expected &amp; I absolutely love this brownser great for contouring</li>
            <li>Found it to be a light bronzer.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and stays on all day</li>
            <li>Easy clean up and the rest was in tact.</li>
            <li>and I am pretty light in skin tone!</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of shimmer.</li>
            <li>and this is the right amount of color for me.  </li>
            <li>therefore there was a nice chunk that broke free and made a mess.</li>
            <li>The colour is very nice and vibrant, and its not overly shimmery like other Physician&#x27;s Formula bronzers.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much of it to brighten your skin.</li>
            <li>booster\\&quot; really does anything and it came with the cheapest brush on earth, but it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and by using a small brush you can select each color for application or use a bigger brush, swirl it up and get a perfect rosy tan glow.</li>
            <li>I hve a very oily face and I apply this on top of my regular foundation</li>
            <li>Gives a nice little glow.  </li>
            <li>Really nice stuff, give you a little glow, not overdone or too bronzy.</li>
            <li>Not for someone with darker complexion or medium who wants a darker bronzer.  </li>
            <li>but it really didn&#x27;t get my skin as tanned as much as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>unfortunately the brush isn&#x27;t the best for application in my opinion so i just use a regular blush brush instead.</li>
            <li>I mainly use this for Countouring and it lasts me all day.</li>
            <li>so this was a little too light for me</li>
            <li>I love how cute the design is, and I always like to wear it on the days I&#x27;m feeling a little blue because it does make me feel a little happier, whether it&#x27;s the actual ingredients in the product or not!!</li>
            <li>It came completely shattered</li>
            <li>appeared old &amp; crumbly</li>
            <li>but I expected more shimmer like there other compacts.  </li>
            <li>Pretty in color but not deep enough for my tan complexion.</li>
            <li>I am a very pale person and it gives me just the right amount of color while still looking natural!</li>
            <li>Usually the brushes that come with makeup are subpar but this one is the right size for sculpting your cheekbones.  </li>

            <li> Terrible product no pigmentation at all and I am pretty light in skin tone! Only used once and have to give it away. BAD BAD BAD!</li>
            <li> Product was just as expected.</li>
            <li> Physcians formula is a reliable brand. The tray and brush are so cute! I love it.</li>
            <li> Found it to be a light bronzer.  I have medium complexion.  I still use it.  Gives a nice little glow.  Not for someone with darker complexion or medium who wants a darker bronzer.  Nice shade for winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes on nicely with large brushes.</li>
            <li> Love how this looks! Just the right amount of shimmer.</li>
            <li> Nice shine dimmer, great for travel...only one item needed as blusher right there. I like this product. Produces no streaks and  perfection in application not necessary!</li>
            <li> The colour is very nice and vibrant, and its not overly shimmery like other Physician&#x27;s Formula bronzers. I love how cute the design is, and I always like to wear it on the days I&#x27;m feeling a little blue because it does make me feel a little happier, whether it&#x27;s the actual ingredients in the product or not!!</li>
            <li> My GF liked this product and it looked good on her.</li>
            <li> i love this bronzer! I am a very pale person and it gives me just the right amount of color while still looking natural! unfortunately the brush isn&#x27;t the best for application in my opinion so i just use a regular blush brush instead. I would buy this again and i definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great product! Came on time with no issues. Just as advertised! Great job guys! I will recomend this to all my friends!</li>
            <li> I bought this about a year ago, I still have plenty left. I love how it feels and looks. I mainly use this for Countouring and it lasts me all day. I hve a very oily face and I apply this on top of my regular foundation</li>
            <li> I like the way it glows, im medium toned skin so this was a little too light for me but i still like it and use it.</li>
            <li> I like this bronzer but it really didn&#x27;t get my skin as tanned as much as I&#x27;d like. It&#x27;s good stuff but I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I ordered it without ever trying it.  Really nice stuff, give you a little glow, not overdone or too bronzy.</li>
            <li> I love Physicians Formula. I don&#x27;t know if the \\&quot;happy booster\\&quot; really does anything and it came with the cheapest brush on earth, but it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and by using a small brush you can select each color for application or use a bigger brush, swirl it up and get a perfect rosy tan glow.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s a great bronzer for sculpting.  Usually the brushes that come with makeup are subpar but this one is the right size for sculpting your cheekbones.  I&#x27;m really happy with this and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use another bronzer.  I&#x27;ve used Tarte, The Balm, NYX and Benefit and this beats all of those for me.  I have very fair skin and this is the right amount of color for me.  I do also have to confess that if you can get it on sale at your local drugstore for cheaper but if you can&#x27;t find, order on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Pretty in color but not deep enough for my tan complexion.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors and loved the shimmer, just broke into a million pieces</li>
            <li> really enjoyed this, it lasted all summer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great bronzer but I expected more shimmer like there other compacts.  It&#x27;s more of a contour powder not a shimmer bronzer. The brush on the underside is a great bonus.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and stays on all day</li>
            <li> It works well to highlight</li>
            <li> It came completely shattered</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It makes me tan and happy.  Definitely good for winter when paleness is a problem.  Apply with a kabuki brush!</li>
            <li> I can hardly see the color on my face and I have a very light complexion. The pink is nonexistent when you actually put it on. It doesn&#x27;t make you &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; IT JUST MAKES YOUR CHEEKS LOOK SHINY and it hardly bronzes. Wish I could get my money back.</li>
            <li> I had bronzer beads before but I like this much better.  I comes with a mirror and small brush for on the go.  You don&#x27;t need very much of it to brighten your skin.</li>
            <li> appeared old &amp; crumbly</li>
            <li> Came in quicker then I expected &amp; I absolutely love this brownser great for contouring</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for 6 years now. Glad I found it on Amazon cheaper. My only complaint is when it was shipped/packaged it was not packaged plush enough therefore there was a nice chunk that broke free and made a mess. Easy clean up and the rest was in tact.</li>
