            <li>This is really great shampoo if you have oily scalp or dandruff.</li>
            <li>I guess it served its purpose, will keep using with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The masques are also incredible but I because my hair is fine</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel, but I especially am very pleased with the results of using this exfoliant product!  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo for dandruff!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of dandruff shampoos of varying price points and this is by far THE BEST.</li>
            <li>After just ONE use my hair felt and looked better.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a difference after using this shampoo for several weeks now and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Great product and way more affordable than at the high end salons.</li>
            <li>Best dandruff shampoo and doesn&#x27;t dry your hair.</li>
            <li>I did two shampoos then conditioned with Kerastase Lait Cristalliste conditioner which is perfect for oily scalp and dry ends.</li>
            <li>Good choice for those who need to use this kind of shampoo frequently.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I am so excited to find that amazon carries this</li>
            <li>It really does clear up build up, but you don&#x27;t get the greatest hair.  </li>
            <li>I find the Cristalliste conditioner works perfect even leaving a little on my ends without washing out.</li>
            <li>But it is SO worth it!</li>
            <li>Excellent shampoo for dry sensitive scalp!  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve started using this product, my hair appears full, rejuvenated and no sign of scaly scalp or flakes.</li>
            <li>every other day or even longer and my hair is still clean, soft &amp; awesome.</li>
            <li>This Keratase Exfoliant Shampoo works really well and made a huge difference- worth the price for what you get.</li>
            <li>and instantly it was amazing.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t burn like some of them do, but it definitely works effectively.</li>
            <li>What I&#x27;ve done with a lot of success is rotate shampoos and use this every couple days.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>and I got back my healthy glossy hairs with normal scalp!!?</li>
            <li>I could never find anything that would really work.  </li>
            <li>it was causing me some real problems.</li>
            <li>really lather &amp; work in your scalp</li>
            <li>Just because it has a fancy name doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>I love the Kerastase line of hair products and would definitely recommend this one to anyone who has issues with a super dry scalp or dandruff troubles.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>Clean the hair and the scalp, but does not make the hair dry.</li>
            <li>it really works, i had been using tea tree paul mitchell conditioner and shampoo, I wanted to try something more sophisticated, I have dry hair and live on dry weather lots of dandruff fall and winter, dandruff is gone in a week, only washing it every other day.  </li>
            <li>I have had some results with the last medicated shampoo, but it rarely took care of the product completely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments on my hair in a month than for the past 10 years.</li>
            <li>Once I started using this, my hair is back to being able to last 2-3 days with limited use.</li>
            <li>In just a few washings, my scalp was clean and my hair was shiny and stronger than normal.</li>
            <li>Combined with lait vital.</li>
            <li>I noticed a decrease in my dandruff after just two uses and completely gone by the 4th.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many shampoos including at least 5 prescription shampoos from the dermatologist.</li>
            <li>After about 2-3 weeks the dermatitis is completely gone.</li>
            <li>It also makes hair shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed I do not need to wash my hair as frequently since using this product.</li>
            <li>I use this once a week to clear my scalp of all of the products (dry shampoo especially) that I use daily.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It also lathers really well so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is definitely my miracle cure as I tend to get dry scalp/dandruff in the winter.  </li>
            <li> i have dry scalp (this is NOT the same as dandruff).</li>
            <li> Only product I can trust to remove my dry itchy scalp</li>
            <li> I used Aveda scalp therapy products before purchasing this but that did not work well in the long term.</li>
            <li> It eased the dry scalp a lot</li>
            <li> but my hair got dry while using it.</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair every other day because I have a very dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> And the little blue plastic pieces meant to be &amp;#34;exfoliants&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> One bad thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t lather too well, so you end up using more than what is prescribed</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> Dry Scalp and dandruff problems solved!!</li>
            <li> It also came a lot sooner than the expected delivery date!</li>
            <li> it came in quite a small bottle (the amount is listed, I just obviously didn&#x27;t pay attention to that!).  </li>
            <li> If you have  a dry scalp problem, you must try this!!!</li>
            <li> At first, I was a little surprised (and somewhat disappointed)</li>
            <li> My scalp is definitely less flaky.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a shampoo like this for a long time and it doesn&#x27;t have a horrible smell like most do.</li>
            <li> I should also mention I was using Neutrogena T/Sal Shampoo and found that it made my scalp condition worse even leaving on for several minutes as advised.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have to shampoo everyday...</li>
            <li> So heavily fragranced that it makes my nose hurt.</li>
            <li> I have been troubled with dermatitis on my head for 20 plus years.</li>
            <li> i would try all kinds of shampoos from organic to expensive.</li>
            <li> Every fall and winter, without fail, dandruff finds me.</li>

            <li> I have been searching for a shampoo like this for a long time and it doesn&#x27;t have a horrible smell like most do. Is working wonders and not drying out my color treated hair. I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo for dandruff! It also came a lot sooner than the expected delivery date!</li>
            <li> My dandruff did go away. One bad thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t lather too well, so you end up using more than what is prescribed</li>

            <li> This is really great shampoo if you have oily scalp or dandruff. It also lathers really well so a little goes a long way. I did two shampoos then conditioned with Kerastase Lait Cristalliste conditioner which is perfect for oily scalp and dry ends. Then with my hair semi-dry (damp) I apply Kerastase Resistance Ciment Thermique then blow-dry. Three of the best Keratase products in my opinion. The masques are also incredible but I because my hair is fine I find the Cristalliste conditioner works perfect even leaving a little on my ends without washing out. I should also mention I was using Neutrogena T/Sal Shampoo and found that it made my scalp condition worse even leaving on for several minutes as advised. This Keratase Exfoliant Shampoo works really well and made a huge difference- worth the price for what you get.</li>

            <li> Great product and way more affordable than at the high end salons. I love this product and I am so excited to find that amazon carries this</li>
            <li> I use this once a week to clear my scalp of all of the products (dry shampoo especially) that I use daily.  It works wonders.  Before I found this, my hair would be greasy after one day of not washing.  Once I started using this, my hair is back to being able to last 2-3 days with limited use.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve had issues with dandruff and hair thinning. Nothing helped my condition. Since I&#x27;ve started using this product, my hair appears full, rejuvenated and no sign of scaly scalp or flakes. I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments on my hair in a month than for the past 10 years. You have to try this.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review before on anything I&#x27;ve purchased.  This product is WONDERFUL! At first, I was a little surprised (and somewhat disappointed) it came in quite a small bottle (the amount is listed, I just obviously didn&#x27;t pay attention to that!).  But it is SO worth it! After just ONE use my hair felt and looked better.  The build-up on my hair was drastically reduced.  I noticed a decrease in my dandruff after just two uses and completely gone by the 4th.  I can not say enough about this!  This is definitely my miracle cure as I tend to get dry scalp/dandruff in the winter.  I could never find anything that would really work.  This has been wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is the best ever product.  It works without any residue.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel, but I especially am very pleased with the results of using this exfoliant product!  I have been troubled with dermatitis on my head for 20 plus years. I have tried many shampoos including at least 5 prescription shampoos from the dermatologist. I have had some results with the last medicated shampoo, but it rarely took care of the product completely. My Beautician offered to try it when I was in to have a haircut and I could see results immediately. After about 2-3 weeks the dermatitis is completely gone.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo for dry sensitive scalp!  It also makes hair shiny and soft.  I am very happy and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> i have dry scalp (this is NOT the same as dandruff). it was causing me some real problems. nothing was working. i would try all kinds of shampoos from organic to expensive. nothing worked and it was embarassing. then a hair salon stylist introduced me to this. and instantly it was amazing. wash your hair twice with this. really lather &amp; work in your scalp and you&#x27;ll be amazed. i don&#x27;t have to shampoo everyday... every other day or even longer and my hair is still clean, soft &amp; awesome. I can&#x27;t rate this highly enough, if you have my same problem. I&#x27;ve even introudced it to my husband who has regular dandruff and it worked after one try. amazing.</li>
            <li> So heavily fragranced that it makes my nose hurt. And the little blue plastic pieces meant to be &amp;#34;exfoliants&amp;#34;? No thanks. Just because it has a fancy name doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair every other day because I have a very dry scalp.  However, with that said since I don&#x27;t wash it every day my scalp tends to flake.  I have noticed a difference after using this shampoo for several weeks now and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  My scalp is definitely less flaky.</li>
            <li> If you have  a dry scalp problem, you must try this!!! I used Aveda scalp therapy products before purchasing this but that did not work well in the long term. However, I have been using this for a month and I got back my healthy glossy hairs with normal scalp!!? You must try it!!!!</li>
