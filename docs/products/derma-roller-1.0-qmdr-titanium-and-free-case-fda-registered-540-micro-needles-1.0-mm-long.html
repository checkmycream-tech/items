            <li>I have been reading about the derma rolling process and have been interested in trying it, so I was very happy to be able to try this derma roller for my honest review.</li>
            <li>The new QMD derma roller received, is great !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working pretty good!</li>
            <li>this item shipped very quickly!</li>
            <li>Rolling was easy and I liked the quality of the needles.</li>
            <li>I was glad to use the Derma Roller on both thighs to see the difference.</li>
            <li>I got this because it covers more area.</li>
            <li>I went and read more reviews here</li>
            <li>I am sure</li>
            <li>many users</li>
            <li>Ive got 4 more one the way thru mail for each part of my body areas then just put what bodypart its for</li>
            <li>but they say 2.5-3 is better for the deeper ones</li>
            <li>and now my skin looks a lot better.</li>
            <li>I have more confidence when I go out now</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it for a week, and my skin is improving once more.</li>
            <li>glad I didn&#x27;t start out by using this on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d better stop before I hurt myself.</li>
            <li>Give it a shot or smooth skin!</li>
            <li>I love this needle device</li>
            <li>I am using it for acne scars, mostly ice pick type.</li>
            <li>, I think your skin needs more time to heal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure, if they go away at all.</li>
            <li>You will love the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face looks and feels smooth!</li>
            <li>love love love</li>
            <li>will continue to use and will comment more when I start to see some results.</li>
            <li>Too soon to tell if I will love it or not.</li>
            <li>I have been using my derma roller for about a month now and my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I love the colors that they send me and love that the handle is very unique to hand shape</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>very efficient and good needle size.  </li>
            <li>I got this Derma Roller complimentary to give my honest and unbiased opinion.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to see that this derma roller was registered with the FDA and also has 540 needles which is more than most, so the process wouldn&#x27;t take as long.</li>
            <li>I have bought many of these and given them to female family members as gifts, they all like them, and say that they are very useful, and they work beautifully.</li>
            <li>Instructions were easy to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean and sterile packaging.</li>
            <li>Be sure to clean the head with alcohol after use, as well as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I heard about this product being able to remove scars, so I thought I would try it for the very large scar I have from knee surgery many years ago.  </li>
            <li>derma roller makes the skin sting as if from a mild sunburn, a very tolerable and maybe even somewhat pleasant sensation.</li>
            <li>but it was fine for me..</li>
            <li>unit fits nicely in your hand, and you GENTLY roll over your skin.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to clean</li>
            <li>I got this qmd derma roller online with a promo for getting a free sample for testing.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to have found this quality roller at such a good price.</li>
            <li>Then I gently cleaned my face and started rolling!!!</li>
            <li>This is much nice than another I purchased &amp; at a decent price.</li>
            <li>My review is more about the product itself and how it felt on my first use.</li>
            <li>I made a video on YouTube and one you can view here for a better first time experience.</li>
            <li>The wheel makes squeaky noises upon rolling and is not as discreet as the original Dermaroller.</li>
            <li>I am excited to see my results</li>
            <li>I am very impressed thus far after the first use and will do a second application in three more weeks.</li>
            <li>What I did after preparing the roller I clean the areas where I was going to use the Derma Roller which it was on the outer side of my thighs which I have some stretch marks</li>
            <li>/&gt;The box has easy-to-follow instructions, including good advice, such as to clean the roller and the skin with alcohol before use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having used it twice, I have found that it is not painful to use.</li>
            <li>makes you to red and does not work good</li>
            <li>received this item to test, in exchange for my true and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t consulting a medical professional, best to do that first before using this product.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t consulting a medical professional, best to do that first before using this product.</li>
            <li>Ok first of all let me say that I was scared at first to use this product because I did not know how to use it,So I did lots of research and watch lots of video just to get a glimps of what I had to do and how to use it.</li>
            <li>I have been adequately educated by a representative of Qualizzi Products.</li>
            <li>I have not been adequately trained</li>
            <li>Luckily, it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve done any permanent damage.</li>
            <li>Luckily, it&#x27;s inexpensive because I quit using it.</li>
            <li>As It is my first time I seen a tad bit of a difference on the light stretch marks</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using it, apply what ever skincare product you normally use, your product will work even better after derma rolling.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>The included instructions were really helpful and easy to follow.</li>
            <li>I also found a couple of nice videos on youtube that explains the proper use of this roller.</li>
            <li>and I’m not afraid to go out without make up on.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, the results will be worth it.</li>
            <li>It was nice that the derma roller came sterilized in a vacuum sealed bag.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t familiar with them, they might look more like a crafting or cooking tool than a beauty tool, but they actually DO work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read the directions carefuly, which say to disinfect it before first use, so I just put a little rubbing alchol in a spray bottle and thats worked great.</li>
            <li>Love this roller, can barely feel it</li>
            <li>I do recomend you use a nice moisturizer after treatment so as not to dry your shin.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li>I used it yesterday for first time as I have my previous ones  and my skin has suffered since then ...as if the blades weren&#x27;t  good ..</li>
            <li>My face is much tighter and the bags under my eyes are really smoothing out!!</li>
            <li>I was very, very nervous when I first started.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge reduction in pore size and old acne scars</li>
            <li>It was my first time using a derma roller</li>
            <li>I would repurchase this product and I&#x27;d like to try a love smaller mm.</li>
            <li>I probably should have purchased the .5mm since this was my first time using a dermaroller, but after the first couple of times, I was used to it.</li>
            <li>I also make sure to keep this item as sterile as possible by soaking in rubbing alcohol 90% and cleansing my skin with the alcohol.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a derma roller.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with Derma Roller, so it took a bit to understand how to use it.  </li>
            <li>WOWY now this is my first one</li>
            <li>Obviously, the effects on my skin show there is something more than length of needle involved.</li>
            <li>Will need to wait and see if it actually works after more uses.</li>
            <li>I really hope it does!      </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hurt, but being scared the first time</li>
            <li>This is the first derma roller I have ever purchased and</li>
            <li>Arrived exactly how it was described.</li>
            <li>has they were when I first received it.</li>
            <li>I have been watching videos on derma rolling, so I would be familiar with how to do it and what it entails, so I was able to see the other derma rollers that are out there.</li>
            <li>and I seen a much more of a difference on the deeper ones that had a slight of a light purple color the difference that I notice was that the skin blended in</li>
            <li>This is so easy to do at home for just a few minutes without having to go to a dermatologist and would cost a lot more.  </li>
            <li>Hard to use, but amazing results!</li>
            <li>Rolling this thing across your head first thing in the morning will really wake you up though.</li>
            <li>When I first purchased it I was really nervous about trying it and the needles intimidated me.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks great, I have giant pores and am prone to black heads and acne.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be be high quality, and exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, the 540 Needles that are suppository smaller in diameter due to the diamond shape in the QMD Dermaroller are quite pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>This roller does not hurt as much as I thought and I can already tell the wrinkles between my eyebrows have softened.</li>
            <li>I expected more from this, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t really care for that too much.</li>
            <li>I actually now use a cetaphil oil free lotion afterwards, prefer that.</li>
            <li>As prescription Fast delivery</li>
            <li>so I cant really say whether or not this one worked.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and it did come in a case.</li>
            <li>It is really helping to diminish my scars and stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied and i do plan to buy from this seller again in a few months when i have to replace this unit!</li>
            <li>haha  </li>
            <li>They are marked the same size needles, but maybe one is more blunt or thicker gauge or something.</li>
            <li>It felt nice rolling over my skin, I went in one direction for a few times then changed direction.</li>
            <li>I like my other roller better, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product was exactly as described and is of high quality and rolled seamlessly over my face.  </li>
            <li>So glad I chose this one because it is very well made even down to the holding case!</li>
            <li>You slightly &#x27;injure&#x27; the skin, triggering a response so that it repairs itself better than before.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I applied my Hyaluronic Acid serum afterwards and it still felt like a slight sun burn, but nothing more than that.</li>
            <li>Excellent...simple...very useful for my professional porpuse....a vital complement as part of the Cosmetic Acupuncture.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t unbearable at all, in fact I won&#x27;t be using any with this particular roller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it ONCE and people noticed it the next day that my deep scars were way better</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely working can see the tiny holes and then the redness causing improved circulation and better absorption of my serums ....</li>
            <li>My previous experience with dermal stimulation has been limited to fifty percent shorter 0.5mm needles rather than the more advanced 1.0mm titanium needles featured on this dermal roller from QMD.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use a high quality vitamin C serum after each treatment</li>
            <li>So far haven&#x27;t seen much results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes a good bit of pressure to actually puncture the skin and cause bleeding, but I don&#x27;t think it is necessary to be so aggressive with the first few treatments.</li>
            <li>In about an hour or so, the redness went away and my face looked and felt normal again.</li>
            <li>This is can be used on the eye area and other fine points.</li>
            <li>, now I had deeper stretch marks on one thigh and light stretch marks on the other thigh.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There were parts of my face that were a little more sensitive than others (chin and forehead), but I never felt any pain.</li>
            <li>I liked the way my skin looked the next day, but as far as long term if it actually works, time will tell.</li>
            <li>However, I am not sure that&#x27;s safe with the 1mm needle.</li>
            <li>I will probably buy more at different lengths to take care of other problems I have.</li>
            <li>3 stars, because my skin does look better now that I cut the frequency down enough so my skin has time to heal.</li>
            <li>- I think there may be too many needles; your skin doesn&#x27;t get the same penetration as one with less needles may accomplish.</li>
            <li>because it is a slightly invasive tool, you want everything as clean as possible.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>It comes with a clear plastic storage case.</li>
            <li>and this coming from a skin professional and one that uses derma rollers ...</li>
            <li>I bought this product early in December</li>
            <li>I am 24 and have been struggling with adult acne for 3 years.</li>
            <li>I have tried every treatment under the sun (natural as well as dermatologist prescribed).</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had any rave reviews from friends about how young I&#x27;m looking</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m beginning to see some early results.</li>
            <li>It is a all natural renew and repair item for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money even if you&#x27;re just curious to check it out.</li>
            <li>I started seeing less scarring right away</li>
            <li>Whereas my previous one was comfortable to use, left no marks, and improved my skin, this one left track marks that took days to heal.</li>
            <li>But so far I LIKE IT which is why I am only giving it 4 stars at this time.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary&lt;br /&gt;57 year old male</li>
            <li>or if it is the needle shape with no &#x27;drag and snag&#x27; as I call it.  </li>
            <li>had such success with my previous roller that I expected much the same from this one.</li>
            <li>Once I got brave enough to give it a try, I realized that it really isn&#x27;t painful.  </li>
            <li>but overall I love it pretty mad</li>
            <li>What the Derma Roller is basically doing is stimulating new collagen production by breaking down old scar tissue and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Because new collagen takes at least 4 weeks to generate after an injury, it&#x27;s too soon to tell, but this roller is well made, medical grade, and has a fantastic little case.</li>
            <li>Even when my skin is not broken out in cystic acne, I have scars left from previous years that make me feel extremely self conscious.</li>

            <li> I got this because it covers more area.</li>
            <li> I went and read more reviews here</li>

            <li> many users</li>
            <li> Ive got 4 more one the way thru mail for each part of my body areas then just put what bodypart its for</li>
            <li> but they say 2.5-3 is better for the deeper ones</li>
            <li> and now my skin looks a lot better.</li>
            <li> I have more confidence when I go out now</li>

            <li> I love this needle device</li>
            <li> I am using it for acne scars, mostly ice pick type.</li>
            <li> , I think your skin needs more time to heal.</li>

            <li> You will love the results.&lt;br</li>

            <li> will continue to use and will comment more when I start to see some results.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell if I will love it or not.</li>
            <li> I have been using my derma roller for about a month now and my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> I love the colors that they send me and love that the handle is very unique to hand shape</li>
            <li> Pretty good.</li>
            <li> very efficient and good needle size.  </li>
            <li> I got this Derma Roller complimentary to give my honest and unbiased opinion.  </li>
            <li> I was happy to see that this derma roller was registered with the FDA and also has 540 needles which is more than most, so the process wouldn&#x27;t take as long.</li>
            <li> I have bought many of these and given them to female family members as gifts, they all like them, and say that they are very useful, and they work beautifully.</li>
            <li> Instructions were easy to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean and sterile packaging.</li>
            <li> Be sure to clean the head with alcohol after use, as well as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I heard about this product being able to remove scars, so I thought I would try it for the very large scar I have from knee surgery many years ago.  </li>
            <li> derma roller makes the skin sting as if from a mild sunburn, a very tolerable and maybe even somewhat pleasant sensation.</li>
            <li> but it was fine for me..</li>
            <li> unit fits nicely in your hand, and you GENTLY roll over your skin.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to clean</li>
            <li> I got this qmd derma roller online with a promo for getting a free sample for testing.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have found this quality roller at such a good price.</li>
            <li> Then I gently cleaned my face and started rolling!!!</li>
            <li> This is much nice than another I purchased &amp; at a decent price.</li>
            <li> My review is more about the product itself and how it felt on my first use.</li>
            <li> I made a video on YouTube and one you can view here for a better first time experience.</li>
            <li> The wheel makes squeaky noises upon rolling and is not as discreet as the original Dermaroller.</li>
            <li> I am excited to see my results</li>
            <li> I am very impressed thus far after the first use and will do a second application in three more weeks.</li>
            <li> What I did after preparing the roller I clean the areas where I was going to use the Derma Roller which it was on the outer side of my thighs which I have some stretch marks</li>
            <li> /&gt;The box has easy-to-follow instructions, including good advice, such as to clean the roller and the skin with alcohol before use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having used it twice, I have found that it is not painful to use.</li>
            <li> makes you to red and does not work good</li>
            <li> received this item to test, in exchange for my true and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t consulting a medical professional, best to do that first before using this product.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t consulting a medical professional, best to do that first before using this product.</li>
            <li> Ok first of all let me say that I was scared at first to use this product because I did not know how to use it,So I did lots of research and watch lots of video just to get a glimps of what I had to do and how to use it.</li>
            <li> I have been adequately educated by a representative of Qualizzi Products.</li>
            <li> I have not been adequately trained</li>
            <li> Luckily, it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve done any permanent damage.</li>
            <li> Luckily, it&#x27;s inexpensive because I quit using it.</li>
            <li> As It is my first time I seen a tad bit of a difference on the light stretch marks</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using it, apply what ever skincare product you normally use, your product will work even better after derma rolling.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> The included instructions were really helpful and easy to follow.</li>
            <li> I also found a couple of nice videos on youtube that explains the proper use of this roller.</li>
            <li> and I’m not afraid to go out without make up on.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, the results will be worth it.</li>
            <li> It was nice that the derma roller came sterilized in a vacuum sealed bag.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t familiar with them, they might look more like a crafting or cooking tool than a beauty tool, but they actually DO work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read the directions carefuly, which say to disinfect it before first use, so I just put a little rubbing alchol in a spray bottle and thats worked great.</li>
            <li> Love this roller, can barely feel it</li>
            <li> I do recomend you use a nice moisturizer after treatment so as not to dry your shin.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> I used it yesterday for first time as I have my previous ones  and my skin has suffered since then ...as if the blades weren&#x27;t  good ..</li>
            <li> My face is much tighter and the bags under my eyes are really smoothing out!!</li>
            <li> I was very, very nervous when I first started.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge reduction in pore size and old acne scars</li>
            <li> It was my first time using a derma roller</li>
            <li> I would repurchase this product and I&#x27;d like to try a love smaller mm.</li>
            <li> I probably should have purchased the .5mm since this was my first time using a dermaroller, but after the first couple of times, I was used to it.</li>
            <li> I also make sure to keep this item as sterile as possible by soaking in rubbing alcohol 90% and cleansing my skin with the alcohol.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a derma roller.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Derma Roller, so it took a bit to understand how to use it.  </li>
            <li> WOWY now this is my first one</li>
            <li> Obviously, the effects on my skin show there is something more than length of needle involved.</li>
            <li> Will need to wait and see if it actually works after more uses.</li>
            <li> I really hope it does!      </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt, but being scared the first time</li>
            <li> This is the first derma roller I have ever purchased and</li>
            <li> Arrived exactly how it was described.</li>
            <li> has they were when I first received it.</li>
            <li> I have been watching videos on derma rolling, so I would be familiar with how to do it and what it entails, so I was able to see the other derma rollers that are out there.</li>
            <li> and I seen a much more of a difference on the deeper ones that had a slight of a light purple color the difference that I notice was that the skin blended in</li>
            <li> This is so easy to do at home for just a few minutes without having to go to a dermatologist and would cost a lot more.  </li>
            <li> Hard to use, but amazing results!</li>
            <li> Rolling this thing across your head first thing in the morning will really wake you up though.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased it I was really nervous about trying it and the needles intimidated me.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks great, I have giant pores and am prone to black heads and acne.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be be high quality, and exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the 540 Needles that are suppository smaller in diameter due to the diamond shape in the QMD Dermaroller are quite pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> This roller does not hurt as much as I thought and I can already tell the wrinkles between my eyebrows have softened.</li>
            <li> I expected more from this, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t really care for that too much.</li>
            <li> I actually now use a cetaphil oil free lotion afterwards, prefer that.</li>
            <li> As prescription Fast delivery</li>
            <li> so I cant really say whether or not this one worked.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and it did come in a case.</li>
            <li> It is really helping to diminish my scars and stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied and i do plan to buy from this seller again in a few months when i have to replace this unit!</li>
            <li> haha  </li>
            <li> They are marked the same size needles, but maybe one is more blunt or thicker gauge or something.</li>
            <li> It felt nice rolling over my skin, I went in one direction for a few times then changed direction.</li>
            <li> I like my other roller better, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as described and is of high quality and rolled seamlessly over my face.  </li>
            <li> So glad I chose this one because it is very well made even down to the holding case!</li>
            <li> You slightly &#x27;injure&#x27; the skin, triggering a response so that it repairs itself better than before.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I applied my Hyaluronic Acid serum afterwards and it still felt like a slight sun burn, but nothing more than that.</li>
            <li> Excellent...simple...very useful for my professional porpuse....a vital complement as part of the Cosmetic Acupuncture.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t unbearable at all, in fact I won&#x27;t be using any with this particular roller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it ONCE and people noticed it the next day that my deep scars were way better</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely working can see the tiny holes and then the redness causing improved circulation and better absorption of my serums ....</li>
            <li> My previous experience with dermal stimulation has been limited to fifty percent shorter 0.5mm needles rather than the more advanced 1.0mm titanium needles featured on this dermal roller from QMD.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a high quality vitamin C serum after each treatment</li>
            <li> So far haven&#x27;t seen much results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes a good bit of pressure to actually puncture the skin and cause bleeding, but I don&#x27;t think it is necessary to be so aggressive with the first few treatments.</li>
            <li> In about an hour or so, the redness went away and my face looked and felt normal again.</li>
            <li> This is can be used on the eye area and other fine points.</li>
            <li> , now I had deeper stretch marks on one thigh and light stretch marks on the other thigh.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There were parts of my face that were a little more sensitive than others (chin and forehead), but I never felt any pain.</li>
            <li> I liked the way my skin looked the next day, but as far as long term if it actually works, time will tell.</li>
            <li> However, I am not sure that&#x27;s safe with the 1mm needle.</li>
            <li> I will probably buy more at different lengths to take care of other problems I have.</li>
            <li> 3 stars, because my skin does look better now that I cut the frequency down enough so my skin has time to heal.</li>
            <li> - I think there may be too many needles; your skin doesn&#x27;t get the same penetration as one with less needles may accomplish.</li>
            <li> because it is a slightly invasive tool, you want everything as clean as possible.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> It comes with a clear plastic storage case.</li>
            <li> and this coming from a skin professional and one that uses derma rollers ...</li>
            <li> I bought this product early in December</li>
            <li> I am 24 and have been struggling with adult acne for 3 years.</li>
            <li> I have tried every treatment under the sun (natural as well as dermatologist prescribed).</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any rave reviews from friends about how young I&#x27;m looking</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m beginning to see some early results.</li>
            <li> It is a all natural renew and repair item for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money even if you&#x27;re just curious to check it out.</li>
            <li> I started seeing less scarring right away</li>
            <li> Whereas my previous one was comfortable to use, left no marks, and improved my skin, this one left track marks that took days to heal.</li>
            <li> But so far I LIKE IT which is why I am only giving it 4 stars at this time.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary&lt;br /&gt;57 year old male</li>
            <li> or if it is the needle shape with no &#x27;drag and snag&#x27; as I call it.  </li>
            <li> had such success with my previous roller that I expected much the same from this one.</li>
            <li> Once I got brave enough to give it a try, I realized that it really isn&#x27;t painful.  </li>
            <li> but overall I love it pretty mad</li>
            <li> What the Derma Roller is basically doing is stimulating new collagen production by breaking down old scar tissue and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Because new collagen takes at least 4 weeks to generate after an injury, it&#x27;s too soon to tell, but this roller is well made, medical grade, and has a fantastic little case.</li>
            <li> Even when my skin is not broken out in cystic acne, I have scars left from previous years that make me feel extremely self conscious.</li>
            <li> (I think if it makes you bleed you must be pressing ridiculously hard and you aren&#x27;t doing it right) and as the instructions said I followed the motions described on the paper --vertically, horizontally and diagonally about 10 times.</li>
            <li> Apparently, though the needle length of this product is the same as my previous product, they are not the same.</li>
            <li> This tool isn’t hard to use at all and it really does work on those embarrassing acne scars.</li>
            <li> For example, a page says to numb the area, while another says to use your favorite products you want to go under the dermis...</li>
            <li> I am hoping to see long term results.</li>
            <li> Moderate pressure, carefully applied in repeated sweeps of the area to be treated, will have a noticeable effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this roller for that long, but it does sting.</li>
            <li> The one i received before, wasn&#x27;t as good quality as this one, because the needles where not titanium and not as sharp as these ones, and within a week the needles were dull and useless.</li>
            <li> the Derma Roller creates tiny punctures into the skin (which are not visible, at least for me they weren&#x27;t) and it activates the body&#x27;s wound healing mechanism to promote new collagen and elastin production.</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need to push very hard, or you will draw blood and it looks like a cat scratched you the next day.</li>
            <li> It is the same size as my other derma roller: 1 mm needles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The instructions said to repeat the treatment every 4 to 6 weeks and that seemed like a very long period of time.</li>
            <li> Allow the roller to dry before storage.</li>
            <li> let it compleately dry and returned it to its sturdy keeping case.</li>
            <li> (second week in January 2015) as I had some active cystic acne on my chin and cheeks.</li>
            <li> I read on multiple websites that people have reported seeing changes after their second round of the treatment.</li>
            <li> My small not quite as deep scars are barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> in a way beauty is very painful and ya gotta work on it to get it down like I have just do what I do when your in motion repeat BEAUTIFUL</li>
            <li> and it was not deep anymore after the swelling went down.</li>
            <li> It says to go back and forth in two different directions, one small area at at time.  </li>
            <li> I was using a serum with it and started having little white Heads</li>
            <li> The scar I have been working on actually looks a little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had scratching and lapses of eczema issues as recent as a few</li>
            <li> It was as a I expected.</li>
            <li> I have only had it a few days and have use it every day.  </li>
            <li> I thought that my face would remain red for a few hours, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> However I feel as though the needles aren&#x27;t as sharp as the used to be</li>
            <li> and some people say they use it every other day or every two weeks.</li>
            <li> The instructions have contradictions from one page to the other.</li>
            <li> My other derma roller says I can use it up to twice a day.</li>
            <li> My acne scars are virtually gone after just TWO WEEKS, using it every other day.</li>
            <li> It can lead to extreme infections.</li>
            <li> Not so much in other areas.  </li>
            <li> years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The forgettable consequences of the scratching have left a few dark spots and scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derma rolling will certainly help.</li>
            <li> The action of the 540 tiny needles on the derma roller&#x27;s rotating head stimulates the body&#x27;s inflammatory response, setting off the production of cytokines and a complicated biological defensive process against the irritation, including vasodilation and a concentration of specialized cells that protect and repair</li>
            <li> I feel like I need to press down hard to get it to roll or needle properly.</li>
            <li> I mean... rolling tiny needles over your face?</li>
            <li> On that note DO NOT USE it when you have active breakouts!</li>
            <li> Your skin will be red afterwards and you should not use any makeup on your face for at least a few hours after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once and can see slight changes already.  </li>
            <li> and I see slight changes.  </li>
            <li> I accepted the test to compare with a previously bought derma roller from another seller, because I have some scars in my face, that I want to remove.</li>
            <li> and Im addicted to it although it is painful but honestly</li>
            <li> Its not too painful during the rolling and the feeling after is, to me, like a mild sun burn.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have Lupus and it causes dark spots on my face, so thats where I concintrated my efforts!</li>
            <li> and I could feel the little pin pricks.</li>
            <li> Alas, not all derma rollers are created equal.</li>
            <li> This will eat your skin, I used every day several weeks no results, poor spend</li>
            <li> , I applied 4 per cent lidocaine - the strongest over the counter - and waited a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> however it took a few weeks to receive it .....</li>
            <li> I decreased the frequency of use to every few days instead of daily.</li>
            <li> I have used this on my thighs and there has been a slight improvement in the skin texture over the past few weeks and the three times i rolled that area.</li>
            <li> It did not hurt, I did not press too hard, it didn&#x27;t make me bleed like other reviewers said</li>
            <li> I have this for three weeks now, and it has gotten dull - meaning the needles aren&#x27;t has sharp</li>
            <li> It is painful to use, and a little hard to judge how much pressure to put on the roller.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes felt a bit uncomfortable wearing skirts and dresses above the knee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the diamond shape of the needle is helpful in reducing pain, as I do not have anything else to compare it to.</li>
            <li> Not sure if i needed this one but still work ing it out</li>
            <li> The instructions were so small</li>
            <li> It came on time and I used it just once it&#x27;s not that painful idk if my threshold for pain is high</li>
            <li> I was honestly pretty nervous about using this and was picturing my face being all bloody.</li>
            <li> Maybe I went too hard but after using this thing</li>
            <li> It has been about a month, since I got it and none of the needles have bent nor are they dull.</li>
            <li> Its a slow process of course.</li>
            <li> I want correction, not damage, so will start slow.</li>
            <li> For as small as it is, it packs quite a punch!</li>
            <li> Made my face 10x worse, throwing it in the trash</li>
            <li> When I was finished, my face felt like I had a slight sun burn, but it wasn&#x27;t painful.</li>
            <li> I have applied antibacterial etc since last night and still it looks horrific !</li>
            <li> Sorry I didn&#x27;t know about them sooner.  </li>

            <li> Made my face 10x worse, throwing it in the trash</li>
            <li> So far haven&#x27;t seen much results. I&#x27;ve only used it three times since I got it. I was using a serum with it and started having little white Heads so I&#x27;ll have to try something else with it and see how good it does. I will update my review later. Good customer service :)</li>
            <li> Excellent...simple...very useful for my professional porpuse....a vital complement as part of the Cosmetic Acupuncture.</li>
            <li> Ok first of all let me say that I was scared at first to use this product because I did not know how to use it,So I did lots of research and watch lots of video just to get a glimps of what I had to do and how to use it. I also read the instructions and it was very simple. I seen that there are several types of Derma Roller I received the Derma Roller 1.00mm which has 540 needles.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I am not fond of needles but I know I was the one to have the control. I love the colors that they send me and love that the handle is very unique to hand shape so it won&#x27;t slip. What I did after preparing the roller I clean the areas where I was going to use the Derma Roller which it was on the outer side of my thighs which I have some stretch marks, now I had deeper stretch marks on one thigh and light stretch marks on the other thigh.&lt;br /&gt;So I was glad to use the Derma Roller on both thighs to see the difference. As It is my first time I seen a tad bit of a difference on the light stretch marks and I seen a much more of a difference on the deeper ones that had a slight of a light purple color the difference that I notice was that the skin blended in and it was not deep anymore after the swelling went down. After that I put on some moisturizer to prevent stretch marks and I am going to continue using this product .&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.All opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Good article, happy with my purchase and happy with the seller because the package I get perfect and good time!</li>
            <li> I am changing this rating as I used it yesterday for 1st time ...and this coming from a skin professional and one that uses derma rollers ...I used it yesterday for first time as I have my previous ones  and my skin has suffered since then ...as if the blades weren&#x27;t  good ..I have applied antibacterial etc since last night and still it looks horrific !I would not purchase again this one from this distributor. I just hope now that I can heal this asap with no scarring</li>
            <li> Pretty good. Definitely have seen results. However I feel as though the needles aren&#x27;t as sharp as the used to be (could just be my own perception) after 3 uses. Nonetheless, good purchase.</li>
            <li> These needles do not break the skin- terrible- I returned this!!</li>
            <li> I got this because it covers more area. However, the roller does not rotate smoothly--seems sticky. The worst thing is that the needles do not seem as micro sized as the others I have used and don&#x27;t seem to puncture the skin. I feel like I need to press down hard to get it to roll or needle properly.</li>
            <li> I have been using the roller for a month now, and can already see a difference.  Am hoping for continued improvement as the year progresses.  It is painful to use, and a little hard to judge how much pressure to put on the roller.  I recommend using it the evening prior to having no place to go the next day.  It can leave you looking really red</li>
            <li> I have only used it once so I can&#x27;t attest that it has faded my scars. My review is more about the product itself and how it felt on my first use. I bought this product early in December but I didn&#x27;t try it until this week (second week in January 2015) as I had some active cystic acne on my chin and cheeks. On that note DO NOT USE it when you have active breakouts! Before beginning to use it I also bought rubbing alcohol (91% isopropyl) from CVS. The instruction slip tells you to cleanse the head of the Derma Roller with rubbing alcohol after each use.    I used it on 5 acne scars on my cheek. It did not hurt, I did not press too hard, it didn&#x27;t make me bleed like other reviewers said (I think if it makes you bleed you must be pressing ridiculously hard and you aren&#x27;t doing it right) and as the instructions said I followed the motions described on the paper --vertically, horizontally and diagonally about 10 times. My skin WAS red afterwards but softer. After I finished I applied jojoba oil which works great as a moisturizer for me.    The instructions said to repeat the treatment every 4 to 6 weeks and that seemed like a very long period of time. I went and read more reviews here and some people say they use it every other day or every two weeks. However, I am not sure that&#x27;s safe with the 1mm needle. What the Derma Roller is basically doing is stimulating new collagen production by breaking down old scar tissue and wrinkles. the Derma Roller creates tiny punctures into the skin (which are not visible, at least for me they weren&#x27;t) and it activates the body&#x27;s wound healing mechanism to promote new collagen and elastin production. Because your skin needs time to heal and rebuild it makes sense that with a 1mm needle and 540 needle count on your roller you should only use it once a month. This is what I plan to do. I read on multiple websites that people have reported seeing changes after their second round of the treatment. This will take awhile I am sure but I wouldrather spend $16 on a derma roller and wait a year for my scars to fade than spend $5000+ on laser scar removal.    I am 24 and have been struggling with adult acne for 3 years. Even when my skin is not broken out in cystic acne, I have scars left from previous years that make me feel extremely self conscious. I have tried every treatment under the sun (natural as well as dermatologist prescribed). Switching Birth control pills has helped.    I will update my review as I go. But so far I LIKE IT which is why I am only giving it 4 stars at this time.    PS: I recommend doing this treatment at night. Your skin will be red afterwards and you should not use any makeup on your face for at least a few hours after.</li>
            <li> Love this roller!!! It was my first time using a derma roller and I started off with the 1.00mm. because my skin is congested and resistant and it&#x27;s use to microdermabrasion, peels and laser. I didn&#x27;t order any numbing cream (I forgot) and I rolled without it because I couldn&#x27;t wait. It wasn&#x27;t unbearable at all, in fact I won&#x27;t be using any with this particular roller. Rolling was easy and I liked the quality of the needles. I had peeling the second and third day and my skin was brighter which told me it was working and it did it&#x27;s job wonderfully!!! I would repurchase this product and I&#x27;d like to try a love smaller mm. needle for daily rolling.</li>
            <li> Did not do anything for stretch marks besides irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Gave it away as a gift so I don&#x27;t know what the outcome of the product was</li>
            <li> So far so good. Because new collagen takes at least 4 weeks to generate after an injury, it&#x27;s too soon to tell, but this roller is well made, medical grade, and has a fantastic little case. I will probably buy more at different lengths to take care of other problems I have. Definitely worth the money even if you&#x27;re just curious to check it out.</li>
            <li> Great product. I probably should have purchased the .5mm since this was my first time using a dermaroller, but after the first couple of times, I was used to it. I used this on my face and chest followed by a vitamin C and hyaluronic acid serum. Remember to roll in multiple directions. I also make sure to keep this item as sterile as possible by soaking in rubbing alcohol 90% and cleansing my skin with the alcohol. Allow the roller to dry before storage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had scratching and lapses of eczema issues as recent as a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The forgettable consequences of the scratching have left a few dark spots and scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derma rolling will certainly help. Instructions were easy to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean and sterile packaging. Quality needles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Sent a sample to test and review.</li>
            <li> I have bought many of these and given them to female family members as gifts, they all like them, and say that they are very useful, and they work beautifully.</li>
            <li> Maybe I went too hard but after using this thing but I have seen no results and several days after use my face still stings when I put on moisturizer</li>
            <li> I heard about this product being able to remove scars, so I thought I would try it for the very large scar I have from knee surgery many years ago.  I sometimes felt a bit uncomfortable wearing skirts and dresses above the knee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many users, I was a bit hesitant to try it.. needles into my skin??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it was painless!  No big deal and within a minute the procedure was over.  Very simple product to use, and I look forward to my scar fading in time for the great weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always with any product read the directions and follow them.  Simple as that!</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t familiar with them, they might look more like a crafting or cooking tool than a beauty tool, but they actually DO work.&lt;br /&gt;Basically, the concept is simple, even homeopathic in a way. You slightly &#x27;injure&#x27; the skin, triggering a response so that it repairs itself better than before.&lt;br /&gt;This unit fits nicely in your hand, and you GENTLY roll over your skin. If it hurts, you are pressing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;After using it, apply what ever skincare product you normally use, your product will work even better after derma rolling.&lt;br /&gt;Just remember that because it is a slightly invasive tool, you want everything as clean as possible.&lt;br /&gt;A sample was provided for review</li>
            <li> This is a quality product!  Meets and exceeds all my expectations.  This is my first time using a derma roller. Sorry I didn&#x27;t know about them sooner.  So glad I chose this one because it is very well made even down to the holding case!</li>
            <li> I love this Derma Roller! I am very glad I bought this one and not another one! I have not felt any pain when I use it, but I think it is working, because I feel tickles on my scalp after hours later. (I bought it for loss hair treatment). Thank you so much for the wonderful product!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to start using</li>
            <li> Great Product and recieved as described. I really liked it! very efficient and good needle size.  Recommand it for freinds.</li>
            <li> Seems to be be high quality, and exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used it twice, I have found that it is not painful to use. I am not sure if the diamond shape of the needle is helpful in reducing pain, as I do not have anything else to compare it to. However, the 540 Needles that are suppository smaller in diameter due to the diamond shape in the QMD Dermaroller are quite pleasant to use. You really don&#x27;t need to push very hard, or you will draw blood and it looks like a cat scratched you the next day. I am hoping to see long term results. The price is very good for the quality of materials. I wish they offered replacement heads.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Derma Roller, so it took a bit to understand how to use it.  The instructions have contradictions from one page to the other. For example, a page says to numb the area, while another says to use your favorite products you want to go under the dermis...</li>
            <li> WOWY now this is my first one and Im addicted to it although it is painful but honestly in a way beauty is very painful and ya gotta work on it to get it down like I have just do what I do when your in motion repeat BEAUTIFUL HURTS over n over that how I get thru it and the results are just mindblowing man o man. Ive got 4 more one the way thru mail for each part of my body areas then just put what bodypart its for</li>
            <li> It came on time and I used it just once it&#x27;s not that painful idk if my threshold for pain is high but it was fine for me.. I&#x27;ve used it ONCE and people noticed it the next day that my deep scars were way better I have the 1.0 but they say 2.5-3 is better for the deeper ones so I think ima bump it up a couple sizes cause of the ice pick scars I have but overall I love it pretty mad I didn&#x27;t learn about this sooner but oh  well it is what it is</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  I&#x27;ve used it once and can see slight changes already.  I recommend to purchase a numbing cream before you try this.  I also found a couple of nice videos on youtube that explains the proper use of this roller.</li>
            <li> makes you to red and does not work good</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I had really bad acne growing up and now I have the scars from it which makes me self-conscious. After trying this product I was instantly impressed with the speed in which the scars started to disappear. The included instructions were really helpful and easy to follow. I started seeing less scarring right away and now my skin looks a lot better. I have more confidence when I go out now and I’m not afraid to go out without make up on. This tool isn’t hard to use at all and it really does work on those embarrassing acne scars.</li>
            <li> Save your money. Doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;m following the instructions and I see slight changes.  I hoping that by the end of 2 weeks, my blemish will be gone.  I&#x27;m using a skin bleaching agent that I got from my dermatologist so fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> This is my second micro needle derma roller. It is the same size as my other derma roller: 1 mm needles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had such success with my previous roller that I expected much the same from this one. Alas, not all derma rollers are created equal. Whereas my previous one was comfortable to use, left no marks, and improved my skin, this one left track marks that took days to heal. My skin roughened with time. I decreased the frequency of use to every few days instead of daily. I haven&#x27;t used it for a week, and my skin is improving once more. The scar I have been working on actually looks a little better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t start out by using this on my face. I can&#x27;t imagine what people would have thought happened to me. This roller is definitely harsher than the last. They are marked the same size needles, but maybe one is more blunt or thicker gauge or something. 3 stars, because my skin does look better now that I cut the frequency down enough so my skin has time to heal. I like my other roller better, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review by Qualizzi Products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_______&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 5/20/14: I have been corrected. My other derma roller says I can use it up to twice a day. This one says only once every 4 to 6 weeks. Why the difference? They are both the same size. Obviously, the effects on my skin show there is something more than length of needle involved. I still prefer the gentler 1.0 mm needles that I can use every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE #2 5/20/14: I have been adequately educated by a representative of Qualizzi Products. Apparently, though the needle length of this product is the same as my previous product, they are not the same. This one is made to be used by medical professionals or under medical supervision. I have not been adequately trained so I must not be using it properly. I wish I knew earlier, but I know now. I&#x27;d better stop before I hurt myself. Luckily, it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve done any permanent damage. If you aren&#x27;t consulting a medical professional, best to do that first before using this product. Otherwise, buy another one that is approved to be used by laypeople.e. If you aren&#x27;t consulting a medical professional, best to do that first before using this product.

            <li> I was honestly pretty nervous about using this and was picturing my face being all bloody. You NEED to follow the instructions and maybe even watch a couple of youtube videos of people using this at home but it does work and it&#x27;s not going to make you bleed or die of pain. Give it a shot or smooth skin!</li>
            <li> have only used it once - following guides to use every 4-6 weeks</li>
            <li> Just tried this roller. It did not hurt, but it was uncomfortable. Hopefully, the results will be worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working pretty good!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1492FHBVU4VCI]]I ordered this a couple weeks ago. I was very impressed with the professionalism I received from the company. They sent an e-mail with instructions prior to arrival and cleaning instructions. This roller does not hurt as much as I thought and I can already tell the wrinkles between my eyebrows have softened. I am very impressed thus far after the first use and will do a second application in three more weeks. I made a video on YouTube and one you can view here for a better first time experience. I am very happy with my purchase and impressed so far! The video can be searched under \\&quot;derma roller QMD\\&quot;</li>
            <li> No complaints. works well.  I use it for my scalp before I apply Rogaine.  I&#x27;ve only been doing Rogaine about a month so I can&#x27;t say whether the derma roller in combination is helping or not but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s hurting anything.  Rolling this thing across your head first thing in the morning will really wake you up though.</li>
            <li> Got this 1.0-QMD Derma Roller within a day or two after odering it! This item was received for the purpose of testing for honest and unbiased review. I was impressed with the sealed pachage and nice storing case.  I read the directions carefuly, which say to disinfect it before first use, so I just put a little rubbing alchol in a spray bottle and thats worked great. Then I gently cleaned my face and started rolling!!! It says to go back and forth in two different directions, one small area at at time.  I have Lupus and it causes dark spots on my face, so thats where I concintrated my efforts! It felt nice rolling over my skin, I went in one direction for a few times then changed direction. I did do under my eyes too, because I have bags and wrinkles starting there. After I was done I cleaned it again with the alcohol let it compleately dry and returned it to its sturdy keeping case. My face was tingely and slighty red after use so I knew it was working! My face is much tighter and the bags under my eyes are really smoothing out!! Then I tried the bigger roller head on my legs and it felt like a massgae! I love this needle device and I am going to keep useing it regularly! I do recomend you use a nice moisturizer after treatment so as not to dry your shin.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars from me!</li>
            <li> I expected more from this, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - I think there may be too many needles; your skin doesn&#x27;t get the same penetration as one with less needles may accomplish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this to try and remove some bad scaring; keloids.  It does the job.  I apply honey after I roll the scars.  Hopefully they go away.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this derma roller. For as small as it is, it packs quite a punch! My skin look really good.</li>
            <li> this item shipped very quickly! I am using it for acne scars, mostly ice pick type. I have only used it once, but It did not hurt at all ( I am using the 1 mm ) I liked the way my skin looked the next day, but as far as long term if it actually works, time will tell. I am also using the vitamin C serum after. Will need to wait and see if it actually works after more uses. I really hope it does!      UPDATE! 12-10-2014    I am actually seeing improvement in my scars! I&#x27;m kinda amazed with this product. Its a slow process of course. I used it once a week for 2 weeks, that was maybe to aggressive, I think your skin needs more time to heal. The next time I waited two weeks and then used it again. So I&#x27;ve basically used it about a month now. My small not quite as deep scars are barely noticeable. Going to take longer on the deeper ones I&#x27;m sure, if they go away at all. As I mentioned above I have ice pick acne scarring from battling acne since I was in 6th grade (I&#x27;m now 33). I got the vitamin C with it, I don&#x27;t really care for that too much. I actually now use a cetaphil oil free lotion afterwards, prefer that.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any rave reviews from friends about how young I&#x27;m looking but I&#x27;ve used it twice and will wait for them to start rolling in. It was as a I expected.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my wf so she use it and she like it I don&#x27;t know for what but she happy with the metric roll bcoz it&#x27;s easy to clean</li>
            <li> Amazing!! I started with the .50 and have moved up the the 1.00mm. Simply said... THIS THING WORKS. My acne scars are virtually gone after just TWO WEEKS, using it every other day. If you think about it the technology here is almost mid evil. I mean... rolling tiny needles over your face? Regardless... Don;t walk... RUN to get one. You will love the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary&lt;br /&gt;57 year old male</li>
            <li> Love it! However it is not painless to use! My face looks and feels smooth!</li>
            <li> As prescription Fast delivery</li>
            <li> I have only used the 1mm roller once because it is directed for monthly use; therefore the 4 star rating.  The product was exactly as described and is of high quality and rolled seamlessly over my face.  It arrived on time and packaged properly .  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great item saved me a lot of money!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Received package promptly!  Have only used it once but I already noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> Its for pro use only . It can lead to extreme infections. DO NOT BUY IT!</li>
            <li> This is a good one. Bought another one earlier in the year that had a bigger head. This is can be used on the eye area and other fine points. Precision quality points that also came with a case. This is much nice than another I purchased &amp; at a decent price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a week and I&#x27;m beginning to see some early results. I&#x27;m so glad to have found this quality roller at such a good price.</li>
            <li> I gave this roller a 3 because it did pierce the skin and it didnt hurt.. I purchased it for stretch marks and later found that I should use the 1.5 or 2.0 so I cant really say whether or not this one worked. The shipping was fast and it did come in a case. It is sturdy and well built.</li>
            <li> Not sure if i needed this one but still work ing it out thank u</li>
            <li> This will eat your skin, I used every day several weeks no results, poor spend</li>
            <li> Tried this and didn&#x27;t see any difference. Luckily, it&#x27;s inexpensive because I quit using it.</li>
            <li> awsome a friend told be about this and it has reduced my acne falir up. i will continue to use this product faithfully every six weeks.</li>
            <li> Nice addition to my rigorous skin routine!</li>
            <li> I got this Derma Roller complimentary to give my honest and unbiased opinion.  It&#x27;s a nice Derma Roller with a case.  It is 540 micro needles.  I got this to try on my scars and stretch marks.  It is a all natural renew and repair item for my skin.  This is so easy to do at home for just a few minutes without having to go to a dermatologist and would cost a lot more.  It is really helping to diminish my scars and stretch marks.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  Very nice product.</li>
            <li> I chose the 1mm size, as it is the shortest that the descriptions said was deep enough to stimulate collagen.  It didn&#x27;t hurt, but being scared the first time, I applied 4 per cent lidocaine - the strongest over the counter - and waited a few minutes.  I don&#x27;t know if that is why I had no pain or if it is the needle shape with no &#x27;drag and snag&#x27; as I call it.  I had improvement on my neck and some areas of my face.  Not so much in other areas.  I am going to do it again without the lidocaine.  If it still doesn&#x27;t hurt, I will order longer needles.  What doesn&#x27;t kill us makes us younger.  I will definitely stay with this brand.  I recommend it to people thinking about it.</li>
            <li> I got this qmd derma roller online with a promo for getting a free sample for testing. I accepted the test to compare with a previously bought derma roller from another seller, because I have some scars in my face, that I want to remove. The one i received before, wasn&#x27;t as good quality as this one, because the needles where not titanium and not as sharp as these ones, and within a week the needles were dull and useless. The new QMD derma roller received, is great ! It has been about a month, since I got it and none of the needles have bent nor are they dull. I am very satisfied and i do plan to buy from this seller again in a few months when i have to replace this unit!</li>
            <li> great quality have used one works well.</li>
            <li> The wheel makes squeaky noises upon rolling and is not as discreet as the original Dermaroller. I would not use this on my face because of the track marks, even the slightest.  I have used this on my thighs and there has been a slight improvement in the skin texture over the past few weeks and the three times i rolled that area. I will continue to use this product for that purpose.</li>
            <li> This is the first derma roller I have ever purchased and I am quite satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goods: All needles were even and packaging was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bads: It squeeks. A lot.</li>
            <li> Hard to use, but amazing results!</li>
            <li> My previous experience with dermal stimulation has been limited to fifty percent shorter 0.5mm needles rather than the more advanced 1.0mm titanium needles featured on this dermal roller from QMD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box has easy-to-follow instructions, including good advice, such as to clean the roller and the skin with alcohol before use. I would also advise washing and rinsing the face and hands thoroughly before applying the alcohol, and to give the alcohol time to evaporate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a good bit of pressure to actually puncture the skin and cause bleeding, but I don&#x27;t think it is necessary to be so aggressive with the first few treatments. Moderate pressure, carefully applied in repeated sweeps of the area to be treated, will have a noticeable effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The derma roller makes the skin sting as if from a mild sunburn, a very tolerable and maybe even somewhat pleasant sensation. The action of the 540 tiny needles on the derma roller&#x27;s rotating head stimulates the body&#x27;s inflammatory response, setting off the production of cytokines and a complicated biological defensive process against the irritation, including vasodilation and a concentration of specialized cells that protect and repair the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use of the derma roller followed by application of an effective skin serum will increase the benefits of either treatment. The ideal time to use the derma roller is at night after a shower or bath and before going to sleep, because the skin can then repair itself overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The derma roller device itself is well-made, with a detachable and replaceable swivelling head and a comfortably-curved handle. The lighting in the photographs make it look mint green, but it is really a very sanitary white color. It comes with a clear plastic storage case. Be sure to clean the head with alcohol after use, as well as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was provided for testing and evaluation.</li>
            <li> This product was purchase for hair loss.  I have only had it a few days and have use it every day.  I am excited to see my results</li>
            <li> ......... bought it for a friend</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this roller for that long, but it does sting. I will continue to use it to see if there are any results.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference</li>
            <li> Love this roller, can barely feel it but it&#x27;s definitely working can see the tiny holes and then the redness causing improved circulation and better absorption of my serums ....love love love however it took a few weeks to receive it .....</li>
            <li> Arrived exactly how it was described. Excellent product. QualizziTM Products is #1</li>
            <li> I have this for three weeks now, and it has gotten dull - meaning the needles aren&#x27;t has sharp has they were when I first received it. Is that supposed to happen?</li>
            <li> Received in time stated. Happy with the product and looking forward to seeing results.  I understand it can take a while to see the benefits because the wrinkles didn&#x27;t get here over night! haha  Its not too painful during the rolling and the feeling after is, to me, like a mild sun burn.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use and will comment more when I start to see some results.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell if I will love it or not. I used it on my face, and it was a tad red.  The instructions were so small I almost couldn&#x27;t read them.  I don&#x27;t know how often I can/should use it. I want correction, not damage, so will start slow.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it works</li>
            <li> I have been reading about the derma rolling process and have been interested in trying it, so I was very happy to be able to try this derma roller for my honest review. I have been watching videos on derma rolling, so I would be familiar with how to do it and what it entails, so I was able to see the other derma rollers that are out there. I was happy to see that this derma roller was registered with the FDA and also has 540 needles which is more than most, so the process wouldn&#x27;t take as long. I was very, very nervous when I first started. It was nice that the derma roller came sterilized in a vacuum sealed bag. I started using the roller on my cheek and I could feel the little pin pricks. It didn&#x27;t hurt, but I could feel it. There were parts of my face that were a little more sensitive than others (chin and forehead), but I never felt any pain. I did see redness after I finished each area. When I was finished, my face felt like I had a slight sun burn, but it wasn&#x27;t painful. I applied my Hyaluronic Acid serum afterwards and it still felt like a slight sun burn, but nothing more than that. I thought that my face would remain red for a few hours, but it didn&#x27;t. In about an hour or so, the redness went away and my face looked and felt normal again. I am looking forward to using this again in 4-6 weeks and seeing how it heals my acne scars and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have been using my derma roller for about a month now and my skin has never looked better.  When I first purchased it I was really nervous about trying it and the needles intimidated me.  Once I got brave enough to give it a try, I realized that it really isn&#x27;t painful.  It almost has a numbing sensation and its not even unpleasant.  My skin looks great, I have giant pores and am prone to black heads and acne.  I have noticed a huge reduction in pore size and old acne scars have faded away.  I use a high quality vitamin C serum after each treatment and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the appearance of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;*I received this item to test, in exchange for my true and unbiased review.</li>
