            <li>I love the purpose of these  gloves, protecting your hands from the uv light.</li>

            <li>I recently learned of these remarkable gloves, bought a pair &amp; now am never without them.</li>
            <li>So far I have been very pleased with the gloves.</li>
            <li>Fits great, not tight and it really protected my hands under the UV light at the salon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started using a sunscreen all over my hands then using a lint-free pad with alcohol to clean the nail bed.</li>
            <li>it was  gone,,, clean margins.....</li>
            <li>Great to protect your hands from looking aged and from uv/led lamps.</li>
            <li>I put strong sunscreen on my hands first and then put on  the gloves before my manicure.</li>
            <li>lucky</li>
            <li>Actually ordered a second pair for my best friend.</li>
            <li>Thanks for selling an inexpensive product that easily solves the problem.</li>
            <li>They are very well made, comfortable &amp; durable.</li>
            <li>Overall nice purchase</li>
            <li>and I have already recommended to many of my professional friends.</li>
            <li>THEM VERY MUCH</li>
            <li>it was on my back top shoulder .</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ever purchased or tried the anti uv manicure gloves.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, item exactly as pictured-</li>
            <li>But unless you have long fingers,the edges of the finger tips kept touching my nails while trying to paint them.</li>
            <li>I can do my own nails without be constricted by tight gloves.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had much luck using this product, which I&#x27;d hoped would protect my skin from the UV of the lights.</li>
            <li>the whole 9 yards hospital, pet scan ....</li>
            <li>what you dont know can really kill you.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I feel safer about covering my hands when there was so much hype about UV Rays.  </li>
            <li>They are very confortable and they wash very well.  </li>
            <li>I gave them to 5 other people and they all seem to love them.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re comfortable and long</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>However, the glove&#x27;s fingers are long and the cloth sheds lint, so I can&#x27;t get a clean manicure.</li>
            <li>melinoma cells grow super fast faster than any other cancer .  </li>
            <li>My only concern for the process was sitting under the UV light and how it will affect my skin now and in the future.</li>
            <li>Glove fits well though I prefer to fold it up slightly above the fingers to prevent it from touching wet polish.</li>
            <li>Glove had a large split in the seam so it had to be sent back.  </li>
            <li>Normally I have trouble finding gloves to fit my long fingers and medium to large hands.  </li>
            <li>almost lost my life if i didnt find it early which i did by the grace of God.</li>
            <li>a dermatoligist professional eye can say your life</li>
            <li>I love these gloves They are thick and seem</li>
            <li>NO MORE ULTRA LIGHT FOR GETTING MY NAILS</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the protection these gloves, purchased through Amazon, actually provide.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would have definitely been a problem down the line.&lt;br /&gt;Not very well</li>

            <li> barely went past my wrist.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> The item is what it looks like in the photos and it fits my small hands</li>
            <li> I usually have a reaction to getting my nails done either acrylic or shellac.</li>
            <li> small section of the glove looked as though the cloth was thinning and you could see through it a bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> everyone go to get a skin check  up and seriously its painless</li>
            <li> i looked at it, it was weird</li>
            <li> i felt a stabbing pain there.</li>
            <li> With all of the positives for this review I failed to mention the delivery was ahead of schedule!</li>

            <li> I use these gloves when I get a gel manicure, however, I have no idea if their effective.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect glove to protect my hands from sunburn while driving. I am on a strong medicine that makes me susceptible to burning.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the look of shellac polish.  My only concern for the process was sitting under the UV light and how it will affect my skin now and in the future. So, I ordered the gloves for protection and I must say I am very satisfied. Normally I have trouble finding gloves to fit my long fingers and medium to large hands.  This product fit perfectly and it feels very comfortable. The product exceeded my expectations. With all of the positives for this review I failed to mention the delivery was ahead of schedule!</li>
            <li> Glove fits well though I prefer to fold it up slightly above the fingers to prevent it from touching wet polish. Easy to put on and take off.  More convenient than applying sunblock to protect hand from UV rays.</li>
            <li> I love gel nails bit was concerned with the UV Lights.  I&#x27;ve been diagnosed with Basal Cell Carcinoma several times and I wanted the added protection that the Noca Glove provides.  The feet is perfect.</li>
            <li> I thought the material was too thin and seemed cheap.  Does it work?  I don&#x27;t know, but it seems much better than doing nothing to protect your skin when getting a gel manicure.  I guess I&#x27;ll know in a few years.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. The fit is perfect and my hands are now protected when they are under the UV/LED lights.</li>
            <li> Everyone going to a &amp;#34;nail salon&amp;#34; MUST use this product! Thank you for keeping this economically available! This is a great investment in your skin care!</li>
            <li> I have been doing gel nails for years &amp; have worried about the UV exposure to my hands. I recently learned of these remarkable gloves, bought a pair &amp; now am never without them. They are very well made, comfortable &amp; durable.</li>
            <li> The glove made me feel protective when having my nails done. The shop after seeing me bring my gloves started proving gloves at the shop</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the protection these gloves, purchased through Amazon, actually provide.  There was no discomfort in  the tops of my hands while nails were under the UV light! I have very fair skin and I can fully recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much luck using this product, which I&#x27;d hoped would protect my skin from the UV of the lights. However, the glove&#x27;s fingers are long and the cloth sheds lint, so I can&#x27;t get a clean manicure. I&#x27;ve started using a sunscreen all over my hands then using a lint-free pad with alcohol to clean the nail bed.</li>
            <li> this is a good read for all . i had a melinoma from the sun almost lost my life if i didnt find it early which i did by the grace of God. it was on my back top shoulder . as i was in my pool i felt a stabbing pain there. i looked at it, it was weird so i keep it in my mind finally after a friend went to the doctor for something she saw on her chest... i went . it was fatal a level 3, not stage i was out of my mind with fear.... the whole 9 yards hospital, pet scan .... a living hell. than it was ok it was  gone,,, clean margins..... lucky i found it.......... in 10 years i would have died from it . so as i go i would like to get the gel nails and i did a few times but no more.... doc says no way stay out of u v b or any sun . the gloves worked to protect my skin but no go... cant do it anymore my life is to important . everyone go to get a skin check  up and seriously its painless what you dont know can really kill you. melinoma cells grow super fast faster than any other cancer .  a dermatoligist professional eye can say your life</li>
            <li> Good gloves.  Obviously I have no way of knowing if they actually block UV.  They are comfortable.  My only complaint is that they&#x27;re a little bit too long which means the fingertips tend to &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; my nails.  My hands are about size 7-8, so they would probably fit larger hands perfectly.  I have not yet washed  them, so I don&#x27;t know how they hold up.</li>
            <li> The item is what it looks like in the photos and it fits my small hands it iras received in a timely manor and it  was what I wanted to get. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I love these gloves They are thick and seem well made I&#x27;ve used them several times already. I keep ithem in my glove compartment and just stick them in my purse when I go in to the Nail salon</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, item exactly as pictured- pretty comfortable - perfect for shellac! My salon had never heard of these. Neither had Sally&#x27;s beauty supply, sephora, or ulta.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ever purchased or tried the anti uv manicure gloves. I must say that it was a great purchase. I am not sure how other brands work but this did the trick for me. Fits great, not tight and it really protected my hands under the UV light at the salon.</li>
            <li> Great item that I take to my nail salon as they are yet to supply their own for customers! Longer length on fingers than some other gloves is perfect!</li>
            <li> Good product.  Thanks</li>
            <li> The cotton gloves are excellent, they fit nicely on my large hands, they are soft to the touch and not confining.  I can do my own nails without be constricted by tight gloves.  Overall nice purchase and I have already recommended to many of my professional friends.</li>
            <li> I love the purpose of these  gloves, protecting your hands from the uv light.But unless you have long fingers,the edges of the finger tips kept touching my nails while trying to paint them. You must either roll each finger back or cut some of the end off</li>
            <li> I usually have a reaction to getting my nails done either acrylic or shellac. I&#x27;ve tried different salons and different products and nothing helped until I tried these. Still got a little reaction but nothing like before.</li>
            <li> Whenever I get a gel manicure, I feel better knowing that I have these as protective gloves.  They seem to work very nicely.</li>
            <li> Glove had a large split in the seam so it had to be sent back.  It did arrive in a timely manner, but I went with another glove.</li>
            <li> these are wonderful.  Just what I needed for my Shellac manicures.  Actually ordered a second pair for my best friend.</li>
            <li> The gloves protect my hands when I put them in the UV Lights when I have a manicure.  I feel safer about covering my hands when there was so much hype about UV Rays.  They are very confortable and they wash very well.  I gave them to 5 other people and they all seem to love them.</li>
            <li> Great product to protect your hands from uv light (which can age your hands) while curing your gel nail polish. They&#x27;re comfortable and long so your arms are protected from the UV as well. Thanks for selling an inexpensive product that easily solves the problem.</li>
            <li> The gloves were too short for the UV protection I had in mind.&lt;br /&gt;They barely went past my wrist.&lt;br /&gt;I do not have long or wide hands.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the stitching was unraveling in a couple of spots.&lt;br /&gt;One small section of the glove looked as though the cloth was thinning and you could see through it a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Would have definitely been a problem down the line.&lt;br /&gt;Not very well made.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Best thing I have bought for myself that protects my health.  Amazing how everyone at the salon was shocked to see that they make them... Great to protect your hands from looking aged and from uv/led lamps.</li>
            <li> I bought these gloves to help protect my hands from UV exposure when I do gel manicures. So far I have been very pleased with the gloves. I have rather small hands, so the gloves are slightly too big for me. I have to adjust them well before I start the manicure. But once they are adjusted, I can continue on with my manicure without any problems. I&#x27;m really glad that I found these. The fabric feels nice on my hands. The quality is quite good and I think that these gloves will last along time. This was really a great purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> Great! Wear them every time I go under the UV light. Hold up well.</li>
            <li> Perfect for having Shellac done on my nails.  Even my nail tech wanted to know where I found them.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These gloves allow me to continue having shellac manicures without worrying about the UV rays on my hands. I put strong sunscreen on my hands first and then put on  the gloves before my manicure.</li>
            <li> I HAD A SKIN CANCER REMOVED FROM THE TOP ON MY HAND AND MY DOCTOR TOLD ME NO MORE ULTRA LIGHT FOR GETTING MY NAILS DONE, SO I STARTED LOOKING ON AMAZON AND FOUND THEM AND WENT TO ASK MY dOCTOR ABOUT THEM AND HE SAID IT WAS GREAT. SO NOW I CAN STILL GET MY NAILS DONE.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THEM VERY MUCH</li>
            <li> Not too tight or loose. I&#x27;m a manicurist and these gloves are perfect for doing gel polishes under a UV lamp!</li>
