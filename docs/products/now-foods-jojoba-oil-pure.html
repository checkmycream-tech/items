            <li>I Liked It. :)</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>but my skin was drying out and producing more oils to compensate.</li>
            <li>this could lead to more acne which is why i bought this stuff.</li>
            <li>The package came on time and I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;ve already started recommending it to others who AREN&#x27;T stretching their ears, just for the healthy skin benefits alone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li>I wish I could love this product , but I can not .</li>
            <li>I also use it for my homemade skin care products and they turn out lovely.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>bought the 1 oz, just to try it out, and i love it.</li>
            <li>the most part, I&#x27;ve had the best results when using this oil to \\&quot;fortify\\&quot; my facial and body moisturizers.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes effortlessly, and it has so many uses for it</li>
            <li>Also, what I love about this oil is that there is no fragrance at all.</li>
            <li>the price was more than half&lt;br /&gt;off.</li>
            <li>I love love this oil...</li>
            <li>I really love the jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>but honestly who gets that excited about toiletries</li>
            <li>Its a very good combination for african hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now been about a month since I started using it, and my skin looks great and is clear of acne.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazing for your skin, sinks in beautifully leaving it supple and glowing...</li>
            <li>If you are going natural or just want to take care of your by making it grow stronger, this is a great product to use.</li>
            <li>Good Thanks but have two bottle</li>
            <li>Its very smooth and rich.</li>
            <li>, I just don&#x27;t like how it&#x27;s so oily and can easily pour out.</li>
            <li>they work well together but teatree oil smells strong so get the one with lavender in it.    </li>
            <li>and I was pleased to find out that there was no bad smell to this product at all.</li>
            <li>My hair is of a fine texture, and yet it doesnt seem oily.</li>
            <li>Perfect little bottle to carry in your purse or travel bag..</li>
            <li>I primarily bought this oil based upon the reviews for those who used it on their hair.</li>
            <li>Jojoba doesnt clog pores and leaves skin feeling so silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Overall i&#x27;d say this oil has been good on my curly hair &amp; goes best with Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Shampoo, However when I mix the oil with other shampoo&#x27;s results vary.</li>
            <li>I have mild acne and this never makes me break out especially since I use it in the mixture with peppermint (which is great at fighting acne).&lt;br /&gt;WHEN</li>
            <li>It is so small, but excellent product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I wish I would have bought a bigger bottle when I purchased it, there are so many uses!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light and pure consistency</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil is a wonderful thing, very similar in weight and texture to natural skin oil, and I have always found Now brand to be a reliable source.</li>
            <li>if proactive, clearasil and benzoyl peroxide didnt work for you then try this stuff and some more natural things like tea tree oil. :)</li>
            <li>It is also great for the colder, dry winter months.</li>
            <li>It is light and not greasy, and seems to soak into my skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>I really love this pure oil.</li>
            <li>It is great for rough skin on your feet, it has done wonders.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin that much softer and gives me a more glowy look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy film like Vitamin E to get in my hair.  </li>
            <li>actually make my own shampoos, body washes, face washes and many other bath line products and was very pleased with the effects of the Jojoba Oil added to my bath line.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Its a great combo with other oils, when doing a hot oil treatment or any hair treatment.</li>
            <li>, It gives that extra moisture for my skin all day and it adds a nice sheen to your skin too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather pay a few dollars more to get a clean product from a reputable health-food store.</li>
            <li>It is not sticky, does not have a strong smell, but at the same time, it moisturizes very well and my super-dry skin felt very comfortable during winter time, when the heating in my house drys up my skin.</li>
            <li>skin moisturizer -- was suggested by my Esthetician --- very inexpensive compared to high end treatment products, with even better results for my skin.</li>
            <li>both right</li>
            <li>This is oil people it works, it came to me fresh and all it takes is a little for your skin, hair, hands and really good for your feet.</li>
            <li>The oil smooths and replenishes dry cuticles in amazing way.</li>
            <li>This is a tiny 1 oz bottle but perfect for everyday skin use.</li>
            <li>will definitely be getting more of this oil.</li>
            <li>Before I used jojoba, my hair would always have some frizz/flyways, and squeezing the ends would sound like kind of like stepping on dead leaves!</li>
            <li>This is My first time trying this type of oil.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be happier, although this is my first time trying jojoba.</li>
            <li>Most everyone recommended jojoba oil to help keep my lobes healthy, but I didn&#x27;t want to purchase a huge bottle (in use with a few other things, this 1 ounce bottle will work for me for a good long while) and this size is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>...that didn&#x27;t last too long, but I have continued to use this oil as a moisturizer, and it is working very nicely.  </li>
            <li>I use the pure shea butter</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The product was packaged very well and came with no damage to the bottles at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It Was Very Moisturizing</li>
            <li>and I soon discovered that it doesn&#x27;t take much either.</li>
            <li>Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash, 6-Ounce Pump Bottle]] from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I massage my gauges with it, and i really did notice a difference.</li>
            <li>and I felt like it really helped my skin.</li>
            <li>add about a drop or two of this to my moisturizer and my skin has never been so clear and moisturized as it is right</li>
            <li>It makes for good shave oil, that&#x27;s not crazy expensive like others.</li>
            <li>I used this in combination with my lotion and again, it left my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair very shiny and skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this product to all who would like to purchase it.</li>
            <li>Making it into a squeeze bottle or including a dropper would be great for not only for portioning oil (a little goes a long way), but for preventing spillage.</li>
            <li>When I went to open it, the foil seal popped right off in one piece, which is not usual.</li>
            <li>and I def cannot live without</li>
            <li>You can get a bigger bottom at Sally, whole foods much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I have a very very sensitive sense of smell</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clog pores and leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement as my first bottle was low.  </li>
            <li>Aside from this minor complaint, the product is great; I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>I only use about 2-3 drops at a time, so it really should come in a dropper bottle.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised.</li>
            <li>I also mix it in my Hair butters, I&#x27;m Natural.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and moisterized.</li>
            <li>I have bleached my hair to hell and back, and I have only heard good things about jojoba oil from people who have done the same, so I decided to purchase a small bottle.</li>
            <li>I was honestly surprised how much I received and how long it&#x27;s lasted.</li>
            <li>Its well worth the money if you need a little bit of product</li>
            <li>When i got this i was in shock how small the bottle was, but also how effective this little oil is.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair natural \\&quot;curly girl\\&quot; and wanted some extra oil and softness to my hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone for their hair or body as this oil is 100 percent natural, unlike some other oils I have tried.</li>
            <li>Although it was smaller than I expected, the delivery was lightning fast.</li>
            <li>I also put it on my hands and bare nails when I go to bed to help with the same thing.</li>
            <li>I  have oily skin and bought jojoba oil because like many others I read that it mimic sebum and slow down oil production.</li>
            <li>the only thing I hate is that you have pay so much for so little lol...</li>

            <li> I highly recommend to anyone for their hair or body as this oil is 100 percent natural, unlike some other oils I have tried.</li>
            <li> Although it was smaller than I expected, the delivery was lightning fast.</li>
            <li> I also put it on my hands and bare nails when I go to bed to help with the same thing.</li>
            <li> I  have oily skin and bought jojoba oil because like many others I read that it mimic sebum and slow down oil production.</li>
            <li> the only thing I hate is that you have pay so much for so little lol...</li>
            <li> use only a little because its highly concentrated.</li>
            <li> I use it right out the shower on my wet skin and just let it  \\&quot;marinate\\&quot; for about a few minutes while i do my hair and makeup, then dry off the excess water.</li>
            <li> Now and then I&#x27;ll smooth a few drops through my hair to tame frizz and condition the dry ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All I use is a total of a quarter size and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Finally something that can help cure my ridiculously dry skin in the winter!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that 1 oz doesn&#x27;t go very far!</li>
            <li> Excuse me everyone</li>
            <li> I usually have problems with my address because I live in an apartment</li>
            <li> It also gave me scabs and dry patches .</li>
            <li> Also I wash my hair once every few days but recommend only using this oily on a weekly basis</li>
            <li> I even put it on the ends of my dry hair sometimes and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Obviously a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> So I stretch it by adding it into other oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it on a few blemishes and dry skin spots</li>
            <li> My mixture is mostly the jojoba (because it is a base) then about 10 drops of all the other oils.</li>
            <li> i wash my face in the morning and rinse it off with the shower head at night and that has kept my acne down</li>
            <li> I also use it alone underneath my eyes before bed and have noticed a slight lightening of my dark circles.</li>
            <li> But the oil in this bottle, from this seller, seems off-color and has an odd smell.</li>
            <li> Immediately after using jojoba (2-3 drops on my short-medium length hair), my hair was less frizzy, softer, bouncier, shinier, and healthier appearing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first opened it i was a bit freaked out because of the chunks in it, but then I realized it was because of the cold weather here. :|</li>
            <li> I like how this oil glides on my skin without a heavy residue.</li>
            <li> I plan to use this in my hair regime and I was afraid that the fragrance would interfere in the overall upkeep of my tresses.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very small.</li>
            <li> but in behind I will go to pick up soon</li>
            <li> and it was getting worse.</li>
            <li> I would even say it made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> also used some on my 4 month old nephew&#x27;s cheeks because he has a very bad case of eczema.</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical that an oil would be beneficial to someone with oily skin</li>
            <li> but at the age of twenty-five, I was sick of it...</li>
            <li> Another stupid trend.</li>
            <li> I got very disappointed when I got this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Jojoba oil is a wonderful thing, very similar in weight and texture to natural skin oil, and I have always found Now brand to be a reliable source. But the oil in this bottle, from this seller, seems off-color and has an odd smell. When I went to open it, the foil seal popped right off in one piece, which is not usual. I can&#x27;t help but wonder if the oil had been improperly stored or even adulterated in some way. I will not use this bottle, or buy from this seller again. I&#x27;d rather pay a few dollars more to get a clean product from a reputable health-food store.</li>
            <li> I have never tried Jojoba oil and this stuff works great!!  I use the pure shea butter and I incorporated the oil into my shea butter and I love it, It gives that extra moisture for my skin all day and it adds a nice sheen to your skin too.  I will continue buying this product.  Speedy delivery too.  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Good Thanks but have two bottle no get it yet forgot to but the account number in there but in behind I will go to pick up soon Thanks</li>
            <li> The item arrived actually I think like a day before the actual date it was set to arrive. The Jojoba Oil did not have a smell to it at all. I have a very very sensitive sense of smell and I was pleased to find out that there was no bad smell to this product at all. The product was packaged very well and came with no damage to the bottles at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually make my own shampoos, body washes, face washes and many other bath line products and was very pleased with the effects of the Jojoba Oil added to my bath line.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be getting more of this oil.</li>
            <li> i wash my face in the morning and rinse it off with the shower head at night and that has kept my acne down but my skin was drying out and producing more oils to compensate. this could lead to more acne which is why i bought this stuff. it doesnt clog my pours or give me acne AT ALL! no irritation or anything! i use it after the shower and i just started adding tea tree oil (as an antibactieral) with it. they work well together but teatree oil smells strong so get the one with lavender in it.    if proactive, clearasil and benzoyl peroxide didnt work for you then try this stuff and some more natural things like tea tree oil. :)</li>
            <li> The package came on time and I&#x27;m pleased with it. When I first opened it i was a bit freaked out because of the chunks in it, but then I realized it was because of the cold weather here. :|</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I&#x27;m stretching my ear lobes.  Most everyone recommended jojoba oil to help keep my lobes healthy, but I didn&#x27;t want to purchase a huge bottle (in use with a few other things, this 1 ounce bottle will work for me for a good long while) and this size is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy film like Vitamin E to get in my hair.  I&#x27;ve also used it on a few blemishes and dry skin spots and it&#x27;s definitely something I&#x27;ll keep on hand from now on.  In fact, I&#x27;ve already started recommending it to others who AREN&#x27;T stretching their ears, just for the healthy skin benefits alone.</li>
            <li> Overall i&#x27;d say this oil has been good on my curly hair &amp; goes best with Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Shampoo, However when I mix the oil with other shampoo&#x27;s results vary. Also I wash my hair once every few days but recommend only using this oily on a weekly basis</li>
            <li> I got very disappointed when I got this product. I thought it was bigger...it&#x27;s very small. When I saw the picture, it seemed to be a big bottle; however it is not-just 1oz. You can get a bigger bottom at Sally, whole foods much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I bought this to add to my current face moisturizers and body lotions to give them some help. I sometimes just use it alone. My skin just drinks it up. It is great for rough skin on your feet, it has done wonders. It is also great for the colder, dry winter months.</li>
            <li> If I Could Have Gotten A Bigger Bottle It Would Have Been Great It Was Very Moisturizing To My Skin I Liked It. :)</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair at night to help with the dryness of winter. Obviously a little goes a long way. My hair is of a fine texture, and yet it doesnt seem oily. It absorbs by morning. I also put it on my hands and bare nails when I go to bed to help with the same thing. I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li> Perfect little bottle to carry in your purse or travel bag.. i would use it as a moisturizer at nights only..</li>
            <li> I have bleached my hair to hell and back, and I have only heard good things about jojoba oil from people who have done the same, so I decided to purchase a small bottle. Before I used jojoba, my hair would always have some frizz/flyways, and squeezing the ends would sound like kind of like stepping on dead leaves! Immediately after using jojoba (2-3 drops on my short-medium length hair), my hair was less frizzy, softer, bouncier, shinier, and healthier appearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also started using this as a facial and body moisturizer when I ran out of olive oil. It absorbs perfectly and leaves no oiliness; my skin feels perfectly smooth. After about a week, I noticed my acne was clearing up. I was not expecting that! It&#x27;s now been about a month since I started using it, and my skin looks great and is clear of acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this product is that it does not come in a dropper type bottle. I only use about 2-3 drops at a time, so it really should come in a dropper bottle. Aside from this minor complaint, the product is great; I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Excellent -- it is just as described.  It is not sticky, does not have a strong smell, but at the same time, it moisturizes very well and my super-dry skin felt very comfortable during winter time, when the heating in my house drys up my skin.</li>
            <li> It makes for good shave oil, that&#x27;s not crazy expensive like others. It&#x27;d get 5 start but honestly who gets that excited about toiletries</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to be part of my oil cleansing method for washing my face.  ...that didn&#x27;t last too long, but I have continued to use this oil as a moisturizer, and it is working very nicely.  It is light and not greasy, and seems to soak into my skin quickly.  I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I primarily bought this oil based upon the reviews for those who used it on their hair. I wear my hair natural \\&quot;curly girl\\&quot; and wanted some extra oil and softness to my hair. This worked well for me and I soon discovered that it doesn&#x27;t take much either. I also used this in my bath water along with my bubbles and just a teaspoon in the water. Worked like a dream. I used this in combination with my lotion and again, it left my skin smooth and soft. I highly recommend to anyone for their hair or body as this oil is 100 percent natural, unlike some other oils I have tried.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be smaller but it wasn&#x27;t and I was surprised. Its well worth the money if you need a little bit of product</li>
            <li> I have had acne since I was in middle school but at the age of twenty-five, I was sick of it... and it was getting worse. I went online and I found the website Acne.org. I purchased this 1 ounce and [[ASIN:B0009RFAPY Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash, 6-Ounce Pump Bottle]] from Amazon. I began to use them both right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I add about a drop or two of this to my moisturizer and my skin has never been so clear and moisturized as it is right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical that an oil would be beneficial to someone with oily skin but I am glad I was wrong. This stuff is amazing and I def cannot live without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying the larger size next time!  I wish everyone knew about this stuff.</li>
            <li> Excuse me everyone but I&#x27;m one of those people that review everything I have purchased on Amazon all at once, because I believe in actually reviewing the product before leaving a comment. This is oil people it works, it came to me fresh and all it takes is a little for your skin, hair, hands and really good for your feet.</li>
            <li> I wish I could love this product , but I can not . This product made my scalp irritated . It also gave me scabs and dry patches .</li>
            <li> Timely delivery for my hair regimen. This is My first time trying this type of oil. My sister has used jojoba for years, now it&#x27;s a part of my haircare.</li>
            <li> Perfect travel size!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent skin moisturizer -- was suggested by my Esthetician --- very inexpensive compared to high end treatment products, with even better results for my skin.</li>
            <li> I clean my face using the oil cleansing method and this jojoba oil is perfect for what I needed it for.  It is very low on the comedogenic scale and soaks in well.  I even put it on the ends of my dry hair sometimes and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. I will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Its very smooth and rich. Its a great combo with other oils, when doing a hot oil treatment or any hair treatment. You can also use it for scalp nourishment.</li>
            <li> Works great, I just don&#x27;t like how it&#x27;s so oily and can easily pour out. Not an issue with the product (obviously, you are BUYING an oil). But just something to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t clog your pores either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to anyone with acne problems.</li>
            <li> Amazing for your skin, sinks in beautifully leaving it supple and glowing... Wonderful as a make up remover as well. I also use it for my homemade skin care products and they turn out lovely.</li>
            <li> I like how this oil glides on my skin without a heavy residue. It doesn&#x27;t clog pores and leaves my skin very soft. I also mix it in my Hair butters, I&#x27;m Natural.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff soooooooo much.i bought the 1 oz, just to try it out, and i love it. I massage my gauges with it, and i really did notice a difference. I love it &lt;3</li>
            <li> Having read about the benefits of jojoba oil, I purchased the 1 ounce size of this product to test it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the most part, I&#x27;ve had the best results when using this oil to \\&quot;fortify\\&quot; my facial and body moisturizers. It makes my skin that much softer and gives me a more glowy look. I also use it alone underneath my eyes before bed and have noticed a slight lightening of my dark circles. Now and then I&#x27;ll smooth a few drops through my hair to tame frizz and condition the dry ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only qualm is the bottle. Making it into a squeeze bottle or including a dropper would be great for not only for portioning oil (a little goes a long way), but for preventing spillage.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair very shiny and skin very soft. use only a little because its highly concentrated. I use about two teaspoons in my 16oz shea butter for my hair. Its a very good combination for african hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used some on my 4 month old nephew&#x27;s cheeks because he has a very bad case of eczema. It smoothed his skin and took some of the redness away.</li>
            <li> This is a tiny 1 oz bottle but perfect for everyday skin use. Jojoba doesnt clog pores and leaves skin feeling so silky and smooth. I use this in a mixture of peppermint oil, emu, bio oil, olive oil, and vitamin e oil. My mixture is mostly the jojoba (because it is a base) then about 10 drops of all the other oils. Great for skin care. I have mild acne and this never makes me break out especially since I use it in the mixture with peppermint (which is great at fighting acne).&lt;br /&gt;WHEN USING IT YOU MUST MASSAGE INTO THE SKIN FOR IT TO WORK FOR ABOUT 1-2 MINUTES. THIS WILL HELP WITH ABSORPTION.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and gorgeous</li>
            <li> You definetly get a lot for your buck. I was honestly surprised how much I received and how long it&#x27;s lasted. I use it as a part of my oil cleansing method and I couldn&#x27;t be happier, although this is my first time trying jojoba. It&#x27;s a very light and pure consistency and I felt like it really helped my skin. I would recommend getting it!</li>
            <li> When i got this i was in shock how small the bottle was, but also how effective this little oil is. Why haven&#x27;t i bought this before? Truly is a blessing to have this. It moisturizes effortlessly, and it has so many uses for it, it&#x27;s basically a all in one oil. 5 stars all the way.</li>
            <li> It is so small, but excellent product. I would recommend it to someone else but check the size before you buy it</li>
            <li> Although it was smaller than I expected, the delivery was lightning fast. I usually have problems with my address because I live in an apartment but they knew to put my Apartment number on the delivery label. Also, what I love about this oil is that there is no fragrance at all. I plan to use this in my hair regime and I was afraid that the fragrance would interfere in the overall upkeep of my tresses. I highly reccomend this product to all who would like to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Good quality - what I would expect from Now Foods.  My only complaint is that 1 oz doesn&#x27;t go very far!</li>
            <li> Another stupid trend. I  have oily skin and bought jojoba oil because like many others I read that it mimic sebum and slow down oil production. Well after using it for almost a moth , I didnt notice any difference. I would even say it made my skin worse. Do not recommend</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement as my first bottle was low.  Speaking of low the price was more than half&lt;br /&gt;off. The oil smooths and replenishes dry cuticles in amazing way. I use it often.</li>
            <li> If you are going natural or just want to take care of your by making it grow stronger, this is a great product to use.</li>
            <li> I love love this oil... I use it for everything hair, skin, and cuticles. I have using it for about a year now and it is very good to my skin the only thing I hate is that you have pay so much for so little lol... So I stretch it by adding it into other oils. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I really love the jojoba oil. It feels great on my skin and I am glad that it does not have any strong scent. I use it right out the shower on my wet skin and just let it  \\&quot;marinate\\&quot; for about a few minutes while i do my hair and makeup, then dry off the excess water. My skin feels so soft and moisterized. All I use is a total of a quarter size and it goes a long way. I really love this pure oil.</li>
            <li> Finally something that can help cure my ridiculously dry skin in the winter! I couldn&#x27;t be more in love with a moisturizer! The fact that it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes or have an overpowering scent is just icing on the jojob- infused cake.</li>
            <li> Great for skin and hair</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I wish I would have bought a bigger bottle when I purchased it, there are so many uses!</li>
