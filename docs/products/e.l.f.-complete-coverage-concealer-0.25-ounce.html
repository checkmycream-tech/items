            <li>I know good makeup I worked in cosmetics.</li>
            <li>I choose this rating because the concealer just isn&#x27;t a good product, it doesn&#x27;t blend well when it makes contact with your skin.</li>
            <li>it goes on nice and smooth and stays on perfectly through out the day.</li>
            <li>i use my fingers which works so much better!</li>

            <li>I liked it at first but its just too think on my skin..</li>
            <li>for light coverage that is.</li>
            <li>The creamy texture creates a smooth look for a brightened up feel.</li>
            <li>and its perfect to bring it anywhere because of the small size.</li>
            <li>i can recommend this for a cheap quick fix.</li>
            <li>and I was okay with the quality; not knowing what concealer was really capable of.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>it seems very cakey.</li>
            <li>At all not what I expected good packaging came on time but low quality product.</li>
            <li>A decent concealer, I purchased at a bargain price.</li>
            <li>The case is so sleek and professional looking!</li>
            <li>I really like this concealer and the different colors.</li>
            <li>I like the variety on the palette, some of them i feel like could have more pigment, and the brush it comes with sucks</li>
            <li>I felt like I just kept putting more on and there wasnt anything but a thick film.</li>
            <li>but when it arrived, it was pretty much dried out.  </li>

            <li> but when it arrived, it was pretty much dried out.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this palette plus the colored conceal palette which includes pink, green, blue and yellow to help with blemishes and under eye circles but the problem is they don&#x27;t conceal AT ALL.  </li>
            <li> The other review gave it a 5 star.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to anyone that has problems finding a concealer for their skin type or to anyone looking for a concealer to  cover it all because they&#x27;re tired of having 2 or 3 different types of concealers sitting around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also done slight highlighting with this as well.</li>
            <li> I struggle with very dark circles and was looking for a concealer that covered them.  </li>
            <li> I have small imperfections on my face and thought this would help hide some of them.  </li>
            <li> Did not love it..</li>
            <li> Hard to work a brush into it to apply.</li>
            <li> and this is just too thick on my skin.</li>
            <li> The color&#x27;s may look caked if you put it on wrong.</li>
            <li> I might have just received a bad one</li>

            <li> A decent concealer, I purchased at a bargain price. The 4 shade selection is a plus. Blends well without noticeable lines.</li>
            <li> This concealer gives good coverage. It is the perfect concealer pallet for summer because you can mix the colors to match it to your skin tone.</li>
            <li> I liked it at first but its just too think on my skin.. I have very oily skin and this is just too thick on my skin. The colors are great you can mix and match to your liking just not my preference.</li>
            <li> This product looked good to me.  I have small imperfections on my face and thought this would help hide some of them.  I might have just received a bad one but when it arrived, it was pretty much dried out.  I won&#x27;t be able to use it at all.  The other review gave it a 5 star. I would like to give the benefit of the doubt so I am just gonna assume it was an error to send me this defective one.</li>
            <li> I really like this concealer and the different colors. it goes on nice and smooth and stays on perfectly through out the day. and its perfect to bring it anywhere because of the small size. The only thing is, I don&#x27;t use the brush that came with it...i use my fingers which works so much better!</li>
            <li> The concealer is exactly as the description promised.  The colors match all skin tones and has a nice texture.  and comes with a nice hard compact case.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new elf concealer kit! Comes with 4 different shades and helps with contouring my face! Such a great buy for an amazing price! I will definitely buy more elf products nows.</li>
            <li> The picture makes it look like you getting a lot but its tiny! And it doesn&#x27;t even work good. Trust me I know good makeup I worked in cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Every girl needs concealer, and e.l.f. is awesome!  This concealer goes on nicely, covers well, and lasts!  It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I struggle with very dark circles and was looking for a concealer that covered them.  I took a chance on this concealer and I have to say that I absolutely love it!!!  I will definitely be purchasing this again and will recommend it to anyone that asks.</li>
            <li> for something so cheap, its okay.  for light coverage that is. i don&#x27;t like how the product sits after iv&#x27;e applied. i can recommend this for a cheap quick fix.</li>
            <li> I like the variety on the palette, some of them i feel like could have more pigment, and the brush it comes with sucks so make sure you have your own.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! It stays on all day, especially when used with foundation and powder. I absolutely love how you can pick and mix shades if needed. I have reddish cheeks and mild acne. This concealer allows me to not only cover my &amp;#34;natural blush&amp;#34;, but it also allows me to conceal my acne. I&#x27;ve also done slight highlighting with this as well. I definitely recommend this product to anyone that has problems finding a concealer for their skin type or to anyone looking for a concealer to  cover it all because they&#x27;re tired of having 2 or 3 different types of concealers sitting around.</li>
            <li> I ordered this palette plus the colored conceal palette which includes pink, green, blue and yellow to help with blemishes and under eye circles but the problem is they don&#x27;t conceal AT ALL.  I just ended up doubling up on my foundation to cover up blemishes.</li>
            <li> At first, I got this and I was okay with the quality; not knowing what concealer was really capable of. It was until recently that I used it fluently! The creamy texture creates a smooth look for a brightened up feel. The color&#x27;s may look caked if you put it on wrong. But I&#x27;ve definitely learned my own technique. It came super fast! The case is so sleek and professional looking! It reminds me of NARS but way cheaper! The colors are versatile. I can use one color on friends and the perfect color on me. I was very impressed with this concealer. I will buy this again!</li>
            <li> Product arrived in three days fast shipping colors seem very fresh bubble wrap and well secured!&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smooth i ordered an elf brush from elf loved it and now love the concealor</li>
            <li> Did not love it.. very caky but no coverage! I felt like I just kept putting more on and there wasnt anything but a thick film.</li>
            <li> This product on the elf website is only like 3-4.99 and they always have some sort of coupon code going on. I am a big fan of eyeslipsface and love most their products</li>
            <li> Didnt like it At all not what I expected good packaging came on time but low quality product. If y</li>
            <li> Products covers once you manage to get it out. Formula is not creamy and needs time time to melt into skin. Hard to work a brush into it to apply.</li>
            <li> I have had different concealers and this one is okay but it doesn&#x27;t conceal the best although it does come with different shades.</li>
            <li> I bought this concealer thinking it would have great coverage. the coverage is not so great. it seems very cakey.</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because the concealer just isn&#x27;t a good product, it doesn&#x27;t blend well when it makes contact with your skin. The brush it comes with to apply is a joke. I do not suggest purchasing. Go to Mac or Sephora and get samples or an application to what best best concealer meshes well with your skin.</li>
