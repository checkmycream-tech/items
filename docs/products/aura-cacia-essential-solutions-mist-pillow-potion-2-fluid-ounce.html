            <li>Love the smell!  </li>
            <li>It has a nice woodsy scent that disappears by morning.</li>

            <li>Nice aroma.</li>

            <li>I will be throwing this out for sure.  </li>

            <li>Who could ask for a better sleep remedy?</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t work if you stay up watching tv :)</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more lavendar.  </li>
            <li>It still smells OK</li>
            <li>but I like Bath and Body Works Lavendar and Vanilla Spray much better.</li>
            <li>Tea cup pooches that just love your pillow, one spray and gone.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, spray it on my kid&#x27;s pillows every night</li>
            <li>read all about this product on Amazon.com, and I am so glad that I decided to try this product.  </li>
            <li>I need 10 more words (they say)...</li>
            <li>love it helps me sleep</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s relaxing but not too strong.</li>
            <li>have been sleeping soundly for the week since my purchase</li>
            <li>the bottle of spray i got two years ago was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Your room is energized with a fabulous aroma,</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It is relaxing and fragrant, which makes for a much more peaceful sleep.  </li>
            <li>I have used many pillow sprays and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>the smell disappates quickly</li>
            <li>It just feels soothing, calming and smells so fresh and inviting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for - fresh smelling and lasts.</li>
            <li>and I feel like I&#x27;m sleeping on fresh, clean sheets that were dried in the warm sun.</li>
            <li>The pillow potion worked the first night</li>
            <li>it was a spray with fairly strong essential oils that would put me right to sleep.  </li>
            <li>and this product is also a pure mist.</li>
            <li>Very nice...not strong enough for me.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this product i spray it on mine</li>
            <li>and it seems to really help us.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>it is much weaker.  </li>
            <li>I really like the scent...</li>
            <li>I will be ordering the pillow potion essential oil to make my own refills, but I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is stressed, or restless at night.</li>
            <li>Not too strong, bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>This is a quality product with real, pure essential oils.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this spray.</li>
            <li>I have been buying Aura Cacia for nearly 30 years.</li>
            <li>We (my 5 year old son and I) both get one short spray on our pillow before bed.</li>
            <li>We were tired of the proverbial &amp;#34;white linen&amp;#34; smell so this is a nice alternative which lasts longer than other sprays.  </li>

            <li> Unfortunately this spray is not what I expected!  I sprayed it once and can&#x27;t get past the smell.  It is not returnable since I was told it was used since I sprayed it one time.  I will be throwing this out for sure.  Make sure you read the company&#x27;s policy on returns before you purchase.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the stink, but I have to say either I&#x27;m a sucker for a placebo, or it really works- have been sleeping soundly for the week since my purchase</li>
            <li> I really like the smell.  I just wish that the scent would last longer.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this product i spray it on mine and my daughters pillows every night and it seems to really help us.</li>
            <li> I have used many pillow sprays and this one is by far my favorite. The smell is lovely without being overwhelming, and the hops help to lull me to sleep. This is a quality product with real, pure essential oils.</li>
            <li> Not a lot of aroma here for an aroma therapeutic product... And what aroma there is is not particularly wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Very diluted and you need to spray a lot for any effect.&lt;br /&gt;Not great value or results.</li>
            <li> I use this on my pillow every night.  It is relaxing and fragrant, which makes for a much more peaceful sleep.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> the bottle of spray i got two years ago was fantastic.  it was a spray with fairly strong essential oils that would put me right to sleep.  this is a new formula, with very different ingredients (its missing several essential oils (expensive ones)), and the worst part its....it is much weaker.  the smell disappates quickly -- i had to use about a quarter bottle to get anything like i did in the past.  Very sad Aura Cacia lowered its standards inwhat seems like a move to make more profit.</li>
            <li> Planning to sleep, but troubles weighing on your mind?  Spray your pillow &amp; surrounding sheets with this lovely spray with lavender sing  a chief ingredients</li>
            <li> Just a little spray and I feel like I&#x27;m sleeping on fresh, clean sheets that were dried in the warm sun. Who could ask for a better sleep remedy?</li>
            <li> Works as described! Great product!</li>
            <li> This is my second order of Pillow Potion Mist. I use it for both my dad and myself. My dad has dementia, and it has been impossible to keep him in bed at night for the past couple years. He falls a lot, so it is crucial to keep him in bed. The pillow potion worked the first night I used it! I cannot claim he sleeps all night, but he has stayed in bed all but 2 nights over the past month! I have been using this myself as well, to help reduce stress at night so I can sleep. It has a nice woodsy scent that disappears by morning. It does not stain the pillow, and I dont break out from it (as I am a side sleeper, my face is on the pillow). I will be ordering the pillow potion essential oil to make my own refills, but I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is stressed, or restless at night.</li>
            <li> a friend recommended I try this spray when I told her I was having trouble sleeping. I really like the scent... it&#x27;s relaxing but not too strong. If only this pillow mist could drag me off the couch and into the bed... it doesn&#x27;t work if you stay up watching tv :)</li>
            <li> I have been buying Aura Cacia for nearly 30 years. I&#x27;ve never been disappointed with any of the products I have used.</li>
            <li> Smell is very strange. Kind of like tree bark and cut grass. Not really soothing to the senses.</li>
            <li> If you like pachouli you will like this spray.  I thought it would be more lavendar.  It still smells OK but I like Bath and Body Works Lavendar and Vanilla Spray much better.</li>
            <li> This smells so good and covers the odors of my dogs. Tea cup pooches that just love your pillow, one spray and gone. Highly recommend this spray.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, spray it on my kid&#x27;s pillows every night</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product to spray on your pillow every night just before you go to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;Aura Cacia Pillow Spray has the great aroma of Lavender and soothing yarrow to help you breathe easier,&lt;br /&gt;and the soothing aroma calms your nerves, too. I have a lot of sinus problems, and I definitely notice the&lt;br /&gt;difference when I lay my head on my pillow now. It just feels soothing, calming and smells so fresh and inviting.&lt;br /&gt;I read all about this product on Amazon.com, and I am so glad that I decided to try this product.  It&#x27;s so settling.&lt;br /&gt;It is delightful. I will continue to use this wonderful spray,..and this product is also a pure mist. Not tested on animals, which is very important to me, no synthetics and made in the USA. You must try this for a relaxing night&#x27;s sleep, and to help soothe your breathing problems. It freshens up your pillow every night with mists of wonderful Lavender Aromas.&lt;br /&gt;I happened to buy this along with another product, that is a must. I use it along with Aura Cacia Ginger/Mint Aromatherapy mist Spray for my Bedroom. The combination is just Wonderful. Your room is energized with a fabulous aroma,..then you&lt;br /&gt;lay your head on your pillow to breathe with ease and sleep in a heavenly Lavender scent. Buy both of these products.</li>
            <li> Just a couple of squirts will do. Nice aroma.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.  The scent is so soothing.  I believe it aids in the relaxation of clients in a health/healing office setting as well as individuals using it at home for relaxation or meditation purposes.</li>
            <li> Not frilly dilly, this spray has a nice, almost masquline, woodsy smell that my wife and I both love.  We were tired of the proverbial &amp;#34;white linen&amp;#34; smell so this is a nice alternative which lasts longer than other sprays.  We will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very nice...not strong enough for me.  But like the aroma. I need 10 more words (they say)...HATE that.....Like the product.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for - fresh smelling and lasts.</li>
            <li> love it helps me sleep</li>
            <li> Love the smell!  Great to spray on your pillows</li>
            <li> We (my 5 year old son and I) both get one short spray on our pillow before bed. He even reminds me if I forget. Not too strong, bottle lasts a long time.</li>
