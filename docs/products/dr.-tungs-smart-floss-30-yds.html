    <ol>
            <li>Best floss I have found.</li>
            <li>This is the best floss I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>it is truly wonderful and makes me look forward to flossing.</li>
            <li>it works great!</li>
            <li>excellent alternative to the flouride infused mainstream stuff!</li>
            <li>but this is the probably the best floss I have used !</li>
            <li>BEST floss.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best floss I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>So if you like the taste of cardmon, go for it, it&#x27;s very good floss.  </li>
            <li>so this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>and I am quite happy with it</li>
            <li>However the shipping and packaging was great, no complaints there</li>
            <li>nice packaging and pleasantly flavored.</li>
            <li>; well - our dentist is very pleased.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Really does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High quality product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels so lovely on your teeth - just how I imagined a really good floss would feel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use floss, dispenser, nice design and compact to carry.</li>
            <li>Dr. Tungs holds up better.</li>
            <li>I like it and have ordered it more than once.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light scent which smells like citrus to me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need my floss to be flavored, but since it is, I find it refreshing.</li>
            <li>I will be buying this again for sure.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s my top choice at this time.  </li>
            <li>It does the job better than any others and doesn&#x27;t break off between the teeth.</li>
            <li>a better value.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been gifting it to all my friends who also love</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love the cardamom smell, too.</li>
            <li>Love this floss.</li>
            <li>Sure, it might pick up more tarter.</li>
            <li>Simply the best.</li>
            <li>The floss itself is OK - contrary to some reviews I&#x27;ve read, the strands do split/shred easily.</li>
            <li>It works very gently and effectively, and I love the cardamom flavor.  </li>
            <li>It really works good.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best floss I have used.</li>
            <li>Works fine, but the herb scent makes me feel like I&#x27;m flossing with a scented candle wick</li>
            <li>Since this floss can flatten  out and easily fit between the gum and tooth, it appears to do its job well.</li>
            <li>plus I enjoy the cardamom flavor.</li>
            <li>It is MUCH more effective at dragging retained food out of the spaces between teeth because it has a broad textured surface to which the debris adheres.</li>
            <li>Who knew I could be excited about a floss of all things...</li>
            <li>This is about as clean as I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with Dr. Tung&#x27;s Smart Floss.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is more gentle than waxed floss, which is what I used to use.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s unwaxed, it&#x27;s sturdy, doesn&#x27;t easily snap, and it&#x27;s gentle on gums.  </li>
            <li>Pleasant, subtle, very fresh flavor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure, but I suspect that multi strand woven floss like this is more effective at removing tarter or plaque better than single non stranded floss.</li>
            <li>I like it better than regular floss</li>
            <li>I actually like Reach Woven floss better though.</li>
            <li>Textured floss gets off so much more of whatever that gross stuff is.</li>
            <li>but I am  ;)</li>
            <li>I like to smear a bit of toothpaste on it, but I&#x27;m sure that isn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
            <li>It gets pretty much everything out</li>
            <li>I have large gaps between my teeth</li>
            <li>The description that the floss stretches well, doesn&#x27;t break, and doesn&#x27;t fray, is very correct.  </li>
            <li>Some people may very well like, depending on your dental structure.</li>
            <li>much prefer the organic silk floss.</li>
            <li>This floss has what you need to really scrub those surfaces between teeth.</li>
            <li>plain floss would be nice.</li>
            <li>love the thicker floss - it doesn&#x27;t split and tear (as much) as all the other flossing products on the market.</li>
            <li>Also, the reach floss is thicker, due to more strands (which I think are thinner too).</li>
            <li>It has a texture that seems to scrub better than other flosses.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels natural and gentle on your gums, but feels like it cleans far better than any commercial flosses and tapes</li>
            <li>Could not find decent floss in any store so I tried this.  </li>
            <li>I love this floss, it expands in between your teeth to retrieve plaque and debris , and the back of the package has instructions to show you the proper way to floss.</li>
            <li>And I took it to my dentist&#x27;s office and the hygienist really liked it, as did several other people in the office.  </li>
            <li>It does not cut or feel sharp like most flosses and it has natural waxes instead of petroleum based waxes.</li>
            <li>Plus, no nasty &#x27;fake&#x27; flavor just the natural flavor of cardamon which I love as a spice.</li>
            <li>However, I can easily work it between my tight teeth and it does its job well.</li>
            <li>I have tight teeth spacings and this gets between them easily.</li>
            <li>Even though it is a thicker bundle of strands, it goes between my tight teeth just as easy as Tung&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Easy to get in tight areas and makes flossing a pleasurable experience.</li>
            <li>That is the reason they tell you to move the floss up-and-down rather than moving it in-and-out in a sawing action.</li>
            <li>But I was genuinely surprised by what a radical improvement this floss is.</li>
            <li>Will know for sure when I go for my next cleaning which is a few months away.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen my dentist since the hygienist recommended it, but it feels good and helps get into the weird spaces between and around my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The only negative that I have is that while the plastic case is kind of cool, it is harder to grab the end of the floss to pull it out because there is only about 1/8&amp;#34; exposed that you can grab it from.</li>
            <li>never thought that I could get this excited about floss, but I am.&lt;br /&gt;It has a lovely faint cardamom smell - not too strong, not too weak -</li>
            <li>In aadition, I have some tightly spaced tooth but this floss rarely shreds.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hard to go back to the cheap drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if other brands slip on some kind of aspartame (under all kinds of names--see Dr. Black videos)</li>
            <li>The Reach woven floss was gentle on gums but would snap and get fuzzy which would start to wear certain spots thin.  </li>

            <li> Although it will remove food particles, the main purpose of flossing is to break up the colonies that bacteria attempt to establish in that &amp;#34;moist, cozy&amp;#34; area between your teeth and gums (that is what causes the gum trouble).</li>
            <li> I had to take apart the plastic dispenser as a result, which was a minor hassle.</li>
            <li> I know it is difficult to get excited about floss</li>
            <li> Not a new product for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harder to find now; maybe it&#x27;s been discontinued, but you can still find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> So I only used the floss for a few days</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like finding some knitting yarn and deciding, &amp;#34;i should floss with this.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> no thanks.</li>
            <li> but the key is to pull the string tightly to &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; it down so that I could slide it between my teeth.</li>
            <li> holy cow, I haven&#x27;t been living...</li>
            <li> The Reach containers have 50 yards of floss instead of 30 that Dr. Tung&#x27;s has, and it&#x27;s a bit cheaper per package too, which combined makes it about half the price of Tung&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I like this floss a little</li>
            <li> I even bought a few to let others try.</li>
            <li> Appears thick and does not hurt my fingers.</li>
            <li> Some people say that it is too thick</li>
            <li> Now that we have tried it, we have a difficult time using any other floss...</li>
            <li> then the thin spots would break/snap.  </li>
            <li> So I bought a single pack, expecting to be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am always skeptical of products that appear to be &#x27;hyped&#x27; as dramatic improvements.  </li>
            <li> (I was doing it kinda wrong, and you are probably too.)</li>
            <li> It shreds, it&#x27;s horribly thick, it&#x27;s just horrible.</li>
            <li> make it almost impossible to floss with.</li>
            <li> Holy crap.</li>
            <li> awful.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> terrible product -- makes my gums swell and nothing else had changed but using this product.</li>

            <li> I think this is helping keep my teeth cleaner. Will know for sure when I go for my next cleaning which is a few months away.</li>
            <li> I like it better than regular floss, it&#x27;s unwaxed, it&#x27;s sturdy, doesn&#x27;t easily snap, and it&#x27;s gentle on gums.  The Reach woven floss was gentle on gums but would snap and get fuzzy which would start to wear certain spots thin.  The fibers would sometimes get stuck in between my teeth and then the thin spots would break/snap.  Dr. Tungs holds up better.</li>
            <li> It really works good.</li>
            <li> Best floss I have found. Appears thick and does not hurt my fingers. However, I can easily work it between my tight teeth and it does its job well. Although it will remove food particles, the main purpose of flossing is to break up the colonies that bacteria attempt to establish in that &amp;#34;moist, cozy&amp;#34; area between your teeth and gums (that is what causes the gum trouble). Flossing &#x3D; messing up their colonies &#x3D; messing up their lives &#x3D; healthier gums. That is the reason they tell you to move the floss up-and-down rather than moving it in-and-out in a sawing action. Since this floss can flatten  out and easily fit between the gum and tooth, it appears to do its job well. I like it and have ordered it more than once.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best floss I have used. Some people say that it is too thick but the key is to pull the string tightly to &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; it down so that I could slide it between my teeth.</li>
            <li> I like this floss a lot. I have tight teeth spacings and this gets between them easily. I&#x27;m not sure, but I suspect that multi strand woven floss like this is more effective at removing tarter or plaque better than single non stranded floss. It has a nice light scent which smells like citrus to me. The only negative that I have is that while the plastic case is kind of cool, it is harder to grab the end of the floss to pull it out because there is only about 1/8&amp;#34; exposed that you can grab it from. I actually like Reach Woven floss better though. It&#x27;s harder to find now; maybe it&#x27;s been discontinued, but you can still find it on Amazon.

            <li> This was not what I was expecting, but I like it anyway.  It works very gently and effectively, and I love the cardamom flavor.  I don&#x27;t need my floss to be flavored, but since it is, I find it refreshing.</li>
            <li> A friend introduced me to this floss and it is the nicest I have ever used.  Easier on the fingers and gets between teeth whether close together or well separated.  I will be buying this again for sure.  And I took it to my dentist&#x27;s office and the hygienist really liked it, as did several other people in the office.  The dentist was eager to try it and they may try to get it.</li>
            <li> holy cow, I haven&#x27;t been living...this will change your life (and your dental health). buy it now already!</li>
            <li> This is about as clean as I&#x27;ve found.  I&#x27;m not sure if other brands slip on some kind of aspartame (under all kinds of names--see Dr. Black videos) but it seems they do.  I don&#x27;t think Tung&#x27;s does so it&#x27;s my top choice at this time.  I would like if they made it without any flavor or added anything--&lt;br /&gt;just plain floss would be nice.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Ferrari&#x27; of flosses!. Easy to get in tight areas and makes flossing a pleasurable experience. Plus, no nasty &#x27;fake&#x27; flavor just the natural flavor of cardamon which I love as a spice. Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey but once you&#x27;ve used this floss it&#x27;s hard to go back to the cheap drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> This is the best floss I&#x27;ve ever used.  Doesn&#x27;t cut or hurt your gums.  I won&#x27;t be using anything else.</li>
            <li> This dental floss comes flavored with cardamon which I thought I&#x27;d like but I don&#x27;t.  So I only used the floss for a few days and I&#x27;ve stopped and am using something else now.  The description that the floss stretches well, doesn&#x27;t break, and doesn&#x27;t fray, is very correct.  So if you like the taste of cardmon, go for it, it&#x27;s very good floss.  If you don&#x27;t, get another flavor.</li>
            <li> Could not find decent floss in any store so I tried this.  It does the job better than any others and doesn&#x27;t break off between the teeth.</li>
            <li> I have large gaps between my teeth so this stuff is great. It gets pretty much everything out and I am quite happy with it plus I enjoy the cardamom flavor.</li>
            <li> Works fine, but the herb scent makes me feel like I&#x27;m flossing with a scented candle wick</li>
            <li> Have you noticed how some brands of floss shred as you pull it between your teeth? Not this one! This goes in, between and out without any problems. Really does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High quality product! Try some today.</li>
            <li> I like this floss a little but It&#x27;s too thick-due to the thickness of the floss make it almost impossible to floss with. Some people may very well like, depending on your dental structure.</li>
            <li> love the thicker floss - it doesn&#x27;t split and tear (as much) as all the other flossing products on the market. Would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This floss cleans well.  It has a texture that seems to scrub better than other flosses.  It also holds essential oils well.  I add a drop or two of essential oils to my floss when flossing.  In my opinion, it does not expand as well as Gum floss for cleaning the spaces between teeth.  I alternate the between the two.</li>
            <li> Textured floss gets off so much more of whatever that gross stuff is.</li>
            <li> I am in love with Dr. Tung&#x27;s Smart Floss.&lt;br /&gt;I never thought that I could get this excited about floss, but I am.&lt;br /&gt;It has a lovely faint cardamom smell - not too strong, not too weak - just right.&lt;br /&gt;It feels so lovely on your teeth - just how I imagined a really good floss would feel.&lt;br /&gt;It feels natural and gentle on your gums, but feels like it cleans far better than any commercial flosses and tapes I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I bought one pack and then promptly bought the 6 pack which is a better value.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been gifting it to all my friends who also love it.&lt;br /&gt;Try this floss - it is truly wonderful and makes me look forward to flossing.</li>
            <li> Now that we have tried it, we have a difficult time using any other floss...it works great!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I haven&#x27;t seen my dentist since the hygienist recommended it, but it feels good and helps get into the weird spaces between and around my teeth.  It is more gentle than waxed floss, which is what I used to use.  I love the cardamom smell, too.</li>
            <li> Love this floss. It does not cut or feel sharp like most flosses and it has natural waxes instead of petroleum based waxes. Who knew I could be excited about a floss of all things... but I am  ;)</li>
            <li> Holy crap. This is just.... awful. It&#x27;s like finding some knitting yarn and deciding, &amp;#34;i should floss with this.&amp;#34; It shreds, it&#x27;s horribly thick, it&#x27;s just horrible. Horrible. Sure, it might pick up more tarter. So would bailing twine. Would you want to put it in-between your teeth?</li>
            <li> excellent alternative to the flouride infused mainstream stuff! nice packaging and pleasantly flavored.</li>
            <li> I know it is difficult to get excited about floss but this is the probably the best floss I have used ! I even bought a few to let others try. Try it and you won&#x27;t go back to the ones you buy at the drugstore or market.</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical of products that appear to be &#x27;hyped&#x27; as dramatic improvements.  So I bought a single pack, expecting to be disappointed.  But I was genuinely surprised by what a radical improvement this floss is. It is MUCH more effective at dragging retained food out of the spaces between teeth because it has a broad textured surface to which the debris adheres. In aadition, I have some tightly spaced tooth but this floss rarely shreds.</li>
            <li> terrible product -- makes my gums swell and nothing else had changed but using this product. returned it immediately. no thanks. much prefer the organic silk floss.</li>
            <li> I love this floss, it expands in between your teeth to retrieve plaque and debris , and the back of the package has instructions to show you the proper way to floss. (I was doing it kinda wrong, and you are probably too.)</li>
            <li> BEST floss. Ever! Doesn&#x27;t shred on dental work. Pleasant, subtle, very fresh flavor. &amp;#34;Grabs&amp;#34; well - our dentist is very pleased. I like to smear a bit of toothpaste on it, but I&#x27;m sure that isn&#x27;t necessary. It&#x27;s the opposite of Glide - that stuff slides around and I don&#x27;t feel it probably cleans well. This floss has what you need to really scrub those surfaces between teeth. Love it!</li>
            <li> The floss itself is OK - contrary to some reviews I&#x27;ve read, the strands do split/shred easily. I was considering rating this even lower because of the defective unit I received, which was tangled internally when I took it out. I had to take apart the plastic dispenser as a result, which was a minor hassle. However the shipping and packaging was great, no complaints there</li>
            <li> Not a new product for me. Simply the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best floss I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
