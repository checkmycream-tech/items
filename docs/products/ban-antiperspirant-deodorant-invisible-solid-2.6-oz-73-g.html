            <li> Sigh...I have very sensitive skin and lots of allergies. For this reason I am only able to use Ban Unscented deodorant. I switched to another brand of unscented deodorant and promptly developed atopic dermatitis. I can&#x27;t say the other deodorant caused this problem, as I am not a medical professional, but I suspect it&#x27;s very likely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve switched to Ban unscented roll on as that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s available here. If I can find the Ban Unscented solid deodorant I will stock up as it works to keep body odor at bay without causing me any problems. I love this stuff and highly recommend purchasing and using it unless you have medical problems from its use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since I received some as a hand-out right after Katrina. It is the best I ever used. I saw the review about it bleaching your clothes, but I have never had this happen. Perhaps it is the combination of the Ban deodorant and the type of laundry detergent that person uses. I have never had it rub off on my clothes or cause any type of problem to my skin. It works without conflicting with whatever perfume I may use from time-to-time. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> works well, has no scent and does not tend to leave residue, but in hot conditions it does not hold its weight as well as others.</li>
            <li> Non allergenic, after skin patch tests this is one of the very few deodorants that I am not allergic to.</li>
            <li> Ruined several shirts by bleaching them. I have had to throw away four shirts after starting to use this deodorant, as it bleached the underarms, as well as anywhere else it touched the fabric. I did wear it with a few shirts that were unaffected; it seems to be a problem with cotton or mostly-cotton fabrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to use it for wearing with white shirts, I will say it&#x27;s a good deodorant. Very effective and not harsh to my skin.</li>
            <li> Jus wow. Its by far my best deororant ever. My old antiperspirant used to leave my shirts with deororant odor. Now I can use the same shirt 2 times and it smells like i never put it on. The best part the price here on amazon! Ps. My shirts never fade color under there.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is truly unscented. It is not invisible as advertised. Also, right after I put on the deodorant and a dark color shirt I will see white stains from deodorant on the shirt.   I mainly got it for the \\&quot;invisible\\&quot; part.</li>
            <li> Good Antiperspirant....not so good Deodorant</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a new deodorant after my last kind was discontinued. I am sensitive to perfumes and sometimes the ingredients so I am not just searching for a product that deodorizes. The Ban is as named. It is white to start but leaves less marking on my clothes and skins than some clear products I&#x27;ve tried. It is solid so you don&#x27;t have to worry about airport security. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and it does seem to last 24 hours+.</li>
            <li> good deodrant worl\ks</li>
            <li> Unscented ban is hard to find at the stores, in fact, I think they do not make this particular one any more.</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry but I don&#x27;t feel enough moisture under my pits when I use it. I&#x27;m knocking off a star because I dropped the deodorant and it broke apart.</li>
            <li> *Update: Despite the 0 helpful votes, it is now almost 10 years later and I can confirm without a doubt that it was the deodorant. The problem never happened again after I switched it!  I couldn&#x27;t figure out why my clothes were bleaching, then when I switched to a new anti perspirant the problem disappeared! BAN IS BAD! BAD STAINS. UUGhhh...I lost hundreds of dollars in clothes because of it, and I even thought I should go to a doctor! This can&#x27;t be healthy.</li>
            <li> I have been using Ban Solid Antiperspirant for over 20 years, and it has never failed me. Prior to using Ban, I had used a number of other antiperspirants and if they worked at all, they eventually stopped working. At least for me, Ban has always been an antiperspirant that I could depend on. I prefer the sold form to the liquid or spray because it goes on dry. It doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense to me to use a wet spray or liquid roll-on when the purpose of using it is to stay dry. I have also found that other deodorants/antiperspirants will sometimes discolor or stain clothing over time. I haven&#x27;t had this problem with Ban Solid.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding this I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this here! The stick ban is so hard to fin  in stores, and the unscented variety is practically unheard of. This stuff is great and is the best antiperspirant out there right now.</li>
            <li> Works well with very little white residue/transfer.  Switched form the roll on to the solid and prefer it.</li>
            <li> 1 OF THE BEST DEODORANT OUT THERE!! TOTALLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find this item at the stores I shop in. They seemed to have stopped carrying it. It was wonderful to be able to find it here and purchase it. I have very sensitive skin and this does not cause me any issues.</li>
            <li> My amazing girlfriend wears this stuff! Given she puts perfume over it...but  I&#x27;ve smelled her before the perfume...this stuff smells good...even the \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; stuff. She also never sweats!</li>
            <li> It didnt work on me, but I know people who simply love it. I guess I&#x27;m just too allergic. &#x3D; (</li>
            <li> I have allergies and need unscented. This is my favorite deodorant. It is I,possible to find it unscented in the stores.</li>
            <li> Works well , keeps me odor free. Doesn&#x27;t ruin my clothes. I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate me.</li>
            <li> I have a low thyroid. All things with phthalates (found among other things in fragrance) lowers my thyroid, so I avoid them completely. I found this on EWG.org as a good choice. It works great!</li>
