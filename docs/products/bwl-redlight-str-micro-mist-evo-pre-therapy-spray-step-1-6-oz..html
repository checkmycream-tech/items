    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great skin care....</li>
            <li>Ive heard that it is suppose to be really good though, which is why I decided to try it....</li>
            <li>and I honestly didn&#x27;t see any differences in my stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Great product and the delivery time was very fast</li>
            <li>more noticeable moles coming up , .</li>
            <li>Using red light therapy works best using nothing on your skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell for sure if it is working</li>
            <li>and it really works!!</li>
            <li>I thought I would try ordering one more time, if I have the same problems, I will need to order from another vendor.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because I am sooo glad there has finally became a cheap way to be young again</li>
            <li>/&gt;Stretch marks thinner in appearance, but still evident after 2 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to use this spray about 2 times with pressure, about 4times in total.</li>
            <li>I use this right before I go into the red light therapy bed, paying close attention to discolorations on my hands from age or from the sun.</li>
            <li>Also, any scars I had from my cats claws are pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>I used this for about a month straight along with the red light therapy machine</li>
            <li>I started doing the Red Light Therapy bed at Showbiz Tan probably about a month or so ago.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to EVERYONE who is thinking about trying the Red Light Therapy Bed..</li>
            <li>The hyper pigmentation on my face is so much lighter.</li>
            <li>It worked really well, but took about 4 sessions for me to really see the results.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent to it when you spray it on, one bottle lasted me about a month when I used it 4 times a week.</li>
            <li>I am going on week 7 of using the red light therapy and this product together.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed that this has made any impact on my red light experience.  </li>
            <li>spray itself smells really funny, almost like old jacuzzi water, and you are meant to spray it onto your body before entering your red light therapy session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>was using it mainly on my face and on my stretch mark areas.</li>
            <li>I had been doing RLT for a few weeks before buying this, without really noticeable results, and with this can of spray, the results were more noted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I started doing the red light bed, I have only gone 15 times..</li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle of this stuff while I use the red light therapy machine at my gym.</li>
            <li>That translates to one week from starting red light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s this product or the red light therapy bed, but my face appears much more softer and my poores look to be getting smaller.</li>
            <li>Such a better value, having used it for 16 total body applications (today I had my 20th session) and still have some in the 9oz tube.(i got it for $16 from a dif web site)</li>
            <li>I picked this one up on Amazon only because my red light therapy salon recommended I buy it from them for a grossly overpriced amount of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked it up online for more than half off, and the results took a while to be noticed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does make you feel like you spent some time in the sun which is good for me as Chicago weather sucks in the winter.</li>
            <li>In all fairness, I have typically ordered two or more BWL Redlight Mist bottles on the same order, whereby one bottle will spray and the other bottle will not spray or at least not spray effectively.  </li>
            <li>The dark scar that was on my arm is almost invisible unless you are right up on it.</li>

            <li> I am now frustrated with BWL RedLight Mist.  I have purchased this same product on two different occasions.  Both times, I have had trouble with the spraying mechanism.  In other words, I was unable to use the misting product.  Or to look at this situation from another direction, I wasted my money.  In all fairness, I have typically ordered two or more BWL Redlight Mist bottles on the same order, whereby one bottle will spray and the other bottle will not spray or at least not spray effectively.  I thought I would try ordering one more time, if I have the same problems, I will need to order from another vendor. I suppose I should not be foolish and order again, since I have wasted my money on two BWL spray bottles already.</li>
            <li> Like this product and I will order again. I feel the collagen being replaced every time I use it!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I am sooo glad there has finally became a cheap way to be young again and it really works!!</li>
            <li> I am a little skeptical about the whole red light therapy, I have been doing it and it basically makes your skin a little red for a couple of hours. It does make you feel like you spent some time in the sun which is good for me as Chicago weather sucks in the winter. The product smells funky.</li>
            <li> $$$ SAVINGS ON MY REDLIGHT SUPPLIES.</li>
            <li> Great skin care.... it made my cellulite on thighs and tummy less noticable.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell for sure if it is working but maybe it takes awhile.  The spray makes me cough a lot when I breath it in so I try to keep my mouth covered.</li>
            <li> Great product and the delivery time was very fast</li>
            <li> I started doing the Red Light Therapy bed at Showbiz Tan probably about a month or so ago. I had a few VERY dark scars that I wasn&#x27;t too fond of, also after my pregnancy my face wasn&#x27;t as \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; as it could have been. So I started doing the red light bed, I have only gone 15 times.. (I ran out of the spray and don&#x27;t want to use my sessions without it) The dark scar that was on my arm is almost invisible unless you are right up on it. My face has cleared up to the point I don&#x27;t even have to wear make-up (unless its eyes shadow and such)... I recommend this product to EVERYONE who is thinking about trying the Red Light Therapy Bed..</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t spray in your face, it will take your breath away &amp; make you cough. Spray on your hand &amp; apply to your face.</li>
            <li> I used this for about a month straight along with the red light therapy machine and I honestly didn&#x27;t see any differences in my stretch marks. I will probably try it again in a few months though. Ive heard that it is suppose to be really good though, which is why I decided to try it....</li>
            <li> This pre therapy mist, I truly believe is working. I use this right before I go into the red light therapy bed, paying close attention to discolorations on my hands from age or from the sun. What a difference. The spots on my hands are all but gone. The hyper pigmentation on my face is so much lighter. I would deff purchase again.</li>
            <li> I picked this one up on Amazon only because my red light therapy salon recommended I buy it from them for a grossly overpriced amount of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked it up online for more than half off, and the results took a while to be noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray itself smells really funny, almost like old jacuzzi water, and you are meant to spray it onto your body before entering your red light therapy session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using it mainly on my face and on my stretch mark areas. It worked really well, but took about 4 sessions for me to really see the results. I had been doing RLT for a few weeks before buying this, without really noticeable results, and with this can of spray, the results were more noted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Example:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stretch marks thinner in appearance, but still evident after 2 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 4 uses, I saw them shrinking, but they of course were still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it will not remove your stretch marks, but it will shrink them making them less embarrassing.</li>
            <li> To runny. Using red light therapy works best using nothing on your skin. Moisturize with vitamin c after!  Don&#x27;t waist money!</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of this stuff while I use the red light therapy machine at my gym. It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent to it when you spray it on, one bottle lasted me about a month when I used it 4 times a week. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s this product or the red light therapy bed, but my face appears much more softer and my poores look to be getting smaller. I am going on week 7 of using the red light therapy and this product together. I&#x27;ve also noticed my stretch marks have started fading and getting smaller. Also, any scars I had from my cats claws are pretty much gone. I would recommend you order this product off Amazon as you can get it for about $10 cheaper than in the store!!</li>
            <li> I used 2 bottles of this stuff. The only thing I noticed was as long as you use it you get darker when you tan.&lt;br /&gt;After I ran out , I seem to be losing my tan , as for all the other miracles it&#x27;s suppose to do . Nothing ,  I seem to&lt;br /&gt;Have more noticeable moles coming up , . And I noticed that people who use the red therapy beds . They have a&lt;br /&gt;Glow about them</li>
            <li> I used the red bed for 4 months and this and I didn&#x27;t notice a difference.  In fact, this stuff made me cough every time I sprayed it. I wouldn&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed that this has made any impact on my red light experience.  I will not be reordering, far too expensive for unnoticeable results.</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle doesn&#x27;t work, the mist flies everywhere.  Don&#x27;t think The product has any effect on my skin.  Was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got it as part of the starting kit from local HT for $80. I was able to use this spray about 2 times with pressure, about 4times in total. That translates to one week from starting red light. That is way too expenssive to keep using. Also, no matter what application method I used, I had an asthma attack every single time I used it, and my family members were complaing of strange breathing difficulties those days as well.&lt;br /&gt;I was soooo looking forward improving my skin tone, but this is not the product for me. Now i use the 2in1 collagenetics for prep. Such a better value, having used it for 16 total body applications (today I had my 20th session) and still have some in the 9oz tube.(i got it for $16 from a dif web site)</li>
            <li> The spray does not spray  also need to use two thumbs to press spray</li>
            <li> I used it once and then it would not spray again.... Too much trouble to return back.  So threw it away. Learned my lesson on this on</li>
