            <li>The brush works well with the eye shadows, and the brow pencil is perfect for any type of brow</li>
            <li>But it makes for them being perfect for day use.</li>
            <li>brushes are the best.  </li>
            <li>This has everything, perfect started kit--I bought this because I wanted to try some ELF products, and this was a great way to try it.</li>
            <li>A perfect Christmas gift and the price is nice!</li>

            <li>Great kit, everything a girl on a budget could want.</li>
            <li>I chose the brown set for a nice, neutral eye, and it&#x27;s perfect!  </li>

            <li>The brush is great quality.</li>
            <li>What a great package they put together.  </li>

            <li>very nice neutral set, realize that the mascara is also brown.  </li>
            <li>came In  a lovely kit and the colors are perfect.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say how good those are.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly E.l.</li>
            <li>F cosmetics has really good products for the the price.</li>
            <li>and I had heard so many great reviews about</li>
            <li>I love this E.l.f. Brown Set!</li>
            <li>I love this set!</li>
            <li>Fabulous Item!!</li>
            <li>The eye shadows are very pigmented and look beautiful!</li>
            <li>Great price for a full set of cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Excellent makeup ... really had wanted to buy more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ways liked powder eyeshadows, so these are good, and they hold a light shimmer.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply lashes</li>
            <li>Love the gold eyeshadow the most, I use it every day!</li>
            <li>Eyelashes aren&#x27;t cheap and come with good glue.</li>
            <li>and I have a very light complexion.</li>
            <li>The colors of the shadows do not match the picture, the case also shows that they come from is a very cheap material.</li>
            <li>The mascara is fantastic!</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic set for the price!  </li>
            <li>so many creamy liners do.  </li>
            <li>The eye shadows are okay, but the two darker tones look identical when you receive them, I haven&#x27;t used the eye lashes or adhesive yet.</li>
            <li>They are gentle on my face and all of good quality, plus, they hold the pigmentation nicely.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love all of this.  </li>
            <li>I love the eyeshadow color</li>
            <li>Perfect for blue eyes!</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I needed 5 more dollars in my cart to qualify for free shipping</li>
            <li>but i just wish their pigment was a bit better vs going on so light.</li>
            <li>All of the products are good quality - the eyeliner, something I&#x27;m very picky about, glides on smooth and doesn&#x27;t melt off like</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great set</li>
            <li>It does NOT go on smooth like others claim.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t use the sharpener as I already have a great one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be buying any e.l.f. products in the future.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good bang for your buck :)</li>
            <li>Originally I just ordered this kit as an add on to a purchase so that I could get free shipping.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about it is the brush.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows are OK but in order for them to look decent, you&#x27;ll need to use eyelid primer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are very pretty, but not as brown.  </li>
            <li>I never used Elf cosmetics before, but I would definitely invest in more of their cosmetics!</li>
            <li>They will be fun to try.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows all stay true to their color and hold up very well.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows are pretty good, the shadow brushes are okay, but the mascara was dry and flaky, the eyeliner brush dry and draggy on the eye.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know why all these other people are saying this is a great set because it is far from it.</li>
            <li>They are pretty colors.  </li>
            <li>I immediately threw it into the trash after the first use.</li>
            <li>I can spend the same amount of money and get better quality from the drugstore.</li>
            <li>The other stuff in this kit is pretty nice though.</li>
            <li>expected more as i love the elf line - this left me not even using any of the kit.  </li>
            <li>The eyelashes look and feel like real lashes.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t say much for the rest of the stuff...</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Well... I really like these products..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use much makeup</li>
            <li>The mascara I didn&#x27;t really like</li>
            <li>Yes, I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I had to give that to my teenage daughter, other than that very pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using for everyday makeup, except the mascara, as its brown, and my eyelashes are more dark, almost black, but it&#x27;s OK, :)</li>
            <li>But overall....I absolutely love the eye shadows, mascara, and even the little brush that comes with it.</li>
            <li>This complete set is cheeap Evertyhing , too much talcom in the shadows</li>
            <li>They go on okay, but it takes me quite a few applications to build up to the effect that I want.  </li>
            <li>Great little package for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>Three shadows; a light, medium and dark.  </li>
            <li>All sets come with a dark, medium, and light shade of eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really complain, considering this was only $7.00, which is what I would normally pay just for eye shadow, but it&#x27;s not what I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>It allows me to make my eyes pop but still look natural.  </li>
            <li>and I shop with them frequently</li>
            <li>and they just glide on, but they have a sparkle to them that just does not suit a 62 year old.  </li>
            <li>The eyeshadows are pretty but they wear a little lighter than they look in the container.</li>
            <li>The mascara is very clumpy, I don&#x27;t use it, I just use it as an eyebrow gel since my eyebrows are a dark brown, like the mascara.</li>
            <li>I never really use fake eyelashes, but they are good to have for future reference.</li>

            <li> I liked everything in this kit except the lash and lash glue... useless!</li>
            <li> The eyeshades don&#x27;t have much pigment and flake, the mascara is okay but messy, the eyeliner is dull and hard to apply, and the brush sheds.</li>
            <li> They last a long time</li>
            <li> The shadows are not really the colors they look like in the photo.  </li>

            <li> The shadows are not as dark as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it so into the trash</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lengthen the lashes at all, and it&#x27;s a very very dark brown.</li>
            <li> I use it for my everyday look.</li>
            <li> it was a waste of my money</li>
            <li> It is very messy.</li>
            <li> In order for any sort of pigment to show up while using it I had to push hard.</li>
            <li> The packaging was dirty and the corners were worn, so possibly my set had been sitting around for a while.</li>
            <li> and if it sucks then well, lesson</li>
            <li> Eyelashes were pointless and useless.</li>
            <li> comes with 3 eye shadows , an eye pencil, mascara, 2 sponge tipped applicators and 1 blending brush, and eye pencil sharpener, 1 set of false lashes and a tube of eyelash glue.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s an eyeliner, mascara, a brush and two sponge applicators, false eyelashes, and glue.  </li>
            <li> From the other reviews, I&#x27;m wondering if I got a  bad one.</li>
            <li> so it is difficult to get all your lashes well.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t wear fake lashes</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t ever figure out fake lashes so they may or may not be up to par.</li>
            <li> Its impossible to use the mascara.</li>
            <li> The mascara is horrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The colors don&#x27;t show up as well on my skin and I have a very light complexion.</li>
            <li> I use this set every day.  It allows me to make my eyes pop but still look natural.  Great price for a full set of cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I love this E.l.f. Brown Set! I&#x27;m using for everyday makeup, except the mascara, as its brown, and my eyelashes are more dark, almost black, but it&#x27;s OK, :)</li>
            <li> My only problem was with the mascara. Do yourself a favor and just pick up a tube of Maybelline mascara. The other stuff in this kit is pretty nice though.</li>
            <li> The colors of the shadows do not match the picture, the case also shows that they come from is a very cheap material.</li>
            <li> Great kit, everything a girl on a budget could want. I like the size of the products, the pencils and the eye make up brushes. The eyelashes look and feel like real lashes. They will be fun to try. This kit was a great buy !</li>
            <li> The shadows are not as dark as I had hoped.  They go on okay, but it takes me quite a few applications to build up to the effect that I want.  They are pretty colors.  I like the eyeliner.  I&#x27;m not to fond of the mascara.  But that&#x27;s just my personal choice</li>
            <li> came In  a lovely kit and the colors are perfect. comes with 3 eye shadows , an eye pencil, mascara, 2 sponge tipped applicators and 1 blending brush, and eye pencil sharpener, 1 set of false lashes and a tube of eyelash glue. A perfect Christmas gift and the price is nice!</li>
            <li> I love this set! I use it for my everyday look. Very easy to apply lashes</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really complain, considering this was only $7.00, which is what I would normally pay just for eye shadow, but it&#x27;s not what I was hoping for.  The mascara is horrible.  The mascara brush is tiny. It doesn&#x27;t lengthen the lashes at all, and it&#x27;s a very very dark brown. I won&#x27;t ever use it, so it&#x27;s ending up in my purse as an emergency only tube.  The shadows are not really the colors they look like in the photo.  They are very pretty, but not as brown.  The lightest one almost looks mauve in the photo, but it actually has a yellowish/cream tint to it.  The other two have a silver tint to them.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are pretty good, the shadow brushes are okay, but the mascara was dry and flaky, the eyeliner brush dry and draggy on the eye. I haven&#x27;t tried the lashes. From the other reviews, I&#x27;m wondering if I got a  bad one. The packaging was dirty and the corners were worn, so possibly my set had been sitting around for a while.</li>
            <li> The lashes were wonderful along with the glue but I can&#x27;t say much for the rest of the stuff... The eyeshades don&#x27;t have much pigment and flake, the mascara is okay but messy, the eyeliner is dull and hard to apply, and the brush sheds.</li>
            <li> The mascara is fantastic! The brush works well with the eye shadows, and the brow pencil is perfect for any type of brow</li>
            <li> expected more as i love the elf line - this left me not even using any of the kit.  it was a waste of my money</li>
            <li> This complete set is cheeap Evertyhing , too much talcom in the shadows The mascara was clumpy and barely there and the eye pencil was too dry to put on my eyes.  wont buy this again</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic set for the price!  I like to focus on my eyes when I do my makeup and this set has everything you need.  Three shadows; a light, medium and dark.  There&#x27;s an eyeliner, mascara, a brush and two sponge applicators, false eyelashes, and glue.  It even came with a pencil sharpener!  I chose the brown set for a nice, neutral eye, and it&#x27;s perfect!  All of the products are good quality - the eyeliner, something I&#x27;m very picky about, glides on smooth and doesn&#x27;t melt off like so many creamy liners do.  Overall, this is a great set and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Originally I just ordered this kit as an add on to a purchase so that I could get free shipping. lol. But overall....I absolutely love the eye shadows, mascara, and even the little brush that comes with it. I never used Elf cosmetics before, but I would definitely invest in more of their cosmetics!</li>
            <li> The mascara is very clumpy, I don&#x27;t use it, I just use it as an eyebrow gel since my eyebrows are a dark brown, like the mascara. The eyeliner pencil doesn&#x27;t work well unless you want to jab it into your eye. The eye shadows are okay, but the two darker tones look identical when you receive them, I haven&#x27;t used the eye lashes or adhesive yet. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Well... I really like these products.. I don&#x27;t use much makeup but when I do I like to use e.l.f.</li>
            <li> very nice neutral set, realize that the mascara is also brown.  I had to give that to my teenage daughter, other than that very pleased.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I bought all of these sets in brown, purple, and smoky. They all deserve five stars. The mascara and eyeliners in the smoky and purple sets are the same, but in the brown set, they are, well, brown. The brushes are all the same in all three sets. They are gentle on my face and all of good quality, plus, they hold the pigmentation nicely. I never really use fake eyelashes, but they are good to have for future reference. The eyeshadows all stay true to their color and hold up very well. All sets come with a dark, medium, and light shade of eyeshadow. I&#x27;ve ways liked powder eyeshadows, so these are good, and they hold a light shimmer. The sets come with two eyeshadow foam/sponge applicants and one sharpener. The packaging is neat and pleasing when you first open it, although the products can be a little difficult to remove from the packaging. Overall, I give this purchase a thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Love the gold eyeshadow the most, I use it every day! Its a great deal and I shop with them frequently</li>
            <li> Excellent makeup ... really had wanted to buy more but when I try and did not have any hope to get another chance!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I needed 5 more dollars in my cart to qualify for free shipping and I had heard so many great reviews about e.l.f. makeup. I figured what the hey - it&#x27;s $7 and if it sucks then well, lesson learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why all these other people are saying this is a great set because it is far from it. The only good thing about it is the brush. The eyeshadows are OK but in order for them to look decent, you&#x27;ll need to use eyelid primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner is a joke. I immediately threw it into the trash after the first use. It does NOT go on smooth like others claim. In order for any sort of pigment to show up while using it I had to push hard. Not worth it so into the trash it went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara is also a big fat joke. The brush has no curve whatsoever to it so it is difficult to get all your lashes well. Even after 3 coats I could still see the eyeshadow residue on my lashes. Wiped it all off and threw the mascara in the trash as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wear fake lashes so I can&#x27;t say how good those are. Didn&#x27;t use the sharpener as I already have a great one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be buying any e.l.f. products in the future. I can spend the same amount of money and get better quality from the drugstore.</li>
            <li> This was a good deal! Surprisingly E.l.F cosmetics has really good products for the the price. The eye shadows are very pigmented and look beautiful! Now the lashes I didn&#x27;t use.. I can&#x27;t ever figure out fake lashes so they may or may not be up to par. The mascara I didn&#x27;t really like but I&#x27;m not into brown Mascara. Overall, a good bang for your buck :)</li>
            <li> Great little package for everyday wear. Eyelashes aren&#x27;t cheap and come with good glue. Brown mascara wears all day. Pencil is creamy. The brush is great quality. The eyeshadows are pretty but they wear a little lighter than they look in the container. They last a long time but i just wish their pigment was a bit better vs going on so light. But it makes for them being perfect for day use.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love all of this.  What a great package they put together.  I love the eyeshadow color and they just glide on, but they have a sparkle to them that just does not suit a 62 year old.  Wish they had this in a matte.  Of course, the e.l.f. brushes are the best.  Yes, I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I liked everything in this kit except the lash and lash glue... useless! Everything else in this kit has met or surpast expentations</li>
            <li> This has everything, perfect started kit--I bought this because I wanted to try some ELF products, and this was a great way to try it. Perfect for blue eyes!</li>
            <li> Great Value.Fabulous Item!!</li>
            <li> Eyelashes were pointless and useless. Its impossible to use the mascara. It is very messy. Shades all look the same.</li>
