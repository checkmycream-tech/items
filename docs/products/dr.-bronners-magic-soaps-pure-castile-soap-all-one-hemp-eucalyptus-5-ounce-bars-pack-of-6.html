            <li>and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>The soap is nice to use but it DOESN&#x27;T WORK to repel insects as some have claimed.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still really nice soap with a nice scent</li>
            <li>Used it and liked it .  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s great for everyone and the hemp makes the skin feel smooth and healthy</li>
            <li>I thought it was just some kind of goofy granola bar, hippie gimmick until I decided to try it for myself.</li>
            <li>and like the feel of a good smooth soap, you owe it to yourself to try out the Dr. Bronners soaps.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap it leaves my skin very nice and clean</li>
            <li>It is strong; you can feel the alkalinity when it gets into your eyes, ouch!  </li>

            <li>I love this soap.  </li>
            <li>although I do like the scent, I think I like the scent of the peppermint better.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this soap, for all the reasons mentioned by others, but also another that no one seems to notice.</li>
            <li>I love the almond, tee tree oil, and eucalyptus soaps.</li>
            <li>I love using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>To top it all off</li>
            <li>so I am glad to get it on Amazon at this dealer.</li>
            <li>love this soap.</li>
            <li>I love this soap and it saves some cash buying it in bulk here on Amazon&#x27;s web site.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>But I saw in so many of the reviews the praise of Peppermint.  </li>
            <li>I love this company and have yet to find a product that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite soap.</li>
            <li>Love the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>The eucalyptus is refreshing in the morning.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>i use them for diy detergent and these smell/work fabulous!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different scents and this one is the best for me.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that the ingredients are natural and organic - good for the skin!</li>
            <li>Nice clean scent, creamy lather.</li>
            <li>It has a nice lather, and a clean eucalyptus smell.</li>
            <li>A new generation has taken the helm with Bronner products and I&#x27;m a great fan of this hemp/eucalyptus product.  </li>
            <li>Dr. Bronner&#x27;s makes great products that are healthy and natural and</li>
            <li>It smells great, natural, and leaves you feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>Clean feel after wash!</li>
            <li>From the beautiful eucalyptus scent, to the creamy smooth lather, to the way it completely rinses away, I am amazed.</li>
            <li>This soap smells great, cleans well, and leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and you get an overall pleasant experience from using this type of soap.  </li>
            <li>but it is very mild</li>
            <li>Good high quality soap.  </li>
            <li>This soap is hands down the best ever soap I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Many soap bars dissipate quickly.  </li>
            <li>They are great on your body, especially in the nether regions, but they are a bit too strong for your face/eyes.</li>
            <li>I happen to really like this for making my own laundry soap.</li>
            <li>Really far-out stuff.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li>Anyways this is all natural which is good.</li>
            <li>also use it to clean my face and hair and is fantastic product but for your hair</li>
            <li>It seems pricey, but the bars last longer than the cheap soaps, and the smell is light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a clean feeling and scent.  </li>
            <li>Much better value than higher priced eucalyptus glycerine bars that dissolve quickly and lose scant</li>
            <li>Gives a good clean feeling, but not enough scent.</li>
            <li>I just love this soap so much.  </li>
            <li>You get true eucalyptus, and the soap leaves a mild scent on your hands.</li>
            <li>The lather is heavenly, the subtil sent and the mild astrengent to the body.  </li>
            <li>It smells good, rinses clean, and doesn&#x27;t over dry your skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels super after using it.</li>
            <li>I also really love this particular scent.</li>
            <li>The soap has a great eucalyptus smell and is mild if you have sensitive skin to regular shelf brands.</li>
            <li>These soap are a luxury worth the expense.</li>
            <li>It makes it worth getting out of bed every morning at five o&#x27;clock even when you don&#x27;t have to.  </li>
            <li>is the size of the bar - pretty big,meaning it&#x27;ll last a long time.overall an excellent product.</li>
            <li>Took teen off strong chemical acne washes, which helped at first then stopped and this has done so much better.  </li>
            <li>multiple uses it&#x27;s a very cheap investment.</li>
            <li>Anyways, This soap smells clean and it is nice knowing that it is not made with any harsh chemicals or cancer causing stuff like cocamide diethanolamine DEA.</li>
            <li>I first discovered it in Hawaii, on a vacation.  </li>
            <li>What a great natural scent, I even keep a few bars around the bathroom just for the aroma.  </li>
            <li>The reason it works so well on your face is because it&#x27;s full of real eucalyptus oil which is naturally antibacterial and anti-inflammatory.</li>
            <li>Fantastic soap if you live near or are traveling to an area with mosquitos.</li>
            <li>I really wanted a bar soap that I could use for all washing in the shower including hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s organic and Fair-Trade responsible.</li>
            <li>I really like this soap.</li>
            <li>People really appreciate them as soon as they give them a try.</li>
            <li>use another product with the same company is called Organic Hair Creme for leave&lt;br /&gt;conditioning &amp; Light Styling</li>
            <li>It lathers very well</li>
            <li>Really like the product.  </li>
            <li>I know there are many fragrant, emollient, specialty and other soaps out there.</li>
            <li>It only takes a little of it to build a good lather and you can tell it is cleaning your skin.  </li>
            <li>It works just as well or even better than more expensive soaps.  </li>
            <li>Just a word of caution that when you buy this product or any other Dr Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps; do not be surprised when you do not see USDA approved.</li>
            <li>Maybe if more people buy it, the price will go down?!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural, it keeps the bugs away, and it lathers really well.  </li>
            <li>Overall, worth the investment.</li>
            <li>It will be my bath soap from now on even if I have to live on rice and beans.  </li>
            <li>I live in FL and mosquitoes and gnats</li>
            <li>And, God forbid... make it \\&quot;New</li>
            <li>Have very sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>peppermint has too much of a cooling/burning sensation, eucalyptus was the right choice, very slight cooling sensation, crisp scent...</li>
            <li>Mosquitos normally eat me alive in the first 30 seconds of being outside, but if I have showered with this eucalyptus soap, they don&#x27;t touch me.</li>
            <li>First came across this soap at the local grocer.  </li>
            <li>Many other natural and handmade soaps mix so many other scents or essential oils in with each other that the main scent gets lost.</li>
            <li>I have looked at other eucalyptus soaps and this set them beat by more than a long shot.  </li>
            <li>when rinsed it did feel as if it stripped all the natural oil and</li>
            <li>I initially found this soap at Whole Foods here in Houston and got some for me and my Mom to try.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin soft.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the commitment to natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this twice so far</li>
            <li>However the bar, while large, seems to last about a 3-4 weeks before its time to open a new one.  </li>
            <li>I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps as they lather up like crazy, leave my skin soft, and the fragrances are super.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling clean without harsh and environmental-harming chemicals and sudsing agents.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very relaxing scent but in this bar it is not overpowering or long lingering.</li>
            <li>Bar lasts reasonable long time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gonna cause dry itchy scalp, but after I conditioned that squeaky stripped feeling completely went away and after my hair dried it was perfectly fine, not dry at all..</li>
            <li>Works very well for mosquitos and other insects, but didn&#x27;t stop some chiggers from doing their thing.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out your skin</li>
            <li>and im down to one unopened bar, and they are large bars.  </li>
            <li>I was highly skeptical and figured theres no way it would make a good shampoo but tried it anyway, it lathered in my hair extremely well, but</li>
            <li>I have sensitive dry skin</li>
            <li>All Natural, long lasting soap.  </li>

            <li> It has a nice lather, and a clean eucalyptus smell.</li>
            <li> A new generation has taken the helm with Bronner products and I&#x27;m a great fan of this hemp/eucalyptus product.  </li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s makes great products that are healthy and natural and</li>
            <li> It smells great, natural, and leaves you feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> Clean feel after wash!</li>
            <li> From the beautiful eucalyptus scent, to the creamy smooth lather, to the way it completely rinses away, I am amazed.</li>
            <li> This soap smells great, cleans well, and leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and you get an overall pleasant experience from using this type of soap.  </li>
            <li> but it is very mild</li>
            <li> Good high quality soap.  </li>
            <li> This soap is hands down the best ever soap I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Many soap bars dissipate quickly.  </li>
            <li> They are great on your body, especially in the nether regions, but they are a bit too strong for your face/eyes.</li>
            <li> I happen to really like this for making my own laundry soap.</li>
            <li> Really far-out stuff.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li> Anyways this is all natural which is good.</li>
            <li> also use it to clean my face and hair and is fantastic product but for your hair</li>
            <li> It seems pricey, but the bars last longer than the cheap soaps, and the smell is light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a clean feeling and scent.  </li>
            <li> Much better value than higher priced eucalyptus glycerine bars that dissolve quickly and lose scant</li>
            <li> Gives a good clean feeling, but not enough scent.</li>
            <li> I just love this soap so much.  </li>
            <li> You get true eucalyptus, and the soap leaves a mild scent on your hands.</li>
            <li> The lather is heavenly, the subtil sent and the mild astrengent to the body.  </li>
            <li> It smells good, rinses clean, and doesn&#x27;t over dry your skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels super after using it.</li>
            <li> I also really love this particular scent.</li>
            <li> The soap has a great eucalyptus smell and is mild if you have sensitive skin to regular shelf brands.</li>
            <li> These soap are a luxury worth the expense.</li>
            <li> It makes it worth getting out of bed every morning at five o&#x27;clock even when you don&#x27;t have to.  </li>
            <li> is the size of the bar - pretty big,meaning it&#x27;ll last a long time.overall an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Took teen off strong chemical acne washes, which helped at first then stopped and this has done so much better.  </li>
            <li> multiple uses it&#x27;s a very cheap investment.</li>
            <li> Anyways, This soap smells clean and it is nice knowing that it is not made with any harsh chemicals or cancer causing stuff like cocamide diethanolamine DEA.</li>
            <li> I first discovered it in Hawaii, on a vacation.  </li>
            <li> What a great natural scent, I even keep a few bars around the bathroom just for the aroma.  </li>
            <li> The reason it works so well on your face is because it&#x27;s full of real eucalyptus oil which is naturally antibacterial and anti-inflammatory.</li>
            <li> Fantastic soap if you live near or are traveling to an area with mosquitos.</li>
            <li> I really wanted a bar soap that I could use for all washing in the shower including hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s organic and Fair-Trade responsible.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap.</li>
            <li> People really appreciate them as soon as they give them a try.</li>
            <li> use another product with the same company is called Organic Hair Creme for leave&lt;br /&gt;conditioning &amp; Light Styling</li>
            <li> It lathers very well</li>
            <li> Really like the product.  </li>
            <li> I know there are many fragrant, emollient, specialty and other soaps out there.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little of it to build a good lather and you can tell it is cleaning your skin.  </li>
            <li> It works just as well or even better than more expensive soaps.  </li>
            <li> Just a word of caution that when you buy this product or any other Dr Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps; do not be surprised when you do not see USDA approved.</li>
            <li> Maybe if more people buy it, the price will go down?!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural, it keeps the bugs away, and it lathers really well.  </li>
            <li> Overall, worth the investment.</li>
            <li> It will be my bath soap from now on even if I have to live on rice and beans.  </li>
            <li> I live in FL and mosquitoes and gnats</li>
            <li> And, God forbid... make it \\&quot;New</li>
            <li> Have very sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> peppermint has too much of a cooling/burning sensation, eucalyptus was the right choice, very slight cooling sensation, crisp scent...</li>
            <li> Mosquitos normally eat me alive in the first 30 seconds of being outside, but if I have showered with this eucalyptus soap, they don&#x27;t touch me.</li>
            <li> First came across this soap at the local grocer.  </li>
            <li> Many other natural and handmade soaps mix so many other scents or essential oils in with each other that the main scent gets lost.</li>
            <li> I have looked at other eucalyptus soaps and this set them beat by more than a long shot.  </li>
            <li> when rinsed it did feel as if it stripped all the natural oil and</li>
            <li> I initially found this soap at Whole Foods here in Houston and got some for me and my Mom to try.  </li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin soft.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the commitment to natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice so far</li>
            <li> However the bar, while large, seems to last about a 3-4 weeks before its time to open a new one.  </li>
            <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps as they lather up like crazy, leave my skin soft, and the fragrances are super.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling clean without harsh and environmental-harming chemicals and sudsing agents.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very relaxing scent but in this bar it is not overpowering or long lingering.</li>
            <li> Bar lasts reasonable long time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gonna cause dry itchy scalp, but after I conditioned that squeaky stripped feeling completely went away and after my hair dried it was perfectly fine, not dry at all..</li>
            <li> Works very well for mosquitos and other insects, but didn&#x27;t stop some chiggers from doing their thing.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out your skin</li>
            <li> and im down to one unopened bar, and they are large bars.  </li>
            <li> I was highly skeptical and figured theres no way it would make a good shampoo but tried it anyway, it lathered in my hair extremely well, but</li>
            <li> I have sensitive dry skin</li>
            <li> All Natural, long lasting soap.  </li>
            <li> So clean smelling and  non irritating.</li>
            <li> but really this stuff is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> a bar doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> These bars last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last that long however and if you use a soap container it tends to flake.</li>
            <li> I will continue to order from Amazon as long as the price with delivery is cheaper than buying it locally.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out our skin, either.</li>
            <li> The dry skin on my hands is already gone</li>
            <li> Not sure if I can use it everyday, but this product certainly works well.</li>
            <li> Maybe a week and a half if you bath regularly.</li>
            <li> When I have a stain I wet it and scrub this soap into the stain then wash it.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s a bit expensive, I think it&#x27;s well worth it for the organic fair-trade sourced contents.</li>
            <li> They seem to last a BIT longer than ordinary bar soaps.  </li>
            <li> but I read some of the other review and then tried the Lavender.  </li>
            <li> And I am one of those people that has unsuccessfully tried many things to repel mosquitos: repellent spray, eating garlic, taking extra B1, etc.</li>
            <li> Only thing that sucks...</li>
            <li> And no guilt of sending harmfull chemicals down the drain and out to our ecosystem.</li>
            <li> Has anyone ever sat down and read the story on the bottle from beginning to end?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I have that slight greasy coating I get from using another soap brand.</li>
            <li> the 50$ some odd is terrifying at 1st but the jug lasts forever, not having to go buy 4$ Replacements every couple of weeks or so has turned this into a huge money saver!!</li>
            <li> I was a little worried I would like it</li>
            <li> I got a six pack a few months ago</li>
            <li> Not sure about the mosquito part as they have not arrived yet.</li>
            <li> no burning or excessive peppermint side effects.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this one in the stores</li>
            <li> i can feel the squeakiest cleanliness of it, but its not for acne oily skin, or at least not for me.</li>
            <li> My wife suffers from dry skin and used Dove until she tried Dr. B&#x27;s now she&#x27;s hooked too.</li>
            <li> This soap is my savior from those blood-sucking little jerks!!!</li>
            <li> Look it up if you don&#x27;t believe me or correct me if I&#x27;m wrong about that study.</li>
            <li> Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> This fragrance - eucalyptus - I like for cold season.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very faint, even when I&#x27;m lathering up.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very nice. Long lasting. Not sure about the mosquito part as they have not arrived yet.</li>
            <li> The scent is very faint, even when I&#x27;m lathering up. I can only imagine that my odor is even further reduced than the actual lathering. Gives a good clean feeling, but not enough scent. Maybe a different scent will help with that.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  Leaves a clean feeling and scent.  I tried the eucalyptus and although I do like the scent, I think I like the scent of the peppermint better.  They seem to last a BIT longer than ordinary bar soaps.  Maybe 1.5 times as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip though, these were not meant for your face or eyes.  They are great on your body, especially in the nether regions, but they are a bit too strong for your face/eyes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this soap, for all the reasons mentioned by others, but also another that no one seems to notice. The eucalyptus soap has fabulous mosquito-repelling properties!!! Mosquitos normally eat me alive in the first 30 seconds of being outside, but if I have showered with this eucalyptus soap, they don&#x27;t touch me. And I am one of those people that has unsuccessfully tried many things to repel mosquitos: repellent spray, eating garlic, taking extra B1, etc. This soap is my savior from those blood-sucking little jerks!!!</li>
            <li> The eucalyptus soap from Dr Bronner&#x27;s line offers the skin soothing, moisture expected from a castile soap with the added benefit of clearing out the winter snuffles.</li>
            <li> I love the almond, tee tree oil, and eucalyptus soaps. I did find this soap for the same price locally so I will be buying it locally instead.</li>
            <li> Clean feel after wash!</li>
            <li> I happen to really like this for making my own laundry soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product. The eucalyptus scent makes me feel like I&#x27;m at a luxurious spa. It&#x27;s a very relaxing scent but in this bar it is not overpowering or long lingering. The soap lathers nicely and does a great job cleaning. I even use this on stained clothes. When I have a stain I wet it and scrub this soap into the stain then wash it. Gets stains out or whitens clothes. It&#x27;s a very good buy and consider it&#x27;s multiple uses it&#x27;s a very cheap investment.</li>
            <li> I really wanted a bar soap that I could use for all washing in the shower including hair. I was highly skeptical and figured theres no way it would make a good shampoo but tried it anyway, it lathered in my hair extremely well, but when rinsed it did feel as if it stripped all the natural oil and though oh no it&#x27;s gonna cause dry itchy scalp, but after I conditioned that squeaky stripped feeling completely went away and after my hair dried it was perfectly fine, not dry at all.. So to my surprise this soap worked as a shampoo! And this eucalyptus scent is amazing! It&#x27;s very warm and spicy, which I love. Ps aside from a shampoo I also used this all over the rest of my body including my face and used it to shave, it was just great all around. Maybe if more people buy it, the price will go down?! Lol buy it!</li>
            <li> delivered timely and for a great price.</li>
            <li> Best soaps ever! No drying out of skin and the smells of the flavors are heavenly!</li>
            <li> This soap smells like a spa. I love using it. It doesn&#x27;t dry out our skin, either. And the price on Amazon for a six-pack beats what you&#x27;ll find in retail.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried I would like it but it is very mild&lt;br /&gt;And not overpowering. Washes off great.</li>
            <li> Smells great, cleans great. I like the fact that the ingredients are natural and organic - good for the skin! Even though it&#x27;s a bit expensive, I think it&#x27;s well worth it for the organic fair-trade sourced contents.</li>
            <li> A new generation has taken the helm with Bronner products and I&#x27;m a great fan of this hemp/eucalyptus product.  Great lather.  Great feel.  Bar lasts reasonable long time.</li>
            <li> This soap is hands down the best ever soap I have ever used! And no guilt of sending harmfull chemicals down the drain and out to our ecosystem. We also buy the gallon sized liquid soap and dilute it into hand soap dispensers (foaming dispensers are best) the 50$ some odd is terrifying at 1st but the jug lasts forever, not having to go buy 4$ Replacements every couple of weeks or so has turned this into a huge money saver!!</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps as they lather up like crazy, leave my skin soft, and the fragrances are super.  This fragrance - eucalyptus - I like for cold season.  I put the bars I&#x27;m not using yet in my kitchen towel drawer, or with the sweeter fragrances in my clothing drawers.</li>
            <li> My brother has used Dr. B&#x27;s for years. I thought it was just some kind of goofy granola bar, hippie gimmick until I decided to try it for myself. I&#x27;m in love. From the beautiful eucalyptus scent, to the creamy smooth lather, to the way it completely rinses away, I am amazed. Okay this is coming from a Dial user, so you would think anything of quality would seem great by comparison but really this stuff is unbelievable. My wife suffers from dry skin and used Dove until she tried Dr. B&#x27;s now she&#x27;s hooked too. She even noticed the clearing of her eczema. And at Amazon&#x27;s price you can&#x27;t beat the value. To top it all off it&#x27;s organic and Fair-Trade responsible.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for years. Its simple and nice and I like this fragrance the best. Hard to find this one in the stores so I am glad to get it on Amazon at this dealer. Arrives in great time.</li>
            <li> Works very well for mosquitos and other insects, but didn&#x27;t stop some chiggers from doing their thing. Overall, worth the investment.</li>
            <li> love this soap. good for insect repellant too</li>
            <li> I love this soap and it saves some cash buying it in bulk here on Amazon&#x27;s web site.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for everyone and the hemp makes the skin feel smooth and healthy</li>
            <li> The best!  Took teen off strong chemical acne washes, which helped at first then stopped and this has done so much better.  Uses morning and night as well as her dad and myself.</li>
            <li> meets my expectations, no mosquito bites since I started using this soap.</li>
            <li> I initially found this soap at Whole Foods here in Houston and got some for me and my Mom to try.  She loved it and so did I.  It does not dry out your skin and it cleans thoroughly.  It only takes a little of it to build a good lather and you can tell it is cleaning your skin.  The smell is nice and you get an overall pleasant experience from using this type of soap.  I don&#x27;t feel like I have that slight greasy coating I get from using another soap brand.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap. Has anyone ever sat down and read the story on the bottle from beginning to end? Really far-out stuff. Anyways, This soap smells clean and it is nice knowing that it is not made with any harsh chemicals or cancer causing stuff like cocamide diethanolamine DEA. Look it up if you don&#x27;t believe me or correct me if I&#x27;m wrong about that study. Anyways this is all natural which is good. Only thing that sucks...a bar doesn&#x27;t last that long. Maybe a week and a half if you bath regularly.</li>
            <li> All Natural, long lasting soap.  Many soap bars dissipate quickly.  These bars last a long time.  Great product and kid approved.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s all natural, it keeps the bugs away, and it lathers really well.  It can also be used as a shampoo.</li>
            <li> These soap are a luxury worth the expense. I have tried this one, the Eucalyptus and it was really terrific but I read some of the other review and then tried the Lavender.  What a treat!  But I saw in so many of the reviews the praise of Peppermint.  Oh My, My!  The lather is heavenly, the subtil sent and the mild astrengent to the body.  It makes it worth getting out of bed every morning at five o&#x27;clock even when you don&#x27;t have to.  It will be my bath soap from now on even if I have to live on rice and beans.  These soaps are great for gifts too.  People really appreciate them as soon as they give them a try.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s makes great products that are healthy and natural and I would  recommend them!  They smell good and have great forms.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing. It smells good, rinses clean, and doesn&#x27;t over dry your skin. I even use it on my face and it keeps my skin clearer than any acne facewash I&#x27;ve ever used. The reason it works so well on your face is because it&#x27;s full of real eucalyptus oil which is naturally antibacterial and anti-inflammatory. Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I read all of the comments on Amazon and decided to purchase some of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Hemp Eucalyptus bar soap to give me some relief from pesky insects.  The soap is nice to use but it DOESN&#x27;T WORK to repel insects as some have claimed.  I live in FL and mosquitoes and gnats are still bothersome even after using Hemp Eucalyptus soap.  Buy the soap if you are looking for organic soap to wash with but don&#x27;t purchase it for insect control because it&#x27;s ineffective.</li>
            <li> Nice clean scent, creamy lather.</li>
            <li> product arrived on time,well packaged and in perfect condition.since i got it, i use it every day in the shower and to wash my hands.it smells great and feels great on the skin.also noteable is the size of the bar - pretty big,meaning it&#x27;ll last a long time.overall an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Great soap! It doesn&#x27;t last that long however and if you use a soap container it tends to flake. My skin feels super after using it.</li>
            <li> This is the type of soap you want to buy. It smells great, natural, and leaves you feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> I love this soap it leaves my skin very nice and clean I feel refresh after a shower&lt;br /&gt;I also use it to clean my face and hair and is fantastic product but for your hair u have&lt;br /&gt;to use another product with the same company is called Organic Hair Creme for leave&lt;br /&gt;conditioning &amp; Light Styling I have try the Lavender Coconut and is wonderful leaves my&lt;br /&gt;hair ready for styling Super products I love them</li>
            <li> I have looked at other eucalyptus soaps and this set them beat by more than a long shot.  It works just as well or even better than more expensive soaps.  You cannot beat the savings but the performance of the soap is the icing on the cake.  This deserves six stars.</li>
            <li> This soap smells great, cleans well, and leaves your skin feeling soft. My husband enjoys using this soap as well.</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of Eucalyptus (or lavender, tea tree, citrus etc.) and like the feel of a good smooth soap, you owe it to yourself to try out the Dr. Bronners soaps.  They are all great.  I love this company and have yet to find a product that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap. I know there are many fragrant, emollient, specialty and other soaps out there. But this product is a thorogh cleanser, non-irritating, and has an aroma of eucalyptus trees. Wow.</li>
            <li> I like this soap. 5 stars. It lathers very well and I enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li> I bought the eucalyptus soap tonight at a health food store, and used it to wash my hands a couple of times to try it out. It has a nice lather, and a clean eucalyptus smell. Many other natural and handmade soaps mix so many other scents or essential oils in with each other that the main scent gets lost. Not in this soap. You get true eucalyptus, and the soap leaves a mild scent on your hands. Leaves the skin soft. The scent also wafts through the house from the sink, but is pleasant.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap on the planet. Smells great, sweet and creamy lather, excellent for the complexion, AND a wonderful shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;No conditioner needed. Hair is silky with body and no tangles. DR BONNER, please don&#x27;t stop making this. And, God forbid... make it \\&quot;New and Improved.\\&quot; It is PERFECT the way it is and I am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Really like the product.  Have very sensitive skin and this soap is great on it.  Spell is wonderful in warm shower.</li>
            <li> Great to keep mosquitoes off</li>
            <li> I have sensitive dry skin and this helps solve my problems.  Eucalyptus is a soothing scent and I prefer it to the mint scents.</li>
            <li> Best deal on the best soap.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s has been putting out soap for years.  This and the peppermint are my favorites.  Their liquid soap has a ton of uses.</li>
            <li> Love the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.  It seems pricey, but the bars last longer than the cheap soaps, and the smell is light and pleasant.  The eucalyptus is refreshing in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Grew up with it back when there were only 2 or 3 soaps to pick from.</li>
            <li> What a great natural scent, I even keep a few bars around the bathroom just for the aroma.  I appreciate the commitment to natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> i can feel the squeakiest cleanliness of it, but its not for acne oily skin, or at least not for me.</li>
            <li> Ok, this soap is not for the faint of heart.  It is strong; you can feel the alkalinity when it gets into your eyes, ouch!  I have oily skin, so I appreciate soaps that work so well.  This soap is not for everyone.  For instance, I can&#x27;t imagine my wife liking this.  She likes moisturizing soaps that leave a layer or two of slime on your skin.  Not sure if I can use it everyday, but this product certainly works well.</li>
            <li> Great eucalyptus smell, great on skin... Much better value than higher priced eucalyptus glycerine bars that dissolve quickly and lose scant</li>
            <li> Not as eucalytusy as I might have wanted but it&#x27;s still really nice soap with a nice scent</li>
            <li> First came across this soap at the local grocer.  Used it and liked it .  Found it in this size on amazon and ordered it.  The soap has a great eucalyptus smell and is mild if you have sensitive skin to regular shelf brands.</li>
            <li> Best soap I&#x27;ve used. Leaves skin feeling clean without harsh and environmental-harming chemicals and sudsing agents. Only downside is the smell - Eucalyptus. You either like it or you don&#x27;t, I suppose. I&#x27;ve tried peppermint, almond, and tea tree and prefer all those to eucalyptus. But if this smell is your thing, then go for it!</li>
            <li> this smells amazing! i use them for diy detergent and these smell/work fabulous!</li>
            <li> this is the best soap on the market. I have used the liquid and although I like it, I prefer a good bar soap instead.</li>
            <li> It was shipped and delivered in timely manner. I feel very happy to use this organic soap. Just a word of caution that when you buy this product or any other Dr Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps; do not be surprised when you do not see USDA approved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice so far and it is amazing. The dry skin on my hands is already gone and I can&#x27;t wait to use this in the shower tomorrow!</li>
            <li> I just love this soap so much.  I first discovered it in Hawaii, on a vacation.  Have used it ever since.  It smells great!  And has been around forever.  I will keep buying this brand without a doubt.  I also really love this particular scent.</li>
            <li> Good high quality soap.  However the bar, while large, seems to last about a 3-4 weeks before its time to open a new one.  I got a six pack a few months ago and im down to one unopened bar, and they are large bars.  Keep that in mind.  Great soap though...peppermint has too much of a cooling/burning sensation, eucalyptus was the right choice, very slight cooling sensation, crisp scent...no burning or excessive peppermint side effects.</li>
            <li> best soap ever! So clean smelling and  non irritating. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Great smell wakes you up in the morning.</li>
            <li> Fantastic soap if you live near or are traveling to an area with mosquitos. The scent of eucalyptus deters mosquitos, so this soap is perfect. It definitely helped in keeping the bites to a minimum while I lived in the tropics.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s bar soaps are awesome; nothing harmful in them.  Eucalyptus is mild on my skin AND it cleans my skin wonderfully leaving it feeling nice and soft.  I have tried many different scents and this one is the best for me.  Only soap I use for shaving, hand-washing, and body cleaning.  I will continue to order from Amazon as long as the price with delivery is cheaper than buying it locally.</li>
