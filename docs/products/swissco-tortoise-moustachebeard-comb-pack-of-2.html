            <li>and he also was very happy with it.</li>
            <li>The comb works well for my mustache, but it is very good for my beard too.</li>
            <li>great gift idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very nice quality comb.</li>
            <li>The good - you get 2 combs with your purchase.  </li>
            <li>Maybe good for others, depending on what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>the good.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Just amazing.</li>
            <li>Now I need to find a good pair of scissors to accompany my favorite comb.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right size  and works great when I need to prepare my beard for a trim.</li>
            <li>Love the comb but did not have two in the package as it said.  </li>
            <li>I worry it might break in the rather more robust environment there.</li>
            <li>The hair on the right side of my face has a mind of its own.</li>
            <li>I just wish they weren&#x27;t so easy to lose.</li>
            <li>The flip side, they are easy to lose.</li>
            <li>I bought this comb as a replacement for the cheap one that came with an electric beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>found this to be a great comb, robust enough haven&#x27;t had any breakages after 3 months of using.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The comb is in fact smooth on the hair and skin.</li>
            <li>This is perfect to take around with you in your pocket and keep your facial hair tamed while out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine teeth, and gentle on the face.  </li>
            <li>Works great without pulling or snagging and a nice size too, not too small like some others I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li>However, I found the comb &amp;#34;good enough&amp;#34; as something I can easily carry around for a quick comb.  </li>
            <li>The not so good - the tines just aren&#x27;t fine enough.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-Modest cool factor&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gladly, it works very well.</li>
            <li>Maybe this does not have the flourishes of other models, but from a pragmatic point of view it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li>If the beard was longer  Swissco comb teeth might not be adequate.</li>
            <li>its fine enough to be able to brush and trim beard accurately.</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;ve got a stylish curl, but you really need something to help spread the wax and keep it neet.</li>
            <li>This little comb is great for getting the mats and tangles out of my Shih Tzu&#x27;s beard</li>
            <li>I think they are a great value for seven dollars or so, and I would reorder in a heartbeat if I somehow managed to lose or destroy them.</li>
            <li>The tines are spaced too far apart to get good coming action.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite beard and mustache</li>
            <li>It was very worn and had glitter makeup on it.</li>
            <li>It works fantastic for knocking out the crumbs that inevitably find there way into your mo&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I really like the comb</li>
            <li>So if you REALLY need two, you might go somewhere else.</li>
            <li>VERY sturdy, doesn&#x27;t get caught in my beard.</li>
            <li>I feel that although there is not a \\&quot;handle\\&quot; to grab and manipulate, I am able to maneuver it well from one end while using the other.</li>
            <li>This mini-comb feels too much like a full size comb, loose, instead of snug around the whiskers.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty subjective, but at least you have the actual measurements and can make your own judgment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, with very smooth polished teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a little smaller than I expected, but still great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a comb with short teeth, exactly what you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li>I keep the second one in the drawer for the eventuality of when I lose the first.</li>
            <li>There is also a cool factor, but there are other \\&quot;cooler\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I find them fine enough to get the old &#x27;stache looking presentable, but not so fine as to tug uncomfortably.</li>
            <li>Ordered it thinking it was a pack of 2, which it clearly states, but only received one.  </li>
            <li>They are basic, but timeless and classy.</li>
            <li>The combs are of a smooth plastic that is flexible enough to withstand back pocket carry, but firm enough for their intended use.</li>
            <li>As some of the other posters have stated, this isn&#x27;t really a mustache comb.</li>

            <li> For anyone wondering about the size of these combs (they sold as a two pack): Mine are 4.5 inches long and about 1/2 inch from the spine to the tips of the teeth.</li>

            <li> This little comb is great for getting the mats and tangles out of my Shih Tzu&#x27;s beard and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the teeth damaging his eyes like with the regular metal detangling dog brushes.</li>
            <li> The good - you get 2 combs with your purchase.  The not so good - the tines just aren&#x27;t fine enough.  This mini-comb feels too much like a full size comb, loose, instead of snug around the whiskers.  Maybe good for others, depending on what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> I bought this comb as a replacement for the cheap one that came with an electric beard trimmer. I love it! It&#x27;s just the right size  and works great when I need to prepare my beard for a trim. Now I need to find a good pair of scissors to accompany my favorite comb.</li>
            <li> As some of the other posters have stated, this isn&#x27;t really a mustache comb. The tines are spaced too far apart to get good coming action. Other than that, it works well though. I just wish they weren&#x27;t so easy to lose.</li>
            <li> For anyone wondering about the size of these combs (they sold as a two pack): Mine are 4.5 inches long and about 1/2 inch from the spine to the tips of the teeth. As mentioned in the title the tooth width is about 1mm, spaced about 1mm apart. I find them fine enough to get the old &#x27;stache looking presentable, but not so fine as to tug uncomfortably. It&#x27;s pretty subjective, but at least you have the actual measurements and can make your own judgment. The combs are of a smooth plastic that is flexible enough to withstand back pocket carry, but firm enough for their intended use. I think they are a great value for seven dollars or so, and I would reorder in a heartbeat if I somehow managed to lose or destroy them.</li>
            <li> This comb is 4.5 inches long not 7.5 inches as listed. Very disappointed. Since comb is so small it is hard to hold and use. Also it was a two pack and one of the combs had been used already. It was very worn and had glitter makeup on it.</li>
            <li> Ordered it thinking it was a pack of 2, which it clearly states, but only received one.  $7 for one tiny comb?  What a rip off!</li>
            <li> I started growing out my mustache in November 2011. Right now I&#x27;ve got a stylish curl, but you really need something to help spread the wax and keep it neet. That&#x27;s where this comb comes in.  It&#x27;s small, with very smooth polished teeth. It won&#x27;t pull or drag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep one with me at all times. It works fantastic for knocking out the crumbs that inevitably find there way into your mo&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Love the comb but did not have two in the package as it said.  When I ordered it, It said it was a two pack.  There was only one in the pack.</li>
            <li> found this to be a great comb, robust enough haven&#x27;t had any breakages after 3 months of using. its fine enough to be able to brush and trim beard accurately.</li>
            <li> This is perfect to take around with you in your pocket and keep your facial hair tamed while out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine teeth, and gentle on the face.  Doesn&#x27;t pull, and it is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Smells weird for about a week.</li>
            <li> I find the product description for these combs to be somewhat misleading. It talks about \\&quot;scalp\\&quot; smoothness, which has little to do with a beard or mustache. Actually, nothing to do with them.  Maybe Swissco is confused about their target demographic or the design of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the good. For a pittance, you receive two hand made combs for your beard and mustache. They are basic, but timeless and classy. Each is the same size, approximately 4.5 inches long, .6 inches deep (half of which is the comb, the other half the handle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb is in fact smooth on the hair and skin. I feel that although there is not a \\&quot;handle\\&quot; to grab and manipulate, I am able to maneuver it well from one end while using the other. This is by far my favorite beard and mustache comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I keep one at the bathroom vanity and another in my travel kit. This way, I never have to worry about swapping one comb all around. Maybe this does not have the flourishes of other models, but from a pragmatic point of view it&#x27;s a great buy. There is also a cool factor, but there are other \\&quot;cooler\\&quot; combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great gift idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Size/Length&lt;br /&gt;-2 for the price of one&lt;br /&gt;-Quality&lt;br /&gt;-Smooth glide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eh:&lt;br /&gt;-Modest cool factor&lt;br /&gt;-Manufacturer is confused about the anatomy of beards and mustaches&lt;br /&gt;-Amazon Add On program!</li>
            <li> I really like the comb but only one came in my package not two like is indicated.  So if you REALLY need two, you might go somewhere else.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality comb. Works great without pulling or snagging and a nice size too, not too small like some others I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;Gave one to a furry faced friend and he also was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> The comb is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little smaller than I expected, but still great. VERY sturdy, doesn&#x27;t get caught in my beard. Just amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a comb with short teeth, exactly what you&#x27;d expect. It&#x27;s not tortoise, it&#x27;s plastic. The company made a slight attempt to imitate tortoise, but only a slight attempt. I didn&#x27;t buy the comb to look at. The comb works well for my mustache, but it is very good for my beard too.I keep my beard trimmed to less than an inch. If the beard was longer  Swissco comb teeth might not be adequate. The comb is narrow and thin, so it fits well in a breast pocket. It&#x27;s not brittle, but I still avoid putting it in my pants pocket. I worry it might break in the rather more robust environment there.</li>
            <li> essential for the mustache.</li>
            <li> I keep loosing them,great grooming!</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers that depending on your preference, you are likely to find the tines spaced too far apart.  However, I found the comb &amp;#34;good enough&amp;#34; as something I can easily carry around for a quick comb.  The flip side, they are easy to lose.</li>
            <li> The hair on the right side of my face has a mind of its own. It curls horizontally like it is nobody&#x27;s business. I bought the comb with hopes that I could straighten out this mess. Gladly, it works very well. I use it after I get out of the shower before my beard dries. I keep the second one in the drawer for the eventuality of when I lose the first.</li>
