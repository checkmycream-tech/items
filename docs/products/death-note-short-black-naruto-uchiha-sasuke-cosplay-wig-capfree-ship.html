            <li>/&gt;Other than that, i love this wig!  </li>
            <li>This wig is so amazing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing deal, once you see the wig you&#x27;re gonna think that it should&#x27;ve costed $40 or $50</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s an amazing deal.</li>
            <li>It looks great from all angles and has a nice snug fit, so that I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have to be concerned of it</li>
            <li>It comes with a nice wig cap too.</li>
            <li>It is really nice.</li>
            <li>its really good and comfortable</li>
            <li>but I loved this way this fit.</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable and it it doesn&#x27;t itch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and very good quality.</li>
            <li>This is such a great wig!</li>
            <li>It needs to be washed, for sure, and styled.</li>
            <li>, the wig is ok, the wig</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and there was more hair in my face than on my head..</li>
            <li>Great wig, just very curly.</li>
            <li>I saw this and thought it looked awesome and payed like 30 $ extra to ship it in time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorite wigs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>its looks fantastic!</li>
            <li>The back was styled perfectly.</li>
            <li>The wig is beautiful.. VERY soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently purchased this product and I thought it was amazing!!</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and light, which is good when you plan on doing a full day cosplay</li>
            <li>Overall very good quaiity, it needs to be styled but</li>
            <li>I loved how it look and it looked real</li>
            <li>I was able to cut it to my desired length and style it for what I needed, and the wig is very soft, so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good wig, but it doesn&#x27;t look like what it does in the picture.</li>
            <li>Styled and all,but sheds really easily.</li>
            <li>It even styles easily but the bangs may need trimming depending on the character.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He is a huge cosplayer.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>and I happily reccomend it to everyone here that is thinking of purchasing but worried that it may actually look like a wig...</li>
            <li>I cut the bangs and it&#x27;s great for Karkat and any short haired character.</li>
            <li>For everyone else, though, don&#x27;t let the pic and cheap price fool you.</li>
            <li>This is a good quality cosplay wig, and it arrived early.</li>
            <li>at first i was concerned about whether or not it would get here on timefor my con, so i emailed the company and got a response within the hour!!</li>
            <li>So excited</li>
            <li>What arrived is significantly shorter...</li>
            <li>Perfect, is a little long and makes my head seems really big but is good, is a good wig.</li>
            <li>It was soft and still had a nice style to it, but I thought it would be a bit shorter.</li>
            <li>overall a good product for the money.</li>
            <li>(John, Jane, Jake etc) I recommend it full on</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good quality, but try to store it carefully because it&#x27;s easy to damage.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what she wanted and was easy to use and wear.</li>
            <li>It quickly lost it&#x27;s style and started flowing in whatever direction</li>
            <li>The wig is very soft, and adorable.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a pretty great product.</li>
            <li>The wig itself is fine, but it is much shorter then in the picture.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not like those cheap wigs you order online, it looks real when you put it on as well.</li>
            <li>I remember it going nearly to the shoulders, looking more like a wig for Mikasa Ackerman.</li>
            <li>Do not expect to be able to see anything, as the front, or &amp;#34;bangs&amp;#34; have no part and are longer than the rest of the wig by far..</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, it is actually a good quality wig and actually looks like hair.  </li>
            <li>It was worth it</li>
            <li>definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>The hair in the back could be a little longer but it still looks very nice, and it fits nicely.  </li>
            <li>The wig came very fast.</li>
            <li>The wig was originally meant for my brother and i to share, but it didn&#x27;t fit him since his head is larger than mine</li>
            <li>The product is exactly like what is pictured.</li>
            <li>First is visibility.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a lot of my Comic Con outfits I will be wearing it again this year .</li>
            <li>dosent look exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having difficulties putting it on, but that&#x27;s probably because this is the first wig I&#x27;ve ever purchased</li>
            <li>This was his first wig, and he loves it.</li>
            <li>reason why I rated 4 stars instead of five stars, is that on the top of the wig, you can see the strands in the middle.  </li>
            <li>it looke exactly like L&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>She likes cosplaying with her friends and is looking forward to getting more later on.</li>
            <li>When I first got the wig I was excited and surprised.</li>
            <li>IT looks pretty similar to the picture but not exactly, but im happy with it.  </li>
            <li>thats ok wont be take too long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a very soft and silky wig, which makes it so fun to wear.</li>
            <li>It fits very well and the size is adjustable.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know who they&#x27;re trying to fool, but the wig they sent me looks NOTHING like that picture and is very unflattering.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t take much time to fix it to the way I wanted it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really upset with it because TaoBao has sent me about 5 or 6 wigs since october</li>
            <li>it looked real though, l&#x27;ll give it that.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Also, the wig is very puffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks like real hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the cut to it</li>
            <li>There are plenty of other online wig shops with better quality wigs.</li>
            <li>and i easily fit all of my long poofy hair into it.</li>
            <li>The wig is great and looks like in the images showed up early and is soft, but it is pretty thin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product and seller to everyone.</li>
            <li>I never felt a wig that soft before!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and realistic.</li>
            <li>The netting is incredibly small, and I have a smaller/average sized head.&lt;br /&gt;Overall; don&#x27;t buy this wig when you could find a much better quality one for a few more bucks.</li>
            <li>That is of course differs of where you live.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s So soft and realistic.</li>
            <li>but I live very far away from China</li>
            <li>You can also use it for more than one cosplay since I usually cosplay as L and Sasuke</li>
            <li>for the first wig and a 20 day wait, its ok, the wig is ok for hair, its not really styled, its only fluffed in the back and the wig cap, they gave me a stoking, this is some what of a bad wig experience, never had a wig before and its ok, now im buying another wig cap from somewhere else having to wait another 20 days, yay -__-&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wig fits fine, the cap is a little too snug though.</li>
            <li>It took me a bit of playing around with in order to see well - the bangs were longer than expected, but overall it&#x27;s an easy fix.</li>
            <li>The wig seems childishly small and barely covered the top of my head.</li>
            <li>The Wig was nice, it came in a small bag whcich made me scared it would loose its bounce</li>
            <li>The wig quality when I recieved it was fantastic and very soft, and with a bit of finger teasing became very fluffy.</li>
            <li>Major props amazon!</li>
            <li>The wig was to small to fit on my head, and it didn&#x27;t look like the picture at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so edgy and easy to put on.  </li>
            <li>recommend this wig to people with either a small head or short hair, as it&#x27;d fit your head a l</li>
            <li>There was no fluff, and if anything would look like a pixie cut.</li>
            <li>Okay; not great.</li>
            <li>so it looked kind of weird.</li>
            <li>The star says everything; I hate it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s incredibly shiny, like a party store&#x27;s wig.</li>
            <li>I recommend this wig to those who like a quick little project (took me only an hour to cut and spike it).</li>
            <li>Its so fluffy and feels so real and soooo soft!</li>
            <li>Though I previously ordered two other wigs from this seller and they were both fantastic, I&#x27;ll let it slide this time and just let it go as a mistake.</li>
            <li>and it could bass as real hair</li>
            <li>I did NOT waste my money at the least bit, and they sent me a wig cap, thanks for that.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m having difficulties putting it on, but that&#x27;s probably because this is the first wig I&#x27;ve ever purchased</li>
            <li> This was his first wig, and he loves it.</li>
            <li> reason why I rated 4 stars instead of five stars, is that on the top of the wig, you can see the strands in the middle.  </li>
            <li> it looke exactly like L&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> She likes cosplaying with her friends and is looking forward to getting more later on.</li>
            <li> When I first got the wig I was excited and surprised.</li>
            <li> IT looks pretty similar to the picture but not exactly, but im happy with it.  </li>
            <li> thats ok wont be take too long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a very soft and silky wig, which makes it so fun to wear.</li>
            <li> It fits very well and the size is adjustable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who they&#x27;re trying to fool, but the wig they sent me looks NOTHING like that picture and is very unflattering.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t take much time to fix it to the way I wanted it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really upset with it because TaoBao has sent me about 5 or 6 wigs since october</li>
            <li> it looked real though, l&#x27;ll give it that.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> Also, the wig is very puffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks like real hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the cut to it</li>
            <li> There are plenty of other online wig shops with better quality wigs.</li>
            <li> and i easily fit all of my long poofy hair into it.</li>
            <li> The wig is great and looks like in the images showed up early and is soft, but it is pretty thin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product and seller to everyone.</li>
            <li> I never felt a wig that soft before!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and realistic.</li>
            <li> The netting is incredibly small, and I have a smaller/average sized head.&lt;br /&gt;Overall; don&#x27;t buy this wig when you could find a much better quality one for a few more bucks.</li>
            <li> That is of course differs of where you live.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s So soft and realistic.</li>
            <li> but I live very far away from China</li>
            <li> You can also use it for more than one cosplay since I usually cosplay as L and Sasuke</li>
            <li> for the first wig and a 20 day wait, its ok, the wig is ok for hair, its not really styled, its only fluffed in the back and the wig cap, they gave me a stoking, this is some what of a bad wig experience, never had a wig before and its ok, now im buying another wig cap from somewhere else having to wait another 20 days, yay -__-&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wig fits fine, the cap is a little too snug though.</li>
            <li> It took me a bit of playing around with in order to see well - the bangs were longer than expected, but overall it&#x27;s an easy fix.</li>
            <li> The wig seems childishly small and barely covered the top of my head.</li>
            <li> The Wig was nice, it came in a small bag whcich made me scared it would loose its bounce</li>
            <li> The wig quality when I recieved it was fantastic and very soft, and with a bit of finger teasing became very fluffy.</li>
            <li> Major props amazon!</li>
            <li> The wig was to small to fit on my head, and it didn&#x27;t look like the picture at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so edgy and easy to put on.  </li>
            <li> recommend this wig to people with either a small head or short hair, as it&#x27;d fit your head a l</li>
            <li> There was no fluff, and if anything would look like a pixie cut.</li>
            <li> Okay; not great.</li>
            <li> so it looked kind of weird.</li>
            <li> The star says everything; I hate it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s incredibly shiny, like a party store&#x27;s wig.</li>
            <li> I recommend this wig to those who like a quick little project (took me only an hour to cut and spike it).</li>
            <li> Its so fluffy and feels so real and soooo soft!</li>
            <li> Though I previously ordered two other wigs from this seller and they were both fantastic, I&#x27;ll let it slide this time and just let it go as a mistake.</li>
            <li> and it could bass as real hair</li>
            <li> I did NOT waste my money at the least bit, and they sent me a wig cap, thanks for that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the wig is very small, and after further searching I discovered that the wig only had elastic on the sides where the adjuster clasps were, instead of the whole bottom half as most wigs usually have.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I am extremely please with this perfect Sollux wig, but still angry at the false advertising.</li>
            <li> I only find two small issues, that aren&#x27;t even really bothersome.</li>
            <li> Long story short</li>
            <li> As I was cutting it, it turned into more of a Sollux wig.</li>
            <li> Shipping was long</li>
            <li> I received this a long time ago</li>
            <li> This wig came as a long layerless wig.</li>
            <li> How do I straighten and style to give it that long, volumous, shabby hair L has?</li>
            <li> It spikes out on the bottom sides a little, but it&#x27;s not very fluffy nor spiky.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a short black wig to use in a larp/cosplay setting - and after searching forever, came across this.</li>
            <li> It only covered the front half.</li>
            <li> Compared to the other wig that I bought this one was too long.</li>
            <li> It was a little short</li>
            <li> The back have this fluffy spike to it, which just makes it</li>
            <li> It was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> However, it was shorter than expected</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected to get</li>
            <li> first, I thought that the wig was probably going to look fake</li>
            <li> the due date that it was supposed to arrive.</li>
            <li> Little long, but will work for my genderbent Homestuck cosplay as well as a few other characters.</li>
            <li> Other than the thin part it looks like my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I was going to get this as a gamzee cosplay wig, but im just going to have to use my other black wig.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s not worth returning, but still a bummer...</li>
            <li> I have a history with getting bad wigs, and I can say this for sure isn&#x27;t a bad wig if you style it up right.  </li>
            <li> but when i ordered it the bangs went down to my chin and they all curled inward.</li>
            <li> The hair wouldn&#x27;t stay down no matter what I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanting black hair but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m crying now because i don&#x27;t know what to do the con is in less than two weeks....</li>
            <li> It just needs a little care and styling is all.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed, since my original use for it was to be a Gamzee/Kurloz wig.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it for cosplay purposes, I just use it as an everyday wig when I feel like I want spunky hair.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s way too short, stiff and thin.</li>
            <li> Secondly, is where the two parts of the hair come together - the bangs and the rest - it just has a weird look to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, it is small, so I hope it fits the person I got it for.</li>
            <li> so if you do order remember it is small.</li>
            <li> It was way too small for her head.</li>
            <li> So amateur me decided to style it.</li>
            <li> It was just very fluffy like some punk rock wig.</li>
            <li> Perhaps with a little work I can still use it, but it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li> , I would recommend ordering it at least 4-5 weeks in advance if you are planning to do something with it.</li>
            <li> When I received the wig one side of it was all the way past my neck, which was very confusing.</li>
            <li> Its ridiculous.</li>
            <li> and they were all crap, and now I order this one paying tons of money to get it here just barely in time</li>
            <li> The bangs were down to the chin and desperately needed styling.</li>
            <li> falling off in game.</li>
            <li> looks real but horrible</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this so badly, but I&#x27;ve bought wigs before and they have been awful, so I was very weary of this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I swear they sent me the wrong wig, because the one I got looks like ti belongs on someone dressing as a Beatle.</li>
            <li> but ill get someone to style it if not.</li>
            <li> but I was looking at my purchases and was reminded of my disappointment, so I decided to write a review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad wig, though.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s bad too.</li>
            <li> Bad quality.</li>
            <li> and it was the wig they made it with bad products</li>
            <li> but when I wore it I got  sick</li>
            <li> it was crap.</li>
            <li> this wig is WAY TO SMALL!!!!!!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was looking for a short black wig to use in a larp/cosplay setting - and after searching forever, came across this. The product is exactly like what is pictured. It looks great from all angles and has a nice snug fit, so that I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have to be concerned of it falling off in game. I only find two small issues, that aren&#x27;t even really bothersome. First is visibility. It took me a bit of playing around with in order to see well - the bangs were longer than expected, but overall it&#x27;s an easy fix. Secondly, is where the two parts of the hair come together - the bangs and the rest - it just has a weird look to me. But either way - it&#x27;s an excellent wig, and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it. The wig cap is very good as well.</li>
            <li> I just got this wig today and it&#x27;s amazing! It&#x27;s very soft and realistic. The estimated delivery date was July 12-20, and I ordered it June 17. It came in 10 days. It&#x27;s already cut and layered perfectly and it looks just like the pictures It comes with a nice wig cap too. It fits very well and the size is adjustable. It is very comfortable and it it doesn&#x27;t itch. I highly recommend the product and seller to everyone.</li>
            <li> It is really nice. I have used it for a lot of my Comic Con outfits I will be wearing it again this year .</li>
            <li> I Orderd this Wig for the 2013 Otakon in Baltimore and Even though I was not expecting to get it until the end of July I got it with in a week of ording it... What great service expecially with it coming from China to Eastern USA.  The Wig was nice, it came in a small bag whcich made me scared it would loose its bounce but the hair is working prefect I cant wait to Wair it for My &amp;#34;L&amp;#34; Cosplay at the Convention, Will definately be Glompped</li>
            <li> The wig was to small to fit on my head, and it didn&#x27;t look like the picture at all. There was no fluff, and if anything would look like a pixie cut. If my hair was cut by a lawn mower. Though I previously ordered two other wigs from this seller and they were both fantastic, I&#x27;ll let it slide this time and just let it go as a mistake.</li>
            <li> When I received the wig one side of it was all the way past my neck, which was very confusing. I was able to cut it to my desired length and style it for what I needed, and the wig is very soft, so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good wig, but it doesn&#x27;t look like what it does in the picture.</li>
            <li> This is such a great wig! Im only going to use it once but after that im going to cut it into a Sollux Captor Wig and use it for that cosplay ^.\\ Its so fluffy and feels so real and soooo soft! the only flaw is that...i cant think of any &amp;#62;.\\</li>
            <li> I bought the wig for my L cosplay and I love it a lot! It needs to be washed, for sure, and styled. When I initially received the wig it looked nothing like the picture at all. It spikes out on the bottom sides a little, but it&#x27;s not very fluffy nor spiky. The bangs were down to the chin and desperately needed styling. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad wig, though. If anything this is one of my favorite wigs! It just needs a little care and styling is all. I have a history with getting bad wigs, and I can say this for sure isn&#x27;t a bad wig if you style it up right.  Overall I recommend this wig to those who like a quick little project (took me only an hour to cut and spike it). If you&#x27;re looking for something 100% pre-styled, I can say you might want to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> for the first wig and a 20 day wait, its ok, the wig is ok for hair, its not really styled, its only fluffed in the back and the wig cap, they gave me a stoking, this is some what of a bad wig experience, never had a wig before and its ok, now im buying another wig cap from somewhere else having to wait another 20 days, yay -__-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyway, the wig is ok, the wig cap--- just pre-buy from somewhere else</li>
            <li> So yeah, title says it. This looks nothing like the photo. It&#x27;s not even cut the same. I swear they sent me the wrong wig, because the one I got looks like ti belongs on someone dressing as a Beatle. I couldn&#x27;t even style it to work.</li>
            <li> Compared to the other wig that I bought this one was too long. It was soft and still had a nice style to it, but I thought it would be a bit shorter.</li>
            <li> When I first got the wig I was excited and surprised. I never felt a wig that soft before!! I couldn&#x27;t stop petting it lol. Overall very good quaiity, it needs to be styled but thats ok wont be take too long. :) Shipping was long but I live very far away from China so it makes sense, I would recommend ordering it at least 4-5 weeks in advance if you are planning to do something with it. That is of course differs of where you live. Anyways I love it! and I would totally recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> The wig fits fine, the cap is a little too snug though. I plan on using this for some Homestuck cosplays. So excited and it was so cheap too :D</li>
            <li> what i received was nothing like the pictures. it was incredibly short and not at all what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> I received this a long time ago but I was looking at my purchases and was reminded of my disappointment, so I decided to write a review. This wig came as a long layerless wig. I remember it going nearly to the shoulders, looking more like a wig for Mikasa Ackerman. I was extremely disappointed, since my original use for it was to be a Gamzee/Kurloz wig. I decided to deal with it and cut it. As I was cutting it, it turned into more of a Sollux wig. I had plans to cosplay Sullox anyways so I went ahead. Now I am extremely please with this perfect Sollux wig, but still angry at the false advertising.</li>
            <li> IT looks pretty similar to the picture but not exactly, but im happy with it.  The hair in the back could be a little longer but it still looks very nice, and it fits nicely.  I would recommend this wig for anyone who ants it.  I did NOT waste my money at the least bit, and they sent me a wig cap, thanks for that.</li>
            <li> I just got it in the mail today, it&#x27;s really great but I don&#x27;t know how to style it to look like L&#x27;s hair. How do I straighten and style to give it that long, volumous, shabby hair L has?</li>
            <li> The wig is beautiful.. VERY soft. But it is not quite as described and pictured... Do not expect to be able to see anything, as the front, or &amp;#34;bangs&amp;#34; have no part and are longer than the rest of the wig by far.. I didn&#x27;t think this was going to be a problem until I put it on and there was more hair in my face than on my head.. And it doesn&#x27;t hold when moved over to the side.. So for mannequins, it&#x27;s great! But for moving people? It needs trimmed before it can even be styled to look like the photo. (If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for) Over all, I&#x27;d rate it a C+. Okay; not great.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this so badly, but I&#x27;ve bought wigs before and they have been awful, so I was very weary of this purchase.  Much to my surprise, it is actually a good quality wig and actually looks like hair.  My daughter is very happy with it, and I&#x27;m happy I went ahead and bought it for her.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look anything like the picture. Inaccurate description. Doesn&#x27;t fit. It&#x27;s no way manageable styling wise. Doesn&#x27;t look like the picture.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who they&#x27;re trying to fool, but the wig they sent me looks NOTHING like that picture and is very unflattering.</li>
            <li> What arrived is significantly shorter... Close cropped like a conservative male cut, no wisps or ability to flip out the ends or back. For the price it&#x27;s not worth returning, but still a bummer...</li>
            <li> The wig is very soft, and adorable. The back have this fluffy spike to it, which just makes it so adorable.&lt;br /&gt;It came a week earlier than stated, which is good.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it is small, so I hope it fits the person I got it for.</li>
            <li> This wig is great for sasuke uchiha cosplay the bangs though are not cut and are the same length so I cut mine and I got compliments on it</li>
            <li> Styled and all,but sheds really easily. Its ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Great wig, just very curly. The bangs definitely have to be styled depending on the look you&#x27;re going for!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently purchased this product and I thought it was amazing!! It was a little short but it didn&#x27;t take much time to fix it to the way I wanted it.</li>
            <li> Photo misleading looks nothing like it</li>
            <li> I have been ordering wigs since october..... several different ones. They didn&#x27;t come in time. I saw this and thought it looked awesome and payed like 30 $ extra to ship it in time and it just came and I&#x27;m really upset with it because TaoBao has sent me about 5 or 6 wigs since october and they were all crap, and now I order this one paying tons of money to get it here just barely in time and it&#x27;s bad too. I&#x27;m crying now because i don&#x27;t know what to do the con is in less than two weeks....</li>
            <li> I was going to get this as a gamzee cosplay wig, but im just going to have to use my other black wig. this wig is WAY TO SMALL!!!!!! it also has a chemical smell to it. it was also really short, I was expecting to style it myself, but it had nothing to style. it looked real though, l&#x27;ll give it that. but all in all. it was crap.</li>
            <li> The wig is perfect and the cap fits just fine. I found some difficulties in styling it, but nothing that I couldn&#x27;t fix with a bit of work. It&#x27;s good quality, but try to store it carefully because it&#x27;s easy to damage. Might shed just a bit. Other than that, it&#x27;s a pretty great product. I&#x27;m quite happy with it!</li>
            <li> dosent look exactly like the picture it is actually shorter hair</li>
            <li> The wig is great and looks like in the images showed up early and is soft, but it is pretty thin. Other than the thin part it looks like my natural hair. The wig was originally meant for my brother and i to share, but it didn&#x27;t fit him since his head is larger than mine so if you do order remember it is small.</li>
            <li> Bad quality. Wig falls apart when just holding it.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t stay on your head.</li>
            <li> The wig itself is fine, but it is much shorter then in the picture. It could not be properly used for Death Note.</li>
            <li> this wig is great! im using it for my kanaya from homestuck cosplay. its a totes quality wig and it came with a wig cap too. at first i was concerned about whether or not it would get here on timefor my con, so i emailed the company and got a response within the hour!! the wig came in the next day. its really good and comfortable and i easily fit all of my long poofy hair into it.</li>
            <li> Perfect, is a little long and makes my head seems really big but is good, is a good wig. l</li>
            <li> The wig came very fast. I&#x27;m having difficulties putting it on, but that&#x27;s probably because this is the first wig I&#x27;ve ever purchased haha</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband! He is a huge cosplayer. This was his first wig, and he loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this wig!  It&#x27;s so edgy and easy to put on.  I don&#x27;t use it for cosplay purposes, I just use it as an everyday wig when I feel like I want spunky hair.  It&#x27;s one of my favorite wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I rated 4 stars instead of five stars, is that on the top of the wig, you can see the strands in the middle.  So if you are looking at that, then you can tell it&#x27;s a wig.  Also, the wig is very puffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, i love this wig!  I can counter the puffiness with a headband or something.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig to dress up as my fursona with some wolf ears and my wolf tail. its looks fantastic! wonderful quality! I am so impressed with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing wig, it&#x27;s cut perfectly and looks awesome. It looks like real hair. It&#x27;s very soft and very good quality. The price was very good too. It was worth it and I would recommend that any L cosplayers buy this wig.</li>
            <li> met expectations. low price. fair shipping rates. overall a good product for the money. I recommend it if you have time to wait for the shipping</li>
            <li> This wig is so amazing and it feels really awesome, it&#x27;s not like those cheap wigs you order online, it looks real when you put it on as well. It&#x27;s an amazing deal, once you see the wig you&#x27;re gonna think that it should&#x27;ve costed $40 or $50 so it&#x27;s an amazing deal. You can also use it for more than one cosplay since I usually cosplay as L and Sasuke it works well for me and I saved a lot of money. Major props amazon! Thank you !</li>
            <li> I loved how it look and it looked real but when I wore it I got  sick and it was the wig they made it with bad products looks real but horrible</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend for her cosplay. We tried it on as soon as it arrived. It was way too small for her head. It only covered the front half. It was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanting black hair but the sheer thought of it has always upset my family... so... instead of dying my hair against their wishes I went ahead and bought a wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I thought that the wig was probably going to look fake but when I actually got the product I was blown away! It doesnt even look like a wig! I am SO happy with this product and I happily reccomend it to everyone here that is thinking of purchasing but worried that it may actually look like a wig... It doesnt. It looks great!</li>
            <li> Little long, but will work for my genderbent Homestuck cosplay as well as a few other characters. It&#x27;s also a very soft and silky wig, which makes it so fun to wear.</li>
            <li> The wig quality when I recieved it was fantastic and very soft, and with a bit of finger teasing became very fluffy. It even styles easily but the bangs may need trimming depending on the character.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the wig is very small, and after further searching I discovered that the wig only had elastic on the sides where the adjuster clasps were, instead of the whole bottom half as most wigs usually have.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this wig to people with either a small head or short hair, as it&#x27;d fit your head a l</li>
            <li> Ordered for my daughter to cosplay at Triad Anime Con.  Was exactly what she wanted and was easy to use and wear.</li>
            <li> I bought this and it came earlier then the due date that it was supposed to arrive. I really like the cut to it and it goes perfect for any Homestuck cosplay. I cut the bangs and it&#x27;s great for Karkat and any short haired character. (John, Jane, Jake etc) I recommend it full on but if you&#x27;re looking for a puffy wig then this one needs work. It&#x27;s still a great wig though. I recommend.</li>
            <li> The wig itself is beautiful. It doesn&#x27;t look shiny at all and it could bass as real hair but when i ordered it the bangs went down to my chin and they all curled inward. So amateur me decided to style it. Long story short i messed up the styling (I didn&#x27;t know what I was thinking I&#x27;m not a hair stylist and I had absolutely no prior experience) I am going to buy another one, maybe the bangs will be cut this time? but ill get someone to style it if not. The back was styled perfectly. The reason it gets only three stars is because I am paying for what the image represents. It looked like they started styling the back and just stooped with the bangs. Um what?</li>
            <li> My Granddaughter is into these books and movies and goes to the conventions. She needed this wig for her costume. She tells me it&#x27;s perfect. I&#x27;m rating this per her instructions.  She&#x27;s already ordered another wig for a different character.</li>
            <li> The wig seems childishly small and barely covered the top of my head. Then when I tried to brush it for styling, a ton of fibers started falling out. It quickly lost it&#x27;s style and started flowing in whatever direction it wanted to. If you have a smaller head, it might work for you. For everyone else, though, don&#x27;t let the pic and cheap price fool you. There are plenty of other online wig shops with better quality wigs.</li>
            <li> Fits good but did need some styling. :33</li>
            <li> This is a good quality cosplay wig, and it arrived early. However, it was shorter than expected so it looked kind of weird. Perhaps with a little work I can still use it, but it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li> the wig is awesome. it looke exactly like L&#x27;s hair. it&#x27;s So soft and realistic. definitely worth the price. it&#x27;s the best one</li>
            <li> My granddaughter has been wearing it on and off since we received it.  She likes cosplaying with her friends and is looking forward to getting more later on.</li>
            <li> It was just very fluffy like some punk rock wig. The hair wouldn&#x27;t stay down no matter what I did. It just stuck up.</li>
            <li> The star says everything; I hate it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s incredibly shiny, like a party store&#x27;s wig. And it&#x27;s way too short, stiff and thin. The netting is incredibly small, and I have a smaller/average sized head.&lt;br /&gt;Overall; don&#x27;t buy this wig when you could find a much better quality one for a few more bucks.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected to get but I loved this way this fit. It is comfortable and light, which is good when you plan on doing a full day cosplay</li>
