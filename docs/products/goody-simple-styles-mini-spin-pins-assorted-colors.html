            <li>*  Work perfectly as described&lt;</li>
            <li>I find it&#x27;s best to place them in the area between the bun and your head, not in the bun itself.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to have them!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really awesome!</li>
            <li>Still, the undo looks great!</li>

            <li>I am very good at doing hairstyles.  </li>
            <li>And it looks gorgeous!</li>

            <li>Surprisingly, it holds perfectly.</li>
            <li>It creates a beautiful neat bun</li>
            <li>I am very pleased!</li>
            <li>Thank you Goody, for returning a GREAT product to the market and thank you Amazon for linking me to the wonderful store that sent them to me - Your Wholesale Retailer in Florida, who gave me FANTASTIC customer service!!</li>
            <li>That being said, these pins are great.</li>
            <li>Great idea.</li>
            <li>and they work GREAT.  </li>
            <li>I think they are great.  </li>
            <li>I am going to try and color them in some way to mach my hair, otherwise these are a great product and</li>
            <li>So - great, durable product, but</li>
            <li>My hairstylist suggested the spin pins and I cannot believe how great these things work.</li>
            <li>Great to use on any thickness hair and for any occasion.</li>
            <li>These work GREAT.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to discover the pins were made out of metal.</li>
            <li>Great buy and</li>
            <li>Anyway, these are GREAT.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am that I tried this product.  </li>
            <li>Great design.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>I use these almost every day for work and it keeps my hair up for hours while also making a great looking bun.</li>
            <li>It looks great every time.</li>
            <li>Works just great, holds a bun all day.</li>
            <li>It looks very tidy without the need for excess bobby pins.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the best way to get a very secure bun is to place the two spin pins perpendicular to one another.  </li>
            <li>The spin pin is amazing!  </li>
            <li>That being said, the spin pins are amazing!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply amazing!  </li>
            <li>Spin Pins are amazing!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving these pins!</li>
            <li>This spin pin is the most awesome invention!</li>
            <li>The best I&#x27;ve ever been able to do is a ponytail.</li>
            <li>I am very happy, and I am buying more for christmas stocking stuffing.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure once my hair gets about 6 inches longer they&#x27;ll be perfect, but for now I think I&#x27;m going to try to get a pack of the mini&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Update, I did use all 4 pins in my hair successfully.  </li>
            <li>TURN INTO MY HAIR EASILY WITH NO PROBLEM AND STAY ALL DAY - GREAT INVENTION!!!</li>
            <li>Very easy to take out as well,no pulling at all!</li>
            <li>I suspect, however, that a good application of hairspray might fix the problem.  </li>
            <li>They are lightweight and look fairly durable.</li>
            <li>Good invention for hair.</li>
            <li>The good news is that if you use them correctly you can&#x27;t see the color anyway</li>
            <li>Good quality metal, ends are protected so they don&#x27;t snag hair</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all good.  </li>
            <li>I twist my hair up and around toward the top, insert my spin pins, and the gorgeous curls at the ends of my hair just hang out gloriously over the resulting bun!  </li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these!!!</li>
            <li>I love it and don&#x27;t want to cut it off because it looks great when I have time to style it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable to wear too!</li>
            <li>It looks very nice and elegant.  </li>
            <li>The spin pin made a nice bun easily AND it looked really good!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with these!</li>
            <li>Just bought this today and love it!  </li>
            <li>I just picked up one of these at the drugstore on a whim and I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>I tried these pins on a whim, and SO glad I did!  </li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments, people ask me what I&#x27;m doing after work to have styled my hair!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why but before buying these I had never been able to successfully put my hair up in a bun.</li>
            <li>I will continue to experiment since I already made the purchase but am definately glad I shopped around and got the cheapest price around!</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>They are simply ingenious!</li>
            <li>Gotta love this stuff!</li>
            <li>well, if i may chime in here, i LOVE these pins!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to say sayonara to bobby pin buns!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this invention!</li>
            <li>I might have to buy more just in case I lose one!</li>
            <li>and once I had my hair up in a bun (possibly the best looking one I have ever been able to produce) it stayed put perfectly until I decided to take it out.</li>
            <li>being said, this is the most efficient and cost effective hairstyling tool on the market!</li>
            <li>Still, I was impressed that I didn&#x27;t even need to put my hair in a ponytail first, and there were no flyaways at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>
            <li>I plan to use these again for sure!</li>
            <li>I just put my hair up three times in a row with these pins, and each time it looked good, and it felt VERY secure.</li>
            <li>these pins are AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>They handle the weight amazingly</li>
            <li>They go in real smooth and didn&#x27;t pinch or hurt at all.</li>
            <li>This is an  amazing product.</li>
            <li>They keep hair up without pulling or breaking, amazingly well.</li>
            <li>I am so thrilled that I found these.</li>
            <li>just thrilled with these hair pins.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product Goody!</li>
            <li>I kind of like these, can you tell???  </li>
            <li>and my hair is nice and wavy.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to have found such a great tool!  </li>
            <li>This product is nice to use to make beachy waves.</li>
            <li>no flyaways or stray hairs,,,I looked very nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I also like that they&#x27;re not outrageously priced (although Amazon, surprisingly, charges more than Walgreens).  </li>
            <li>Great price, came quickly.  </li>
            <li>The pins are very easy to put in and take out</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy for me to give</li>
            <li>I am thrilled to have some spin pins - they&#x27;re fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did because this pins are AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>I love these pins and am using them to do my own hair for the USMC Birthday Ball this year.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the kind of bun maker that&#x27;s a plastic loop that you hook at the bottom, and I like this one better.</li>
            <li>but it is very fine and slippery.</li>
            <li>And, while I have a LOT of hair, the strands are very fine, so my hair doesn&#x27;t hold bobby pins, barrettes, hair bands, head bands, etc.</li>
            <li>So easy to wrap hair into a bun and then twist these two pieces in!  </li>
            <li>I have very fine slippery hair that is shoulder blade length.</li>
            <li>These pins can hang on to all that hair and they don&#x27;t let go, and it&#x27;s so easy!</li>
            <li>So happy to have found this before the hot summer weather.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the modern updo Goody product, and purchased these after being thrilled with that expecting these to be just as great.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews and watched some videos relating to this on you tube, it looked too good to be true...</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to use, hold my hair all day, and make it easy for me to create a good looking bun.</li>
            <li>It feels very secure</li>
            <li>It was very comfortable while it lasted.</li>
            <li>but 2 makes it very secure.</li>
            <li>The pins are very smooth with ball shaped tips.</li>
            <li>I have waist length hair and these hold it up with no problem, and are very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I can get all my hair up and off my neck and not worry about it ALL day.  </li>
            <li>Then I put the spin pins in at the top and the bottom.</li>
            <li>These spin pins, though, are like magic.</li>
            <li>I LOVE that.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying some more today, because I can&#x27;t do without them anymore.    </li>
            <li>I love being able to get out of bed</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>, I would give it more stars if I could.</li>
            <li>I have NEVER been able to put it up myself in anything but a pony tail.  </li>
            <li>I always love the idea of chignon&#x27;s or fancy buns</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m truly in love.</li>
            <li>You should place one at the top of the bun and a spin pin at the bottom.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels secure, no slippage!</li>
            <li>Much better than using a hundred bobby pins and more sophisticated than just using a rubber band.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if you use your imagination you can create many styles with them.</li>
            <li>The spin pin is nothing short of AWESOME.  </li>
            <li>Stylish to wear.  </li>
            <li>My daughter gave me a set of Spin Pins and told me I was going to love them.</li>
            <li>I will keep and attempt to continue using the four I have, just won&#x27;t be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>I LOVE ALL TYPES OF HAIR PRODUCTS AND ITEMS</li>
            <li>&quot; most people I&#x27;ve shared this item with</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with these pins from Goody.  </li>
            <li>One tip that wasn&#x27;t in the instructions is to make sure you push them against your head a bit as you screw them into the bun.  </li>
            <li>I can do a bun on the top of my head and sleep in it.</li>
            <li>my hair is up and out of my face ever since and never a nasty hair elastic dent in sight!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so inept at being able to style my hair.</li>
            <li>These pins are absolutely fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I love these spin pins.</li>
            <li>It tends to slip out of most hair clips, headbands, etc.  </li>
            <li>I imagine one might need more than two of the shorter pins or purchase the longer size.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She loves to pull my hair, even when in a pony tail, so a bun on top of my head</li>
            <li>totally secure!</li>
            <li>They are fantastic!</li>
            <li>These things are infinitely better than bobbi pins.</li>
            <li>but I think with 2 more would stay better</li>
            <li>Now that I know how to use it, I love it.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to recreate that style again with these pins.</li>
            <li>Love these pins.</li>
            <li>I have to say, I&#x27;ve never even been able to wear them out of the house.  </li>
            <li>I put it in a bun on top of my head about 4 hours ago</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to see that Amazon is now charging the price I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>I may buy some more from here.    </li>
            <li>I love this invention.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love these things.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought 3 more pair of them.  </li>
            <li>but I prefer the look I get from the magic grip hair pins.</li>
            <li>I wanted to wear one of the cute chignon styles I&#x27;ve been seeing on celebrities, but I had no idea how to make a bun.  </li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>Be creative.</li>
            <li>I can even do a French twist, awesome product, it&#x27;s $5.88 at Walmart.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more just to have.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>They do the job that would take many bobby pins to do.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these spin pins and am glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>So I wish I had gotten the minis, because these stick out a bit at the top and bottom of my bun.  </li>
            <li>overall great product!  </li>
            <li>Saw a video of these online and thought they were interesting.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I tried these.</li>
            <li>The part I love is that they are mostly invisible to others.</li>
            <li>These are sooo much better than any hair clip</li>
            <li>(my guess is that it will work much better) but what I needed most is a way to put my hair up, or \\&quot;hide\\</li>
            <li>I picked up these Spin Pins at a Walmart, and they are fantastic!</li>
            <li>-- then it holds all of it better.</li>
            <li>Love love LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t seem to work for women with more hair.  </li>
            <li>More pins might help the bun stay, but I haven&#x27;t experimented with it.    </li>
            <li>Since getting these pins, I&#x27;ve been enjoying putting my hair into a bun more than I had before.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I began with a set for myself that I absolutely love.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my hair styles when I&#x27;m using the spin pins.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I intend to buy many more so that I can have some on hand at all</li>
            <li>Just be sure you don&#x27;t interlock them when inserting, as they warn, because they do stay PUT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We love these pins - they help me and my son&#x27;s jooda stay intact</li>
            <li>and I struggled MANY MANY times to keep my hair up with these pins.  </li>
            <li>Two will hold your hair but more will make you feel more secure in your do!</li>
            <li>These spin pins are fantastic!</li>
            <li>I found a lot of these once at a dolar store stocked up can never have to many of these.</li>
            <li>Great product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like bobby pins and the results are better than they are with bobby pins.</li>
            <li>One trick is to make sure that you place them against your scalp when you twist them in.</li>
            <li>love love love these.</li>
            <li>But we have a wedding tomorrow and after seeing the good reviews I decided it was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li>I am an absolute klutz when it comes to hair, but these were super-easy to use and very effective.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put in, easy to take out, and pain-free!  </li>
            <li>and it is very easy to use, and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>These are easy to use and I love the concept, but they don&#x27;t hold my hair well, even when I use more than one, and seem overpriced to me.  </li>
            <li>It feels very secure, and the pins twist in and out easily without pulling out your hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that easy, and they hold better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before.</li>
            <li>Really useful and more effective than bobby pins.</li>
            <li>They are more comfortable than ties and hold better.</li>
            <li>They need a little bit of practice to see what looks best/works best on you, but it is very easy and flexible.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this exceptional product.</li>
            <li>They are the best money I ever spent on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I actually enjoy using these and being creative with them.</li>
            <li>$8.00 +FREE S/H TO HOME, which speaks better of the retailer than the product.</li>
            <li>Best $3.50 I&#x27;ve ever spent on my hair.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re becoming my go-to morning hair accessory.</li>
            <li>These are wonderful for putting long hair into a bun and keeping it secure.</li>
            <li>Much more comfortable than bobby pins.</li>
            <li>but honestly these spin pins are definitely worth the $6 you pay anywhere else.  </li>
            <li>the kind that bobby pins slip right out of, but these stay put.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how cool of a product this is!  </li>
            <li>These hair pins are easy to use.</li>
            <li>Since my hair breaks easily, I&#x27;ve been trying to stay away from putting my hair in elastics</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I get a headache easily from hair accessoories, and these have never bothered me.</li>
            <li>-I didn&#x27;t think it would be that easy</li>
            <li>The pins are easy to twist in &amp; out and they do hold your bun for quite a while.</li>
            <li>They spin in and spin out easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that easy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too easy.</li>
            <li>*  Easy to use on yourself without a mirror&lt;br</li>
            <li>They go in and out easy and there isn&#x27;t any learning curve.</li>
            <li>With these I can do them easily and they stay in all day, if fact</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are easy to insert, easy to remove, and hold a secure hairdo.</li>
            <li>I have relatively fine hair, shoulder length</li>
            <li>I have fairly fine shoulder length hair and this works like charm.</li>
            <li>The instructions were easy to follow, and it did secure my hair...</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that never stays where it belongs unless I use a claw that gives me a headache.  </li>
            <li>You can quickly put your hair in a bun with just these two pins!</li>
            <li>I waited a good, long time to write this review, to make sure I was really satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to use, twists in easy and twists out easy,</li>
            <li>I was dubious when I first saw them because my hair tangles in things very easily, but these don&#x27;t tangle in my hair.</li>
            <li>This little spin pins are awesome.  </li>
            <li>These really are amazing.</li>
            <li>This had such great reviews I had to try it.</li>
            <li>Once I got the hang of it, though, it was smooth sailing.</li>
            <li>They are FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li>You just turn the pin into your hair and they stay secure.</li>
            <li>This pin holds my bun in place securely.  </li>
            <li>Secure even if I whip my head from side to side.  </li>
            <li>but I did a great side swept bun last night for a formal event that everyone raved over!  </li>
            <li>I can even sleep comfortably with these in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The two pins were surprisingly comfortable.  </li>
            <li>and they hold my hair securely in place for hours at a time.  </li>
            <li>Also, they are comfortable to wear and do not pull at my hair like a pony tail</li>
            <li>But being that it was relatively cheap</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t believe its still holding - also they&#x27;re so comfortable -</li>
            <li>Buy a set and enjoy.  </li>
            <li>but sometimes I just want a smooth unadorned</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy that I finally found something that can handle my hair.</li>
            <li>Up until I got these pins, nothing would hold my hair securely in an up-do.</li>
            <li>I have a big head, lol, and hair that hits my shoulders.</li>
            <li>Indispensable items.</li>
            <li>Great for those with short hair -</li>
            <li>Stays secure for hours and with yard work and hats etc.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>However, unlike some fortunate women here, I have to adjust the pins now</li>
            <li>I could get a bun to stay with just one, but its really secure with two.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t feel completely secure like it&#x27;d stay that way for hours.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to do a bun with these.</li>
            <li>I thought I had finally figured out how to make it work for me, and I was super happy about it!&lt;br /&gt;Alas</li>
            <li>but my mom was quick to tell me that it says in bold not to do so, so I won&#x27;t be doing that again!</li>
            <li>I have found that using ponytail holders (to put your hair into a ponytail first) holds the style better.</li>
            <li>time, just like bobby pins, the original color is wearing in spots.  </li>
            <li>I put my bottom one in first, seems to hold better for me</li>
            <li>Where was that strength to keep its original shape!?!?!?&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>The side chignon I made for the first time ever looked so cute.</li>
            <li>Great and must have hair accessory for anybody with long hair.</li>
            <li>I was so excited about how well they worked that I called my mother to tell her to pick some up too.  </li>
            <li>This works great for even really long hair like mine.</li>
            <li>but It was so easy that I put my hair up while driving on my first try!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hip length, but very fine and slippery and absolutely straight.</li>
            <li>I am buying several pairs as stocking stuffers for people who I know would love them, but would never pick them up on their own.</li>
            <li>super quick and easy to use, and they don&#x27;t tug on your hair/scalp at all.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;m writing this review, I&#x27;m swinging my head back and forth and loving the feeling, because I am confident that these pins won&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li>Most of the quick and easy hair products are really meant for medium length hair.</li>
            <li>I can throw my hair up in a bun straight out of the shower, and I&#x27;m good for the whole day.</li>
            <li>My hair is about medium thickness and just above my waist and these spin pins are not only easy to put in but stay in perfectly.</li>
            <li>You need a relatively large mass of hair to be able to use these without them showing.</li>
            <li>This product fell right out of my fine shoulder length hair</li>
            <li>Even with just one pin it barely put my hair up but the 2nd pin it was perfect!</li>
            <li>I love these so much, I have 3 sets (just in case I misplace one).</li>
            <li>I really like these, and will probably purchase more of them.</li>
            <li>:) highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I have a FULL head of 3b curly hair and expected some setbacks but hoped otherwise thanks to a review about these products working best for curly hair instead of straight fine hair.</li>
            <li>2 work pretty well for hanging around the house and taking it easy.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s available at most stores near you, go get one, or two sets!</li>
            <li>They are just as quick and easy to use as hairsticks, and much quicker than a ponytail holder and bobby pins!  </li>
            <li>thanks, thanks to the Spin Pin\\&quot;!! :)   </li>
            <li>This is also a product for those of us with longer hair and can be as quick as putting hair in a pony tail.</li>
            <li>Would love to see them make some smaller ones for more versitile styles.</li>
            <li>The Spin Pins work best for my hair but 2 pins simply aren&#x27;t enough!</li>
            <li>I used to use these ALL the time when they were called HairScroos and could not BE more pleased to find them again, as I broke my last one almost a year ago now.  </li>
            <li>The Spin Pin is super helpful.  </li>
            <li>The paint wears off the pins fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>That advice is probably obvious to most, but maybe they are some hair-idiots like me out there. :-)</li>
            <li>but I guess I got lucky when it mattered.  </li>
            <li>They are VERY easy to use (there are clear directions) and they don&#x27;t tug on your hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend searching the internet for more ideas than what the box provides...</li>
            <li>I pull my hair into a ponytail and secure it with an elastic first.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly long hair, almost waist length, with a good bit of body.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t look very good with a simple bun because my ears stick out, and I live in a hot climate so a ponytail</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these to keep your hair secure in a comfortable bun.</li>
            <li>I lost my original pair, and I miss them very much.</li>
            <li>these really keep my hair up in a bun and easy to take off.</li>
            <li>I have long hair (reaching slightly above my waist)and this pin works beautifully!</li>
            <li>These little corkscrew pins are so great for quick up dos.</li>
            <li>first try!</li>
            <li>(Note: For the best bun, be sure to put the first pin in from the bottom and try to catch the ends of your hair that you twisted around in it.</li>
            <li>The first day I wore it, I got 3 compliments on my hairstyle!  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Goody!!</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length curly hair (somewhere between 2b and 3a) and the Spin Pin is great for creating quick messy buns.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine (not thin) and</li>
            <li>These work great with my fine yet thick hair.</li>
            <li>These two little spin pins are the most amazing things that have ever happened to hair since the hair iron.</li>
            <li>They keep my hair in place, the hair is secure, and it doesn&#x27;t pull on my scalp like the Modern Updo maker.</li>
            <li>so I tried the much cheaper ones available from overseas.</li>
            <li>Now for the exciting part...</li>
            <li>so I thought this might be worth a try.</li>
            <li>and all I can say is it was WELL WORTH</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Overall,they&#x27;re fun to play and experiment with,</li>
            <li>The only reason I discovered these is because my sister happened to try them out, and mentioned how much she loved them.  </li>
            <li>I plan to purchase several sets so they will be handy when I need them.</li>
            <li>If my hair is freshly shampooed I have to spray some product in it to give it some hold before putting these in.  </li>
            <li>These are so worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the way all that hair looks in a ponytail, and I&#x27;ve wanted to wear something more professional looking and sleek.  </li>
            <li>I think this product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about how it looks from the side (see my photos)</li>
            <li>the economical hair pin set five stars...</li>
            <li>They work fantastically and seem to be decently gentle on the hair- more gentle than using a rubberband.</li>
            <li>It is SO useful.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s well worth it because the spin pins hold my hair in place.</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li>and they won&#x27;t open even through a good night sleep and whole day of running around.  </li>
            <li>Works great in my granddaughter&#x27;s soft curly hair and my soft straight hair.  </li>
            <li>This should be make more clear at time of order, not after.....</li>
            <li>these will be worth it so that I have another option for hairstyles.  </li>
            <li>Super comfortable as well, I can sleep with them in without feeling them, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Still highly recommended for easy hair maintenance.</li>
            <li>I pretty much plan to buy a whole bunch more if I happen to see them at Target or the drugstore because for me they are a must have.</li>
            <li>Right now it&#x27;s shoulder length</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>Slides right out, no matter how adjusted.</li>
            <li>However I have noticed a lot of breakage from right hair ties.</li>
            <li>These are great little gizmos for creating buns!</li>
            <li>These little pins are amazing!</li>
            <li>These are actually pretty great, they hold extremely well and don&#x27;t pull or use too much tension.</li>
            <li>Anywho, these pins kept my hair in securely all day, normally if I put my hair in a ponytail</li>
            <li>These are pretty fun.</li>
            <li>I will also add that I have dark brunette hair and whenever the pins (brunette color) happen to stick out, they blend in fairly well with my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft and fine.</li>
            <li>One piece of advice: Put the first pin in right where the ENDS of your hair are tucked in the bun</li>
            <li>I bought these about a week ago after hearing good things about them, and so far, my experience has only been so-so.   </li>
            <li>I did take away one star because at times, I do have a heck of a time getting the bun to feel as secure as I&#x27;d like, and ultimately, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ever quite as secure as with elastics.  </li>
            <li>I have super straight hair that goes below my shoulders.</li>
            <li>Might work good for thin hair or hair that is not that healthy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still getting the hang of these, but they are very promising.  </li>
            <li>(so it&#x27;s very gentle on your hair).</li>
            <li>These kept my hair in place all day which is an absolute first!</li>
            <li>These little jewels are too good to do without.  </li>
            <li>I do have fine hair, and the one thing I&#x27;d say is that I found these work better for me when my hair is not freshly washed.</li>
            <li>I figured it was different than anything I&#x27;ve seen, and I&#x27;m so glad I bought them.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>Insert the first pin where your hair ends.</li>
            <li>I experimented with this, because I love the French Twist look.</li>
            <li>I bought it tody and did it on my first try.</li>
            <li>Expensive, but great!!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy mine from Amazon, I got them from Mal-mart, but I found them here first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy more of these in the same color because I can&#x27;t see them when they are in my hair, and I know I&#x27;ll lose them lol&lt;</li>
            <li>You simply twist them into your bun in a clockwise direction - one at the top and one at the bottom.</li>
            <li>One from the top (about 12:00 position), and one from a 5:00 position - especially when working out.     </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re sitting on gold here, go out and really spread the news!  </li>
            <li>and screw the first one in.   </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s funny</li>
            <li>I did like those ez combs pretty well, but even they hurt after a while.  </li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve been searching for an elegant way to gather my hair back that still shows the curls to de-emphasize my ears, but still keeps my hair off my neck.  </li>
            <li>As a mother of 2 young children, I don&#x27;t always have time to style my hair nor do I enjoy it in my face while trying to do things.</li>
            <li>Usually I have the best results when I do the exact opposite.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical when I saw first this in the magazine, name this the\\&quot; best product of the century\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>no ends of hair, no ugly hair clips, just a nice round bun.    </li>
            <li>I picked these up at the grocery store yesterday and tried them out today for the first time.</li>
            <li>Then I just separate the ball of hair that is left and spin in a spin pin, one on top and one on the bottom.  </li>
            <li>When I first got my spin pins I was timid with them.  </li>
            <li>I bought two sets of these just in case I needed more of the pins to hold my hair up, but I only needed to use two.</li>
            <li>Definitely work better for me on my off-shampoo days.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that my hair has EVER been in a bun.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>so I use a hairband first to create a ponytail (even though they say not to)</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says it will...</li>
            <li>The pictures are my first attempt at using them, on hair that has been washed and flat-ironed.</li>
            <li>I had lost mine and NOTHING would keep my slippery, straight hair in place!</li>
            <li>Absolutely!</li>
            <li>hair is a medium shade, so either the blonde or brunette work ok for me.</li>
            <li>I am a nurse so keeping my long locks up and secure is important while I&#x27;m at work.</li>
            <li>In conjunction with the \\&quot;Modern Updo\\&quot; pin made by Goody, these are amazing at holding all day long.</li>
            <li>My only advise, get more than two.</li>
            <li>Next time I will test these pins for my updo hair in the dance class. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering if the people who did not succeed with these neglected to put them through the bun and the adjacent scalp hair, which would allow the pins to slide out of place,or if perhaps they have super fine and sort of short hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty positive I won&#x27;t be one of those lucky people that go to the gym with them or jog with them, but for simple everyday wear, so far its perfect!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very excited to use them in the future.</li>
            <li>With the other kind, the loop would show more at the bottom, and occasionally it would come unclasped.</li>
            <li>This is a very neat idea, and I bet it does work well with the right type of hair.</li>
            <li>I have very long (about waist length), very fine, stick-straight hair and these spiral pins really work for me!</li>
            <li>Love using the spin pins, they are easy to use and gave me a few new quick styles to do.</li>
            <li>I am going to buy more for my daughters who have long hair and are constantly looking for cute ways to put it up.</li>
            <li>They do not make your bun completely bullet proof (for bullet proof, I put my hair in a ponytail, braid it, tie the ends with another elastic, then wrap the whole thing around in a bun and secure it with another elastic or two.</li>
            <li>and I love how easy it is for me to re-twist my hair several times a day when necessary.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to put it in a bun with any sort of clips or pins, because there is simply too much hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought these years before they became available from a major company.</li>
            <li>Plus I live in TX where it is very hot and humid a lot of the time.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, they really do hold the bun tightly--</li>
            <li>I literally was lucky in each case of finding them because they are sold out EVERYWHERE near me!</li>
            <li>It took me about 15 tries to get it right, but I&#x27;m glad I kept trying.</li>
            <li>have long, wavy hair that I wear up most of the time.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic tools for doing anything from a simple bun to a more ornamental french twist, any sort of updo.   </li>
            <li>If you have short hair, they might visibly be stuck out the other end of your bun, but they work great for me.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work for me, especially after reading someone saying that they weren&#x27;t good for thick hair.</li>
            <li>Even with tons of bobby pins, I was never able to get my hair into a bun that I thought looked good.</li>
            <li>I read many good reviews about these little spin pins, but to be honest, I was skeptical they would work.  </li>
            <li>With just two of them, it takes me less than a minute to get my hair into a perfect bun that stays tight all day.      </li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t hurt and I actually keep checking to see if my hair is secure because for the first time in my life I don&#x27;t have a headache.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m such a novice when it comes to hair and beauty but these made it so easy to look well-groomed.</li>
            <li>but these were so simple and easy.</li>
            <li>They both say put the same but goodys is stronger and doesn&#x27;t get bend up easily.</li>
            <li>They last forever and easy to use in your hair - longer hair to tie in up in a bun, but I would suggest several as you can misplace them easily -</li>
            <li>Three pins makes it strong enough to go running for an hour, with not a hair out of place.  </li>
            <li>Pure amazement...</li>
            <li>I will be picking up a few more packs when I can find them!</li>
            <li>I never could get straight pins or bobby pins to do a thing in my thick wavy hair, but these stay put pretty good.    </li>
            <li>I will continue to try new ways of using them occasionally to see if I can find something that will work every time because I did love the comfort of it the one time it did hold.</li>
            <li>I have very long thick hair and this puts my hair up in a perfect bun!</li>
            <li>Another great thing is- no clip or odd bun ponytail that rubs the back of your seat while driving, sitting or laying.</li>
            <li>And it is a nice tight bun, too.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to see a commercial with real people (on the streets) with all different hair types, lengths and styles trying out the spin pin for the first time.  </li>
            <li>These ingenious pins have happily facilitated my lazy approach to hair styling, and the result always looks complicated and thought-out considering the short amount of time creating gorgeous buns takes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m interested in trying out the other items in this line in hopes that I may have more hair styling luck.</li>
            <li>and they fit nicely when Im only using half of my hair</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re best for buns, messy or tight, and depending on the style I wear up to two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The trick is really to get them in at a certain angle; I prefer to put mine in diagonally.  </li>
            <li>spin pins are very gentle and hold my long fine hair very well.</li>
            <li>Again, AMAZING little hair accessory.  </li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I&#x27;m not particularly hair adept, but I found these relatively easy to use.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t stay in my fine hair and definitely aren&#x27;t capable of securing a bun, not to mention they take awhile to \\&quot;screw\\&quot; in.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even good at twisting my hair and getting it into that bun shape (esp find it hard to tuck the end pieces in wihtout them coming out)</li>
            <li>the bun was still there and reasonable in the morning.  </li>
            <li>and i even wear them to the gym and they stay very well.</li>
            <li>They are gentle and you can experiment with how you want to put the bun / chignon on your hair.</li>
            <li>but with this ting the weight is really well dispersed, I didn&#x27;t have a headache at all.</li>
            <li>and I use both on a daily basis to give me the secure hold I need.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li>Straight bobby pins cost about 5 cents each - these cost 5 DOLLARS?</li>
            <li>As my hair got longer, I found that 3 or 4 spin pins really held it all day.  </li>
            <li>After trying the Goody \\&quot;Modern Updo Maker\\&quot; which I bought without discussing with my hairstylist, I was about ready to give up on Goody products.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very pricey from Goody</li>
            <li>These spin pins did not work when my hair was straight, my hair just slipped out in all sorts of places.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They really hold hair in place very well, without spinning or falling out throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not for short-haired people.</li>
            <li>Yes yes highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I use them in updos in place of bobby pins and it is so much faster</li>
            <li>I slept with them in my hair, was very comforatable and my hair stayed in until morning.</li>
            <li>I am very hair-challenged.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think my this would work on my hair.</li>
            <li>very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to put your hair in a bun.  </li>
            <li>Very well-made and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Soo much easier than sticking 100 bobby pins in and hairspray and all this and then trying not to move my head too much.</li>
            <li>Bobby pins are a joke to me since they do absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Picked these up on a whim, spun the two pins in, and I have never felt such a secure bun in my life.</li>
            <li>my hair and bobby pins rip strands out no matter how gentle I am at removing them.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>They stay in place really well</li>
            <li>I whole heartedly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>While I can not suggest you ever go against manufacturers&#x27; instructions, I think if you CAREFULLY spin the pins both in and out (Not just try to yank them out.), you should be okay.</li>
            <li>so it really doesn&#x27;t matter which color you get.</li>
            <li>Would they really hold my waist-length hair in a bun?</li>
            <li>They also keep my hair up and secure for an entire 8+ hours.</li>
            <li>Really, these things hold all day and do not hurt, pinch, pull or dig into your head.</li>
            <li>They are indeed very durable.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think these would work</li>
            <li>It really is secure.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I checked the reviews here before I purchased the pins and really want to give 5 stars of this product.</li>
            <li>These worked much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m having some difficulty putting them in, sometimes I will place them straight into my hair then angle up towards the scalp and twist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that two pins isn&#x27;t enough to secure it all.  </li>
            <li>I have really, really dense curly hair, so these pins were put up to the challenge.</li>
            <li>I have to be careful to put these away after use, otherwise I&#x27;m pretty sure my cat will think she has a new toy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend these to anyone (and I&#x27;m buying a few more myself!).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use, and it really holds the hair well- for a long time.</li>
            <li>The other items don&#x27;t work well with my hair because I have too much (the updo pin does ok.)</li>
            <li>Truly remarkable, I have tried so many things that just don&#x27;t stay in my thick, coarse hair, this was like a sudden miracle.</li>
            <li>I wear these regularly, they are easy to use and secure your hair without any sense of feeling like your hair will come loose.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, straight, long hair (almost waist-length).</li>
            <li>My hair is long but fine, so I don&#x27;t have as much hair to put up as some people.</li>
            <li>For years I have used endless clips, bands,sticks, bobby pins, doodads and whatsits but most of the time I had hair all over the place</li>
            <li>I spun one in from the bottom and one from the top, as the instructions say to do, but I spun one so that it connected with the other.</li>
            <li>However, after much practice, I was amazed at how well they worked once I FINALLY got it right!  </li>
            <li>The first time I used these, it pinned a bun securely while the hair was wet.  </li>
            <li>I have medium to long fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair, medium to fine textured but a LOT of it.</li>
            <li>little spin pins is all it takes to secure, and I mean secure a nice &amp;#34;bun&amp;#34; of sort in the thickest hair.  </li>
            <li>I have long super straight thick hair and these hold up fairly well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought a lot of hair gadgets but mostly (until recently), the only thing that really worked for me was the octopus clip.</li>
            <li>I keep my hair long, not just because I think it&#x27;s pretty this way, but I also like to be able to put my hair up in a simple manner when I don&#x27;t want it in the way.</li>
            <li>My favorite part is when I take it down there is no crease from a hair tie</li>
            <li>My hair is shoulder length, super thin, super fine</li>
            <li>When I saw these at Walmart I was more than a little intrigued but was also not expecting much either.</li>
            <li>A new staple!</li>
            <li>This is one hair accessory I cannot live without!</li>
            <li>I have thick long hair, I don&#x27;t do nice buns because it takes far to many bobby pins.</li>
            <li>It works in my opinion better than the Bumpit and is less noticeable in hair.</li>
            <li>The next thing I&#x27;d like to see from Goody is a memorable commercial for the \\&quot;Spin Pin\\</li>
            <li>The color was a decent match, so they more or less disappear in your hair.  </li>
            <li>I have shoulder-length plus, big, brunette hair and these suckers work great at securing my buns.  </li>
            <li>More practice, and/or a second set to do two smaller buns would probably fix this, though.</li>
            <li>I am not able to put my hair in a bun with two of these without first putting it in a ponytail elastic, and even then they don&#x27;t hold better than a couple of mini clips from the dollar store.</li>
            <li>I can wear my hair in a bun without needing the big obvious clip any more.</li>
            <li>You can create a more casual style with these or a more formal style --</li>
            <li>These little double-helixes make it surprisingly easy to do exactly that.  </li>
            <li>I have hip length, very fine hair, and these actually hold it in place without me having to fix it all day long.</li>
            <li>Make sure to make a really tight bun when you use it though.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hair accessory.</li>
            <li>I like the ballerina look, with the bun high on the head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Just be careful not to interlock them in your hair, as the package direction states, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>because though I wouldn&#x27;t reccommend to anyone with lots of 3b curly hair, maybe someone with less hair or a different type (wavy or straight) could get better results if willing to risk the amount on the pricetag.</li>
            <li>I love these little spiral pins.</li>
            <li>It took me a year to figure out how to do that little bump of hair on top of my head.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t happen with these magical little items.</li>
            <li>was amazed and have sold many friends on these little jewels.&lt;br</li>
            <li>--it doesn&#x27;t have any kind of texture that enables it to grab onto itself, so it can be hard to put it up and make it stay.  </li>
            <li>It works GREAT with my waist long thick hair, even if I sleep with them in at night.</li>
            <li>I love them for a messy bun.</li>
            <li>I love the messy bun</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t worry about hair styles and normally have my hair is in a bun.  </li>
            <li>I do understand that they are trying to cater to many different hair types, but for me they are just way too long.   </li>
            <li>I wore my hair in a slightly messy (but stylish) bun all day, WENT TO BED FOR THE NIGHT,</li>
            <li>I may order a few more...</li>
            <li>I need to buy a few more</li>
            <li>Anyway, definitely fork up the $5 and buy these, they&#x27;re so worth it.</li>
            <li>I might just buy a few more sets and keep them in my purse and car.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably buy a few more sets</li>
            <li>I guess that shows its pretty much user-error for those that can&#x27;t get it to work properly.</li>
            <li>Normally just throwing it up in a ponytail.  </li>
            <li>My hair is just past my shoulders, and very fine.</li>
            <li>Everybody&#x27;s hair is different, so keep trying if they don&#x27;t work for you right away.</li>
            <li>if you like a loose, sexy looking updo look, these are the only way to go!</li>
            <li>Two weren&#x27;t enough for my hair though, but once I got four of them (the box says not to overlay them, but I do and it makes the bun nice and tight)</li>
            <li>A different kind of bobby pin, took little time to learn to use it</li>
            <li>I plan to get these for every female relative with long hair as they are that effective.  </li>
            <li>Not until I read an article about them in the New York Times</li>
            <li>I can put it up every which way now in less than 30 seconds, it&#x27;s really easy to put them in and to take them out, and they hold my hair up all day.</li>
            <li>I love these little things!</li>
            <li>This makes a more coiled and fun looking style that looks like it took a long time and lots of bobby pins to create, but in fact took just seconds and two little pins!</li>
            <li>So my first concern was that the spin pin was going to get tangled, especially when trying to remove it from my hair.  </li>
            <li>and she said WOW!</li>
            <li>Usually, I would have one pin securing the bun to the rest of the hair by spinning the pin into part of the bun and the hair, close to the head from the top.  </li>
            <li>Finally I can pin those pretty hair forks on the bun.  </li>
            <li>pin looked small and suspicious, however this holds your hair in the most efficient way using its swirl like brush.</li>
            <li>So if I can get this down it&#x27;ll be huge</li>
            <li>My hair is long, medium-thick, mostly straight but a little wavy in some places, and while it&#x27;s capable of looking gorgeous when I wear it down and fix it, it&#x27;s a pain</li>
            <li>/&gt;The little mini spin pins are perfect for making a little bun when just doing part of your hair, when the rest hangs down.</li>
            <li>I will say, that having layered hair, it can be tricky to make it work because you will have some of the shorter hairs that aren&#x27;t long enough to fit into the pins.</li>
            <li>For the average hair competent female, these should be a no brain wonder.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty thick, super-straight light to medium brown hair</li>
            <li>so one just has to give a little twist a couple times a day - that&#x27;s probably because my hair is so fine.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is half again what I paid, so I think I&#x27;ll go back to the grocery store and pick up another couple of packages just in case they decide to stop making them (like seems to happen with everything else I fall in love with).</li>
            <li>I have very long curly fine hair that now needs to be up all the time because it&#x27;s so long and have a new baby..</li>
            <li>No need to mess with hot rollers, straight irons, or curling irons this summer!  </li>
            <li>The only down side is that I have layered hair, so I get lots of ends sticking out, which looks okay for casual wear but would not look good for a professional or formal situation.  </li>
            <li>a fervent of bun style hair, I tried many different types of pins to hold my hair tight yet stylish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I go with a simple bun hairdo a lot (especially when it&#x27;s as hot as it is now!),  </li>
            <li>I was looking for an alternative to the ponytail and realized I am completely inept when it comes to fixing my hair.</li>
            <li>so I need to keep my hair neat and professional looking.  </li>
            <li>They really work and they&#x27;re low commitment.</li>
            <li>I was so near my hair-related Holy Grail--</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finding myself even telling complete strangers about it on the street when I notice they too could benefit from the use of the spin pin.  </li>
            <li>- but it does help the pins to grab as much hair as possible.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very silky and even when using 10 hairpins my hair slips out almost immediately of a chignon, bun or french braid.</li>
            <li>It last the whole day,until you unscrew the pin off.</li>
            <li>The twisting action does do wonders.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely amazed.  </li>
            <li>I am a complete clutz at styling my hair.  </li>
            <li>These actually work really well.</li>
            <li>I am completely hopeless when it comes to styling hair in any way</li>
            <li>I bought them regardless and was pleasantly surprised by how well they performed.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s nearly to my waist (longest it&#x27;s ever been).  </li>
            <li>I tried it without using a ponytail and with a ponytail, no different really.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t look professional if you looked closely</li>
            <li>I also like that you can get a more \\&quot;put together\\&quot; messy bun with these as compared to using a regular hair tie (bobby pins never work).</li>
            <li>Which quite honestly, is gonna take someones eye out when day if they walk to close behind me.     </li>
            <li>I have thick wavy hair and just two are ok</li>
            <li>When I ordered this product, I was worrried the spin pins wouldn&#x27;t hold my hair, as many of the other reviews were from people with thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>These are really a great little invention, and keeps all hair tightly in it&#x27;s place all day long.</li>
            <li>At Wal-Mart these are right next to a puffy ponytail-er and a french twist thingy.</li>
            <li>I use only 2 spin pins and they works very well with my long, straight Asian hair to hold the hair bun for the whole day.</li>
            <li>please, folks at Goody - make a reasonable profit - charge fairly for 2 pieces of twisted metal!  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair which is also pretty thin around the sides.</li>
            <li>I went to Walgreens to get one of these just to try and see what the fuss is about, thinking that it cant be as easy as it looks, I mean how would it work, had no clue until I opened it and put my hair in a pony tail and made a messy bun in seconds without even trying, so easy.</li>
            <li>At almost 50 years of age I have finally found a hair accessory that works in thin, fine hair!!</li>
            <li>I love wearing my hair in a bun, but my past attempts at buns have been time-consuming, with mixed results.</li>
            <li>I wasnt&#x27; sure how big or small they would be, so bought them out of curiousity.  </li>
            <li>If you have long hair, and you like casual updos, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I often wear my long (close to waist length) thick,straight, hair in a bun that had to be held with 2 or 3 large clips.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair that is very fine and slick.  </li>
            <li>I have them in right now, it only takes 30 seconds to get my hair into a bun and to twist these in and they stay all day long.</li>
            <li>The only minor criticism is that every time I put it on the bathroom countertop it rolls right off.</li>
            <li>But really, the pins are very well hidden in your hair, so no one sees them.</li>
            <li>I used to use a lot of regular hair pins to put it up, but after it got to my waist, it was too heavy to stay up securely in just pins unless my head was nearly armored with them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy a few more packs as back ups.</li>
            <li>I am a disaster with hair, especially since I have a lot of length - pretty much my hair is down or in a pony tail.</li>
            <li>I was very excited because it got great reviews, and I have been continually searching for a way to put my hair back in a way other than a simple pony-tail which looks lazy and sloppy with my hair.</li>
            <li>I can use both the blonde and brunette pins as they completely disappear into my hair and are completely invisible.</li>
            <li>My mom has a professional technician license so in my entire life I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to  shop where hair professionals buy their professional grade equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing is that I have baby fine hair that isn&#x27;t super long or thick, it&#x27;s about to the bottom of my shoulder blades or where my bra goes across my back.  </li>
            <li>I have long, very fine, thick hair.</li>
            <li>This product takes only a minute to put in, looks professional, and will stay in all day!  </li>
            <li>I can twist my hair into a bun, hold it was one hand and spin the pin in through the top, then switch hands and spin the other pin in from the bottom at a different angle so it doesn&#x27;t lock on the other pin.</li>
            <li>No sharp edges or jagged edges to catch or cut my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>I can put my hair in a full bun, a half bun and French twist in seconds.</li>
            <li>With the spin pin, I spin one up from the bottom and one down from the top, both at a slight angle.</li>
            <li>All you  have to do is twist your hair into a bun, than screw the first pin into the loose end,then screw the second pin into the opposit direction.</li>
            <li>They take a little practice to use, but are completely worth it once you get the hang of it.     </li>
            <li>With these pins, I can twist my hair into a french twist or two stakced french twists or a bun, and it holds any hair it hits, even the little ones that barely fit and fall out of my &#x27;gripper&#x27; hair elastics.</li>
            <li>I have been a huge fan of it since I discovered it a long time ago, and the Spin Pin allows you to make the messy buy without getting your hair tangled, using 10 million bobby pins, or using a scrunchie that flattens your hair and leaves a dent.  </li>
            <li>The Spin Pins are made of metal so they will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen videos with ppl with shagged, layered and shorter hair that worked very well with the Spin Pins.</li>
            <li>Only \\&quot;value for price paid\\&quot; would get 5* from me because I purchased the complete Bundle Pack from Walmart for onl</li>
            <li>I have long, thick hair, and most clips just give up and cry when I try to use them to put my hair up.</li>
            <li>I also have fairly thin hair that slips out of most anything.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that they don&#x27;t leave behind lines in your hair the way that hair ties would.</li>
            <li>It just takes a little bit of practice to get the pins in just the right place to not let pieces hanging out</li>
            <li>(Just a little less stylish, of course.)</li>
            <li>for me it is worth the money to finally have something that works with my hair and keeps it up without getting weighed down.</li>
            <li>It helped that I had read the reviews first, and watched the You Tube videos, but it literally took 30 seconds to do, and lasted hours, until I chose to take it down.</li>
            <li>I braid my hair first, then fold the braid in half or thirds to create a \\&quot;bun\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Then I hold it with one hand while I spin the two pins in, one pretty close to the end of my hair, and the other one about opposite.  </li>
            <li>and it really does hold all day (even if my hair is wet when I put it up)!  </li>
            <li>They hold my hair securely, and don&#x27;t budge unless I do some serious head-banging.</li>
            <li>Its a bit more suttle and not so noticeably dramatic like your hiding a bee hive under there.</li>
            <li>I have hair that is pretty long, so I have never really tried it.</li>
            <li>They work very well with my hair, not too thick and not too much.  </li>
            <li>These little pins really do work!</li>
            <li>But I tried to just put it up a little higher, and that solves the problem of the \\&quot;fly-away\\&quot; hairs that don&#x27;t want to stay in place.</li>
            <li>So easy to put into your bun and keeps my hair up all day long without pulling so hard</li>
            <li>I was at work yesterday and a woman had these in, and took them out for a sec, and I asked her about them, and she highly recomended them.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re small and easily lost if you aren&#x27;t careful</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter if you get light or dark, they&#x27;re hidden inside your hair, plus eventually the paint wears off the tips anyway.</li>
            <li>It still stays tight and *most* of the hair stays in the bun, however I do have to use one bobby pin sometimes to tame a big flyaway..or whatever you call it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been pleased enough with the results to wear it this way in public, but I did an easy French twist...gathered my hair fairly high, twisted it, then folded it down twice and pulled the hair from the left to the right over the twisted hair.</li>
            <li>First use only took 5 seconds and my hair stayed until I took it down!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve previously tried the Goody Modern Updo (which is like a combo of a hair styling stick and a gigantic bobby pin)</li>
            <li>It may be because I have some layers in my \\&quot;just above bra strap\\&quot; hair, but I have to aid them with other pins to get a decent look.</li>
            <li>I have a LOT of thick, long (middle of my back) hair and spend lots of money on clips and pins, barrettes, ties that aren&#x27;t strong enough to hold all my hair...............</li>
            <li>My hair is not really long enough to go into a bun, but these things hold it up!</li>
            <li>too many lumps here, strands missing here and there, not to mention my hair is very thick, straight and long.</li>
            <li>I have waist-length, very fine, very thin hair.</li>
            <li>i think the looks you can create from these are super sexy, but almost impossible to get from any other hair accessory.</li>
            <li>It was such a mess to get this out because it had widened so much it wouldn&#x27;t spin.  </li>
            <li>These little corkscrews really did hold my bun all freakin day, AND my head didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>seems steep to me; I saw them in the store months ago but just couldn&#x27;t make myself spend that much on these little things.  </li>
            <li>I thought these were a little gimmicky, but cheap enough to try and give away if they didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I am so happy to have them!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really awesome!</li>

            <li> It creates a beautiful neat bun</li>
            <li> I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> Thank you Goody, for returning a GREAT product to the market and thank you Amazon for linking me to the wonderful store that sent them to me - Your Wholesale Retailer in Florida, who gave me FANTASTIC customer service!!</li>
            <li> That being said, these pins are great.</li>
            <li> Great idea.</li>
            <li> and they work GREAT.  </li>
            <li> I think they are great.  </li>
            <li> I am going to try and color them in some way to mach my hair, otherwise these are a great product and</li>
            <li> So - great, durable product, but</li>
            <li> My hairstylist suggested the spin pins and I cannot believe how great these things work.</li>
            <li> Great to use on any thickness hair and for any occasion.</li>
            <li> These work GREAT.  </li>
            <li> I was happy to discover the pins were made out of metal.</li>
            <li> Great buy and</li>
            <li> Anyway, these are GREAT.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am that I tried this product.  </li>
            <li> Great design.</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> I use these almost every day for work and it keeps my hair up for hours while also making a great looking bun.</li>
            <li> It looks great every time.</li>
            <li> Works just great, holds a bun all day.</li>
            <li> It looks very tidy without the need for excess bobby pins.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the best way to get a very secure bun is to place the two spin pins perpendicular to one another.  </li>
            <li> The spin pin is amazing!  </li>
            <li> That being said, the spin pins are amazing!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply amazing!  </li>
            <li> Spin Pins are amazing!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving these pins!</li>
            <li> This spin pin is the most awesome invention!</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever been able to do is a ponytail.</li>
            <li> I am very happy, and I am buying more for christmas stocking stuffing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure once my hair gets about 6 inches longer they&#x27;ll be perfect, but for now I think I&#x27;m going to try to get a pack of the mini&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Update, I did use all 4 pins in my hair successfully.  </li>
            <li> TURN INTO MY HAIR EASILY WITH NO PROBLEM AND STAY ALL DAY - GREAT INVENTION!!!</li>
            <li> Very easy to take out as well,no pulling at all!</li>
            <li> I suspect, however, that a good application of hairspray might fix the problem.  </li>
            <li> They are lightweight and look fairly durable.</li>
            <li> Good invention for hair.</li>
            <li> The good news is that if you use them correctly you can&#x27;t see the color anyway</li>
            <li> Good quality metal, ends are protected so they don&#x27;t snag hair</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all good.  </li>
            <li> I twist my hair up and around toward the top, insert my spin pins, and the gorgeous curls at the ends of my hair just hang out gloriously over the resulting bun!  </li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these!!!</li>
            <li> I love it and don&#x27;t want to cut it off because it looks great when I have time to style it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable to wear too!</li>
            <li> It looks very nice and elegant.  </li>
            <li> The spin pin made a nice bun easily AND it looked really good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with these!</li>
            <li> Just bought this today and love it!  </li>
            <li> I just picked up one of these at the drugstore on a whim and I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li> I tried these pins on a whim, and SO glad I did!  </li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments, people ask me what I&#x27;m doing after work to have styled my hair!</li>
            <li> Love them!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why but before buying these I had never been able to successfully put my hair up in a bun.</li>
            <li> I will continue to experiment since I already made the purchase but am definately glad I shopped around and got the cheapest price around!</li>
            <li> I love them!</li>
            <li> They are simply ingenious!</li>
            <li> Gotta love this stuff!</li>
            <li> well, if i may chime in here, i LOVE these pins!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to say sayonara to bobby pin buns!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this invention!</li>
            <li> I might have to buy more just in case I lose one!</li>
            <li> and once I had my hair up in a bun (possibly the best looking one I have ever been able to produce) it stayed put perfectly until I decided to take it out.</li>
            <li> being said, this is the most efficient and cost effective hairstyling tool on the market!</li>
            <li> Still, I was impressed that I didn&#x27;t even need to put my hair in a ponytail first, and there were no flyaways at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>
            <li> I plan to use these again for sure!</li>
            <li> I just put my hair up three times in a row with these pins, and each time it looked good, and it felt VERY secure.</li>
            <li> these pins are AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> They handle the weight amazingly</li>
            <li> They go in real smooth and didn&#x27;t pinch or hurt at all.</li>
            <li> This is an  amazing product.</li>
            <li> They keep hair up without pulling or breaking, amazingly well.</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled that I found these.</li>
            <li> just thrilled with these hair pins.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product Goody!</li>
            <li> I kind of like these, can you tell???  </li>
            <li> and my hair is nice and wavy.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have found such a great tool!  </li>
            <li> This product is nice to use to make beachy waves.</li>
            <li> no flyaways or stray hairs,,,I looked very nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I also like that they&#x27;re not outrageously priced (although Amazon, surprisingly, charges more than Walgreens).  </li>
            <li> Great price, came quickly.  </li>
            <li> The pins are very easy to put in and take out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy for me to give</li>
            <li> I am thrilled to have some spin pins - they&#x27;re fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did because this pins are AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> I love these pins and am using them to do my own hair for the USMC Birthday Ball this year.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the kind of bun maker that&#x27;s a plastic loop that you hook at the bottom, and I like this one better.</li>
            <li> but it is very fine and slippery.</li>
            <li> And, while I have a LOT of hair, the strands are very fine, so my hair doesn&#x27;t hold bobby pins, barrettes, hair bands, head bands, etc.</li>
            <li> So easy to wrap hair into a bun and then twist these two pieces in!  </li>
            <li> I have very fine slippery hair that is shoulder blade length.</li>
            <li> These pins can hang on to all that hair and they don&#x27;t let go, and it&#x27;s so easy!</li>
            <li> So happy to have found this before the hot summer weather.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the modern updo Goody product, and purchased these after being thrilled with that expecting these to be just as great.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews and watched some videos relating to this on you tube, it looked too good to be true...</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to use, hold my hair all day, and make it easy for me to create a good looking bun.</li>
            <li> It feels very secure</li>
            <li> It was very comfortable while it lasted.</li>
            <li> but 2 makes it very secure.</li>
            <li> The pins are very smooth with ball shaped tips.</li>
            <li> I have waist length hair and these hold it up with no problem, and are very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I can get all my hair up and off my neck and not worry about it ALL day.  </li>
            <li> Then I put the spin pins in at the top and the bottom.</li>
            <li> These spin pins, though, are like magic.</li>
            <li> I LOVE that.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying some more today, because I can&#x27;t do without them anymore.    </li>
            <li> I love being able to get out of bed</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> , I would give it more stars if I could.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER been able to put it up myself in anything but a pony tail.  </li>
            <li> I always love the idea of chignon&#x27;s or fancy buns</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m truly in love.</li>
            <li> You should place one at the top of the bun and a spin pin at the bottom.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels secure, no slippage!</li>
            <li> Much better than using a hundred bobby pins and more sophisticated than just using a rubber band.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if you use your imagination you can create many styles with them.</li>
            <li> The spin pin is nothing short of AWESOME.  </li>
            <li> Stylish to wear.  </li>
            <li> My daughter gave me a set of Spin Pins and told me I was going to love them.</li>
            <li> I will keep and attempt to continue using the four I have, just won&#x27;t be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I LOVE ALL TYPES OF HAIR PRODUCTS AND ITEMS</li>
            <li> &quot; most people I&#x27;ve shared this item with</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with these pins from Goody.  </li>
            <li> One tip that wasn&#x27;t in the instructions is to make sure you push them against your head a bit as you screw them into the bun.  </li>
            <li> I can do a bun on the top of my head and sleep in it.</li>
            <li> my hair is up and out of my face ever since and never a nasty hair elastic dent in sight!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so inept at being able to style my hair.</li>
            <li> These pins are absolutely fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I love these spin pins.</li>
            <li> It tends to slip out of most hair clips, headbands, etc.  </li>
            <li> I imagine one might need more than two of the shorter pins or purchase the longer size.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She loves to pull my hair, even when in a pony tail, so a bun on top of my head</li>
            <li> totally secure!</li>
            <li> They are fantastic!</li>
            <li> These things are infinitely better than bobbi pins.</li>
            <li> but I think with 2 more would stay better</li>
            <li> Now that I know how to use it, I love it.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to recreate that style again with these pins.</li>
            <li> Love these pins.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I&#x27;ve never even been able to wear them out of the house.  </li>
            <li> I put it in a bun on top of my head about 4 hours ago</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to see that Amazon is now charging the price I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> I may buy some more from here.    </li>
            <li> I love this invention.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love these things.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 3 more pair of them.  </li>
            <li> but I prefer the look I get from the magic grip hair pins.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wear one of the cute chignon styles I&#x27;ve been seeing on celebrities, but I had no idea how to make a bun.  </li>
            <li> and I love them.  </li>
            <li> Be creative.</li>
            <li> I can even do a French twist, awesome product, it&#x27;s $5.88 at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering more just to have.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> They do the job that would take many bobby pins to do.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these spin pins and am glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> So I wish I had gotten the minis, because these stick out a bit at the top and bottom of my bun.  </li>
            <li> overall great product!  </li>
            <li> Saw a video of these online and thought they were interesting.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I tried these.</li>
            <li> The part I love is that they are mostly invisible to others.</li>
            <li> These are sooo much better than any hair clip</li>
            <li> (my guess is that it will work much better) but what I needed most is a way to put my hair up, or \\&quot;hide\\</li>
            <li> I picked up these Spin Pins at a Walmart, and they are fantastic!</li>
            <li> -- then it holds all of it better.</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t seem to work for women with more hair.  </li>
            <li> More pins might help the bun stay, but I haven&#x27;t experimented with it.    </li>
            <li> Since getting these pins, I&#x27;ve been enjoying putting my hair into a bun more than I had before.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I began with a set for myself that I absolutely love.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my hair styles when I&#x27;m using the spin pins.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> I intend to buy many more so that I can have some on hand at all</li>
            <li> Just be sure you don&#x27;t interlock them when inserting, as they warn, because they do stay PUT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We love these pins - they help me and my son&#x27;s jooda stay intact</li>
            <li> and I struggled MANY MANY times to keep my hair up with these pins.  </li>
            <li> Two will hold your hair but more will make you feel more secure in your do!</li>
            <li> These spin pins are fantastic!</li>
            <li> I found a lot of these once at a dolar store stocked up can never have to many of these.</li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like bobby pins and the results are better than they are with bobby pins.</li>
            <li> One trick is to make sure that you place them against your scalp when you twist them in.</li>
            <li> love love love these.</li>
            <li> But we have a wedding tomorrow and after seeing the good reviews I decided it was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li> I am an absolute klutz when it comes to hair, but these were super-easy to use and very effective.  </li>
            <li> Easy to put in, easy to take out, and pain-free!  </li>
            <li> and it is very easy to use, and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> These are easy to use and I love the concept, but they don&#x27;t hold my hair well, even when I use more than one, and seem overpriced to me.  </li>
            <li> It feels very secure, and the pins twist in and out easily without pulling out your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that easy, and they hold better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before.</li>
            <li> Really useful and more effective than bobby pins.</li>
            <li> They are more comfortable than ties and hold better.</li>
            <li> They need a little bit of practice to see what looks best/works best on you, but it is very easy and flexible.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this exceptional product.</li>
            <li> They are the best money I ever spent on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I actually enjoy using these and being creative with them.</li>
            <li> $8.00 +FREE S/H TO HOME, which speaks better of the retailer than the product.</li>
            <li> Best $3.50 I&#x27;ve ever spent on my hair.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re becoming my go-to morning hair accessory.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful for putting long hair into a bun and keeping it secure.</li>
            <li> Much more comfortable than bobby pins.</li>
            <li> but honestly these spin pins are definitely worth the $6 you pay anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> the kind that bobby pins slip right out of, but these stay put.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how cool of a product this is!  </li>
            <li> These hair pins are easy to use.</li>
            <li> Since my hair breaks easily, I&#x27;ve been trying to stay away from putting my hair in elastics</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I get a headache easily from hair accessoories, and these have never bothered me.</li>
            <li> -I didn&#x27;t think it would be that easy</li>
            <li> The pins are easy to twist in &amp; out and they do hold your bun for quite a while.</li>
            <li> They spin in and spin out easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that easy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too easy.</li>
            <li> *  Easy to use on yourself without a mirror&lt;br</li>
            <li> They go in and out easy and there isn&#x27;t any learning curve.</li>
            <li> With these I can do them easily and they stay in all day, if fact</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are easy to insert, easy to remove, and hold a secure hairdo.</li>
            <li> I have relatively fine hair, shoulder length</li>
            <li> I have fairly fine shoulder length hair and this works like charm.</li>
            <li> The instructions were easy to follow, and it did secure my hair...</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that never stays where it belongs unless I use a claw that gives me a headache.  </li>
            <li> You can quickly put your hair in a bun with just these two pins!</li>
            <li> I waited a good, long time to write this review, to make sure I was really satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Super easy to use, twists in easy and twists out easy,</li>
            <li> I was dubious when I first saw them because my hair tangles in things very easily, but these don&#x27;t tangle in my hair.</li>
            <li> This little spin pins are awesome.  </li>
            <li> These really are amazing.</li>
            <li> This had such great reviews I had to try it.</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of it, though, it was smooth sailing.</li>
            <li> They are FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li> You just turn the pin into your hair and they stay secure.</li>
            <li> This pin holds my bun in place securely.  </li>
            <li> Secure even if I whip my head from side to side.  </li>
            <li> but I did a great side swept bun last night for a formal event that everyone raved over!  </li>
            <li> I can even sleep comfortably with these in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The two pins were surprisingly comfortable.  </li>
            <li> and they hold my hair securely in place for hours at a time.  </li>
            <li> Also, they are comfortable to wear and do not pull at my hair like a pony tail</li>
            <li> But being that it was relatively cheap</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe its still holding - also they&#x27;re so comfortable -</li>
            <li> Buy a set and enjoy.  </li>
            <li> but sometimes I just want a smooth unadorned</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I finally found something that can handle my hair.</li>
            <li> Up until I got these pins, nothing would hold my hair securely in an up-do.</li>
            <li> I have a big head, lol, and hair that hits my shoulders.</li>
            <li> Indispensable items.</li>
            <li> Great for those with short hair -</li>
            <li> Stays secure for hours and with yard work and hats etc.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> However, unlike some fortunate women here, I have to adjust the pins now</li>
            <li> I could get a bun to stay with just one, but its really secure with two.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t feel completely secure like it&#x27;d stay that way for hours.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to do a bun with these.</li>
            <li> I thought I had finally figured out how to make it work for me, and I was super happy about it!&lt;br /&gt;Alas</li>
            <li> but my mom was quick to tell me that it says in bold not to do so, so I won&#x27;t be doing that again!</li>
            <li> I have found that using ponytail holders (to put your hair into a ponytail first) holds the style better.</li>
            <li> time, just like bobby pins, the original color is wearing in spots.  </li>
            <li> I put my bottom one in first, seems to hold better for me</li>
            <li> Where was that strength to keep its original shape!?!?!?&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> The side chignon I made for the first time ever looked so cute.</li>
            <li> Great and must have hair accessory for anybody with long hair.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about how well they worked that I called my mother to tell her to pick some up too.  </li>
            <li> This works great for even really long hair like mine.</li>
            <li> but It was so easy that I put my hair up while driving on my first try!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hip length, but very fine and slippery and absolutely straight.</li>
            <li> I am buying several pairs as stocking stuffers for people who I know would love them, but would never pick them up on their own.</li>
            <li> super quick and easy to use, and they don&#x27;t tug on your hair/scalp at all.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m writing this review, I&#x27;m swinging my head back and forth and loving the feeling, because I am confident that these pins won&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li> Most of the quick and easy hair products are really meant for medium length hair.</li>
            <li> I can throw my hair up in a bun straight out of the shower, and I&#x27;m good for the whole day.</li>
            <li> My hair is about medium thickness and just above my waist and these spin pins are not only easy to put in but stay in perfectly.</li>
            <li> You need a relatively large mass of hair to be able to use these without them showing.</li>
            <li> This product fell right out of my fine shoulder length hair</li>
            <li> Even with just one pin it barely put my hair up but the 2nd pin it was perfect!</li>
            <li> I love these so much, I have 3 sets (just in case I misplace one).</li>
            <li> I really like these, and will probably purchase more of them.</li>
            <li> :) highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have a FULL head of 3b curly hair and expected some setbacks but hoped otherwise thanks to a review about these products working best for curly hair instead of straight fine hair.</li>
            <li> 2 work pretty well for hanging around the house and taking it easy.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s available at most stores near you, go get one, or two sets!</li>
            <li> They are just as quick and easy to use as hairsticks, and much quicker than a ponytail holder and bobby pins!  </li>
            <li> thanks, thanks to the Spin Pin\\&quot;!! :)   </li>
            <li> This is also a product for those of us with longer hair and can be as quick as putting hair in a pony tail.</li>
            <li> Would love to see them make some smaller ones for more versitile styles.</li>
            <li> The Spin Pins work best for my hair but 2 pins simply aren&#x27;t enough!</li>
            <li> I used to use these ALL the time when they were called HairScroos and could not BE more pleased to find them again, as I broke my last one almost a year ago now.  </li>
            <li> The Spin Pin is super helpful.  </li>
            <li> The paint wears off the pins fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> That advice is probably obvious to most, but maybe they are some hair-idiots like me out there. :-)</li>
            <li> but I guess I got lucky when it mattered.  </li>
            <li> They are VERY easy to use (there are clear directions) and they don&#x27;t tug on your hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend searching the internet for more ideas than what the box provides...</li>
            <li> I pull my hair into a ponytail and secure it with an elastic first.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly long hair, almost waist length, with a good bit of body.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look very good with a simple bun because my ears stick out, and I live in a hot climate so a ponytail</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these to keep your hair secure in a comfortable bun.</li>
            <li> I lost my original pair, and I miss them very much.</li>
            <li> these really keep my hair up in a bun and easy to take off.</li>
            <li> I have long hair (reaching slightly above my waist)and this pin works beautifully!</li>
            <li> These little corkscrew pins are so great for quick up dos.</li>
            <li> first try!</li>
            <li> (Note: For the best bun, be sure to put the first pin in from the bottom and try to catch the ends of your hair that you twisted around in it.</li>
            <li> The first day I wore it, I got 3 compliments on my hairstyle!  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Goody!!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length curly hair (somewhere between 2b and 3a) and the Spin Pin is great for creating quick messy buns.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine (not thin) and</li>
            <li> These work great with my fine yet thick hair.</li>
            <li> These two little spin pins are the most amazing things that have ever happened to hair since the hair iron.</li>
            <li> They keep my hair in place, the hair is secure, and it doesn&#x27;t pull on my scalp like the Modern Updo maker.</li>
            <li> so I tried the much cheaper ones available from overseas.</li>
            <li> Now for the exciting part...</li>
            <li> so I thought this might be worth a try.</li>
            <li> and all I can say is it was WELL WORTH</li>
            <li> well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Overall,they&#x27;re fun to play and experiment with,</li>
            <li> The only reason I discovered these is because my sister happened to try them out, and mentioned how much she loved them.  </li>
            <li> I plan to purchase several sets so they will be handy when I need them.</li>
            <li> If my hair is freshly shampooed I have to spray some product in it to give it some hold before putting these in.  </li>
            <li> These are so worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way all that hair looks in a ponytail, and I&#x27;ve wanted to wear something more professional looking and sleek.  </li>
            <li> I think this product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about how it looks from the side (see my photos)</li>
            <li> the economical hair pin set five stars...</li>
            <li> They work fantastically and seem to be decently gentle on the hair- more gentle than using a rubberband.</li>
            <li> It is SO useful.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s well worth it because the spin pins hold my hair in place.</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li> and they won&#x27;t open even through a good night sleep and whole day of running around.  </li>
            <li> Works great in my granddaughter&#x27;s soft curly hair and my soft straight hair.  </li>
            <li> This should be make more clear at time of order, not after.....</li>
            <li> these will be worth it so that I have another option for hairstyles.  </li>
            <li> Super comfortable as well, I can sleep with them in without feeling them, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Still highly recommended for easy hair maintenance.</li>
            <li> I pretty much plan to buy a whole bunch more if I happen to see them at Target or the drugstore because for me they are a must have.</li>
            <li> Right now it&#x27;s shoulder length</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> Slides right out, no matter how adjusted.</li>
            <li> However I have noticed a lot of breakage from right hair ties.</li>
            <li> These are great little gizmos for creating buns!</li>
            <li> These little pins are amazing!</li>
            <li> These are actually pretty great, they hold extremely well and don&#x27;t pull or use too much tension.</li>
            <li> Anywho, these pins kept my hair in securely all day, normally if I put my hair in a ponytail</li>
            <li> These are pretty fun.</li>
            <li> I will also add that I have dark brunette hair and whenever the pins (brunette color) happen to stick out, they blend in fairly well with my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft and fine.</li>
            <li> One piece of advice: Put the first pin in right where the ENDS of your hair are tucked in the bun</li>
            <li> I bought these about a week ago after hearing good things about them, and so far, my experience has only been so-so.   </li>
            <li> I did take away one star because at times, I do have a heck of a time getting the bun to feel as secure as I&#x27;d like, and ultimately, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ever quite as secure as with elastics.  </li>
            <li> I have super straight hair that goes below my shoulders.</li>
            <li> Might work good for thin hair or hair that is not that healthy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting the hang of these, but they are very promising.  </li>
            <li> (so it&#x27;s very gentle on your hair).</li>
            <li> These kept my hair in place all day which is an absolute first!</li>
            <li> These little jewels are too good to do without.  </li>
            <li> I do have fine hair, and the one thing I&#x27;d say is that I found these work better for me when my hair is not freshly washed.</li>
            <li> I figured it was different than anything I&#x27;ve seen, and I&#x27;m so glad I bought them.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Insert the first pin where your hair ends.</li>
            <li> I experimented with this, because I love the French Twist look.</li>
            <li> I bought it tody and did it on my first try.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but great!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy mine from Amazon, I got them from Mal-mart, but I found them here first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy more of these in the same color because I can&#x27;t see them when they are in my hair, and I know I&#x27;ll lose them lol&lt;</li>
            <li> You simply twist them into your bun in a clockwise direction - one at the top and one at the bottom.</li>
            <li> One from the top (about 12:00 position), and one from a 5:00 position - especially when working out.     </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re sitting on gold here, go out and really spread the news!  </li>
            <li> and screw the first one in.   </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s funny</li>
            <li> I did like those ez combs pretty well, but even they hurt after a while.  </li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been searching for an elegant way to gather my hair back that still shows the curls to de-emphasize my ears, but still keeps my hair off my neck.  </li>
            <li> As a mother of 2 young children, I don&#x27;t always have time to style my hair nor do I enjoy it in my face while trying to do things.</li>
            <li> Usually I have the best results when I do the exact opposite.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I saw first this in the magazine, name this the\\&quot; best product of the century\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> no ends of hair, no ugly hair clips, just a nice round bun.    </li>
            <li> I picked these up at the grocery store yesterday and tried them out today for the first time.</li>
            <li> Then I just separate the ball of hair that is left and spin in a spin pin, one on top and one on the bottom.  </li>
            <li> When I first got my spin pins I was timid with them.  </li>
            <li> I bought two sets of these just in case I needed more of the pins to hold my hair up, but I only needed to use two.</li>
            <li> Definitely work better for me on my off-shampoo days.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that my hair has EVER been in a bun.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> so I use a hairband first to create a ponytail (even though they say not to)</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it will...</li>
            <li> The pictures are my first attempt at using them, on hair that has been washed and flat-ironed.</li>
            <li> I had lost mine and NOTHING would keep my slippery, straight hair in place!</li>
            <li> Absolutely!</li>
            <li> hair is a medium shade, so either the blonde or brunette work ok for me.</li>
            <li> I am a nurse so keeping my long locks up and secure is important while I&#x27;m at work.</li>
            <li> In conjunction with the \\&quot;Modern Updo\\&quot; pin made by Goody, these are amazing at holding all day long.</li>
            <li> My only advise, get more than two.</li>
            <li> Next time I will test these pins for my updo hair in the dance class. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if the people who did not succeed with these neglected to put them through the bun and the adjacent scalp hair, which would allow the pins to slide out of place,or if perhaps they have super fine and sort of short hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty positive I won&#x27;t be one of those lucky people that go to the gym with them or jog with them, but for simple everyday wear, so far its perfect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited to use them in the future.</li>
            <li> With the other kind, the loop would show more at the bottom, and occasionally it would come unclasped.</li>
            <li> This is a very neat idea, and I bet it does work well with the right type of hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long (about waist length), very fine, stick-straight hair and these spiral pins really work for me!</li>
            <li> Love using the spin pins, they are easy to use and gave me a few new quick styles to do.</li>
            <li> I am going to buy more for my daughters who have long hair and are constantly looking for cute ways to put it up.</li>
            <li> They do not make your bun completely bullet proof (for bullet proof, I put my hair in a ponytail, braid it, tie the ends with another elastic, then wrap the whole thing around in a bun and secure it with another elastic or two.</li>
            <li> and I love how easy it is for me to re-twist my hair several times a day when necessary.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to put it in a bun with any sort of clips or pins, because there is simply too much hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought these years before they became available from a major company.</li>
            <li> Plus I live in TX where it is very hot and humid a lot of the time.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, they really do hold the bun tightly--</li>
            <li> I literally was lucky in each case of finding them because they are sold out EVERYWHERE near me!</li>
            <li> It took me about 15 tries to get it right, but I&#x27;m glad I kept trying.</li>
            <li> have long, wavy hair that I wear up most of the time.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic tools for doing anything from a simple bun to a more ornamental french twist, any sort of updo.   </li>
            <li> If you have short hair, they might visibly be stuck out the other end of your bun, but they work great for me.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work for me, especially after reading someone saying that they weren&#x27;t good for thick hair.</li>
            <li> Even with tons of bobby pins, I was never able to get my hair into a bun that I thought looked good.</li>
            <li> I read many good reviews about these little spin pins, but to be honest, I was skeptical they would work.  </li>
            <li> With just two of them, it takes me less than a minute to get my hair into a perfect bun that stays tight all day.      </li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t hurt and I actually keep checking to see if my hair is secure because for the first time in my life I don&#x27;t have a headache.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m such a novice when it comes to hair and beauty but these made it so easy to look well-groomed.</li>
            <li> but these were so simple and easy.</li>
            <li> They both say put the same but goodys is stronger and doesn&#x27;t get bend up easily.</li>
            <li> They last forever and easy to use in your hair - longer hair to tie in up in a bun, but I would suggest several as you can misplace them easily -</li>
            <li> Three pins makes it strong enough to go running for an hour, with not a hair out of place.  </li>
            <li> Pure amazement...</li>
            <li> I will be picking up a few more packs when I can find them!</li>
            <li> I never could get straight pins or bobby pins to do a thing in my thick wavy hair, but these stay put pretty good.    </li>
            <li> I will continue to try new ways of using them occasionally to see if I can find something that will work every time because I did love the comfort of it the one time it did hold.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair and this puts my hair up in a perfect bun!</li>
            <li> Another great thing is- no clip or odd bun ponytail that rubs the back of your seat while driving, sitting or laying.</li>
            <li> And it is a nice tight bun, too.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to see a commercial with real people (on the streets) with all different hair types, lengths and styles trying out the spin pin for the first time.  </li>
            <li> These ingenious pins have happily facilitated my lazy approach to hair styling, and the result always looks complicated and thought-out considering the short amount of time creating gorgeous buns takes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m interested in trying out the other items in this line in hopes that I may have more hair styling luck.</li>
            <li> and they fit nicely when Im only using half of my hair</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re best for buns, messy or tight, and depending on the style I wear up to two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trick is really to get them in at a certain angle; I prefer to put mine in diagonally.  </li>
            <li> spin pins are very gentle and hold my long fine hair very well.</li>
            <li> Again, AMAZING little hair accessory.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I&#x27;m not particularly hair adept, but I found these relatively easy to use.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay in my fine hair and definitely aren&#x27;t capable of securing a bun, not to mention they take awhile to \\&quot;screw\\&quot; in.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even good at twisting my hair and getting it into that bun shape (esp find it hard to tuck the end pieces in wihtout them coming out)</li>
            <li> the bun was still there and reasonable in the morning.  </li>
            <li> and i even wear them to the gym and they stay very well.</li>
            <li> They are gentle and you can experiment with how you want to put the bun / chignon on your hair.</li>
            <li> but with this ting the weight is really well dispersed, I didn&#x27;t have a headache at all.</li>
            <li> and I use both on a daily basis to give me the secure hold I need.</li>
            <li> IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li> Straight bobby pins cost about 5 cents each - these cost 5 DOLLARS?</li>
            <li> As my hair got longer, I found that 3 or 4 spin pins really held it all day.  </li>
            <li> After trying the Goody \\&quot;Modern Updo Maker\\&quot; which I bought without discussing with my hairstylist, I was about ready to give up on Goody products.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very pricey from Goody</li>
            <li> These spin pins did not work when my hair was straight, my hair just slipped out in all sorts of places.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They really hold hair in place very well, without spinning or falling out throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not for short-haired people.</li>
            <li> Yes yes highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I use them in updos in place of bobby pins and it is so much faster</li>
            <li> I slept with them in my hair, was very comforatable and my hair stayed in until morning.</li>
            <li> I am very hair-challenged.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think my this would work on my hair.</li>
            <li> very well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier to put your hair in a bun.  </li>
            <li> Very well-made and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Soo much easier than sticking 100 bobby pins in and hairspray and all this and then trying not to move my head too much.</li>
            <li> Bobby pins are a joke to me since they do absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Picked these up on a whim, spun the two pins in, and I have never felt such a secure bun in my life.</li>
            <li> my hair and bobby pins rip strands out no matter how gentle I am at removing them.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> They stay in place really well</li>
            <li> I whole heartedly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> While I can not suggest you ever go against manufacturers&#x27; instructions, I think if you CAREFULLY spin the pins both in and out (Not just try to yank them out.), you should be okay.</li>
            <li> so it really doesn&#x27;t matter which color you get.</li>
            <li> Would they really hold my waist-length hair in a bun?</li>
            <li> They also keep my hair up and secure for an entire 8+ hours.</li>
            <li> Really, these things hold all day and do not hurt, pinch, pull or dig into your head.</li>
            <li> They are indeed very durable.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think these would work</li>
            <li> It really is secure.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I checked the reviews here before I purchased the pins and really want to give 5 stars of this product.</li>
            <li> These worked much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m having some difficulty putting them in, sometimes I will place them straight into my hair then angle up towards the scalp and twist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that two pins isn&#x27;t enough to secure it all.  </li>
            <li> I have really, really dense curly hair, so these pins were put up to the challenge.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful to put these away after use, otherwise I&#x27;m pretty sure my cat will think she has a new toy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend these to anyone (and I&#x27;m buying a few more myself!).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use, and it really holds the hair well- for a long time.</li>
            <li> The other items don&#x27;t work well with my hair because I have too much (the updo pin does ok.)</li>
            <li> Truly remarkable, I have tried so many things that just don&#x27;t stay in my thick, coarse hair, this was like a sudden miracle.</li>
            <li> I wear these regularly, they are easy to use and secure your hair without any sense of feeling like your hair will come loose.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, straight, long hair (almost waist-length).</li>
            <li> My hair is long but fine, so I don&#x27;t have as much hair to put up as some people.</li>
            <li> For years I have used endless clips, bands,sticks, bobby pins, doodads and whatsits but most of the time I had hair all over the place</li>
            <li> I spun one in from the bottom and one from the top, as the instructions say to do, but I spun one so that it connected with the other.</li>
            <li> However, after much practice, I was amazed at how well they worked once I FINALLY got it right!  </li>
            <li> The first time I used these, it pinned a bun securely while the hair was wet.  </li>
            <li> I have medium to long fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair, medium to fine textured but a LOT of it.</li>
            <li> little spin pins is all it takes to secure, and I mean secure a nice &amp;#34;bun&amp;#34; of sort in the thickest hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long super straight thick hair and these hold up fairly well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a lot of hair gadgets but mostly (until recently), the only thing that really worked for me was the octopus clip.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair long, not just because I think it&#x27;s pretty this way, but I also like to be able to put my hair up in a simple manner when I don&#x27;t want it in the way.</li>
            <li> My favorite part is when I take it down there is no crease from a hair tie</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length, super thin, super fine</li>
            <li> When I saw these at Walmart I was more than a little intrigued but was also not expecting much either.</li>
            <li> A new staple!</li>
            <li> This is one hair accessory I cannot live without!</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair, I don&#x27;t do nice buns because it takes far to many bobby pins.</li>
            <li> It works in my opinion better than the Bumpit and is less noticeable in hair.</li>
            <li> The next thing I&#x27;d like to see from Goody is a memorable commercial for the \\&quot;Spin Pin\\</li>
            <li> The color was a decent match, so they more or less disappear in your hair.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder-length plus, big, brunette hair and these suckers work great at securing my buns.  </li>
            <li> More practice, and/or a second set to do two smaller buns would probably fix this, though.</li>
            <li> I am not able to put my hair in a bun with two of these without first putting it in a ponytail elastic, and even then they don&#x27;t hold better than a couple of mini clips from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> I can wear my hair in a bun without needing the big obvious clip any more.</li>
            <li> You can create a more casual style with these or a more formal style --</li>
            <li> These little double-helixes make it surprisingly easy to do exactly that.  </li>
            <li> I have hip length, very fine hair, and these actually hold it in place without me having to fix it all day long.</li>
            <li> Make sure to make a really tight bun when you use it though.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this hair accessory.</li>
            <li> I like the ballerina look, with the bun high on the head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to interlock them in your hair, as the package direction states, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> because though I wouldn&#x27;t reccommend to anyone with lots of 3b curly hair, maybe someone with less hair or a different type (wavy or straight) could get better results if willing to risk the amount on the pricetag.</li>
            <li> I love these little spiral pins.</li>
            <li> It took me a year to figure out how to do that little bump of hair on top of my head.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t happen with these magical little items.</li>
            <li> was amazed and have sold many friends on these little jewels.&lt;br</li>
            <li> --it doesn&#x27;t have any kind of texture that enables it to grab onto itself, so it can be hard to put it up and make it stay.  </li>
            <li> It works GREAT with my waist long thick hair, even if I sleep with them in at night.</li>
            <li> I love them for a messy bun.</li>
            <li> I love the messy bun</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t worry about hair styles and normally have my hair is in a bun.  </li>
            <li> I do understand that they are trying to cater to many different hair types, but for me they are just way too long.   </li>
            <li> I wore my hair in a slightly messy (but stylish) bun all day, WENT TO BED FOR THE NIGHT,</li>
            <li> I may order a few more...</li>
            <li> I need to buy a few more</li>
            <li> Anyway, definitely fork up the $5 and buy these, they&#x27;re so worth it.</li>
            <li> I might just buy a few more sets and keep them in my purse and car.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably buy a few more sets</li>
            <li> I guess that shows its pretty much user-error for those that can&#x27;t get it to work properly.</li>
            <li> Normally just throwing it up in a ponytail.  </li>
            <li> My hair is just past my shoulders, and very fine.</li>
            <li> Everybody&#x27;s hair is different, so keep trying if they don&#x27;t work for you right away.</li>
            <li> if you like a loose, sexy looking updo look, these are the only way to go!</li>
            <li> Two weren&#x27;t enough for my hair though, but once I got four of them (the box says not to overlay them, but I do and it makes the bun nice and tight)</li>
            <li> A different kind of bobby pin, took little time to learn to use it</li>
            <li> I plan to get these for every female relative with long hair as they are that effective.  </li>
            <li> Not until I read an article about them in the New York Times</li>
            <li> I can put it up every which way now in less than 30 seconds, it&#x27;s really easy to put them in and to take them out, and they hold my hair up all day.</li>
            <li> I love these little things!</li>
            <li> This makes a more coiled and fun looking style that looks like it took a long time and lots of bobby pins to create, but in fact took just seconds and two little pins!</li>
            <li> So my first concern was that the spin pin was going to get tangled, especially when trying to remove it from my hair.  </li>
            <li> and she said WOW!</li>
            <li> Usually, I would have one pin securing the bun to the rest of the hair by spinning the pin into part of the bun and the hair, close to the head from the top.  </li>
            <li> Finally I can pin those pretty hair forks on the bun.  </li>
            <li> pin looked small and suspicious, however this holds your hair in the most efficient way using its swirl like brush.</li>
            <li> So if I can get this down it&#x27;ll be huge</li>
            <li> My hair is long, medium-thick, mostly straight but a little wavy in some places, and while it&#x27;s capable of looking gorgeous when I wear it down and fix it, it&#x27;s a pain</li>
            <li> /&gt;The little mini spin pins are perfect for making a little bun when just doing part of your hair, when the rest hangs down.</li>
            <li> I will say, that having layered hair, it can be tricky to make it work because you will have some of the shorter hairs that aren&#x27;t long enough to fit into the pins.</li>
            <li> For the average hair competent female, these should be a no brain wonder.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty thick, super-straight light to medium brown hair</li>
            <li> so one just has to give a little twist a couple times a day - that&#x27;s probably because my hair is so fine.</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is half again what I paid, so I think I&#x27;ll go back to the grocery store and pick up another couple of packages just in case they decide to stop making them (like seems to happen with everything else I fall in love with).</li>
            <li> I have very long curly fine hair that now needs to be up all the time because it&#x27;s so long and have a new baby..</li>
            <li> No need to mess with hot rollers, straight irons, or curling irons this summer!  </li>
            <li> The only down side is that I have layered hair, so I get lots of ends sticking out, which looks okay for casual wear but would not look good for a professional or formal situation.  </li>
            <li> a fervent of bun style hair, I tried many different types of pins to hold my hair tight yet stylish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I go with a simple bun hairdo a lot (especially when it&#x27;s as hot as it is now!),  </li>
            <li> I was looking for an alternative to the ponytail and realized I am completely inept when it comes to fixing my hair.</li>
            <li> so I need to keep my hair neat and professional looking.  </li>
            <li> They really work and they&#x27;re low commitment.</li>
            <li> I was so near my hair-related Holy Grail--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding myself even telling complete strangers about it on the street when I notice they too could benefit from the use of the spin pin.  </li>
            <li> - but it does help the pins to grab as much hair as possible.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very silky and even when using 10 hairpins my hair slips out almost immediately of a chignon, bun or french braid.</li>
            <li> It last the whole day,until you unscrew the pin off.</li>
            <li> The twisting action does do wonders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely amazed.  </li>
            <li> I am a complete clutz at styling my hair.  </li>
            <li> These actually work really well.</li>
            <li> I am completely hopeless when it comes to styling hair in any way</li>
            <li> I bought them regardless and was pleasantly surprised by how well they performed.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s nearly to my waist (longest it&#x27;s ever been).  </li>
            <li> I tried it without using a ponytail and with a ponytail, no different really.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look professional if you looked closely</li>
            <li> I also like that you can get a more \\&quot;put together\\&quot; messy bun with these as compared to using a regular hair tie (bobby pins never work).</li>
            <li> Which quite honestly, is gonna take someones eye out when day if they walk to close behind me.     </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and just two are ok</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product, I was worrried the spin pins wouldn&#x27;t hold my hair, as many of the other reviews were from people with thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> These are really a great little invention, and keeps all hair tightly in it&#x27;s place all day long.</li>
            <li> At Wal-Mart these are right next to a puffy ponytail-er and a french twist thingy.</li>
            <li> I use only 2 spin pins and they works very well with my long, straight Asian hair to hold the hair bun for the whole day.</li>
            <li> please, folks at Goody - make a reasonable profit - charge fairly for 2 pieces of twisted metal!  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair which is also pretty thin around the sides.</li>
            <li> I went to Walgreens to get one of these just to try and see what the fuss is about, thinking that it cant be as easy as it looks, I mean how would it work, had no clue until I opened it and put my hair in a pony tail and made a messy bun in seconds without even trying, so easy.</li>
            <li> At almost 50 years of age I have finally found a hair accessory that works in thin, fine hair!!</li>
            <li> I love wearing my hair in a bun, but my past attempts at buns have been time-consuming, with mixed results.</li>
            <li> I wasnt&#x27; sure how big or small they would be, so bought them out of curiousity.  </li>
            <li> If you have long hair, and you like casual updos, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I often wear my long (close to waist length) thick,straight, hair in a bun that had to be held with 2 or 3 large clips.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair that is very fine and slick.  </li>
            <li> I have them in right now, it only takes 30 seconds to get my hair into a bun and to twist these in and they stay all day long.</li>
            <li> The only minor criticism is that every time I put it on the bathroom countertop it rolls right off.</li>
            <li> But really, the pins are very well hidden in your hair, so no one sees them.</li>
            <li> I used to use a lot of regular hair pins to put it up, but after it got to my waist, it was too heavy to stay up securely in just pins unless my head was nearly armored with them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy a few more packs as back ups.</li>
            <li> I am a disaster with hair, especially since I have a lot of length - pretty much my hair is down or in a pony tail.</li>
            <li> I was very excited because it got great reviews, and I have been continually searching for a way to put my hair back in a way other than a simple pony-tail which looks lazy and sloppy with my hair.</li>
            <li> I can use both the blonde and brunette pins as they completely disappear into my hair and are completely invisible.</li>
            <li> My mom has a professional technician license so in my entire life I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to  shop where hair professionals buy their professional grade equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing is that I have baby fine hair that isn&#x27;t super long or thick, it&#x27;s about to the bottom of my shoulder blades or where my bra goes across my back.  </li>
            <li> I have long, very fine, thick hair.</li>
            <li> This product takes only a minute to put in, looks professional, and will stay in all day!  </li>
            <li> I can twist my hair into a bun, hold it was one hand and spin the pin in through the top, then switch hands and spin the other pin in from the bottom at a different angle so it doesn&#x27;t lock on the other pin.</li>
            <li> No sharp edges or jagged edges to catch or cut my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I can put my hair in a full bun, a half bun and French twist in seconds.</li>
            <li> With the spin pin, I spin one up from the bottom and one down from the top, both at a slight angle.</li>
            <li> All you  have to do is twist your hair into a bun, than screw the first pin into the loose end,then screw the second pin into the opposit direction.</li>
            <li> They take a little practice to use, but are completely worth it once you get the hang of it.     </li>
            <li> With these pins, I can twist my hair into a french twist or two stakced french twists or a bun, and it holds any hair it hits, even the little ones that barely fit and fall out of my &#x27;gripper&#x27; hair elastics.</li>
            <li> I have been a huge fan of it since I discovered it a long time ago, and the Spin Pin allows you to make the messy buy without getting your hair tangled, using 10 million bobby pins, or using a scrunchie that flattens your hair and leaves a dent.  </li>
            <li> The Spin Pins are made of metal so they will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen videos with ppl with shagged, layered and shorter hair that worked very well with the Spin Pins.</li>
            <li> Only \\&quot;value for price paid\\&quot; would get 5* from me because I purchased the complete Bundle Pack from Walmart for onl</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair, and most clips just give up and cry when I try to use them to put my hair up.</li>
            <li> I also have fairly thin hair that slips out of most anything.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that they don&#x27;t leave behind lines in your hair the way that hair ties would.</li>
            <li> It just takes a little bit of practice to get the pins in just the right place to not let pieces hanging out</li>
            <li> (Just a little less stylish, of course.)</li>
            <li> for me it is worth the money to finally have something that works with my hair and keeps it up without getting weighed down.</li>
            <li> It helped that I had read the reviews first, and watched the You Tube videos, but it literally took 30 seconds to do, and lasted hours, until I chose to take it down.</li>
            <li> I braid my hair first, then fold the braid in half or thirds to create a \\&quot;bun\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Then I hold it with one hand while I spin the two pins in, one pretty close to the end of my hair, and the other one about opposite.  </li>
            <li> and it really does hold all day (even if my hair is wet when I put it up)!  </li>
            <li> They hold my hair securely, and don&#x27;t budge unless I do some serious head-banging.</li>
            <li> Its a bit more suttle and not so noticeably dramatic like your hiding a bee hive under there.</li>
            <li> I have hair that is pretty long, so I have never really tried it.</li>
            <li> They work very well with my hair, not too thick and not too much.  </li>
            <li> These little pins really do work!</li>
            <li> But I tried to just put it up a little higher, and that solves the problem of the \\&quot;fly-away\\&quot; hairs that don&#x27;t want to stay in place.</li>
            <li> So easy to put into your bun and keeps my hair up all day long without pulling so hard</li>
            <li> I was at work yesterday and a woman had these in, and took them out for a sec, and I asked her about them, and she highly recomended them.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re small and easily lost if you aren&#x27;t careful</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter if you get light or dark, they&#x27;re hidden inside your hair, plus eventually the paint wears off the tips anyway.</li>
            <li> It still stays tight and *most* of the hair stays in the bun, however I do have to use one bobby pin sometimes to tame a big flyaway..or whatever you call it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been pleased enough with the results to wear it this way in public, but I did an easy French twist...gathered my hair fairly high, twisted it, then folded it down twice and pulled the hair from the left to the right over the twisted hair.</li>
            <li> First use only took 5 seconds and my hair stayed until I took it down!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously tried the Goody Modern Updo (which is like a combo of a hair styling stick and a gigantic bobby pin)</li>
            <li> It may be because I have some layers in my \\&quot;just above bra strap\\&quot; hair, but I have to aid them with other pins to get a decent look.</li>
            <li> I have a LOT of thick, long (middle of my back) hair and spend lots of money on clips and pins, barrettes, ties that aren&#x27;t strong enough to hold all my hair...............</li>
            <li> My hair is not really long enough to go into a bun, but these things hold it up!</li>
            <li> too many lumps here, strands missing here and there, not to mention my hair is very thick, straight and long.</li>
            <li> I have waist-length, very fine, very thin hair.</li>
            <li> i think the looks you can create from these are super sexy, but almost impossible to get from any other hair accessory.</li>
            <li> It was such a mess to get this out because it had widened so much it wouldn&#x27;t spin.  </li>
            <li> These little corkscrews really did hold my bun all freakin day, AND my head didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> seems steep to me; I saw them in the store months ago but just couldn&#x27;t make myself spend that much on these little things.  </li>
            <li> I thought these were a little gimmicky, but cheap enough to try and give away if they didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually wear 4 because I have long and thick hair, and like to keep several handy for when I need them (in the car, at home etc).</li>
            <li> I have long, thick curly hair, which I wear down most of the time.  </li>
            <li> I will try again eventually, but the spin pin failure and its result is too fresh in my mind.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, down to the middle of my back, but it is so fine that I can barely make a ponytail holder stay in without tying it so tight I pull out hairs when I take my hair down, and don&#x27;t even get me started on barrettes and bobby pins.</li>
            <li> if you have very fine AND very thin hair, even if it&#x27;s long, this may not work for you.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair, and it doesn&#x27;t get greasy very fast, but it does look slept on, even when I put it back into a pony tail, and I haven&#x27;t found a way to put my hair up into a bun on a non-wash day that looks good....until now!</li>
            <li> Recently, I have noticed a permanant bump in my hair at the crown that not even a flat iron could get rid of.</li>
            <li> they say \\&quot;don&#x27;t cross the beams\\&quot;)  Flattening the bun doesn&#x27;t give you a flat look</li>
            <li> simply because I have thick hair down to my bra strap, and the bun looks like a huge tribble.</li>
            <li> They hold up my long, thick hair without a problem -- something that is rarely achieved.  </li>
            <li> Loose or tight, full or half bun or twist, these WORK.</li>
            <li> Its just past shoulder length and its all one length (I&#x27;ve also had layers my whole life</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a throw-my-hair-up-and-go-go-go kinda girl and this product makes me life that much easier.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> flat against your head</li>
            <li> I either put some mousse in it and scrunch or take the flat iron to it.  </li>
            <li> I can hold a bun of LONG hair with only two pins.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly either losing my ponytails or they get stretched out to the point where I can&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> No perm, color, hair dryer, curling iron or flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I was a little reluctant to spend 8 bucks on two little pins but it was totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Also, since it is not a clip type pins, you can leave your upper part of the bun naturally while you hold your hair bun tightly.</li>
            <li> I mean I have so much hair that hair stylists sigh when I enter the salon!</li>
            <li> Now, for only $6, I can do one myself, AND IT WILL HOLD ALL DAY LONG!  </li>
            <li> I was expecting them to be difficult to twist into place but they glide so easily without any struggle or breaking my hair.</li>
            <li> I personally like to still use a rubber band and then create a bun and twist those in around the loose hanging hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it doesn&#x27;t work as well in shorter hair, very thin hair or hair with extreme layers, but it does work on most hair types if your hair is long enough to wrap.  </li>
            <li> Twist one section and use one spin pin to hold in place and then twist the second section to wrap around the other bun and use the second spin pin to hold in place.</li>
            <li> It makes for a kind of ugly look, with these brown metal things sticking 1-2cm up through your hair.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair, and these are for blonde hair, even though the description says \\&quot;blonde or brunette\\&quot; and the picture shows the brunette version.</li>
            <li> Which says ALOT when your dealing with long hair.</li>
            <li> I have long wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> The only time I seem to have any luck is when my hair&#x27;s wet,but that&#x27;s not really a surprise.  </li>
            <li> I actually bought 2 sets and have occasionally used 3 pins at a time, but I have to think the 3rd pin is only necessary for people with really long and/or really thick hair.      </li>
            <li> Within 10 seconds, I can have my hair up in a bun that will hold all day long, through all kinds of activities.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair so if it works for me it will work.</li>
            <li> I wash it, comb it, pull it back and twist it while its wet and it stays up all day.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and stick these in at the end when I&#x27;m making a sock bun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not talking about shoulder-length hair long, but close to the waist long.</li>
            <li> Also, this creates a natural bun without a gimmicky look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> even long hair if it is tapered.</li>
            <li> my butt long).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Added bonus, in a headful of long hair NOT ONCE  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are smaller than I expected (about 3 inches) and made of metal.</li>
            <li> have long hair that is a bit thick, but very slippery</li>
            <li> I have also tried some new &#x27;dos that I was never able to get to stay in place with just bobby pins.  </li>
            <li> The only other item that has ever worked were contour clips that still managed to slip out after being in for a while.</li>
            <li> but you definitely need both to create the bun, so be careful!</li>
            <li> If your hair is layered it is a little bit more difficult but you can still do it.  </li>
            <li> This is for my course and slightly wavy, very heavy mid-back length hair, the long, slick and extremely heavy hair of my daughter&#x27;s friend, and the hugest bun of long, heavy, straight hair I&#x27;ve ever seen - just 1 pin feels quite secure, though I&#x27;d recommend 2 for those with tons of hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very long (mid-back),</li>
            <li> I have very long, wavy hair</li>
            <li> I work with children so I am into just throwing my hair up in a bun because my ponytail is very long.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s dry now</li>
            <li> a few stray strands escape simply because my hair is short.</li>
            <li> It helps anchor long hair in several places so that the weight is evenly distributed and the hair does not pull down on one spot of your head all day.</li>
            <li> every single day*</li>
            <li> twist your hair however you like and twist a single pin into each side of your bun or whatever.</li>
            <li> It is really tight and though it was hard to use at first</li>
            <li> I have thick, straight hair that is down to my hips, so I was a little skeptical that these would be able to hold my hair up.</li>
            <li> With such thick hair, there is no other hair accessory that could do what spin pins do for me!</li>
            <li> you make a mistake and put it in the wrong area its much easier to fix than regular pins because you can just &#x27;unscrew&#x27; it (it wont pull your hair out of place like a regular pin</li>
            <li> and I know it won&#x27;t come loose.     </li>
            <li> and I can just spin one of these into a loose bun</li>
            <li> even after having them in for hours they don&#x27;t leave any bends or marks in your hair so you can always put it back down.</li>
            <li> I can just dry my hair, put these styling pins in it and go!  </li>
            <li> Switch hands, screw the 2nd one in from the other side, still pressing the bun with your other hand.  </li>
            <li> Maybe with 50 bobby pins, a hairnet, and half a bottle of aqua net.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my eye on spin pins since I first saw them at my local Target, but didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returns when they inevitably failed to revolutionize my hair routine.</li>
            <li> I have long thin straight hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick, very curly, very long hair.</li>
            <li> This is my first review of anything; I have extremely long (7 in past shoulder) thick wavy/coarse/curly hair, almost ethnic in texture-</li>
            <li> My first few tries were messy and not secure at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely clueless when it comes to hair styling, but this little stuff twists my hair up, with some messy loose ends that wowed my friend.  </li>
            <li> No tugging, no unwinding hair, just back the little pin out</li>
            <li> but the little red package from China was not even close to what was portrayed on line.  </li>
            <li> they work for a tight bun, a messy bun, a French twist, or even for pulling back just the front of your hair.  </li>
            <li> Having very long hair I look for ways to contain it when I&#x27;m active and the hair is just in the wayl&lt;br /&gt;Unbelievable these simple little spin pins eliminate the hassle of putting up your hair.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty long (mid-back) and very, very thick and heavy.</li>
            <li> Oh well, my bad for not reading more carefully.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve found many products won&#x27;t work in my hair, but I was honestly shocked when I tried the spin pin.  </li>
            <li> They have come out with so many useless items lately for hair that I waited forever to try this one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to having to wear at least two ponytail holders at a time and even then they only last for a bit before the elastic breaks and gives up.  </li>
            <li> When I&#x27;ve been in weddings, the stylist managed to put it up using 30+ hair pins and lots of product and the updo would be slipping halfway through the reception.  </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m not much of a hair styler.</li>
            <li> Imagine my frustration as I had to carefully untangle my hair from around this thing.</li>
            <li> If you had thinner hair, that might be harder.  </li>
            <li> These are going to replace my regular everyday hairbands.</li>
            <li> They work well for me even though my hair is baby-fine and partially layered.</li>
            <li> The instructions say that you should be careful not to intersect the pins when you twist them in.</li>
            <li> Now, I put my hair up wet</li>
            <li> and I was devastated when the place I bought them from had closed and no one else had them.</li>
            <li> Please be careful to always follow the recommendation of the manufacturers.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t yet tried it on wet hair</li>
            <li> I get tons of compliments on my double buns every time I do my hair that way, even when they are messy and not straight.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair and since these are bigger than bobby pins</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried - sitting in a drawer, unused, because it was too complicated or just didn&#x27;t work right with my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long (middle of my back), curly hair.</li>
            <li> The other one I will have going from the bottom, through the center of the bun.  </li>
            <li> These two pins actually hold my thick hair in place all day long.  </li>
            <li> So when I saw the model on the commercial with her long flowing thick tresses, I thought, well of course it holds in her hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick long slippery Asian Hair with lots of layers.</li>
            <li> In other words, use it to anchor the stray hair at the end.</li>
            <li> Afterall, I usually wear my hair in a bun daily.  </li>
            <li> Making a bun with a ponytail holder and traditional bobby pins takes some time, and usually starts falling out within a couple hours.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve convinced 7 other people to purchase the spin pin, just by demonstrating how it works.  </li>
            <li> I pulled my hair back in a pony tail, twisted it around,wrapped the hair in a bun(like when using hair sticks) and twisted one in the top and one in the bottom.</li>
            <li> I am still not sure how this tiny spring-looking thing does it, but IT DOES!!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I need a couple of extra bobby pins, but not many.  </li>
            <li> No more damaged hair from ponytail bands and constant adjustment/fixing.</li>
            <li> Usually the ultimate skeptic when it comes to styling gadgets, but these things work!</li>
            <li> and then due to the weight of my hair.</li>
            <li> Its not too tight on my scalp (like pony-tails) and its not too loose to where I have to re-do my bun every hour or 2...</li>
            <li> I have really thick, long hair - to my bra band long.</li>
            <li> Then after more months of a sloppy bun poorly held together with a clip that I would have to re-adjust every few hours, I decided to break down and purchase the Swivel Pins......</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair down to my mid back.</li>
            <li> I have thick black hair and these little guys actually keep my hair up in a bun for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have very thick natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical because they really don&#x27;t look like they would work.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too messy for me; sadly, that is exactly what I ended up with when using 2 Spin Pins.</li>
            <li> It did take a few tries to get the hang of tucking the ends under</li>
            <li> It took me a few tries but I conquered the process of the spin and I will say, it works.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and my hair and head hurt when I pull my hair up or back because of the weight of my hair.</li>
            <li> It might take a few tries to get the hang of it</li>
            <li> (she has blonde thick hair that goes down to her waist-</li>
            <li> so my hair&#x27;s always down.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> After it&#x27;s up, it stays up until I take it down, and these pins don&#x27;t show at all in my hair.</li>
            <li> They hold the hair until I take it down.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll have this down in no time.</li>
            <li> My hair was either down or in a bun held by an octopus clip.</li>
            <li> I keep some in my purse so that if I&#x27;m out with my hair down</li>
            <li> the possibilities are endless!</li>
            <li> I have long hair, but maybe not thick enough and the end of pins usually sticking out of the other side of the bun, but it&#x27;s not too bad</li>
            <li> I have hair of medium thickness, I have been told by friends with very thick hair that they are unable to secure their hair as they do for me.</li>
            <li> i use the small ones for either one small bun with just the front of my hair pulled up on the crown of my head with the rest of it hanging down and some pieces sticking out of the bun, or sometimes i would make two small bun/pigtails in the back that were loose.</li>
            <li> My hair is 2/3 down my back, thick, and heavy</li>
            <li> I am not a woman equipt with even a quarter of the basic hair styling skills that the average small child has, but somehow this silly little spiral has managed to turn someone like me into a budding hairstylist.</li>
            <li> It takes less than a minute to put your hair up and it stays up.  </li>
            <li> However, Amazon is listing these at $10, and you can get them for half that Walgreens or Walmart.</li>
            <li> The pins are invisible so they don&#x27;t look tacky like my previous butterfly clips.</li>
            <li> It take less than a minute to get a polish look.  </li>
            <li> It takes about a minute and a half.  </li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is close to half the price.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t &amp;#34;inch&amp;#34; their way out of the bun and are well hidden.</li>
            <li> I bought these on a whim at Target for about half the price.</li>
            <li> It was half the size as was listed.  </li>
            <li> This way, the bun stays tight to your head rather than falling down.    </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s curly, thick, and long (down to  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear regular hair ties-they slowly fall out no matter how tight I make them, even if I wear 2!</li>
            <li> That was a disappointment so I almost returned both, but I decided to try the pins first.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that I wear in a bun.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair (almost waist length), LOTS of it, and its extremely thick.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> They screw in and hold your hair tightly.</li>
            <li> So I bought these at walmart - put them in, and my hair stayed in a tight bun, all day, and all day today.</li>
            <li> Either way, 3 hours later...and the bun is still tight and in tact despite walking around and working.</li>
            <li> I have long thick heavy hair and for years would torture myself with tight pins and bunches of rubber bands to get it to stay  up.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY LONG THICK HAIR AND THE TWO SPIN PINS</li>
            <li> My hair is very, very long and thick</li>
            <li> I did half of it in a bun a few times, but it took forever to get it up with a few ponytail holders and a half a pack of bobby pins.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m forming the bun wrong, but I&#x27;m thinking/hoping it&#x27;s just because I have so much hair</li>
            <li> even if they stick out a little, they&#x27;re not conspicuous.  </li>
            <li> person could even put some sort of sparkly doohickey on the looped end for a little dress up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However when it was curled and a little \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; it kept my hair up.  </li>
            <li> My issue is that apparently my hair is too thin (though for reference, my ponytail is approximately the same circumference of a quarter) and the ends of the pins stick out from the bun.</li>
            <li> I spray with a little hairspray, and it stays in all day.  </li>
            <li> I do think they are a little pricey for what they are - two pieces of scrap metal.</li>
            <li> For those a little challenged like myself, it may take some practice.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to add that little tip in case anyone was making that mistake.</li>
            <li> Truly; it took me years to figure out how to put a little \\&quot;bump\\&quot; in my hair</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, and up until now, I&#x27;ve always just pulled it back into a ponytail for casual days and cardio workouts.  </li>
            <li> I can easily create a messy bun without the pony tail holder (which always shows and I hate that).  </li>
            <li> A few times when I have used it I interlocked the pins-</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t rely on them for heavy duty activities or even all-day wear.  </li>
            <li> I have mid back length, curly, thick difficult to manage hair.</li>
            <li> The packaging warms not to tangle the pins together, but I haven&#x27;t found it difficult to avoid doing so even placing them perpendicularly, because I have thick enough hair that I can just place them on different planes.  </li>
            <li> A messy bun is my go-to hairstyle on the weekends.  </li>
            <li> I watched a few videos on you tube about how to put them in and that took all of the guess work out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  I&#x27;ve been using these for a few months now and still like them.  </li>
            <li> It does give the messy bun look and hairs will stick out</li>
            <li> Purchased this item a few days ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used  them everyday since I then.</li>
            <li> It took me a few hours to master putting the pins in my hair, but that&#x27;s a testament to me and not the product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any trouble taking them out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m alright with a messy bun if it looks relaxed</li>
            <li> Just practice a few times and you&#x27;ll get it.  </li>
            <li> It creates a messy bun.  </li>
            <li> I do recommend that if you have really thin hair, you go with the smaller ones-</li>
            <li> Was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for something to hold my thick/heavy hair in a bun, and this does not fit the bill.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known about this prodcut when I was heavy into the theater and had to put my hair in buns or updos....</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll still have a few fly-aways, but the majority will be in the bun.)</li>
            <li> my hair is too heavy.</li>
            <li> Messy look</li>
            <li> and I imagine put less strain on your hair than any hairtie!</li>
            <li> Also, one other note, it&#x27;s really hard not to lose one of these</li>
            <li> Lately I hate the feeling of my hair on my neck, so I have been sticking it on top of my head in a ridiculous looking doubled over ponytail.</li>
            <li> I have about shoulder length hair that is fairly stiff</li>
            <li> I am so sick of spending $8, $10, $15 on hair accessories that aren&#x27;t right for my hair and can&#x27;t be returned.</li>
            <li> They are not easy to find in stores.</li>
            <li> When these arrived, I thought they were a little small.</li>
            <li> These are slick little things and they don&#x27;t hurt or pull/break your hair out when you take them out, nor can you see them once in.  </li>
            <li> I have a very hard time doing anything with my hair other than wearing it down because everything slips out.</li>
            <li> I have long (to my bra strap) very thick and slippery (its stick-straight and untreated, so almost no texture) hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, long wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long, very thick hair and the spin pins</li>
            <li> Actually, I got the wrong color anyways when I ordered them from here, but they were always hidden in my hair so even that wasn&#x27;t a problem.    </li>
            <li> My daily routine is usually a ponytail or a sloppy bun that I have to re adjust 4 or 5 times a day.  </li>
            <li> You can create your &#x27;bun&#x27; in a tight ballerina style or in a looser version, both hold up well!  </li>
            <li> They have stayed in and my bun has stayed tight to my head!  </li>
            <li> I usually always have trouble with putting my hair in a bun because of the thickness and length, but I tried these out</li>
            <li> I have thick curly/wavy hair that goes down to my waist.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair down to my waist.</li>
            <li> I have very long thin hair</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim figuring it would fall into the long line of random hair dohickies that don&#x27;t work with my hair, or at least don&#x27;t work with me, but for once my $5 were well spent.    </li>
            <li> With very little effort.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really that bad at being a girl.  </li>
            <li> I have hair past my shoulders</li>
            <li> It just seemed expensive ENOUGH to keep putting off.</li>
            <li> I had found a solution when I learned the proper way to use hairsticks, but they were not perfect:  the bottom ends of the sticks poked me in the neck</li>
            <li> I must have walked past these in the hair aisle dozens of times, having no idea</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t pull on my hair and give me a headache as is usually the case when I have my hair up.</li>
            <li> I had much higher hopes for this product, but was sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Search no more, just buy this.  </li>
            <li> no snagged hairs and no more bobby pins digging into my scalp.</li>
            <li> No more headaches.</li>
            <li> and I usually just give up.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, heavy hair that is mid-back length.</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened</li>
            <li> Well, after a very frustrating 30 minutes of spinning them in and out, I finally got it to work!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding barrettes, clips etc that will work in my thick and heavy hair.  </li>
            <li> and I think its mainly because I have bangs and some shorter layers from a bad haircut that slip out and bug me.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not very good at styling my hair.  </li>
            <li> Spin pins are basically long bobby pins twisted into a spiral shape that looks a lot like rotini pasta.</li>
            <li> thick hair and getting it up into a bun is usually too time-consuming for my morning routine.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical on this item as I was unsure of how it would hold my long, thick hair...</li>
            <li> I thought it would be hard to twist it in since I have just thick hair</li>
            <li> My one complaint would be that, after lots of use, the finish starts to come off.</li>
            <li> My one issue: the description for this product is a bit confusing.</li>
            <li> since sally&#x27;s sucks.</li>
            <li> I always have at least three on hand.  </li>
            <li> I have quite thick, hip-length hair and use four pins to hold it all up, BUT it stays.</li>
            <li> I have thick frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> UNBELIEVABLE!</li>
            <li> When I mean a lot</li>
            <li> I bought this imagining it would become like all of the other offbeat hair clips and accessories</li>
            <li> no more pulling out 100 bobby pins every night!</li>
            <li> I mean a lot of hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair just past my shoulders - it usually takes about 20 bobby pins to hold a bun in my hair, until now!</li>
            <li> Its seriously the coolest thing ever.i&#x27;m getting the chignon maker too.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of Asian slippery hair which is impossible to just anything up.</li>
            <li> but these actually work and aren&#x27;t painful.</li>
            <li> so i brought the sally&#x27;s verison and the wires are not good</li>
            <li> I was dead wrong</li>
            <li> I got frustrated this afternoon when I tried them in the low bun</li>
            <li> I get frustrated putting my hair in a simple pony tail!</li>
            <li> I am completely incompetent when it comes to styling my hair.  </li>
            <li> I am a complete hair-do idiot.  </li>
            <li> For the price of these you can&#x27;t go wrong - if you have trouble putting your hair up, try this!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to see that I did not receive the blonde set and the box indicates.</li>
            <li> I have had very thick hair since I was a child, and now its thinning out because I&#x27;m on the pill (change of hormones)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very slowly</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and can never get it to stay put when I tried to put it in a bun.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly/kinky hair that shrinks to about shoulder length when it dries.  </li>
            <li> but my hair is very thick.  </li>
            <li> Got these to use on daughter who has very thick virgin hair for updo for prom.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> *  If you have very thick hair, you may need to get two sets</li>
            <li> I bought them thinking that it would be a rip-off</li>
            <li> I know, why buy something you think will be a rip-off).</li>
            <li> (I have brunette thin hair almost to my bra strap).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m tired of the fuss).</li>
            <li> I have thin, baby-fine hair,</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and nothing holds.</li>
            <li> When it gets annoying at work, I&#x27;ll throw my hair up in a second with the spin pins.  </li>
            <li> I have thin, shoulder-length hair.</li>
            <li> and I looked sloppy.</li>
            <li> No more thousands of bobby pins and ugly doorknob hair from hairbands.</li>
            <li> I was also a little nervous because I&#x27;m a moron when it comes to hair styling and hair products</li>
            <li> I hate it when you want to rate a product using the stars and or just a few words.</li>
            <li> This product is way too expensive.</li>
            <li> Well, internet, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Might become an expensive habit.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t completely useless to me, cuz I&#x27;m growing my hair out</li>
            <li> I am terrible at styling my hair and these are so simple to use.</li>
            <li> I was just giving them a random chance, since pins almost never work in my hair.</li>
            <li> I got mine at Walmart for $5 and that&#x27;s too expensive to be replacing all the time.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, to this day, I still struggle in the morning before I go to work</li>
            <li> If I can get it to work then even at $15 (which sounds absurd to me; I don&#x27;t spend a ton on beauty products and always get stuff on sale)</li>
            <li> I use it when my hair is when and make two buns on either side of my head with my hair twisted.</li>
            <li> Crazy thing, I got it out and tried to reshape it, and that wasn&#x27;t going to happen.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Spin Pin in my desperate search for something to get my hair off my neck in this summer heat.</li>
            <li> , I really hated having really insanely thick hair, but my hair is medium/thick.</li>
            <li> I would purchase another pair or 2 if they weren&#x27;t so expensive!     </li>
            <li> and then it just looked idiotic.</li>
            <li> and I was extremely disappointed</li>
            <li> but i hate bobby pins</li>
            <li> Awful!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought these on 6/7/10 and used them immediately.  I have a LOT of thick, long (middle of my back) hair and spend lots of money on clips and pins, barrettes, ties that aren&#x27;t strong enough to hold all my hair...............these pins are AMAZING.  It takes less than a minute to put your hair up and it stays up.  With summer and the humid weather here I am so glad I can get all my hair up and off my neck and not worry about it ALL day.  If you can find them, buy them.  I never heard of them and I was in CVS and there was one pair left, so I figured it was different than anything I&#x27;ve seen, and I&#x27;m so glad I bought them.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these!!!</li>
            <li> I bought 3 packs of 2 at Walgreen for $15. Therefore, 6 for $15 not 2 for $15 from this retailer. That being said, these pins are great. I have very thick, long (middle of my back), curly hair. 2 work pretty well for hanging around the house and taking it easy. I use 4 when going to the pool or out running around, which includes working out. I may stock up next time I go out that way I never run out.</li>
            <li> These really are amazing. I bought them thinking that it would be a rip-off (yeah, I know, why buy something you think will be a rip-off). But, I am amazed how well they work. They screw in and hold your hair tightly. Great idea.</li>
            <li> I saw a youtube video about this product and had to have it. It works GREAT with my waist long thick hair, even if I sleep with them in at night. You simple twist your hair into a bun and then screw the spin pins in, it even works well with just one pin. Which says ALOT when your dealing with long hair. The Spin Pins are made of metal so they will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen videos with ppl with shagged, layered and shorter hair that worked very well with the Spin Pins. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this exceptional product. And YES, I have stock piled on them..... color of product doesn&#x27;t matter, there not seen. At 5.99, their a steal.</li>
            <li> This had such great reviews I had to try it. Most of the quick and easy hair products are really meant for medium length hair. This is also a product for those of us with longer hair and can be as quick as putting hair in a pony tail.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but this product deserves a rave!  It does exactly what it says it will do. My hair is just past my shoulders, and very fine. I love wearing my hair in a bun, but my past attempts at buns have been time-consuming, with mixed results. This product works! It helped that I had read the reviews first, and watched the You Tube videos, but it literally took 30 seconds to do, and lasted hours, until I chose to take it down. One tip. Insert the first pin where your hair ends. In other words, use it to anchor the stray hair at the end. Now for the exciting part...I experimented with this, because I love the French Twist look. I&#x27;ve never been pleased enough with the results to wear it this way in public, but I did an easy French twist...gathered my hair fairly high, twisted it, then folded it down twice and pulled the hair from the left to the right over the twisted hair. Then I put the spin pins in at the top and the bottom. And it looks gorgeous! So happy to have found this before the hot summer weather. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I work out every day and I wear my hair in a ponytail almost all the time. Recently, I have noticed a permanant bump in my hair at the crown that not even a flat iron could get rid of. Also, I have a bit of breakage from the constant elastic in my hair. I was looking for an alternative to the ponytail and realized I am completely inept when it comes to fixing my hair. Then I saw the spin pin. I bought it tody and did it on my first try. My hair is just below my shoulders with layers. Some of the front doesn&#x27;t go in but I put them in a simple braid and clipped it at the side. The bun doesn&#x27;t even move through a workout. I was very happy with the results. For those of you who don&#x27;t see how they could work check out youtube videos. It is literally sooooo simple. I am going to buy more for my daughters who have long hair and are constantly looking for cute ways to put it up.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair, and most clips just give up and cry when I try to use them to put my hair up. Claw clips can&#x27;t even get around my hair. These spin pins, though, are like magic. They hold my hair securely, and don&#x27;t budge unless I do some serious head-banging. I can throw my hair up in a bun straight out of the shower, and I&#x27;m good for the whole day. I LOVE that.     My one complaint would be that, after lots of use, the finish starts to come off. It just rubs off after a while, I guess. But really, the pins are very well hidden in your hair, so no one sees them. It&#x27;s not a big problem, just a thing I noticed. Actually, I got the wrong color anyways when I ordered them from here, but they were always hidden in my hair so even that wasn&#x27;t a problem.    I will also note that it does take a bit of practice to get the hang of using these pins. My first few tries were messy and not secure at all. Once I got the hang of it, though, it was smooth sailing. I lost my original pair, and I miss them very much. I&#x27;m buying some more today, because I can&#x27;t do without them anymore.    I would also note that you can find these at retailers for cheaper. I&#x27;m buying my replacement set at Walgreens tonight, for $6 and no shipping.</li>
            <li> These hair pins are easy to use. I love them for a messy bun. I hate it when you want to rate a product using the stars and or just a few words.</li>
            <li> Ever since I saw the commerical I have been looking for these and FINALLY after 4-5 weeks of looking I found ONE (I have brunette thin hair almost to my bra strap). A week later I found ONE for my mom (she has blonde thick hair that goes down to her waist-she had no problem with it staying in)! I literally was lucky in each case of finding them because they are sold out EVERYWHERE near me! My mom and I are on the look out for another set for each of us-we&#x27;ve been looking for a week now!    They come in 2 colors:Brunette and Blonde    I was under the impression that you only used one of the pins-you actually use both! A few times when I have used it I interlocked the pins-but my mom was quick to tell me that it says in bold not to do so, so I won&#x27;t be doing that again! I&#x27;m assuming its because you would have a chance of tangling them together and not getting them apart?    I have been wearing mine every day-I love being able to get out of bed and when I go running in the morning pull them out as I&#x27;m walking out the door to put up my hair. I can&#x27;t wear regular hair ties-they slowly fall out no matter how tight I make them, even if I wear 2! I probably have to fix them 1-2 a day when I wear them which isn&#x27;t a big deal and I think its mainly because I have bangs and some shorter layers from a bad haircut that slip out and bug me.     LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE THINGS! I will be picking up a few more packs when I can find them!</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome. They have come out with so many useless items lately for hair that I waited forever to try this one but it is so amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use --spin in, spin out&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t pull your hair&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t hurt&lt;br /&gt;If you make a mistake and put it in the wrong area its much easier to fix than regular pins because you can just &#x27;unscrew&#x27; it (it wont pull your hair out of place like a regular pin would.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sigh, I would give it more stars if I could. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I have long (to my bra strap) very thick and slippery (its stick-straight and untreated, so almost no texture) hair.  I have NEVER been able to put it up myself in anything but a pony tail.  When I&#x27;ve been in weddings, the stylist managed to put it up using 30+ hair pins and lots of product and the updo would be slipping halfway through the reception.  I used these spin pins yesterday for my bun and they work GREAT.  I kept them in for 8+ hours and my bun was still standing.  I even slept in my bun and the bun was still there and reasonable in the morning.  I am an absolute klutz when it comes to hair, but these were super-easy to use and very effective.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they do it, but they are great! My hair is not really long enough to go into a bun, but these things hold it up! I think they are great.  Expensive, but great!!!</li>
            <li> These two little spin pins are the most amazing things that have ever happened to hair since the hair iron. I have relatively fine hair, shoulder length and i&#x27;m not much of a hair styler. I always love the idea of chignon&#x27;s or fancy buns but I never know how to do them or make them stay. Since my hair breaks easily, I&#x27;ve been trying to stay away from putting my hair in elastics but i hate bobby pins so my hair&#x27;s always down. these things can hold a bun for hours and i even wear them to the gym and they stay very well. even after having them in for hours they don&#x27;t leave any bends or marks in your hair so you can always put it back down. i&#x27;m truly in love. great product goody!</li>
            <li> Really useful and more effective than bobby pins. I just twist my hair into a bun, with my hair either straightened or curly, and the two pins hold everything in place. I&#x27;m in love with these!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this product and thought I should give it a chance.  Afterall, I usually wear my hair in a bun daily.  I have long wavy hair.  So my first concern was that the spin pin was going to get tangled, especially when trying to remove it from my hair.  It didn&#x27;t get tangled and it is very easy to use, and comfortable.  My bun stayed in place with just two spin pins.  You should place one at the top of the bun and a spin pin at the bottom.  Just be careful not to interlock them in your hair, as the package direction states, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Let me just say that first off, I&#x27;m not exactly a highly skilled hair person.  My daily routine is usually a ponytail or a sloppy bun that I have to re adjust 4 or 5 times a day.  I also have fairly thin hair that slips out of most anything.  Now I wouldn&#x27;t purchase these for the $15 they have listed here but honestly these spin pins are definitely worth the $6 you pay anywhere else.  They are FANTASTIC.  My hair feels secure, no slippage! They are great!! I definitely recommend them!</li>
            <li> Just bought this today and love it!  I&#x27;ve previously tried the Goody Modern Updo (which is like a combo of a hair styling stick and a gigantic bobby pin) so I was eager to try this product.  I have hair past my shoulders and I&#x27;m a lawyer so I need to keep my hair neat and professional looking.  This product takes only a minute to put in, looks professional, and will stay in all day!  Much better than using a hundred bobby pins and more sophisticated than just using a rubber band.  No need to mess with hot rollers, straight irons, or curling irons this summer!  I can just dry my hair, put these styling pins in it and go!  I&#x27;m sure if you use your imagination you can create many styles with them.</li>
            <li> I just picked up one of these at the drugstore on a whim and I am so glad I did! I have about shoulder length hair that is fairly stiff and I often wear it up. I don&#x27;t like the strain that hair elastics have on my scalp/hair so I thought this might be worth a try. They are VERY easy to use (there are clear directions) and they don&#x27;t tug on your hair. They are gentle and you can experiment with how you want to put the bun / chignon on your hair. They need a little bit of practice to see what looks best/works best on you, but it is very easy and flexible. I have a much more expensive hairpin that was meant for a similar purpose but these actually work and aren&#x27;t painful. You just turn the pin into your hair and they stay secure. They really work and they&#x27;re low commitment.</li>
            <li> The spin pin is amazing!  I have shoulder length curly hair (somewhere between 2b and 3a) and the Spin Pin is great for creating quick messy buns.  I love the messy bun I have been a huge fan of it since I discovered it a long time ago, and the Spin Pin allows you to make the messy buy without getting your hair tangled, using 10 million bobby pins, or using a scrunchie that flattens your hair and leaves a dent.  It does not get tangled in your hair.  You twist it in and twist it out (just don&#x27;t cross the 2 pins - I imagine that would get it tangled in your hair).  I definitely recommend this product.  You only need 2 to create a hairstyle, but I might even buy a backup set, just in case.</li>
            <li> This little spin pins are awesome.  They&#x27;re easy to use, hold my hair all day, and make it easy for me to create a good looking bun.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy mine from Amazon, I got them from Mal-mart, but I found them here first. At Wal-Mart these are right next to a puffy ponytail-er and a french twist thingy. I bought the puffy ponytail-er and this, and used the ponytail-er the same day. That was a disappointment so I almost returned both, but I decided to try the pins first. The pins actually work! I have had very thick hair since I was a child, and now its thinning out because I&#x27;m on the pill (change of hormones) and I dye it rather often. I like it being thinner, I really hated having really insanely thick hair, but my hair is medium/thick. Its just past shoulder length and its all one length (I&#x27;ve also had layers my whole life and I&#x27;m tired of the fuss). Anywho, these pins kept my hair in securely all day, normally if I put my hair in a ponytail I get a headache because the ponytail-er puts all the pressure and weight of all my hair on the outside strands, so a pony or bun is out of the question, but with this ting the weight is really well dispersed, I didn&#x27;t have a headache at all. I&#x27;m going to buy more of these in the same color because I can&#x27;t see them when they are in my hair, and I know I&#x27;ll lose them lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I actually bought another set and can now do double buns. I get tons of compliments on my double buns every time I do my hair that way, even when they are messy and not straight.</li>
            <li> Finally.  Someone out there invented the perfect hair fastener.  My hair doesn&#x27;t slide out and when I throw my head back in a tantrum at my desk I don&#x27;t have a clasp that hurts.</li>
            <li> The spin pin is nothing short of AWESOME.  I hesitated buying it for a while because it was always an after-thought and rather pricey; not that the price is alot of money in itself but for a hair pin? It just seemed expensive ENOUGH to keep putting off. Then after more months of a sloppy bun poorly held together with a clip that I would have to re-adjust every few hours, I decided to break down and purchase the Swivel Pins...... and all I can say is it was WELL WORTH EVERY CENT!!!  This pin holds my bun in place securely.  I put it in every morning during the work week and never have to worry about slippage or hair unraveling. Secure even if I whip my head from side to side.  Easy to use. Stylish to wear.  You won&#x27;t regret this purchase.  I strongly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note: they come two in a pack and I use both on a daily basis to give me the secure hold I need.</li>
            <li> These are actually pretty great, they hold extremely well and don&#x27;t pull or use too much tension. I have hip length, very fine hair, and these actually hold it in place without me having to fix it all day long. They take a little practice to use, but are completely worth it once you get the hang of it.     My one issue: the description for this product is a bit confusing. I have dark hair, and these are for blonde hair, even though the description says \\&quot;blonde or brunette\\&quot; and the picture shows the brunette version. Oh well, my bad for not reading more carefully. I am going to try and color them in some way to mach my hair, otherwise these are a great product and well worth the money. Would love to see them make some smaller ones for more versitile styles.</li>
            <li> My daughter gave me a set of Spin Pins and told me I was going to love them. I was skeptical because they really don&#x27;t look like they would work. I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, wavy hair that I wear up most of the time. I always used plastic clips or covered rubber bands, but they both have drawbacks. Rubber bands often gave me a headache and clips don&#x27;t hold as well. Spin pins are basically long bobby pins twisted into a spiral shape that looks a lot like rotini pasta. You simply twist them into your bun in a clockwise direction - one at the top and one at the bottom. To remove them, just twist them in a counter-clockwise direction. It&#x27;s that easy, and they hold better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before. My bun or french twist stays in place all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wear your hair up, you&#x27;ll definitely want to try these.</li>
            <li> Meh.  These are easy to use and I love the concept, but they don&#x27;t hold my hair well, even when I use more than one, and seem overpriced to me.  I like how they blend in but I can&#x27;t rely on them for heavy duty activities or even all-day wear.  I will keep and attempt to continue using the four I have, just won&#x27;t be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I love these little spiral pins. I have fine, straight, long hair (almost waist-length). Barrettes and traditional bobby pins always pull and break my hair. These spiral pins are the only thing that I have found that doesn&#x27;t damage my hair at all. I pull my hair into a ponytail and use these \\&quot;pins\\&quot; to put it up in a bun. They hold all day - even throughout vigorous workouts like running or working out with my kettlebells.     Note: The box says that you can use them with or without ponytail holders. I have found that using ponytail holders (to put your hair into a ponytail first) holds the style better. Also, I almost always use both of the spirals at the same time. One from the top (about 12:00 position), and one from a 5:00 position - especially when working out.     I love these so much, I have 3 sets (just in case I misplace one).</li>
            <li> I bought these about a week ago after hearing good things about them, and so far, my experience has only been so-so.   I&#x27;ve tried these things in an array of different positions and hairstyles,and yet not one time have I used them has all my hair managed to stay up. The only time I seem to have any luck is when my hair&#x27;s wet,but that&#x27;s not really a surprise.  Overall,they&#x27;re fun to play and experiment with,but I&#x27;ll definitely be sticking with my hairclip anytime I leave the house.</li>
            <li> I LOVE ALL TYPES OF HAIR PRODUCTS AND ITEMS AND THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE FOUND IN A WHILE - IT REALLY WORKS. I HAVE VERY LONG THICK HAIR AND THE TWO SPIN PINS TURN INTO MY HAIR EASILY WITH NO PROBLEM AND STAY ALL DAY - GREAT INVENTION!!!</li>
            <li> I have really thick, long hair - to my bra band long. I am a disaster with hair, especially since I have a lot of length - pretty much my hair is down or in a pony tail. I couldn&#x27;t find the spin pin in stores so I bought the simple styles pack through Goody which includes 2 spin pins, the updo pin, volume boost comb, and a pony pouf clip. The other items don&#x27;t work well with my hair because I have too much (the updo pin does ok.) But the spin pin - OH MY GOD!!    The spin pin made a nice bun easily AND it looked really good! Before, when I would make a bun with bobby pins, the pins would spread and then slip out. Or if I put enough in so they wouldn&#x27;t spread then I would need about 30+ and then it just looked idiotic. With the spin pin, I spin one up from the bottom and one down from the top, both at a slight angle. I tuck the ends under with ONE regular bobby pin and viola! And it is a nice tight bun, too. It feels very secure and I know it won&#x27;t come loose.     I pretty much plan to buy a whole bunch more if I happen to see them at Target or the drugstore because for me they are a must have.</li>
            <li> I waited a good, long time to write this review, to make sure I was really satisfied.  I truly am--I bought these pins a couple months ago, and I have used them *every single day* since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair that is a bit thick, but very slippery--it doesn&#x27;t have any kind of texture that enables it to grab onto itself, so it can be hard to put it up and make it stay.  Making a bun with a ponytail holder and traditional bobby pins takes some time, and usually starts falling out within a couple hours.  I had found a solution when I learned the proper way to use hairsticks, but they were not perfect:  the bottom ends of the sticks poked me in the neck, I was self-conscious about the tops looking like \\&quot;antennae,\\&quot; and lounging about at home would make the style fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Spin Pins solve all of my hairstyling problems.  There are no ends sticking out, so there is nothing to bother me or cause the hairstyle to slip.  They are just as quick and easy to use as hairsticks, and much quicker than a ponytail holder and bobby pins!  Most importantly, they really do hold the bun tightly--the resulting hairstyle can take me through work, exercise, the chiropractor, chasing pets, and doing housework, all while maintaining the same look I started the day with.  I don&#x27;t like to use any type of styling product on my hair, and with these, I don&#x27;t have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I wish Goody would work on with regard to this product is marketing!!  I must have walked past these in the hair aisle dozens of times, having no idea I was so near my hair-related Holy Grail--I heard no buzz about Spin Pins on the internet, either, even though I follow various online beauty communities.  The only reason I discovered these is because my sister happened to try them out, and mentioned how much she loved them.  I guess a really awesome product can rely on word of mouth?</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair\\&quot;.  \\&quot;No thanks, thanks to the Spin Pin\\&quot;!! :)   I wish I had invented the \\&quot;Spin Pin\\&quot;, this product is AMAZING!!  My hair is very, very long and thick so I&#x27;ve found many products won&#x27;t work in my hair, but I was honestly shocked when I tried the spin pin.  I&#x27;ve convinced 7 other people to purchase the spin pin, just by demonstrating how it works.  I&#x27;m finding myself even telling complete strangers about it on the street when I notice they too could benefit from the use of the spin pin.  I&#x27;ve found it doesn&#x27;t work as well in shorter hair, very thin hair or hair with extreme layers, but it does work on most hair types if your hair is long enough to wrap.  The next thing I&#x27;d like to see from Goody is a memorable commercial for the \\&quot;Spin Pin\\&quot; most people I&#x27;ve shared this item with had never even heard of it before... Goody you&#x27;re sitting on gold here, go out and really spread the news!  It would be nice to see a commercial with real people (on the streets) with all different hair types, lengths and styles trying out the spin pin for the first time.  Please get this item out there, before something similar comes along and steals your thunder!!  Excellent Product: 5+++++ Stars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with these pins from Goody.  Easy to put in, easy to take out, and pain-free!  They hold up my long, thick hair without a problem -- something that is rarely achieved.  The color was a decent match, so they more or less disappear in your hair.  I actually bought 2 sets and have occasionally used 3 pins at a time, but I have to think the 3rd pin is only necessary for people with really long and/or really thick hair.      You can create a more casual style with these or a more formal style -- just depends on how you curl the hair and where you place the bun. One tip that wasn&#x27;t in the instructions is to make sure you push them against your head a bit as you screw them into the bun.  This way, the bun stays tight to your head rather than falling down.    I&#x27;m loving these pins!</li>
            <li> Straight bobby pins cost about 5 cents each - these cost 5 DOLLARS? Because the metal is bent differently?   Someone is laughing... (price was $10.37 for a pair at time of posting)  Look on ebay for spiral hair pin - get them for 10 cents each.  Having said this, I have a pair that I bought for about $3 30 years ago.   Within 10 seconds, I can have my hair up in a bun that will hold all day long, through all kinds of activities.  I can do a bun on the top of my head and sleep in it. (During the recent 7 day power outage, I slept with my hair that way for 2 nights!! No running water, no shower...)  My method is to twist my hair, wind it into a bun, then...   Press the bun flat against your head (so the pin grabs plenty of it...). and screw the first one in.   Switch hands, screw the 2nd one in from the other side, still pressing the bun with your other hand.  I cross the pins in an \\&quot;x\\&quot;...(think it&#x27;s funny they say \\&quot;don&#x27;t cross the beams\\&quot;)  Flattening the bun doesn&#x27;t give you a flat look - but it does help the pins to grab as much hair as possible.  So - great, durable product, but please, folks at Goody - make a reasonable profit - charge fairly for 2 pieces of twisted metal!  This product is way too expensive.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly/wavy hair that goes down to my waist.  I&#x27;m used to having to wear at least two ponytail holders at a time and even then they only last for a bit before the elastic breaks and gives up.  I was in a wedding this summer and it took the stylist over 80 bobby pins to get my hair pinned up and I don&#x27;t even want to think about the amount of hairspray used! I got two of these and they were wonderful! Two weren&#x27;t enough for my hair though, but once I got four of them (the box says not to overlay them, but I do and it makes the bun nice and tight) my hair is up and out of my face ever since and never a nasty hair elastic dent in sight!</li>
            <li> UNBELIEVABLE! At almost 50 years of age I have finally found a hair accessory that works in thin, fine hair!! The only other item that has ever worked were contour clips that still managed to slip out after being in for a while. This spin pin is the most awesome invention! My hair is shoulder length, super thin, super fine and I have no problem getting these pins in, and they stay in! I&#x27;ve never been a girly girl when it comes to hair and I&#x27;m so inept at being able to style my hair. The best I&#x27;ve ever been able to do is a ponytail. This is a must have item!!! I plan to purchase several sets so they will be handy when I need them.</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair just past my shoulders - it usually takes about 20 bobby pins to hold a bun in my hair, until now! You can create your &#x27;bun&#x27; in a tight ballerina style or in a looser version, both hold up well!  It did take a few tries to get the hang of tucking the ends under so they don&#x27;t stick out everywhere but I did a great side swept bun last night for a formal event that everyone raved over!  I was amazed that it held up all night with only the two spin pins!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding barrettes, clips etc that will work in my thick and heavy hair.  I decided to try these.  They work.  I braid my hair first, then fold the braid in half or thirds to create a \\&quot;bun\\&quot;.  Then I attach the bun to my scalp with the spin pins.  As my hair got longer, I found that 3 or 4 spin pins really held it all day.  I can even sleep comfortably with these in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over time, just like bobby pins, the original color is wearing in spots.  I can use both the blonde and brunette pins as they completely disappear into my hair and are completely invisible.</li>
            <li> After trying the Goody \\&quot;Modern Updo Maker\\&quot; which I bought without discussing with my hairstylist, I was about ready to give up on Goody products. My hairstylist suggested the spin pins and I cannot believe how great these things work. They keep my hair in place, the hair is secure, and it doesn&#x27;t pull on my scalp like the Modern Updo maker. If you have long hair, and you like casual updos, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> These pins are absolutely fantastic!  I have very long (mid-back), thick hair and getting it up into a bun is usually too time-consuming for my morning routine.  Plus, it takes 20 to 30 bobby pins to keep it up there all day.    I tried these pins on a whim, and SO glad I did!  With just two of them, it takes me less than a minute to get my hair into a perfect bun that stays tight all day.      I&#x27;d highly recommend these to anyone (and I&#x27;m buying a few more myself!).</li>
            <li> I love these spin pins. I have very long thin hair and I can just spin one of these into a loose bun and my hair is up and staying there in about 30 seconds.They&#x27;re very pricey from Goody so I tried the much cheaper ones available from overseas. Something is different about them and they just don&#x27;t stay in. Maybe if you had thicker hair.</li>
            <li> So easy to put into your bun and keeps my hair up all day long without pulling so hard I have a headache by the end of the day. I have long, thick hair but it is very fine and slippery. Works like a charm! One of the best, if not the best, hair products I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I have mid back length, curly, thick difficult to manage hair. Plus I live in TX where it is very hot and humid a lot of the time. Lately I hate the feeling of my hair on my neck, so I have been sticking it on top of my head in a ridiculous looking doubled over ponytail. Awful!  I was at work yesterday and a woman had these in, and took them out for a sec, and I asked her about them, and she highly recomended them.  Of course I was still sceptical because nothing works in my hair, barretes pull, ponytailers slip and hurt, clips hurt. I did like those ez combs pretty well, but even they hurt after a while.  So I bought these at walmart - put them in, and my hair stayed in a tight bun, all day, and all day today. I was amazed. They are the best money I ever spent on my hair.  I put my bottom one in first, seems to hold better for me</li>
            <li> Had a client show these to me and I had to have them.  Received these in a timely fashion and in very good condition.  Great to use on any thickness hair and for any occasion.</li>
            <li> I have very thick natural hair.  The first time I used these, it pinned a bun securely while the hair was wet.  The two pins were surprisingly comfortable.  Felt no hair pull and I didn&#x27;t feel anything against my scalp like with bobby pins.  Hooray!&lt;br /&gt;A week later I attempted a french roll.  I didn&#x27;t even have all my hair up in it when...the pin bent out of shape!  Now it was stuck in the hair and it didn&#x27;t even hold the attempted style.  Imagine my frustration as I had to carefully untangle my hair from around this thing. I wasn&#x27;t even doing what the manufacturer warns against, which is crossing the pins (sounds like some Ghostbuster thing,  \\&quot;do not cross the streams!\\&quot; Anyways...) while fastening the hair with the spin pins.  Crazy thing, I got it out and tried to reshape it, and that wasn&#x27;t going to happen.  Where was that strength to keep its original shape!?!?!?&lt;br /&gt;After that experience, the spin pins are sitting on the bathroom counter.  Haven&#x27;t used them since then.  I will try again eventually, but the spin pin failure and its result is too fresh in my mind.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick curly hair, which I wear down most of the time.  I don&#x27;t look very good with a simple bun because my ears stick out, and I live in a hot climate so a ponytail just bugs the back of my neck.  So, I&#x27;ve been searching for an elegant way to gather my hair back that still shows the curls to de-emphasize my ears, but still keeps my hair off my neck.  These little double-helixes make it surprisingly easy to do exactly that.  I twist my hair up and around toward the top, insert my spin pins, and the gorgeous curls at the ends of my hair just hang out gloriously over the resulting bun!  My blonde-colored spin pins match my hair almost perfectly, so even if they stick out a little, they&#x27;re not conspicuous.  I&#x27;ve found that the best way to get a very secure bun is to place the two spin pins perpendicular to one another.  The packaging warms not to tangle the pins together, but I haven&#x27;t found it difficult to avoid doing so even placing them perpendicularly, because I have thick enough hair that I can just place them on different planes.  If you had thinner hair, that might be harder.  I did take away one star because at times, I do have a heck of a time getting the bun to feel as secure as I&#x27;d like, and ultimately, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ever quite as secure as with elastics.  Bottom line: I really like these, and will probably purchase more of them.</li>
            <li> I have no skills when it comes to fixing my hair.  I either put some mousse in it and scrunch or take the flat iron to it.  A messy bun is my go-to hairstyle on the weekends.  That being said, the spin pins are amazing!  I can easily create a messy bun without the pony tail holder (which always shows and I hate that).  These two pins actually hold my thick hair in place all day long.  If my hair is freshly shampooed I have to spray some product in it to give it some hold before putting these in.  I watched a few videos on you tube about how to put them in and that took all of the guess work out.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that is very fine and slick.  It tends to slip out of most hair clips, headbands, etc.  I&#x27;m also not very good at styling my hair.  I saw the commercial for this product and wanted to try it.  I found them at Wal-Mart after looking for several weeks.  The pins are very easy to put in and take out and they hold my hair securely in place for hours at a time.  Also, they are comfortable to wear and do not pull at my hair like a pony tail would, which gives me headaches.  The only down side is that I have layered hair, so I get lots of ends sticking out, which looks okay for casual wear but would not look good for a professional or formal situation.  I suspect, however, that a good application of hairspray might fix the problem.  I will also add that I have dark brunette hair and whenever the pins (brunette color) happen to stick out, they blend in fairly well with my hair.</li>
            <li> These work wonders! I highly recommend these to keep your hair secure in a comfortable bun. I have thin, baby-fine hair, the kind that bobby pins slip right out of, but these stay put. These are easy to insert, easy to remove, and hold a secure hairdo. I was expecting them to be difficult to twist into place but they glide so easily without any struggle or breaking my hair. I am very pleased! These are going to replace my regular everyday hairbands. A new staple!</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft and fine. Right now it&#x27;s shoulder length but the length varies because I only get it trimmed two or three times a year.  I don&#x27;t worry about hair styles and normally have my hair is in a bun.  These work GREAT.  Two pins hold all day and I can&#x27;t feel them at all.  I highly recommend this hair accessory. They don&#x27;t pinch, grab or pull as  traditional bobby pins can. if the pins work out it&#x27;s very slowly so one just has to give a little twist a couple times a day - that&#x27;s probably because my hair is so fine. May not be needed on sturdier hair types.&lt;br /&gt;For longer hair I imagine one might need more than two of the shorter pins or purchase the longer size.&lt;br /&gt;A person could even put some sort of sparkly doohickey on the looped end for a little dress up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I&#x27;ve been using these for a few months now and still like them.  I get a headache easily from hair accessoories, and these have never bothered me. Still highly recommended for easy hair maintenance.</li>
            <li> I never wore my hair in a bun -- until I had a baby. She loves to pull my hair, even when in a pony tail, so a bun on top of my head is the only way to go. I have fairly fine shoulder length hair and this works like charm. I only need one.</li>
            <li> So I was a skeptic. I have thin hair and nothing holds. So when I saw the model on the commercial with her long flowing thick tresses, I thought, well of course it holds in her hair. And she had hair people on set to place all the hairs just right. But being that it was relatively cheap I bought it because often times, I find myself without hair clip or elastic at work and end up using a pencil. Which quite honestly, is gonna take someones eye out when day if they walk to close behind me.     It took me a few tries but I conquered the process of the spin and I will say, it works. Although if you are looking to create a polished, every hair in its place bun, this isnt for you. It does give the messy bun look and hairs will stick out but I like that.</li>
            <li> I have medium to long fine hair.  These spin pins did not work when my hair was straight, my hair just slipped out in all sorts of places.  However when it was curled and a little \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; it kept my hair up.  But as I went to take them out I couldn&#x27;t get one of the pins out.  Turns out it literally exploded in my hair - widened.  It was such a mess to get this out because it had widened so much it wouldn&#x27;t spin.  Beware!</li>
            <li> These things work. I saw them several years ago in Germany but didn&#x27;t try them then. Seems they finally made the U.S. market. They do not make your bun completely bullet proof (for bullet proof, I put my hair in a ponytail, braid it, tie the ends with another elastic, then wrap the whole thing around in a bun and secure it with another elastic or two. And that won&#x27;t budge.) But it&#x27;s easier on your hair than hair ties - you shouldn&#x27;t break any hair using these pins. I never could get straight pins or bobby pins to do a thing in my thick wavy hair, but these stay put pretty good.    However, Amazon is listing these at $10, and you can get them for half that Walgreens or Walmart.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item a few days ago and I love it! I use it in combination with the Goody Simple Styles Volume Boost hair accessory. I use that item in my bang area to create volume. It works in my opinion better than the Bumpit and is less noticeable in hair. Its a bit more suttle and not so noticeably dramatic like your hiding a bee hive under there. The Goody Simple Styles Spin Pins are almost effortless in going into your hair. They are also simple to remove- just uncoil out. I personally like to still use a rubber band and then create a bun and twist those in around the loose hanging hair. I have long hair so if it works for me it will work. It gives me the look that I prefer. I like to have some of the stray hairs hang outside and around the bun. I place mine in the middle and not so low. I actually enjoy using these and being creative with them.</li>
            <li> This is my first review of anything; I have extremely long (7 in past shoulder) thick wavy/coarse/curly hair, almost ethnic in texture-I love it and don&#x27;t want to cut it off because it looks great when I have time to style it. For years I have used endless clips, bands,sticks, bobby pins, doodads and whatsits but most of the time I had hair all over the place and I looked sloppy. As a mother of 2 young children, I don&#x27;t always have time to style my hair nor do I enjoy it in my face while trying to do things. I was out shopping and had forgotten a hair band or a clip to get my hair out of my face so I stopped by the hair stuff isle and I saw these-I didn&#x27;t think it would be that easy but as soon as I got in the car I tried them. I pulled my hair back in a pony tail, twisted it around,wrapped the hair in a bun(like when using hair sticks) and twisted one in the top and one in the bottom. Pure amazement...first try! totally secure! no flyaways or stray hairs,,,I looked very nice and smooth. My friend was with me and she said WOW! where did all of your hair go?  I&#x27;ve used  them everyday since I then. I&#x27;m going to throw away everything else. I wash it, comb it, pull it back and twist it while its wet and it stays up all day. It looks very nice and elegant.  Another great thing is- no clip or odd bun ponytail that rubs the back of your seat while driving, sitting or laying. Its seriously the coolest thing ever.i&#x27;m getting the chignon maker too. Life changing. Very easy to take out as well,no pulling at all! Genius!</li>
            <li> These are great little gizmos for creating buns! They work well for me even though my hair is baby-fine and partially layered.</li>
            <li> These are really a great little invention, and keeps all hair tightly in it&#x27;s place all day long. My issue is that apparently my hair is too thin (though for reference, my ponytail is approximately the same circumference of a quarter) and the ends of the pins stick out from the bun. It makes for a kind of ugly look, with these brown metal things sticking 1-2cm up through your hair. I do understand that they are trying to cater to many different hair types, but for me they are just way too long.   Also, one other note, it&#x27;s really hard not to lose one of these but you definitely need both to create the bun, so be careful!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical on this item as I was unsure of how it would hold my long, thick hair... I am still not sure how this tiny spring-looking thing does it, but IT DOES!! Its not too tight on my scalp (like pony-tails) and its not too loose to where I have to re-do my bun every hour or 2... AND, WAIT TIL YOU HEAR THIS... I wore my hair in a slightly messy (but stylish) bun all day, WENT TO BED FOR THE NIGHT, woke up, and low and behold... My bun was still in tact! (Just a little less stylish, of course.) I have a lot of hair so I used two of these contraptions, but it beats the 1005 bobby pins I used to use. :) highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using spin pins for about a year. They are fantastic! I have quite thick, hip-length hair and use four pins to hold it all up, BUT it stays. These things are infinitely better than bobbi pins. I use them to bun my hair at night or when I want to keep the look of a style simple (that is, I don&#x27;t want hair accessories showing). I am buying several pairs as stocking stuffers for people who I know would love them, but would never pick them up on their own.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have very long, wavy hair and sometimes I don&#x27;t have the time  to style it.  I use it to create a bun or French twist on days when I literally have no time.  It takes a minute.  I have gotten so many compliments, people ask me what I&#x27;m doing after work to have styled my hair!</li>
            <li> I use these in my bun only. You need a relatively large mass of hair to be able to use these without them showing. I have long hair and stick these in at the end when I&#x27;m making a sock bun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They really hold hair in place very well, without spinning or falling out throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not for short-haired people.</li>
            <li> I went to Walgreens to get one of these just to try and see what the fuss is about, thinking that it cant be as easy as it looks, I mean how would it work, had no clue until I opened it and put my hair in a pony tail and made a messy bun in seconds without even trying, so easy. I have thick wavy hair and just two are ok but I think with 2 more would stay better, I cant believe I did not try these earlier. Awesome hair accessory.</li>
            <li> I was happy to discover the pins were made out of metal. I had been wondering about its durability and imagined it was plastic. Admittedly, I am one of those people who do not have the the talent or imagination beauty-wise. It took me a few hours to master putting the pins in my hair, but that&#x27;s a testament to me and not the product. Now that I know how to use it, I love it. The pins are easy to twist in &amp; out and they do hold your bun for quite a while. Definitely a must have!</li>
            <li> I have thick frizzy hair.  When it gets annoying at work, I&#x27;ll throw my hair up in a second with the spin pins.  Love them!</li>
            <li> I have long thick heavy hair and for years would torture myself with tight pins and bunches of rubber bands to get it to stay  up.  These don&#x27;t hurt and I actually keep checking to see if my hair is secure because for the first time in my life I don&#x27;t have a headache.  They handle the weight amazingly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m such a novice when it comes to hair and beauty but these made it so easy to look well-groomed. I have thick, wavy hair down to my waist. These kept my hair in place all day which is an absolute first! The side chignon I made for the first time ever looked so cute. The pins are invisible so they don&#x27;t look tacky like my previous butterfly clips. They go in real smooth and didn&#x27;t pinch or hurt at all. They are lightweight and look fairly durable. Yes yes highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a very neat idea, and I bet it does work well with the right type of hair. My hair is not that type, however. I have waist-length, very fine, very thin hair. I did manage to get this to work one time, but the two pins were inter-connected (the instructions say not to let them inter-connect) to do it. I spun one in from the bottom and one from the top, as the instructions say to do, but I spun one so that it connected with the other. It was very comfortable while it lasted. It didn&#x27;t pull on my hair and give me a headache as is usually the case when I have my hair up. I didn&#x27;t have any trouble taking them out like I thought I would, either. I thought I had finally figured out how to make it work for me, and I was super happy about it!&lt;br /&gt;Alas, it was not to be. I have not been able to recreate that style again with these pins. They just will not hold my hair to my head. I will continue to try new ways of using them occasionally to see if I can find something that will work every time because I did love the comfort of it the one time it did hold. I will update if I find something that works. Until then- if you have very fine AND very thin hair, even if it&#x27;s long, this may not work for you. If it does, let me know how!</li>
            <li> I love these little things! I use them in updos in place of bobby pins and it is so much faster and they actually hold my hair. Everybody&#x27;s hair is different, so keep trying if they don&#x27;t work for you right away. My hair has to have some moisture for these to stay.</li>
            <li> My hair is very silky and even when using 10 hairpins my hair slips out almost immediately of a chignon, bun or french braid. These little pins are amazing! First use only took 5 seconds and my hair stayed until I took it down! I slept with them in my hair, was very comforatable and my hair stayed in until morning. Love these pins.</li>
            <li> These are pretty fun. I don&#x27;t know why but before buying these I had never been able to successfully put my hair up in a bun. I am very hair-challenged. The instructions say that you should be careful not to intersect the pins when you twist them in. Usually I have the best results when I do the exact opposite. For the price of these you can&#x27;t go wrong - if you have trouble putting your hair up, try this!</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and my hair and head hurt when I pull my hair up or back because of the weight of my hair. I get headaches from it! I am so thrilled that I found these. Today, I have my hair pulled back in a low bun, just like the instructions describe. My hair has stayed in place all day, and no hurting! I&#x27;m going to use them for my updo for my wedding next week! I tried using hairpins and bobby pins in my trial dos, and nothing would hold my hair in place until I put these in.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the modern updo Goody product, and purchased these after being thrilled with that expecting these to be just as great.  I have to say, I&#x27;ve never even been able to wear them out of the house.  They don&#x27;t stay in my fine hair and definitely aren&#x27;t capable of securing a bun, not to mention they take awhile to \\&quot;screw\\&quot; in.  I had much higher hopes for this product, but was sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> A different kind of bobby pin, took little time to learn to use it and I do use them quite often!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder-length plus, big, brunette hair and these suckers work great at securing my buns.  1 alone would probably hold my bun but 2 makes it very secure.</li>
            <li> I have a FULL head of 3b curly hair and expected some setbacks but hoped otherwise thanks to a review about these products working best for curly hair instead of straight fine hair. After using them, my hope disappeared once my expectations were exceeded.    The Spin Pins work best for my hair but 2 pins simply aren&#x27;t enough! I&#x27;m alright with a messy bun if it looks relaxed but when it seems like you&#x27;ve been in the wilderness for 2 weeks and haven&#x27;t had time to fix your hair between bear fights it&#x27;s too messy for me; sadly, that is exactly what I ended up with when using 2 Spin Pins. It may be because I have some layers in my \\&quot;just above bra strap\\&quot; hair, but I have to aid them with other pins to get a decent look. I would purchase another pair or 2 if they weren&#x27;t so expensive!     Overall, I give this 2* because though I wouldn&#x27;t reccommend to anyone with lots of 3b curly hair, maybe someone with less hair or a different type (wavy or straight) could get better results if willing to risk the amount on the pricetag. Only \\&quot;value for price paid\\&quot; would get 5* from me because I purchased the complete Bundle Pack from Walmart for onl $8.00 +FREE S/H TO HOME, which speaks better of the retailer than the product. I will continue to experiment since I already made the purchase but am definately glad I shopped around and got the cheapest price around!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, very curly, very long hair. I almost never wear it up because pony tail holders/scrunchies and bobby pins just don&#x27;t hold it up. I bought the Spin Pin in my desperate search for something to get my hair off my neck in this summer heat. IT WORKS!!! I can put it up every which way now in less than 30 seconds, it&#x27;s really easy to put them in and to take them out, and they hold my hair up all day. I was a little reluctant to spend 8 bucks on two little pins but it was totally worth it. I was also a little nervous because I&#x27;m a moron when it comes to hair styling and hair products but these were so simple and easy. I love them!</li>
            <li> These hair pins held my hair up for 12 hours.  I am a nurse and I have to have my hair up off my shoulders and these did the trick.  I even slept in them.  Good invention for hair.</li>
            <li> This is an  amazing product. Search no more, just buy this.  I was skeptical when I saw first this in the magazine, name this the\\&quot; best product of the century\\&quot;. After on try - I AM SOLD. It take less than a minute to get a polish look.  All you  have to do is twist your hair into a bun, than screw the first pin into the loose end,then screw the second pin into the opposit direction. No pull, no pinch, no pain. It last the whole day,until you unscrew the pin off. Great and must have hair accessory for anybody with long hair. I am very happy, and I am buying more for christmas stocking stuffing.</li>
            <li> I go with a simple bun hairdo a lot (especially when it&#x27;s as hot as it is now!),  and I finally found pins that both hold the hair well, and make nothing show: no ends of hair, no ugly hair clips, just a nice round bun.    They are simply ingenious!</li>
            <li> I picked these up at the grocery store yesterday and tried them out today for the first time. I have very thick hair and can never get it to stay put when I tried to put it in a bun. I put it in a bun on top of my head about 4 hours ago and I can&#x27;t believe its still holding - also they&#x27;re so comfortable - I can&#x27;t even feel them on my head. The price on Amazon is half again what I paid, so I think I&#x27;ll go back to the grocery store and pick up another couple of packages just in case they decide to stop making them (like seems to happen with everything else I fall in love with).</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think my this would work on my hair. I have a lot of Asian slippery hair which is impossible to just anything up. When I mean a lot.. I mean I have so much hair that hair stylists sigh when I enter the salon! But know to behold this thing actually works! Even with just one pin it barely put my hair up but the 2nd pin it was perfect! The twisting action does do wonders. I thought it would be hard to twist it in since I have just thick hair but It was so easy that I put my hair up while driving on my first try! Gotta love this stuff!</li>
            <li> These little corkscrew pins are so great for quick up dos. I wish I had ordered an additional set. I can put my hair in a full bun, a half bun and French twist in seconds. Totally recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have fairly long hair, almost waist length, with a good bit of body.  I used to use these ALL the time when they were called HairScroos and could not BE more pleased to find them again, as I broke my last one almost a year ago now.  These are fantastic tools for doing anything from a simple bun to a more ornamental french twist, any sort of updo.   I am thrilled to have some spin pins - they&#x27;re fantastic!</li>
            <li> I am a complete hair-do idiot.  I can put my hair in a pony, a braid, or a bun.  It took me a year to figure out how to do that little bump of hair on top of my head.  And, while I have a LOT of hair, the strands are very fine, so my hair doesn&#x27;t hold bobby pins, barrettes, hair bands, head bands, etc. very well.  They almost always fall out.  I bought these today from a store in town and I put them in as soon as I got home.  That was five hours ago.  They have stayed in and my bun has stayed tight to my head!  I&#x27;m completely amazed.  These are so worth the money.  :)</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and watched some videos relating to this on you tube, it looked too good to be true... IT WAS EVEN BETTER!!! it holds your hair perfectly and you can do a lot of stylings with it! DO BUY IT!!!</li>
            <li> Update, 16 September 2010    I paid $6 for a pack.  I see that Amazon has raised the price again.    Update, 23 July 2010  I&#x27;m glad to see that Amazon is now charging the price I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere.  I may buy some more from here.    _________________________________    I&#x27;m still getting the hang of these, but they are very promising.  I have very thick, curly/kinky hair that shrinks to about shoulder length when it dries.  I have been looking for an alternative to a ponytail bun for sometime. This works, although in my case I think that using a ponytail holder will help, along with the pins. If I want to do a curly bun (see link below) I&#x27;ll need four.    The following thread, from a site for people with textured hair, discusses Spin Pins at length. There are some photographs and links to videos.    [The link info has been removed. Google naturallycurly.com and the name of this product.]    I also like that they&#x27;re not outrageously priced (although Amazon, surprisingly, charges more than Walgreens).  I am so sick of spending $8, $10, $15 on hair accessories that aren&#x27;t right for my hair and can&#x27;t be returned.</li>
            <li> well, if i may chime in here, i LOVE these pins! i tell everyone i know that they should have them. i have both sizes. i use the small ones for either one small bun with just the front of my hair pulled up on the crown of my head with the rest of it hanging down and some pieces sticking out of the bun, or sometimes i would make two small bun/pigtails in the back that were loose. i think the looks you can create from these are super sexy, but almost impossible to get from any other hair accessory. if you like a loose, sexy looking updo look, these are the only way to go! i&#x27;m a hairstylist, and i think they&#x27;re great!   i am not using them now cause i decided it was time to cut my hair short, but as soon as it grows in enough, i&#x27;ll be using them again!!!</li>
            <li> I love this invention. They are not easy to find in stores. They keep hair up without pulling or breaking, amazingly well. I can always count on Amazon to find items I want or need, without the hassle of shopping everywhere for them locally.</li>
            <li> i got my goody spin pin and was at sally&#x27;s so i brought the sally&#x27;s verison and the wires are not good that it got bend is a messed up way....i need to buy the goody&#x27;s verison again. since sally&#x27;s sucks. They both say put the same but goodys is stronger and doesn&#x27;t get bend up easily.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I always have at least three on hand.  It&#x27;s so much easier to put your hair in a bun.  Just practice a few times and you&#x27;ll get it.  It creates a messy bun.  If your hair is layered it is a little bit more difficult but you can still do it.  I have super straight hair that goes below my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I love these things.  I&#x27;ve bought 3 more pair of them.  My hair is long, medium-thick, mostly straight but a little wavy in some places, and while it&#x27;s capable of looking gorgeous when I wear it down and fix it, it&#x27;s a pain and it&#x27;s not practical, and I like to wear it back at work.  I don&#x27;t like the way all that hair looks in a ponytail, and I&#x27;ve wanted to wear something more professional looking and sleek.  Never in my life have I managed to get a bun to stay in my hair.  Maybe with 50 bobby pins, a hairnet, and half a bottle of aqua net.  Maybe.  But with these things?  I get a perfect bun, every day.  With very little effort.  It says you don&#x27;t have to use a ponytail holder.  I disagree.  I pull my hair into a ponytail and secure it with an elastic first.  Then twist my hair while I wrap it around the ponytail.  Then I hold it with one hand while I spin the two pins in, one pretty close to the end of my hair, and the other one about opposite.  I spray with a little hairspray, and it stays in all day.  It takes about a minute and a half.  Best $3.50 I&#x27;ve ever spent on my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine (not thin) and medium length.  The instructions were easy to follow, and it did secure my hair... but I prefer the look I get from the magic grip hair pins.</li>
            <li> I am a complete clutz at styling my hair.  I wanted to wear one of the cute chignon styles I&#x27;ve been seeing on celebrities, but I had no idea how to make a bun.  The Spin Pin is super helpful.  All I do is gather my hair into a ponytail and add an elastic.  I pull it through twice and then pull it halfway through on the third time around.  You may not need an elastic but my hair is very thick.  Then I just separate the ball of hair that is left and spin in a spin pin, one on top and one on the bottom.  Sometimes I need a couple of extra bobby pins, but not many.  It holds all day.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that never stays where it belongs unless I use a claw that gives me a headache.  When I first got my spin pins I was timid with them.  Don&#x27;t know why.......I&#x27;ve had them about a month now and I love them.  Once I just let er&#x27; rip and played around they worked beautifully.  They stay where I put them.  These actually do what they say.  Shock!  Buy a set and enjoy.  Be creative.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair and this puts my hair up in a perfect bun! I can even do a French twist, awesome product, it&#x27;s $5.88 at Walmart.</li>
            <li> My hair can be tricky to put. It&#x27;s hip length, but very fine and slippery and absolutely straight. I used to use a lot of regular hair pins to put it up, but after it got to my waist, it was too heavy to stay up securely in just pins unless my head was nearly armored with them.&lt;br /&gt;Longer hair sticks work, but sometimes I just want a smooth unadorned bun.&lt;br /&gt;These? Work perfectly in my hair. I was dubious when I first saw them because my hair tangles in things very easily, but these don&#x27;t tangle in my hair. They spin in and spin out easily. I can twist my hair into a bun, hold it was one hand and spin the pin in through the top, then switch hands and spin the other pin in from the bottom at a different angle so it doesn&#x27;t lock on the other pin. After it&#x27;s up, it stays up until I take it down, and these pins don&#x27;t show at all in my hair. The pins are very smooth with ball shaped tips. No sharp edges or jagged edges to catch or cut my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just thrilled with these hair pins.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Make sure to make a really tight bun when you use it though. Very well-made and sturdy. I have moved around a lot and my hair stays, so excellent delivery!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my eye on spin pins since I first saw them at my local Target, but didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returns when they inevitably failed to revolutionize my hair routine. Well, internet, I was wrong. These ingenious pins have happily facilitated my lazy approach to hair styling, and the result always looks complicated and thought-out considering the short amount of time creating gorgeous buns takes. I highly recommend searching the internet for more ideas than what the box provides...the possibilities are endless! No more damaged hair from ponytail bands and constant adjustment/fixing. These work great with my fine yet thick hair. I&#x27;m so glad to say sayonara to bobby pin buns!</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that I wear in a bun.  I can&#x27;t tell you the number of pins it used to take to hold it in place. Plus, they would always slide out.  But 2 of the spin pins do the trick. I have also tried some new &#x27;dos that I was never able to get to stay in place with just bobby pins.  Again, the hair stays in place for hours. I am seriously impressed.   I&#x27;m ordering more just to have.</li>
            <li> I saw these on sale @ Target and decided to give them a try. I have thick, straight hair that is down to my hips, so I was a little skeptical that these would be able to hold my hair up. I usually always have trouble with putting my hair in a bun because of the thickness and length, but I tried these out and they worked! I bought two sets of these just in case I needed more of the pins to hold my hair up, but I only needed to use two. I&#x27;m so happy that I finally found something that can handle my hair.</li>
            <li> I think this product is well worth the money. Like other reviewers, I&#x27;m not particularly hair adept, but I found these relatively easy to use. I do have fine hair, and the one thing I&#x27;d say is that I found these work better for me when my hair is not freshly washed. The times I tried it just after washing my hair, they didn&#x27;t hold as well. Definitely work better for me on my off-shampoo days.</li>
            <li> These actually work really well. As another poster put it, they make your updo bullet proof. I do think they are a little pricey for what they are - two pieces of scrap metal. I usually wear 4 because I have long and thick hair, and like to keep several handy for when I need them (in the car, at home etc).</li>
            <li> I like that I don&#x27;t get creases in my hair from putting my hair up in these for a while throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through three sets of pins. I love them. I have very thick hair down to my mid back. They hold the hair until I take it down.  Still, I have one problem. The paint wears off the pins fairly quickly. At $7+ per set, I was considering giving them up. The price on Amazon is close to half the price. I will consider buying them again here.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long wavy hair.  I have never been able to put it in a bun with any sort of clips or pins, because there is simply too much hair.  I gave these a shot - and my hair has stayed up for hours now!  I may order a few more... for me it is worth the money to finally have something that works with my hair and keeps it up without getting weighed down.</li>
            <li> These pins have revolutionized my hair-do. I have long, very fine, thick hair. Up until I got these pins, nothing would hold my hair securely in an up-do. I could not do a french twist unless I went to a professional stylist and spent $60 to have my hair done. Now, for only $6, I can do one myself, AND IT WILL HOLD ALL DAY LONG!  Just twist your hair into whatever style you want, and twist the pins into the middle of it. It holds the hair all the way through the twist, instead of just holding one spot. I can hold a bun of LONG hair with only two pins. Three pins makes it strong enough to go running for an hour, with not a hair out of place.  The person who invented these pins is genius. Once you buy them, you will never go back.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that my hair has EVER been in a bun. I have hair that is pretty long, so I have never really tried it. I didn&#x27;t think that it would ever stay. I did half of it in a bun a few times, but it took forever to get it up with a few ponytail holders and a half a pack of bobby pins. Then, it fell out within an hour.&lt;br /&gt;These, however, held all of my hair in a bun, no ponytail holder required, and it stayed in place for over 4 hours! Great buy and now my baby can&#x27;t pull my hair every time I pick her up. Going to order a backup set now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a throw-my-hair-up-and-go-go-go kinda girl and this product makes me life that much easier.&lt;br /&gt;Only downside: I tend to lose a spin pin here and there.  Might become an expensive habit.  ;)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this invention! I have thick black hair and these little guys actually keep my hair up in a bun for a long time. I love the fact that they don&#x27;t leave behind lines in your hair the way that hair ties would. It&#x27;s very comfortable to wear too! Sometimes I forget that I&#x27;m even wearing it. They do the job that would take many bobby pins to do. And plus. It&#x27;s super easy to do a bun with these. Literally just twist your hair into a bun and then twist in the spin pin. It&#x27;s that easy. Your hair will look so flawless and plus, you can&#x27;t even see the spin pin. I absolutely love these spin pins and am glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I bought this today.  It works!  The only thing is that I have baby fine hair that isn&#x27;t super long or thick, it&#x27;s about to the bottom of my shoulder blades or where my bra goes across my back.  So I wish I had gotten the minis, because these stick out a bit at the top and bottom of my bun.  They aren&#x27;t completely useless to me, cuz I&#x27;m growing my hair out and I&#x27;m sure once my hair gets about 6 inches longer they&#x27;ll be perfect, but for now I think I&#x27;m going to try to get a pack of the mini&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;But overall great product!  Soo much easier than sticking 100 bobby pins in and hairspray and all this and then trying not to move my head too much.</li>
            <li> I have long hair (almost waist length), LOTS of it, and its extremely thick. Bobby pins are a joke to me since they do absolutely nothing. Until I got these my hair never held in a bun (literally never). Picked these up on a whim, spun the two pins in, and I have never felt such a secure bun in my life. I can walk around all day, I can RUN, and the bun will hold. Literally is life changing and a must have for long-haired girls in the summer.</li>
            <li> I have very long (about waist length), very fine, stick-straight hair and these spiral pins really work for me! They&#x27;re best for buns, messy or tight, and depending on the style I wear up to two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually regular pins slide out of my hair and bobby pins rip strands out no matter how gentle I am at removing them. I thought these were a little gimmicky, but cheap enough to try and give away if they didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spin pins are very gentle and hold my long fine hair very well. Because of the sheer weight of the length of my hair, I can&#x27;t use these for aggressive exercise (I run and do CrossFit), but I wear them for yoga and pilates and they work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always carry one spin pin in my purse for last minute styling emergencies!</li>
            <li> Saw a video of these online and thought they were interesting. You can quickly put your hair in a bun with just these two pins! They don&#x27;t &amp;#34;inch&amp;#34; their way out of the bun and are well hidden.</li>
            <li> I saw a commercial for these last night and was immediately intrigued. I wear my hair in a bun every day and have to use elastic bands (no bobby pins). I&#x27;m constantly either losing my ponytails or they get stretched out to the point where I can&#x27;t use them. I have long, thick hair so I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work for me, especially after reading someone saying that they weren&#x27;t good for thick hair. I bought some today and tried them and it seems to be holding like it says it should. Now, I put my hair up wet and it&#x27;s dry now so I don&#x27;t know if that will make a difference but I&#x27;ll try it in the morning and let you know.</li>
            <li> I am completely hopeless when it comes to styling hair in any way but I saw a commercial for these and I just had to try it.  I&#x27;m glad I did because this pins are AMAZING.  Super easy to use, twists in easy and twists out easy, no snagged hairs and no more bobby pins digging into my scalp. I was so excited about how well they worked that I called my mother to tell her to pick some up too.  I have them in right now, it only takes 30 seconds to get my hair into a bun and to twist these in and they stay all day long. I will definitely buy a few more packs as back ups.</li>
            <li> I bought this imagining it would become like all of the other offbeat hair clips and accessories I&#x27;ve tried - sitting in a drawer, unused, because it was too complicated or just didn&#x27;t work right with my hair. I was dead wrong and I&#x27;m so glad I tried these. I have long hair, medium to fine textured but a LOT of it. These little corkscrews really did hold my bun all freakin day, AND my head didn&#x27;t hurt. You know when you have a lot of hair, sometimes your bun or ponytail starts to hurt your head after awhile? Didn&#x27;t happen with these magical little items. They&#x27;re becoming my go-to morning hair accessory. The only minor criticism is that every time I put it on the bathroom countertop it rolls right off. Haha. I need to buy a few more, I know I&#x27;ll end up losing some! Anyway, definitely fork up the $5 and buy these, they&#x27;re so worth it.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful for putting long hair into a bun and keeping it secure. The part I love is that they are mostly invisible to others.</li>
            <li> These little pins really do work! I am terrible at styling my hair and these are so simple to use. They stay in place really well and I didn&#x27;t even have to adjust them after working outside building a fence &amp; dog house. Just twist the hair and screw them in! My hair is 2/3 down my back, thick, and heavy so I use a hairband first to create a ponytail (even though they say not to) then I section my pony into two pieces. Twist one section and use one spin pin to hold in place and then twist the second section to wrap around the other bun and use the second spin pin to hold in place. This makes a more coiled and fun looking style that looks like it took a long time and lots of bobby pins to create, but in fact took just seconds and two little pins! I might have to buy more just in case I lose one! This is one hair accessory I cannot live without!</li>
            <li> I am not a woman equipt with even a quarter of the basic hair styling skills that the average small child has, but somehow this silly little spiral has managed to turn someone like me into a budding hairstylist. I have long hair, down to the middle of my back, but it is so fine that I can barely make a ponytail holder stay in without tying it so tight I pull out hairs when I take my hair down, and don&#x27;t even get me started on barrettes and bobby pins. I bought this product on a whim figuring it would fall into the long line of random hair dohickies that don&#x27;t work with my hair, or at least don&#x27;t work with me, but for once my $5 were well spent.    It took me about 5 minutes max to get a feel for it and once I had my hair up in a bun (possibly the best looking one I have ever been able to produce) it stayed put perfectly until I decided to take it out. I&#x27;m interested in trying out the other items in this line in hopes that I may have more hair styling luck. I whole heartedly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it will... it&#x27;s too easy. Watch a video tutorial on You Tube (there are lots) and you&#x27;ll have this down in no time. It feels very secure, and the pins twist in and out easily without pulling out your hair. I&#x27;m not crazy about how it looks from the side (see my photos) simply because I have thick hair down to my bra strap, and the bun looks like a huge tribble. More practice, and/or a second set to do two smaller buns would probably fix this, though. The pictures are my first attempt at using them, on hair that has been washed and flat-ironed. Your hair texture, length and so forth will affect your result, but for me it was superb. It&#x27;s very easy for me to give the economical hair pin set five stars... IT WORKS.</li>
            <li> I bought these years before they became available from a major company. I had lost mine and NOTHING would keep my slippery, straight hair in place! (I was the dancer who always had the bobby pins flying out of her hair during turns - before spin pins,that is!) I lost my pair some years back and I was devastated when the place I bought them from had closed and no one else had them. Thank goodness they are back!! Now my hair stays up! [By the way, the instructions say not to cross the pins. I have done this for years with no damage to either my pins or my hair. While I can not suggest you ever go against manufacturers&#x27; instructions, I think if you CAREFULLY spin the pins both in and out (Not just try to yank them out.), you should be okay. Please be careful to always follow the recommendation of the manufacturers. They are there for a reason.]  Thank you Goody, for returning a GREAT product to the market and thank you Amazon for linking me to the wonderful store that sent them to me - Your Wholesale Retailer in Florida, who gave me FANTASTIC customer service!!</li>
            <li> I bought these on a whim at Target for about half the price. I was just giving them a random chance, since pins almost never work in my hair. I have fine hair which is also pretty thin around the sides. I have a big head, lol, and hair that hits my shoulders. With these pins, I can twist my hair into a french twist or two stakced french twists or a bun, and it holds any hair it hits, even the little ones that barely fit and fall out of my &#x27;gripper&#x27; hair elastics. I love these pins and am using them to do my own hair for the USMC Birthday Ball this year.     Recommending to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair in a bun all the time and these are the greatest invention since sliced bread. They work fantastically and seem to be decently gentle on the hair- more gentle than using a rubberband. It&#x27;s really easy to use, and it really holds the hair well- for a long time. I do recommend that if you have really thin hair, you go with the smaller ones- or else these bigger ones will pop out of your bun.</li>
            <li> These are sooo much better than any hair clip and I imagine put less strain on your hair than any hairtie! I have long, very thick hair and the spin pins hold my hair in a bun effortlessly...super quick and easy to use, and they don&#x27;t tug on your hair/scalp at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try this but never wanted to pay for it. I recently got an amazon gift certificate, so I decided to take the plunge. It is SO useful. No more thousands of bobby pins and ugly doorknob hair from hairbands. It is really tight and though it was hard to use at first and I was extremely disappointed, it works well now that I figured out how to use it. It does take a bit of practice, so don&#x27;t get discouraged! I have thick long slippery Asian Hair with lots of layers. It still stays tight and *most* of the hair stays in the bun, however I do have to use one bobby pin sometimes to tame a big flyaway..or whatever you call it. Shipping was on time and I would def. recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My mom has a professional technician license so in my entire life I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to  shop where hair professionals buy their professional grade equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this is the most efficient and cost effective hairstyling tool on the market! And it&#x27;s available at most stores near you, go get one, or two sets! I use two pins at a time (one set).</li>
            <li> I just bought this product today (you can get it cheaper at Target). I was very excited because it got great reviews, and I have been continually searching for a way to put my hair back in a way other than a simple pony-tail which looks lazy and sloppy with my hair. I will say, that having layered hair, it can be tricky to make it work because you will have some of the shorter hairs that aren&#x27;t long enough to fit into the pins. I still haven&#x27;t gotten the low bun to work because of that reason, although I just got them today and I haven&#x27;t yet tried it on wet hair (my guess is that it will work much better) but what I needed most is a way to put my hair up, or \\&quot;hide\\&quot; it when I haven&#x27;t washed it that day. I have thick, coarse hair, and it doesn&#x27;t get greasy very fast, but it does look slept on, even when I put it back into a pony tail, and I haven&#x27;t found a way to put my hair up into a bun on a non-wash day that looks good....until now! I got frustrated this afternoon when I tried them in the low bun and it wasn&#x27;t working. But I tried to just put it up a little higher, and that solves the problem of the \\&quot;fly-away\\&quot; hairs that don&#x27;t want to stay in place. I just put my hair up three times in a row with these pins, and each time it looked good, and it felt VERY secure. As I&#x27;m writing this review, I&#x27;m swinging my head back and forth and loving the feeling, because I am confident that these pins won&#x27;t come out. Truly remarkable, I have tried so many things that just don&#x27;t stay in my thick, coarse hair, this was like a sudden miracle. I&#x27;m very excited to use them in the future. I might just buy a few more sets and keep them in my purse and car. If it doesn&#x27;t work one way, keep trying different angles, locations, and all that. It took me about 15 tries to get it right, but I&#x27;m glad I kept trying.</li>
            <li> I am very good at doing hairstyles.  Got these to use on daughter who has very thick virgin hair for updo for prom. She does nothing to her hair but wash and condition.  No perm, color, hair dryer, curling iron or flat iron.  They kept sliding out even when using multiples.  Might work good for thin hair or hair that is not that healthy.  Was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for something to hold my thick/heavy hair in a bun, and this does not fit the bill.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair and since these are bigger than bobby pins I thought they would be stronger. I am not able to put my hair in a bun with two of these without first putting it in a ponytail elastic, and even then they don&#x27;t hold better than a couple of mini clips from the dollar store. I read the reviews about them stretching, bending and breaking so I&#x27;m returning them before that happens. I got mine at Walmart for $5 and that&#x27;s too expensive to be replacing all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a lot of hair gadgets but mostly (until recently), the only thing that really worked for me was the octopus clip. My hair was either down or in a bun held by an octopus clip. I picked up these Spin Pins at a Walmart, and they are fantastic! I can wear my hair in a bun without needing the big obvious clip any more. I have thin, shoulder-length hair. When I pin it with these, it stays up all day long, never needs any hair-spray, and the pins barely show at all. AND I don&#x27;t damage my hair because you can take these out just by unscrewing them (so it&#x27;s very gentle on your hair). One piece of advice: Put the first pin in right where the ENDS of your hair are tucked in the bun -- then it holds all of it better. That advice is probably obvious to most, but maybe they are some hair-idiots like me out there. :-) Anyway, these are GREAT. I&#x27;ll probably buy a few more sets so I can keep spares in my different purses. Love love LOVE this product. Awesome!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wondered about these pins and whether they would work for me.  They work very well with my hair, not too thick and not too much.  When I position it properly, just one pin could hold my bun in place.  I was very impressed.  Usually, I would have one pin securing the bun to the rest of the hair by spinning the pin into part of the bun and the hair, close to the head from the top.  The other one I will have going from the bottom, through the center of the bun.  This product doesn&#x27;t seem to work for women with more hair.  More pins might help the bun stay, but I haven&#x27;t experimented with it.    Since getting these pins, I&#x27;ve been enjoying putting my hair into a bun more than I had before.  It looks very tidy without the need for excess bobby pins.  I like the ballerina look, with the bun high on the head.</li>
            <li> When I say hair-do handicapped, I&#x27;m talking about any female out there like me. I get frustrated putting my hair in a simple pony tail! too many lumps here, strands missing here and there, not to mention my hair is very thick, straight and long. I&#x27;m not talking about shoulder-length hair long, but close to the waist long. Its overall impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading a million reviews on these pins, I decided to give it a try. After all, if it doesn&#x27;t work, I can always give them to a female friend of mine that has fine,thin hair. EVERYTHING works on her hair.  Well, after a very frustrating 30 minutes of spinning them in and out, I finally got it to work! I guess that shows its pretty much user-error for those that can&#x27;t get it to work properly. For the average hair competent female, these should be a no brain wonder.  For those a little challenged like myself, it may take some practice. :)  Either way, 3 hours later...and the bun is still tight and in tact despite walking around and working. I&#x27;m pretty positive I won&#x27;t be one of those lucky people that go to the gym with them or jog with them, but for simple everyday wear, so far its perfect!</li>
            <li> My sister has these and they are incredible! She used them for her prom hair and it only needed like 3 of them, instead of using 25 or so bobby pins</li>
            <li> This is the fifth set of these that I have ordered. I began with a set for myself that I absolutely love. Once my friends and family saw my hair they asked what I was using. After showing them the spin pins they all wanted some too. I now give them as gifts! I have very thick hair and sometimes I have to start with a hair band before creating a bun but it&#x27;s well worth it because the spin pins hold my hair in place. I get so many compliments on my hair styles when I&#x27;m using the spin pins. With such thick hair, there is no other hair accessory that could do what spin pins do for me! My friends with thinner hair say that they work just as well for their hair thickness.  Only one heads-up on these. It says that they come in blonde or brunette but I have yet to figure out a way to select which color you get. The good news is that if you use them correctly you can&#x27;t see the color anyway so it really doesn&#x27;t matter which color you get.</li>
            <li> When these arrived, I thought they were a little small. Would they really hold my waist-length hair in a bun? Absolutely! You pull your hair back (no rubber band), twist it in a bun and then twirl in a metal spiral on each side. Surprisingly, it holds perfectly. My hair is long but fine, so I don&#x27;t have as much hair to put up as some people. Still, I was impressed that I didn&#x27;t even need to put my hair in a ponytail first, and there were no flyaways at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;*  Good quality metal, ends are protected so they don&#x27;t snag hair&lt;br /&gt;*  Work perfectly as described&lt;br /&gt;*  Easy to use on yourself without a mirror&lt;br /&gt;*  Takes seconds to put in&lt;br /&gt;*  They stay where you put them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the kind of bun maker that&#x27;s a plastic loop that you hook at the bottom, and I like this one better. With the other kind, the loop would show more at the bottom, and occasionally it would come unclasped. These spirals don&#x27;t come out until you take them out yourself. Also, this creates a natural bun without a gimmicky look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;*  Amazon doesn&#x27;t let you pick between blonde and brunette&lt;br /&gt;*  They&#x27;re small and easily lost if you aren&#x27;t careful&lt;br /&gt;*  If you have very thick hair, you may need to get two sets&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is a medium shade, so either the blonde or brunette work ok for me. Still, if I&#x27;d had a choice, I would have bought the blonde ones rather than the brunette ones I received. I have to be careful to put these away after use, otherwise I&#x27;m pretty sure my cat will think she has a new toy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend these. I would definitely buy them again if I happen to lose them.</li>
            <li> I often wear my long (close to waist length) thick,straight, hair in a bun that had to be held with 2 or 3 large clips.  When I ordered this product, I was worrried the spin pins wouldn&#x27;t hold my hair, as many of the other reviews were from people with thin, fine hair.  I LOVE this product.  It creates a beautiful neat bun and it really does hold all day (even if my hair is wet when I put it up)!  This is definitely worth the price.  I wish I had known about this prodcut when I was heavy into the theater and had to put my hair in buns or updos....no more pulling out 100 bobby pins every night!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a low maintenance type of woman. I keep my hair long, not just because I think it&#x27;s pretty this way, but I also like to be able to put my hair up in a simple manner when I don&#x27;t want it in the way. I am a nurse so keeping my long locks up and secure is important while I&#x27;m at work. When I saw these at Walmart I was more than a little intrigued but was also not expecting much either. I bought them regardless and was pleasantly surprised by how well they performed. My hair is about medium thickness and just above my waist and these spin pins are not only easy to put in but stay in perfectly. They also keep my hair up and secure for an entire 8+ hours. I intend to buy many more so that I can have some on hand at all times!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I see some reviewers are having problems with the pins staying in at all. I find it&#x27;s best to place them in the area between the bun and your head, not in the bun itself. Just wanted to add that little tip in case anyone was making that mistake.</li>
            <li> Usually the ultimate skeptic when it comes to styling gadgets, but these things work! It doesn&#x27;t matter if you get light or dark, they&#x27;re hidden inside your hair, plus eventually the paint wears off the tips anyway. It doesn&#x27;t seem like they would work, but THEY DO!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a lot of hair, get two or three sets. In conjunction with the \\&quot;Modern Updo\\&quot; pin made by Goody, these are amazing at holding all day long. It helps anchor long hair in several places so that the weight is evenly distributed and the hair does not pull down on one spot of your head all day. No more headaches. Loose or tight, full or half bun or twist, these WORK. Wish they&#x27;d been invented decades ago. Indispensable items. They work in EVERYONE&#x27;S hair. Just be sure you don&#x27;t interlock them when inserting, as they warn, because they do stay PUT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little mini spin pins are perfect for making a little bun when just doing part of your hair, when the rest hangs down. Really, these things hold all day and do not hurt, pinch, pull or dig into your head. It might take a few tries to get the hang of it but they work!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cannot recommend highly enough.</li>
            <li> I gave them to a friend as a gift.  They are indeed very durable. I wasnt&#x27; sure how big or small they would be, so bought them out of curiousity.  I have a lot of hair.  Great for those with short hair - even long hair if it is tapered.</li>
            <li> We love these pins - they help me and my son&#x27;s jooda stay intact and they won&#x27;t open even through a good night sleep and whole day of running around.  My wife loves them too.</li>
            <li> This product fell right out of my fine shoulder length hair so I returned it.  Slides right out, no matter how adjusted.</li>
            <li> I have long thin straight hair and I struggled MANY MANY times to keep my hair up with these pins.  However, after much practice, I was amazed at how well they worked once I FINALLY got it right!  The trick is really to get them in at a certain angle; I prefer to put mine in diagonally.  Unfortunately, to this day, I still struggle in the morning before I go to work and I usually just give up.  But if I&#x27;m not rushed (lets say on a weekend), I can get the pins in there in 1 minute.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think these would work but they do. I have thick, heavy hair that is mid-back length. They have been in my hair for over 5 hours and haven&#x27;t moved at all. They go in and out easy and there isn&#x27;t any learning curve.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, and up until now, I&#x27;ve always just pulled it back into a ponytail for casual days and cardio workouts.  For either occasion, I would constantly need to readjust my elastic band and eventually that band would stretch out and need to be thrown away.  I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am that I tried this product.  I can put my hair in a bun with the spin pin for my high-impact step-cardio class and my 14&amp;#34;+ length hair stays in one place throughout! And...I even have layers! Not one stray!!  Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about breakage anymore! Thanks for a great product Goody!</li>
            <li> I seldom give five stars...this one has to get one of them. I have a lot...I mean a lot of hair and it&#x27;s curly, thick, and long (down to  my butt long). My only advise, get more than two. Two will hold your hair but more will make you feel more secure in your do!</li>
            <li> Having very long hair I look for ways to contain it when I&#x27;m active and the hair is just in the wayl&lt;br /&gt;Unbelievable these simple little spin pins eliminate the hassle of putting up your hair.&lt;br /&gt;2 little spin pins is all it takes to secure, and I mean secure a nice &amp;#34;bun&amp;#34; of sort in the thickest hair.  Stays secure for hours and with yard work and hats etc.&lt;br /&gt;Just twist your hair however you like and twist a single pin into each side of your bun or whatever. Voila!  It really is secure.&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed and have sold many friends on these little jewels.&lt;br /&gt;Added bonus, in a headful of long hair NOT ONCE  have these pins tangled up in any way.  No tugging, no unwinding hair, just back the little pin out and it&#x27;s all good.  Again, AMAZING little hair accessory.  I stocked up through Amazon before they were discontinued or something.  These little jewels are too good to do without.  Have looked forever for something that works and doesn&#x27;t tangle and rip your hair.  I kind of like these, can you tell???  They outta pay me,,,,</li>
            <li> I work with children so I am into just throwing my hair up in a bun because my ponytail is very long. However I have noticed a lot of breakage from right hair ties. This product keeps my bun in place and stops my hair from getting dammaged!</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have them! I checked the reviews here before I purchased the pins and really want to give 5 stars of this product. I use only 2 spin pins and they works very well with my long, straight Asian hair to hold the hair bun for the whole day. Finally I can pin those pretty hair forks on the bun.  Next time I will test these pins for my updo hair in the dance class. :)</li>
            <li> I have very long curly fine hair that now needs to be up all the time because it&#x27;s so long and have a new baby.. these really keep my hair up in a bun and easy to take off. No tangling which I feared. Great design.</li>
            <li> Even with tons of bobby pins, I was never able to get my hair into a bun that I thought looked good. These spin pins are fantastic! Once you learn how to put them into your hair, you can do it in 20 seconds. I keep a pair in my purse, at the office, at home for when I want to put my hair up and have it look a bit nicer than a ponytail. They give you a sturdy hold that will stay put even while running to catch a bus or the subway! I highly recommend this product. (Note: For the best bun, be sure to put the first pin in from the bottom and try to catch the ends of your hair that you twisted around in it. You&#x27;ll still have a few fly-aways, but the majority will be in the bun.)</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works great in my granddaughter&#x27;s soft curly hair and my soft straight hair.  Much more comfortable than bobby pins.</li>
            <li> They last forever and easy to use in your hair - longer hair to tie in up in a bun, but I would suggest several as you can misplace them easily - I found a lot of these once at a dolar store stocked up can never have to many of these.</li>
            <li> I have long hair (reaching slightly above my waist)and this pin works beautifully! I can create a bun in no time and it stays put with no problems at all. Recently I cut my hair to shoulder length and the bun still stays put - ofcourse a few stray strands escape simply because my hair is short. Great product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I like the idea of these and they fit nicely when Im only using half of my hair but if i try to put all my hair in a bun, it falls apart b/c my hair is too heavy.</li>
            <li> I use these almost every day for work and it keeps my hair up for hours while also making a great looking bun. My favorite part is when I take it down there is no crease from a hair tie and my hair is nice and wavy. This works great for even really long hair like mine.</li>
            <li> I wear these regularly, they are easy to use and secure your hair without any sense of feeling like your hair will come loose.  I have hair of medium thickness, I have been told by friends with very thick hair that they are unable to secure their hair as they do for me.</li>
            <li> These worked much better than I expected. I have waist length hair and these hold it up with no problem, and are very comfortable. I also have amish hairpins and prefer these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are smaller than I expected (about 3 inches) and made of metal. If you have short hair, they might visibly be stuck out the other end of your bun, but they work great for me.</li>
            <li> Great price, came quickly.  Love using the spin pins, they are easy to use and gave me a few new quick styles to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen pins like before, but it totally works well.&lt;br /&gt;As a fervent of bun style hair, I tried many different types of pins to hold my hair tight yet stylish.&lt;br /&gt;Finally I found the ultimate tool to achieve my goal.&lt;br /&gt;This pin looked small and suspicious, however this holds your hair in the most efficient way using its swirl like brush. Also, since it is not a clip type pins, you can leave your upper part of the bun naturally while you hold your hair bun tightly. That&#x27;s really awesome!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how cool of a product this is!  The first day I wore it, I got 3 compliments on my hairstyle!  So easy to wrap hair into a bun and then twist these two pieces in!  I am so happy to have found such a great tool!  Thanks, Goody!!</li>
            <li> Had seen these spin pins at the local stores, and never understood what or how they worked. Not until I read an article about them in the New York Times did I consider trying them. I have long super straight thick hair and these hold up fairly well. All you need are two. However, unlike some fortunate women here, I have to adjust the pins now and then due to the weight of my hair. Still, the undo looks great!</li>
            <li> I read many good reviews about these little spin pins, but to be honest, I was skeptical they would work.  When I saw it on sale at local Target I decided to give it a try.  It&#x27;s simply amazing!  I&#x27;m completely clueless when it comes to hair styling, but this little stuff twists my hair up, with some messy loose ends that wowed my friend.  I have long hair, but maybe not thick enough and the end of pins usually sticking out of the other side of the bun, but it&#x27;s not too bad and I love how easy it is for me to re-twist my hair several times a day when necessary.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair, I don&#x27;t do nice buns because it takes far to many bobby pins. With these I can do them easily and they stay in all day, if fact I forget they are in. It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like bobby pins and the results are better than they are with bobby pins. I recommend it all the time.</li>
            <li> I just received these today. I was disappointed to see that I did not receive the blonde set and the box indicates. I did notice that the product discription upon selecting it did not indicate which color, however after placing the order it showed as blonde or brunette. This should be make more clear at time of order, not after.....</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my daughter as a Christmas \\&quot;stocking stuffer.\\&quot;  The item that was shipped to me was not anything close to what I ordered from this link.  It was NOT a \\&quot;Goody\\&quot; product.  It was half the size as was listed.  It was sent from some company in China with a \\&quot;wrapper\\&quot; that was torn open and had instructions in Chinese.  Not sure what happened but the little red package from China was not even close to what was portrayed on line.  Go to a store and buy it there!  Only gave it 1 star because this review would not process with zero stars!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Great styles! Messy look</li>
            <li> I have very fine slippery hair that is shoulder blade length. I have a very hard time doing anything with my hair other than wearing it down because everything slips out. Pins literally work themselves up and fall out within an hour! I tried these on a whim when I saw them on sale 2 for $1 at Dollar Tree (they are still there as of today!). I tried them immediately in the car and I was blown away at how well they held my hair. I could get a bun to stay with just one, but its really secure with two. I do interlock them sometimes and never have a problem getting them out. They don&#x27;t pull or hurt my head. One trick is to make sure that you place them against your scalp when you twist them in. If I&#x27;m having some difficulty putting them in, sometimes I will place them straight into my hair then angle up towards the scalp and twist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love love love these. I&#x27;ve been moving away from hair ties as they can cause breakage and these are just the ticket. They are more comfortable than ties and hold better.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty long (mid-back) and very, very thick and heavy. These pins can hang on to all that hair and they don&#x27;t let go, and it&#x27;s so easy! I keep some in my purse so that if I&#x27;m out with my hair down and I need it out of my way I can put it up, no mirror necessary. It looks great every time.</li>
            <li> This may publish under my husband&#x27;s name as his name is on our Amazon account.  Spin Pins are amazing!  IF you put them in so that they grab your bun AND grab some of the hair of your scalp (to hold things in place), they work wonders.  This is for my course and slightly wavy, very heavy mid-back length hair, the long, slick and extremely heavy hair of my daughter&#x27;s friend, and the hugest bun of long, heavy, straight hair I&#x27;ve ever seen - just 1 pin feels quite secure, though I&#x27;d recommend 2 for those with tons of hair.  they work for a tight bun, a messy bun, a French twist, or even for pulling back just the front of your hair.  I&#x27;m wondering if the people who did not succeed with these neglected to put them through the bun and the adjacent scalp hair, which would allow the pins to slide out of place,or if perhaps they have super fine and sort of short hair.  I plan to get these for every female relative with long hair as they are that effective.  Try them! :D</li>
            <li> I am completely incompetent when it comes to styling my hair.  Truly; it took me years to figure out how to put a little \\&quot;bump\\&quot; in my hair (even now sometimes I give up in frustration) and I can&#x27;t even braid it or put it in even pig tails.  I have pretty thick, super-straight light to medium brown hair that&#x27;s nearly to my waist (longest it&#x27;s ever been).  I bought a pack of these from CVS for $7.29-which seems steep to me; I saw them in the store months ago but just couldn&#x27;t make myself spend that much on these little things.  But we have a wedding tomorrow and after seeing the good reviews I decided it was worth a shot.  I always attempt to do something different for weddings (like braids or curling it and I&#x27;ve even looked up \\&quot;foolproof and easy\\&quot; updos with videos and step by step instructions) but always have to give up because I&#x27;m running out of time.  Normally just throwing it up in a ponytail.  These are slick little things and they don&#x27;t hurt or pull/break your hair out when you take them out, nor can you see them once in.  That being said, I&#x27;m having some problems getting all of the hair to stay in, there are big chunks that fall down/stick out sideways, etc. and it doesn&#x27;t feel completely secure like it&#x27;d stay that way for hours.  I tried it without using a ponytail and with a ponytail, no different really.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m forming the bun wrong, but I&#x27;m thinking/hoping it&#x27;s just because I have so much hair that two pins isn&#x27;t enough to secure it all.  So I bought another pack this morning and have to try and master them tonight before the wedding tomorrow...fingers crossed I can accomplish this!  If I can get it to work then even at $15 (which sounds absurd to me; I don&#x27;t spend a ton on beauty products and always get stuff on sale) these will be worth it so that I have another option for hairstyles.  I will try to remember to update back.  Already got a buck or two out of them for entertainment purposes from my husband watching me struggle with these, hejust rolls his eyes and laughs at me.  I&#x27;m really that bad at being a girl.  So if I can get this down it&#x27;ll be huge and I&#x27;d reccomend to everyone!  Update, I did use all 4 pins in my hair successfully.  It didn&#x27;t look professional if you looked closely but that was my fault.  I&#x27;m not even good at twisting my hair and getting it into that bun shape (esp find it hard to tuck the end pieces in wihtout them coming out) but I guess I got lucky when it mattered.  Only took me 3-5 minutes from start to finish I&#x27;d guess.  Also it stayed in for 5 hours with no problem.  I plan to use these again for sure!</li>
            <li> This product is nice to use to make beachy waves. I use it when my hair is when and make two buns on either side of my head with my hair twisted. The spin pin holds my hair in place. Super comfortable as well, I can sleep with them in without feeling them, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have really, really dense curly hair, so these pins were put up to the challenge. Works just great, holds a bun all day. It just takes a little bit of practice to get the pins in just the right place to not let pieces hanging out but you learn. I also like that you can get a more \\&quot;put together\\&quot; messy bun with these as compared to using a regular hair tie (bobby pins never work).</li>
