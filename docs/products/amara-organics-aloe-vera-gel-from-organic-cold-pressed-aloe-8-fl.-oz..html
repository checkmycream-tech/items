            <li>He put it on his face and stood in front of the fan and said it felt so nice.</li>
            <li>For a review system to work, all reviews should be honest, whether the product was obtained through Amazon, a store, or received at a discount.</li>

            <li>than that I got well over the purchase price in one use and have tons more to spare.</li>
            <li>A representative of the company sent me an email detailing many purposes</li>
            <li>I am particularly pleased with the results on my itchy scalp after using the gel as a conditioner before and after shampooing my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love having aloe vera  around.  </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t think  you can ask for more than that.  </li>
            <li>I feel confident this will work well for any type of burn, insect bite, rash, etc.</li>
            <li>and am really glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>Love it .</li>
            <li>but if you are expecting a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; this is more watery than a gel.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with my Aloe Vera Gel purchase.</li>
            <li>So many uses.  </li>
            <li>Too many to name.  </li>
            <li>The bottle arrived safely since it was packed in bubble wrap and was sealed as well.</li>
            <li>Many uses.</li>
            <li>For that reason, I am so glad there are products like this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;~ Aloe vera is for more than a sunburn, although a sunburn is what we are most used to using it for.</li>
            <li>So many things to use aloe vera gel for, but</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a good thing to have in your first aid</li>
            <li>Aloe vera is good for some much more it can really help with skin disorders like scalp itch, acne, dandruff, and even sunburn.  </li>
            <li>How awesome to have a single product that can take care of anything from sunburns to bug bites.  </li>
            <li>This is a great Gel that is so versatile, it is able to do many things, a necessary addition to our camping first-aid kit.</li>
            <li>It did relieve the pain and he loved that it went on easily and got absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love the thinner consistency and the fact that it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice and has really helped.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this product as a leave-in conditioner for my hair after showering.</li>
            <li>Going on smooth without residue and leaves skin smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>we used to have the actual plant in our house, but we did not take great care of it</li>
            <li>I always buy organic before I buy non organic, as what goes on my skin is just as important as what goes in my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good natural product.</li>
            <li>First, aloe vera is one of Nature&#x27;s great natural remedies and cures.</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and absorbs quickly with no greasy or sticky</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and refreshing.</li>
            <li>It really is a great buy primarily because of the benefits, and the long time a bottle lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li>Fabulous product, pure and refreshing.</li>
            <li>It was a very soothing and made her much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice gel, as close to the natural gel coming straight from the plant as you can get.  </li>
            <li>I paid full price for the product</li>
            <li>Love that it doesn&#x27;t have the dyes that you normally see in Aloe Vera!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick arrival coincided on a day when our family had been at the pool.</li>
            <li>Great Product and Seller was extremely helpful with follow up instructions!</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue and it absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li>We used chemical laden aloe for years with success on sun burns</li>
            <li>this product is not like others that burn on contact..seeing my daughter with a smile on her face when she said mom &amp;#34;&amp;#34;LOOK</li>
            <li>Your hair will love aloe, and it acts as a soft setting gel.</li>
            <li>I am using the gel as part of my hair growth treatment, and I love the soft texture it gives my hair.</li>
            <li>It absorbed well into my skin.</li>
            <li>and I think it is superior to other brands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;burn area right out.  </li>
            <li>I put it on 3 times a day - right after therapy in the morning, again in the afternoon</li>
            <li>it being very pure.</li>
            <li>That said, it gives a cooling sensation more so than others i have used, but I still prefer the more viscous products I have owned previously.</li>
            <li>It is worth having on hand as part of a first aid or itch relief  kit for the family.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the consistency is a little looser than the other aloe gels we have used, it applies just as easily, and dries quickly and beautifully with no stickiness.</li>

            <li>Real aloe vera gel!</li>
            <li>His skin remains in stellar condition.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as it is marketed.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I tried Amara Organics</li>
            <li>My mother in law ended up getting sunburned on her arm from driving and I was so glad that I had purchased this earlier in the week.  </li>
            <li>She used this and the next day her skin was all better.  </li>
            <li>Works well and fast!</li>
            <li>I wanted to get some for my first aid kit and have some on me at all times just in case.</li>
            <li>My favorite way to use it is as &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; for my entire body!</li>
            <li>This gel has been very helpful in relieving my itchy skin, do to an autoimmune disorder!</li>
            <li>you can feel the real power of the pure aloe!</li>
            <li>right now I use it mainly in my hair.</li>
            <li>I am using in my dry skin, love it</li>
            <li>had used pure aloe from the aloe plant on vacation and it sucked every&lt;</li>
            <li>This is a pure Aloe product which we will continue to use beyond radiation.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t speak too much to the effectiveness if I had applied it immediately after the burn</li>
            <li>I have a dog that has very itchy skin.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs fast, not greasy, no colors, no dyes.</li>
            <li>This aloe gel is very watery.</li>
            <li>The Amara product is the real thing.</li>
            <li>and he said he really likes it.  </li>
            <li>[...] I really do appreciate getting feedback about what I have written, and the feedback I receive helps me to continue to write quality reviews for products I believe in.</li>
            <li>They sent me an email with instructions about using their product, which I really appreciated.)</li>
            <li>Amara Organics Aloe Vera Gel is the only thing that has significantly improved my complexion and healed the acne scars on my face.</li>
            <li>After more closely reading the labels, I discovered that they all include other, non-natural, ingredients with the aloe vera.</li>
            <li>It is much more liquidy than the green gel you buy in the store, but I really like it that way!</li>
            <li>Also serves as a great mixing agent for other lotions and creams due to</li>
            <li>and so I started reading through the different options that Amazon offered and saw the statement that said &amp;#34;ABSORBS QUICKLY WITH NO STICKY RESIDUE&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Decent shipping time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for skin and hair care,</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and this seller.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>As you can imagine on a burned from radiation breast, taking my bra off with the old Aloe Vera products was pure torcher like ripping a bandaid off a sunburn.  </li>
            <li>I did a little research, read many reviews, and chose Amara Organics aloe gel because of it&#x27;s purity.</li>
            <li>I have fine limp hair and now it looks like I have 2 times as much , much fuller and very shiny.</li>
            <li>We tried the gel and no negative reactions at all.</li>
            <li>end result is that this is the same as if I had harvested my own plants -- without the mess.</li>
            <li>It is slightly sticky, but washes off easily.</li>
            <li>This Aloe Vera Gel from Amara Organics is made from organic plants grown in the USA, it sinks in leaving my skin smooth and soft, its not greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li>It really helps releive the symptoms of contact dermatitis in general.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft and silky!  </li>
            <li>This was the first thing we headed for after a long weekend of camping and swimming.</li>
            <li>Using this for poison ivy, and it&#x27;s worked well so far.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The product is grown and bottled in the USA just in case anyone is sensitive about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>When the bottle arrived, I put some on my arms and was pleasantly surprised how soothing it is.</li>
            <li>The lotion is as described and makes you skin feel soft and soothed.</li>
            <li>Also because it is an all natural and organic product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple weeks and my skin is much softer already.  </li>
            <li>Seemed to heal a moderate sunburn overnight after a very liberal slathering.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s worth the extra money to go Organic when it actually works!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a thick globby like gel, it is smooth and really feels</li>
            <li>This is not the cheap stuff from the Whatever-mart that dries stiff and flakes off.</li>
            <li>It drys fast, so you won&#x27;t have to wait long if you&#x27;re in a rush in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Skin goes back to normal and moisture .</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing for my hair which gets really dry at times.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally found an aloe vera gel for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using natural hair cleansers and conditioners for the last couple of months.</li>
            <li>He is now half way through his treatments and so far it is working out very well.  </li>
            <li>and I much prefer this to oily moisturizers and other aloe-based products that can be sticky.</li>
            <li>I live in Colorado, and the air is very dry here.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t use that green stuff that they sell in big box stores, only the pure and natural aloe plant like this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, the Amara product is priced right, and beats most other cold pressed aloes.</li>

            <li> Love it .</li>
            <li> but if you are expecting a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; this is more watery than a gel.  </li>

            <li> Too many to name.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;This is a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a good thing to have in your first aid</li>
            <li> Aloe vera is good for some much more it can really help with skin disorders like scalp itch, acne, dandruff, and even sunburn.  </li>
            <li> How awesome to have a single product that can take care of anything from sunburns to bug bites.  </li>
            <li> This is a great Gel that is so versatile, it is able to do many things, a necessary addition to our camping first-aid kit.</li>

            <li> we used to have the actual plant in our house, but we did not take great care of it</li>
            <li> I always buy organic before I buy non organic, as what goes on my skin is just as important as what goes in my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> good natural product.</li>
            <li> First, aloe vera is one of Nature&#x27;s great natural remedies and cures.</li>

            <li> It is very gentle and refreshing.</li>
            <li> It really is a great buy primarily because of the benefits, and the long time a bottle lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> Fabulous product, pure and refreshing.</li>
            <li> It was a very soothing and made her much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice gel, as close to the natural gel coming straight from the plant as you can get.  </li>
            <li> I paid full price for the product</li>
            <li> Love that it doesn&#x27;t have the dyes that you normally see in Aloe Vera!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick arrival coincided on a day when our family had been at the pool.</li>
            <li> Great Product and Seller was extremely helpful with follow up instructions!</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue and it absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li> We used chemical laden aloe for years with success on sun burns</li>
            <li> this product is not like others that burn on contact..seeing my daughter with a smile on her face when she said mom &amp;#34;&amp;#34;LOOK</li>
            <li> Your hair will love aloe, and it acts as a soft setting gel.</li>
            <li> I am using the gel as part of my hair growth treatment, and I love the soft texture it gives my hair.</li>
            <li> It absorbed well into my skin.</li>
            <li> and I think it is superior to other brands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;burn area right out.  </li>
            <li> I put it on 3 times a day - right after therapy in the morning, again in the afternoon</li>
            <li> it being very pure.</li>
            <li> That said, it gives a cooling sensation more so than others i have used, but I still prefer the more viscous products I have owned previously.</li>
            <li> It is worth having on hand as part of a first aid or itch relief  kit for the family.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the consistency is a little looser than the other aloe gels we have used, it applies just as easily, and dries quickly and beautifully with no stickiness.</li>

            <li> Exactly as it is marketed.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I tried Amara Organics</li>
            <li> My mother in law ended up getting sunburned on her arm from driving and I was so glad that I had purchased this earlier in the week.  </li>
            <li> She used this and the next day her skin was all better.  </li>
            <li> Works well and fast!</li>
            <li> I wanted to get some for my first aid kit and have some on me at all times just in case.</li>
            <li> My favorite way to use it is as &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; for my entire body!</li>
            <li> This gel has been very helpful in relieving my itchy skin, do to an autoimmune disorder!</li>
            <li> you can feel the real power of the pure aloe!</li>
            <li> right now I use it mainly in my hair.</li>
            <li> I am using in my dry skin, love it</li>
            <li> had used pure aloe from the aloe plant on vacation and it sucked every&lt;</li>
            <li> This is a pure Aloe product which we will continue to use beyond radiation.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak too much to the effectiveness if I had applied it immediately after the burn</li>
            <li> I have a dog that has very itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs fast, not greasy, no colors, no dyes.</li>
            <li> This aloe gel is very watery.</li>
            <li> The Amara product is the real thing.</li>
            <li> and he said he really likes it.  </li>
            <li> [...] I really do appreciate getting feedback about what I have written, and the feedback I receive helps me to continue to write quality reviews for products I believe in.</li>
            <li> They sent me an email with instructions about using their product, which I really appreciated.)</li>
            <li> Amara Organics Aloe Vera Gel is the only thing that has significantly improved my complexion and healed the acne scars on my face.</li>
            <li> After more closely reading the labels, I discovered that they all include other, non-natural, ingredients with the aloe vera.</li>
            <li> It is much more liquidy than the green gel you buy in the store, but I really like it that way!</li>
            <li> Also serves as a great mixing agent for other lotions and creams due to</li>
            <li> and so I started reading through the different options that Amazon offered and saw the statement that said &amp;#34;ABSORBS QUICKLY WITH NO STICKY RESIDUE&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Decent shipping time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for skin and hair care,</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and this seller.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> As you can imagine on a burned from radiation breast, taking my bra off with the old Aloe Vera products was pure torcher like ripping a bandaid off a sunburn.  </li>
            <li> I did a little research, read many reviews, and chose Amara Organics aloe gel because of it&#x27;s purity.</li>
            <li> I have fine limp hair and now it looks like I have 2 times as much , much fuller and very shiny.</li>
            <li> We tried the gel and no negative reactions at all.</li>
            <li> end result is that this is the same as if I had harvested my own plants -- without the mess.</li>
            <li> It is slightly sticky, but washes off easily.</li>
            <li> This Aloe Vera Gel from Amara Organics is made from organic plants grown in the USA, it sinks in leaving my skin smooth and soft, its not greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li> It really helps releive the symptoms of contact dermatitis in general.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soft and silky!  </li>
            <li> This was the first thing we headed for after a long weekend of camping and swimming.</li>
            <li> Using this for poison ivy, and it&#x27;s worked well so far.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The product is grown and bottled in the USA just in case anyone is sensitive about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> When the bottle arrived, I put some on my arms and was pleasantly surprised how soothing it is.</li>
            <li> The lotion is as described and makes you skin feel soft and soothed.</li>
            <li> Also because it is an all natural and organic product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple weeks and my skin is much softer already.  </li>
            <li> Seemed to heal a moderate sunburn overnight after a very liberal slathering.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the extra money to go Organic when it actually works!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a thick globby like gel, it is smooth and really feels</li>
            <li> This is not the cheap stuff from the Whatever-mart that dries stiff and flakes off.</li>
            <li> It drys fast, so you won&#x27;t have to wait long if you&#x27;re in a rush in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Skin goes back to normal and moisture .</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing for my hair which gets really dry at times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found an aloe vera gel for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using natural hair cleansers and conditioners for the last couple of months.</li>
            <li> He is now half way through his treatments and so far it is working out very well.  </li>
            <li> and I much prefer this to oily moisturizers and other aloe-based products that can be sticky.</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado, and the air is very dry here.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t use that green stuff that they sell in big box stores, only the pure and natural aloe plant like this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, the Amara product is priced right, and beats most other cold pressed aloes.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and sheer so that it hydrates without being a gooey mess!</li>
            <li> It is soothing and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> At first, I thought it was going to be too thick.</li>
            <li> It really makes my thick, curly hair so soft without weighing it down with gunk.</li>
            <li> I also use it for minor scrapes and bug bites.</li>
            <li> I use it to hydrate the skin, help with scars, and minor wounds, and certainly minor sunburn.  </li>
            <li> bottle which is enough to last a long time considering that only a small amount is needed.  </li>
            <li> I have used at least five different brands of 99-100% aloe gel products of my sensitive skin, and none of them was so watery as this.</li>
            <li> Works much better than the very expensive stuff I was using.  </li>
            <li> I still have well over half of a bottle left.</li>
            <li> This review comes from the female half of the family.</li>
            <li> I use this Aloe Vera gel as a leave-in conditioner on my hair, mixed with a little jojoba oil and sometimes coconut oil.</li>
            <li> The reason I say better is because the fact is it can clear up my bad burns in one application sometimes, where as the other stuff usually took two or three applications.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed at first that it didn&#x27;t help with itching too much on my scalp and face, but then I found out from the Dermatoligest that it is a neurlogical problem so that&#x27;s why.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> We now use it on bug bites and scrapes as well‚Äîcan&#x27;t wait to try the other recommended uses.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and grandma because their skin gets extremely itchy in the summer.</li>
            <li> I plan to share this with my other radiation buds and even tell the therapists about it.</li>
            <li> To show how gel like this is, I took two pictures, one of the gel with my hand cupped, and the other with my hand tilted.</li>
            <li> With Amara I apply it, let it dry for a few minutes and put my bra on and wear it for the rest of the day with no problems.  </li>
            <li> He wears a prosthetic it helps his limb when it gets sore, and his skin begins to break down.</li>
            <li> Additionally the redness in his face also went down.</li>
            <li> away from all the other chimic stuff you can find on the market!</li>
            <li> We have tried a few other aloe vera gels in our family, and they have all caused a skin redness and stinging for me and my daughter.</li>
            <li> I tried Proactive and everything else back then, but Amara Organic&#x27;s Aloe Vera Gel is seriously</li>
            <li> I chose Amara aloe vera because it is organic and very low ingredient, and has none of these ridiculous chemicals in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This aloe Vera is scent less.</li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t like using other brands that I had in the past because they were messy and just sat on the skin like jelly.  </li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t replace a heavy nighttime moisturizer or steroid creams, during the day it soothes the skin and diminishes the itch.</li>
            <li> A few of the reasons you should try this aloe vera</li>
            <li> You wont find me without this little bottle of miracle juice!</li>
            <li> I have him carry a small amount of Aloe in a jar in addition to some small gauze pads and as soon as his treatment is over he goes into the men&#x27;s room and will apply it around his neck.  </li>
            <li> Then, the gel is extracted by cold press -- the plant&#x27;s natural remedy is not damaged by heat or chemicals.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my opinion (and Dr. Mercola&#x27;s), no better remedy exists for sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This healed that up in a couple day and no more itching.  </li>
            <li> I put some of the gel in a small travel size bottle to carry in my purse and got to use it a couple days ago when I got bit up by mosquitos while I was at work.</li>
            <li> This is the new replacement for SLS (sodium laurel/laureth sulfate) and is bad news.</li>
            <li> We have been applying it at least 3 times per day.</li>
            <li> Other products are sticky and some have weird coloring, scents, etc.  </li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t wish for another terrible sunburn, I will certainly use this if it happens again!  </li>
            <li> I had a pretty terrible sunburn and ordered this a day or two after the fact (was using in conjunction with vit E/soybean oil mix)</li>
            <li> Soon after receiving it, my college aged son came home with some painful sunburn on his face and arms.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is a bit watery, but I&#x27;d take this any day over a bunch of unnecessary additives.</li>
            <li> I really was miserable</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> especially during summer to treat those nasty sunburns.  </li>
            <li> Though my acne isn&#x27;t bad now, I wish I had discovered this product in the past when it was really bad.</li>
            <li> She was afraid that it would be sticky and greasy....</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong here!</li>
            <li> I used this on my daughter after a bad sunburn.</li>
            <li> I am going through breast cancer radiation therapy and was desperate to find an Aloe Vera Gel that did not stick to my bra!  </li>
            <li> My husband gets itchy ears and scratches himself while sleeping and wakes up all bloody.  </li>
            <li> My worst acne disappeared in 2 weeks.</li>

            <li> Fantastic!  This was the first thing we headed for after a long weekend of camping and swimming. Very light and feels immediately cooler!</li>
            <li> Awesome.. Just used it in my sunburn and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No smell no sticky feeling...</li>
            <li> We used chemical laden aloe for years with success on sun burns but I think this works much better and its organic. The reason I say better is because the fact is it can clear up my bad burns in one application sometimes, where as the other stuff usually took two or three applications. Also you don&#x27;t have to refrigerate, nice advantage over some organics, we will continue to buy this brand. Works for us.</li>
            <li> Product is awesome! Great customer support with detailed introduction email. Will buy for them again!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my hair. Leaves it 10000times smoother</li>
            <li> Using this for poison ivy, and it&#x27;s worked well so far.  Smells nice and has really helped.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product as a leave-in conditioner for my hair after showering. Because although this product is too oily for me as a face cream, it&#x27;s rich consistency and pleasant smell work well as a hair product</li>
            <li> I have to say best product ever.&lt;br /&gt;I had used pure aloe from the aloe plant on vacation and it sucked every&lt;br /&gt;burn area right out.  I was laying out over the weekend and missed a spot&lt;br /&gt;with my sunscreen., your product had the same effect that the aloe from the&lt;br /&gt;leaf had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this purchase and will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> this is a great product! away from all the other chimic stuff you can find on the market! you can feel the real power of the pure aloe! on top of the quality of the product, the suppliers are very nice and they will send an e-book, with many uses recipes</li>
            <li> Brilliant product, helped clear my roseacia.  There are No extra chemicals, or scents.  I used it along with my medicine, to help with dryness.  Great stuff.  Now I use it to condition my scalp.  A++</li>
            <li> I used this on my daughter after a bad sunburn. It was a very soothing and made her much more comfortable. I definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> This aloe is wonderful!!! Shipping was super fast and I love this company for they&#x27;re after sales follow up to make sure your a happy camper üëçüëçüëçüòÅ</li>
            <li> I apply this before my moisturizer.  Lovely, nourished, soft skin - which is a good thing to have when in your 40s with very fair skin.  I focus on applying products with no nasties.  This fits the bill.  Great, prompt service as well!</li>
            <li> Amara Organics Aloe Vera Gel is the only thing that has significantly improved my complexion and healed the acne scars on my face. Though my acne isn&#x27;t bad now, I wish I had discovered this product in the past when it was really bad. I tried Proactive and everything else back then, but Amara Organic&#x27;s Aloe Vera Gel is seriously the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it almost two months ago, and have used it twice a day. I still have well over half of a bottle left. ;) Apply before going to bed and, if you need it for your face, before you put on makeup in the morning. It drys fast, so you won&#x27;t have to wait long if you&#x27;re in a rush in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amara Organics sends you follow up emails to make sure you&#x27;re satisfied with their products and are truly genuine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the extra money to go Organic when it actually works!</li>
            <li> Real aloe vera gel! Awesome product.&lt;br /&gt;Item as described.</li>
            <li> Love this Product i bought it for my oldest daughter..it broke my heart seeing her with her skin condition worsening..she has eczema..i searched around and noticed that this Product has many good reviews and decided to buy it for her..which she feels her skin cooled after applying..the redness had disappeared as well as the itching and burning..this product is not like others that burn on contact..seeing my daughter with a smile on her face when she said mom &amp;#34;&amp;#34;LOOK AT MY SKIN&amp;#34;&amp;#34;...PRICELESS..thank you..i also bought the Aloe Glycerine Soap and she loves it</li>
            <li> We have tried a few other aloe vera gels in our family, and they have all caused a skin redness and stinging for me and my daughter. After more closely reading the labels, I discovered that they all include other, non-natural, ingredients with the aloe vera. I did a little research, read many reviews, and chose Amara Organics aloe gel because of it&#x27;s purity. And I&#x27;m so glad I did. It&#x27;s quick arrival coincided on a day when our family had been at the pool. We tried the gel and no negative reactions at all. We now use it on bug bites and scrapes as well‚Äîcan&#x27;t wait to try the other recommended uses. I&#x27;ve finally found an aloe vera gel for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The product came promptly and as described, and to me it seems like a lot of gel for the price. The consistency is a bit watery, but I&#x27;d take this any day over a bunch of unnecessary additives. I had a pretty terrible sunburn and ordered this a day or two after the fact (was using in conjunction with vit E/soybean oil mix) so I can&#x27;t speak too much to the effectiveness if I had applied it immediately after the burn (this is also why 4/5 stars), but it was incredibly soothing on my skin, even more than the oils. It drys very quickly and without any sticky residue at all, which was great and I much prefer this to oily moisturizers and other aloe-based products that can be sticky. While I don&#x27;t wish for another terrible sunburn, I will certainly use this if it happens again!  An edit - great customer service! received an email to follow up on purchase receipt and satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Forgot to put sunscreen on my legs while at the beach and this product has relieved me of a lot of pain, torture and agony the next day.  It was easy to apply and absorbs quickly with no greasy or sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is grown and bottled in the USA just in case anyone is sensitive about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I got well over the purchase price in one use and have tons more to spare. Thank you Amara Organics.</li>
            <li> Amazing texture and so clean!</li>
            <li> Used this to make a spray with essential oils. At first, I thought it was going to be too thick. It is not! Worked well and sprayed nicely.</li>
            <li> Love this gel! I use it in natural cosmetics and it has a wonderful consistency.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and read aloe vera gel might help.  I purchased Amara because of the way it is processed and it is organic.  A representative of the company sent me an email detailing many purposes I could use the product for.  I am particularly pleased with the results on my itchy scalp after using the gel as a conditioner before and after shampooing my hair.  It also has soothed my eczema on my face and arms to the point I don&#x27;t need to use cortisone anymore.</li>
            <li> I ordered this just in case we would need some Aloe Vera for sunburns this summer. When the bottle arrived, I put some on my arms and was pleasantly surprised how soothing it is. I live in Colorado, and the air is very dry here. For two days now, I have been putting the Aloe Vera on my arms and legs and it is refreshing! I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My husband is treating for throat cancer (35 radiation treatments) and I know that would not be good for his skin.  I have him carry a small amount of Aloe in a jar in addition to some small gauze pads and as soon as his treatment is over he goes into the men&#x27;s room and will apply it around his neck.  His skin remains in stellar condition.  Shortly after I placed my order, Jennifer from Amara contacted me by email with a brochure of recipes.  Thank you Jennifer!!  I will be ordering this again!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this aloe Vera gel. I am using it to take care of my skin during radiation for breast cancer. The lotion is as described and makes you skin feel soft and soothed. I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I love having aloe vera  around.  As a kid my mom kept a plant in case of burns.  Aloe vera is good for some much more it can really help with skin disorders like scalp itch, acne, dandruff, and even sunburn.  I did not know that it could be used as a leave in conditioner.  I have a dog that has very itchy skin.  I used this after giving her a bath an it worked great.  I am recommending  this product because of its versatility.  Also because it is an all natural and organic product.  It comes in a 8 oz. bottle which is enough to last a long time considering that only a small amount is needed.  It absorbs fast, not greasy, no colors, no dyes. and it is not sticky.  i don&#x27;t think  you can ask for more than that.  I received a discount on this product for an honest and unbiased  opinion.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this aloe vera gel. I went to the beach this weekend and although I don&#x27;t get sunburn, I applied this and it felt soothing. It didn&#x27;t leave a greasy film. It also doesn&#x27;t have alcohol added to it like the cheaper brands. Also, it&#x27;s organic and made in the USA. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> This aloe gel is very watery. I have used at least five different brands of 99-100% aloe gel products of my sensitive skin, and none of them was so watery as this. That said, it gives a cooling sensation more so than others i have used, but I still prefer the more viscous products I have owned previously.</li>
            <li> Exactly as it is marketed. Going on smooth without residue and leaves skin smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> This review comes from the female half of the family. Love this Aloe Vera Gel! First, aloe vera is one of Nature&#x27;s great natural remedies and cures. Second, the Amara product is organic. That&#x27;s a must for me. Then, the gel is extracted by cold press -- the plant&#x27;s natural remedy is not damaged by heat or chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end result is that this is the same as if I had harvested my own plants -- without the mess. This is not the cheap stuff from the Whatever-mart that dries stiff and flakes off. The Amara product is the real thing. I find it absorbes quickly into my skin and feels really good. I also massage it into my hair and scalp after shampooing (and leave it in). It gives my hair sleek body. Your hair will love aloe, and it acts as a soft setting gel. On my face and neck, I mix several drops of aloe vera with equal amounts of vitamin C serum, and let it settle into the skin before applying a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amara Organic Aloe gel is odorless, soothing and healing for facial use. It is also good for any skin eruption or irritation anywhere on the body. In my opinion (and Dr. Mercola&#x27;s), no better remedy exists for sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the Amara product is priced right, and beats most other cold pressed aloes. It really is a great buy primarily because of the benefits, and the long time a bottle lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> I have been using aloe vera gel for various purposes for about 35 years.  This is the first time I tried Amara Organics and I think it is superior to other brands. I love the thinner consistency and the fact that it absorbs quickly.  Other products are sticky and some have weird coloring, scents, etc.  Soon after receiving it, my college aged son came home with some painful sunburn on his face and arms.  He hasn&#x27;t like using other brands that I had in the past because they were messy and just sat on the skin like jelly.  He was in quite a bit of discomfort so he reluctantly applied the Amara Organics and he said he really likes it.  It did relieve the pain and he loved that it went on easily and got absorbed quickly.  Amazingly, he had almost no peeling from the burn either.  I feel confident this will work well for any type of burn, insect bite, rash, etc. and am really glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed at first that it didn&#x27;t help with itching too much on my scalp and face, but then I found out from the Dermatoligest that it is a neurlogical problem so that&#x27;s why.  But I love it for a hair conditioner, best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have fine limp hair and now it looks like I have 2 times as much , much fuller and very shiny. Works much better than the very expensive stuff I was using.  My husband gets itchy ears and scratches himself while sleeping and wakes up all bloody.  This healed that up in a couple day and no more itching.  Will keep using and buying.</li>
            <li> Love it . I use this on my face and hair.Everyone need aloe vera gel in there house also great for sunburns.</li>
            <li> not sticky!!! excellent and soothing</li>
            <li> A must have! This Aloe Vera Gel from Amara Organics is made from organic plants grown in the USA, it sinks in leaving my skin smooth and soft, its not greasy or sticky. This is a great Gel that is so versatile, it is able to do many things, a necessary addition to our camping first-aid kit. How awesome to have a single product that can take care of anything from sunburns to bug bites.  Very lightweight and sheer so that it hydrates without being a gooey mess!</li>
            <li> I always like having aloe vera around...especially during summer to treat those nasty sunburns.  My mother in law ended up getting sunburned on her arm from driving and I was so glad that I had purchased this earlier in the week.  She used this and the next day her skin was all better.  The aloe vera immediately soothed and cooled her burn...the best part...it didn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue and it absorbed quickly.  She was afraid that it would be sticky and greasy....this aloe vera was excellent.  Works well and fast!</li>
            <li> Love this gel!  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple weeks and my skin is much softer already.  Also, I appreciate the purity of the Aloe gel.&lt;br /&gt;Amara Organic is a great company to deal with............they want you to be happy with your purchase.</li>
            <li> very nice aloe gel but if you are expecting a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; this is more watery than a gel.  However, it does not have all the additives that outer products on the market contain!  So this is the one to use.  no chemicals!</li>
            <li> Great product at a fair price, has helped me with itchy scalp, and use it every day as a moisturizer on face .</li>
            <li> I use this after every time I work in the garden because it cools the stinging pain and itch I get from the pollen. It really helps releive the symptoms of contact dermatitis in general. I also use it for minor scrapes and bug bites. It is worth having on hand as part of a first aid or itch relief  kit for the family.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and grandma because their skin gets extremely itchy in the summer. Worked like magic! :)</li>
            <li> The absolute BEST EVER</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my Aloe Vera Gel purchase. I am using the gel as part of my hair growth treatment, and I love the soft texture it gives my hair. I highly recommend it for skin and hair care,</li>
            <li> i used it as after sun lotion to sooth my burn , and it works perfectly. Skin goes back to normal and moisture .</li>
            <li> After doing a product review of everything in our house that my family uses, I was dismayed to find that my two &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; bottles of aloe vera - Lily of the Desert and Jason brands - both contain the neurotixin phenoxyethanol. This is the new replacement for SLS (sodium laurel/laureth sulfate) and is bad news. I chose Amara aloe vera because it is organic and very low ingredient, and has none of these ridiculous chemicals in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the consistency is a little looser than the other aloe gels we have used, it applies just as easily, and dries quickly and beautifully with no stickiness. My kids and I would notice this, and it has been just great and I recommend this product with no hesitation. We are very happy with it and will to order from Amara again when this bottle is gone.</li>
            <li> very good organic aloe vera gel.  love it!</li>
            <li> excellent product for my eczema and excellent service</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband. He wears a prosthetic it helps his limb when it gets sore, and his skin begins to break down.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product and the excellent service.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with everything - they also send you an email with information on making recipes with Aloe Vera!  Great company will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice gel, as close to the natural gel coming straight from the plant as you can get.  I use it to hydrate the skin, help with scars, and minor wounds, and certainly minor sunburn.  The price is very fair.  Customer service is superb.  I highly recommend this product and this seller.</li>
            <li> Wonderful quality.  So many uses.  Too many to name.  Great price for the quality and quantity.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> This organic aloe vera gel is just what I needed! I wanted to get some for my first aid kit and have some on me at all times just in case. The bottle arrived safely since it was packed in bubble wrap and was sealed as well. I put some of the gel in a small travel size bottle to carry in my purse and got to use it a couple days ago when I got bit up by mosquitos while I was at work. It definitely helped soothe the itchiness. This product is definitely a must have in any home. There&#x27;s plenty of uses for it and it&#x27;s a good thing to have in your first aid kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I am going through breast cancer radiation therapy and was desperate to find an Aloe Vera Gel that did not stick to my bra!  I really was miserable and so I started reading through the different options that Amazon offered and saw the statement that said &amp;#34;ABSORBS QUICKLY WITH NO STICKY RESIDUE&amp;#34;.  I paid full price for the product and I will do it again and again. As you can imagine on a burned from radiation breast, taking my bra off with the old Aloe Vera products was pure torcher like ripping a bandaid off a sunburn.  With Amara I apply it, let it dry for a few minutes and put my bra on and wear it for the rest of the day with no problems.  It is soothing and long lasting.  I put it on 3 times a day - right after therapy in the morning, again in the afternoon and then just before I go to bed.  Thank you, Amara.  I plan to share this with my other radiation buds and even tell the therapists about it.</li>
            <li> feels good to the touch.  The zie of the bottle is good.</li>
            <li> Love that it doesn&#x27;t have the dyes that you normally see in Aloe Vera!  Works great!</li>
            <li> I use this WONDERFUL product for everything! My favorite way to use it is as &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; for my entire body! You wont find me without this little bottle of miracle juice!</li>
            <li> good natural product. has such a diverse range of benefits. check it out! i love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product! Many uses. Decent shipping time.</li>
            <li> This gel has been very helpful in relieving my itchy skin, do to an autoimmune disorder! While it doesn&#x27;t replace a heavy nighttime moisturizer or steroid creams, during the day it soothes the skin and diminishes the itch. I&#x27;m so happy I ordered this organic product!</li>
            <li> This product has been a Godsend in helping my husband keep his skin in good condition during radiation treatments. We have been applying it at least 3 times per day. Our radiation oncology team had given us a list of approved lotions and one of them was Aloe Vera Gel but I couldn&#x27;t find Aloe without additives until I found Amara Organics on Amazon.com. He is now half way through his treatments and so far it is working out very well.  I am even using it as a moisturizer for my skin. Check with your own team of nurses if you are going through radiation therapy for their input. This is a pure Aloe product which we will continue to use beyond radiation. Thank you Amara Organics.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item with a discount code to review. I must say that it is awesome!  Aloe vera gel is a must have for me. It is very moisturizing for my hair which gets really dry at times. I apply it with my conditioner or alone.</li>
            <li> Aloe vera is like one of those miracle plants - we used to have the actual plant in our house, but we did not take great care of it so eventually it ceased to continue to provide for us. For that reason, I am so glad there are products like this. I was offered this product at a discount in exchange for my fair and unbiased review, and I am so glad I got it! It actually arrived the same day my son got a sunburn on his face, so it was quite timely. We don&#x27;t use that green stuff that they sell in big box stores, only the pure and natural aloe plant like this. I had a perfect opportunity to truly try it out. He put it on his face and stood in front of the fan and said it felt so nice. Additionally the redness in his face also went down. A few of the reasons you should try this aloe vera gel:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ A little goes a long way. Truly it does. It isn&#x27;t a thick globby like gel, it is smooth and really feels lovely.&lt;br /&gt;~ Aloe vera is for more than a sunburn, although a sunburn is what we are most used to using it for. It is also great for problem skin areas, or even just to put on a super itchy bug bite!&lt;br /&gt;~ This product is organic. I always buy organic before I buy non organic, as what goes on my skin is just as important as what goes in my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and I highly recommend it. To show how gel like this is, I took two pictures, one of the gel with my hand cupped, and the other with my hand tilted. It is much more liquidy than the green gel you buy in the store, but I really like it that way! [...] I really do appreciate getting feedback about what I have written, and the feedback I receive helps me to continue to write quality reviews for products I believe in. For a review system to work, all reviews should be honest, whether the product was obtained through Amazon, a store, or received at a discount. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Great Product and Seller was extremely helpful with follow up instructions!</li>
            <li> This aloe Vera is scent less. It is not clumpy. It absorbed well into my skin. It is very gentle and refreshing. It is slightly sticky, but washes off easily.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product, pure and refreshing. I bought it to mix with coconut oil and essential oils to use as a moisturizer. I also used it as a leave-in hair conditioner, and it turned out to be the best hair conditioner ever. Highly recommend. I am a convert. (Great company as well. They sent me an email with instructions about using their product, which I really appreciated.)</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soft and silky!  Amazing results!</li>
            <li> Seemed to heal a moderate sunburn overnight after a very liberal slathering. Also serves as a great mixing agent for other lotions and creams due to it being very pure. Relieves the itch from bugbites on contact as well. Can&#x27;t go wrong here!</li>
            <li> I am using in my dry skin, love it</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;ve been using natural hair cleansers and conditioners for the last couple of months. I use this Aloe Vera gel as a leave-in conditioner on my hair, mixed with a little jojoba oil and sometimes coconut oil. It really makes my thick, curly hair so soft without weighing it down with gunk. So many things to use aloe vera gel for, but right now I use it mainly in my hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent! My worst acne disappeared in 2 weeks.</li>
