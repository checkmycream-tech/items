            <li>Their Argan Oil one is nice too</li>
            <li>Nice smelling lotion &amp; moisturizer</li>
            <li>Their hair products are great and have really great deals but this particular lotion didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>Lovely smell, love it!</li>

            <li>It didn&#x27;t leave a residue and absorbed into my skin very nicely.</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>but I love coconut</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite lotions.  </li>
            <li>It smells fabulous and keeps my skin hydrated for hours!</li>
            <li>One thing, it smells mostly of coconut.</li>
            <li>It smells mostly like soap then the coconut milk shampoo and conditioner that smells way better</li>
            <li>People always ask what scent I am wearing, but I won&#x27;t tell because I don&#x27;t want everyone else smelling like me! :-)</li>
            <li>My daughter and I love this lotion</li>
            <li>I will get more as soon as I can.</li>
            <li>and I think adding more to the formula would make the lotion thicker and longer-lasting.</li>
            <li>cute</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product line to anyone who likes pleasant, subtle-smelling bath and beauty items.</li>
            <li>I love the product, it&#x27;s smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li>should note that my bottle of lotion has absolutely no sparkle or shimmer or anything to it, which I&#x27;m happy about!</li>
            <li>The scent is very pretty and very light, a floral coconut smell that disappears after about an hour or so.</li>
            <li>The lotion smells delicious, but not too overwhelming and it goes on smoothly, adding a little shimmer on the way!</li>
            <li>I use it after my shower and it made my skin so smooth</li>
            <li>i was so happy that i had finally found a lotion that was moisturizing and smelled like heavenly coconut.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s $9 a bottle at my local drug store so it was a great deal when I purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li>i was able to get dressed right after putting on this lotion, no problem.</li>
            <li>This was smooth, non-greasy, and sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>When i first got home with this lotion i fell absolutely in love with the scent.</li>
            <li>I do have to use more than other, thicker formulas, to get good results.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the whole coconut milk line by ORX.</li>
            <li>It smells good but doesn&#x27;t last all day &amp; just makes you glittery.</li>
            <li>scent is wonderful and the lotion is so thick and creamy.</li>
            <li>I wish it had a bit more coconut oil in it, as coconut oil is very nourishing for skin</li>
            <li>My sister who has more normal skin also said it didn&#x27;t moisturise at all!</li>
            <li>as stated before, this is not a thick lotion, so i&#x27;d stick to using it as a refreshing end to a shower in the summer and get something more intense for winter.</li>
            <li>It smells heavenly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, has great scent but the lotion itself is very watery and doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li>I always love the silky soft feeling that leaves my skin!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very milky lotion, and absorbed extremely quickly.</li>
            <li>Smells good but a little to runny for me</li>
            <li>I have fallen in love with OGX products and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back!</li>
            <li>I am very picky with lotion and have probably tried all brands on the market!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I do LOVE AND ADORE THE SMELL of the shampoo and conditioner, somehow the lotion leaves me flat</li>
            <li>It is so creamy, smells absolutely heavenly and makes my skin SUPER soft.</li>
            <li>i was attracted to the smell of this lotion, which smells much stronger in the bottle than on the skin.</li>
            <li>It is not an intense moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Rich &amp; moisturizing all day long.  </li>
            <li>&amp; this did absolutely nothing for other than making my skin glittery (silver glitter) and adding sweet fragrance.</li>
            <li>Then i walked outside and realized this stuff had left me FULL of glitter, not shimmer but glitter.</li>
            <li>I have everything they&#x27;ve made out of this scent, the lotion combined with the body wash makes me soft as well as smell like a tropical beach.</li>
            <li>So far I have not noticed any issues with sensitivity.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that often reacts to chemicals and lanolin.</li>
            <li>This body lotion seems to do a good job of moisturizing without causing any reactions, although it is a bit thin and thus I&#x27;m only giving it four stars.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice scent, isn&#x27;t too thick or runny, absorbs pretty quickly, isn&#x27;t very greasy (I hate greasy lotions!), and of course, moisturizes my skin nicely.  </li>
            <li>Wish I would have known sooner and gotten a replacement..left is new bottle, right pic is previous bottle</li>
            <li>I use a few different lotions every day (keep bottles of lotion in many parts of the house and in my purse), and this one is by far the cheapest per ounce, but seems to work as well as the more expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have super fragrance sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t give me any sort of negative reaction at all.  </li>
            <li>12 hours later, there is a soft, lingering smell of which you get occasional whiffs.</li>
            <li>Not a big on the use of lotion in general</li>
            <li>It came out like really watered down like milk.</li>

            <li> Generic product, I ordered in march just used it as the one I ordered in January was running out, this was like a totally different product. It came out like really watered down like milk.I don&#x27;t even have to put pressure on the bottle it just runs out. Being that this ive been using this since 2013 I know there&#x27;s something off about this one bottle.. Never had this hsppen with any of my previous bottles. Wish I would have known sooner and gotten a replacement..left is new bottle, right pic is previous bottle</li>
            <li> Superb lotion with the use of coconut milk Which is good for your skin. Love it. Smells great and it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>

            <li> Smells amazing.  Lightweight and refreshing.  Perfect summer lotion! Will be purchasing again!!</li>
            <li> and the smell is out of this world!  I love it!  I even use it on my face! Their Argan Oil one is nice too but this is MUCH better!</li>
            <li> This line of products is the best smelling coconut you will ever smell.  If you can&#x27;t get enough coconut, this is the way to go.  The lotion smells delicious, but not too overwhelming and it goes on smoothly, adding a little shimmer on the way! I have super fragrance sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t give me any sort of negative reaction at all.  I won&#x27;t just buy this again; I&#x27;ll probably buy it for as long as it&#x27;s made.</li>
            <li> I got this lotion and then immediately bought the body wash. Love it.</li>

            <li> This lotion is hard to find in the local Wal Mart. I love the product, it&#x27;s smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE IT. Especially combined with the shower gel</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this lotion and I LOVE it! I am very picky with lotion and have probably tried all brands on the market! I&#x27;m leery of trying heavily scented lotions but I love coconut so figured I would give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is wonderful and the lotion is so thick and creamy. Thickness is a key factor for me and this is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried if not THE best! So far I have not noticed any issues with sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I love it! I use it after my shower and it made my skin so smooth and it smells amazing! I would reccomend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I choose it is because I like and it for my loved&lt;br /&gt;and Sometimes I used to buy online&lt;br /&gt;also it&#x27;s good for me to buy something for my</li>
            <li> This was smooth, non-greasy, and sweet smelling. It didn&#x27;t leave a residue and absorbed into my skin very nicely. It is not an intense moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Best smelling lotion!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite lotions.  It has a very nice scent, isn&#x27;t too thick or runny, absorbs pretty quickly, isn&#x27;t very greasy (I hate greasy lotions!), and of course, moisturizes my skin nicely.  My hands get extremely dry and many lotions cause my skin to turn very red and painful, but this one doesn&#x27;t unless my skin is in very bad shape.  I&#x27;ve been using this lotion on a daily basis for about 6 months and plan to buy another bottle when it runs out.  I use a few different lotions every day (keep bottles of lotion in many parts of the house and in my purse), and this one is by far the cheapest per ounce, but seems to work as well as the more expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should note that my bottle of lotion has absolutely no sparkle or shimmer or anything to it, which I&#x27;m happy about!</li>
            <li> Amazing lotion! It smells fabulous and keeps my skin hydrated for hours! One thing, it smells mostly of coconut.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin &amp; this did absolutely nothing for other than making my skin glittery (silver glitter) and adding sweet fragrance. My sister who has more normal skin also said it didn&#x27;t moisturise at all! Useless product.</li>
            <li> When i first got home with this lotion i fell absolutely in love with the scent. i was so happy that i had finally found a lotion that was moisturizing and smelled like heavenly coconut. Then i walked outside and realized this stuff had left me FULL of glitter, not shimmer but glitter. ugh i guess i will just have  to wear this when i go out at night, what a shame.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling lotion &amp; moisturizer</li>
            <li> It smells mostly like soap then the coconut milk shampoo and conditioner that smells way better but it got here 3 days earlier I just was expecting something different then the soapy smell</li>
            <li> Smells good but a little to runny for me</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Rich &amp; moisturizing all day long.  It&#x27;s $9 a bottle at my local drug store so it was a great deal when I purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It smells heavenly and absorbs quickly. People always ask what scent I am wearing, but I won&#x27;t tell because I don&#x27;t want everyone else smelling like me! :-) I combine this with other coconut milk products and I feel like a tropical goddess. I really recommend this product line to anyone who likes pleasant, subtle-smelling bath and beauty items.</li>
            <li> Smells and feels great on my body!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, has great scent but the lotion itself is very watery and doesn&#x27;t last very long, I have to reapply constantly.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this lotion, It&#x27;s hard to find in stores so I checked Amazon. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great product. Too pricey here.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try it because I like the smell of coconut. It was just what I thought. :) The smell is great, I liked the feel of it. I also loved that I didn&#x27;t have a greasy feeling after I put it on. I will get more as soon as I can. Only wish it was a little cheaper. ;)</li>
            <li> Great price  offered through Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that often reacts to chemicals and lanolin. This body lotion seems to do a good job of moisturizing without causing any reactions, although it is a bit thin and thus I&#x27;m only giving it four stars. I do have to use more than other, thicker formulas, to get good results. Moisturizing benefits seem to last all day, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to improve moisture retention over time as some lotions do. The scent is very pretty and very light, a floral coconut smell that disappears after about an hour or so. I wish it had a bit more coconut oil in it, as coconut oil is very nourishing for skin and I think adding more to the formula would make the lotion thicker and longer-lasting.</li>
            <li> I always love the silky soft feeling that leaves my skin!</li>
            <li> I would give it a 5 start if the scent lasted longer and if the scent was a stronger coconut scent.  However is a very nice lotion to get! it does leave a almost non existant glitter trail.  cute</li>
