            <li>but it works great to wash my cats.  </li>
            <li>The rest of my family think it&#x27;s great though.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt really great after I used this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My favorite conditioner for a great price!</li>
            <li>and I loved it</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Very light sweet scent but excellent moisture.</li>
            <li>It has great ingredients and is paraben free.</li>
            <li>Having used Dermorganic conditioner for a couple of years now, I can say it is amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li>Works wonderfully and the pump is very convenient.</li>
            <li>does not leave hair silky and nice feels tangled.</li>
            <li>I also color greys regulary and this product is doing a great job for me right now.</li>
            <li>The salon I go to charges more for this product</li>
            <li>I love these products</li>
            <li>it made my hair look healthier more fuller then stringy.</li>
            <li>The conditioner itself is a usually a great product, but the one I bought had chunks in it and felt old than it should be.</li>
            <li>Cruelty free, vegan, gluten free too!</li>
            <li>Makes it so easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>so you can squeeze it out easily.  </li>
            <li>so I enjoy that.  </li>
            <li>have been using it for a while and definitely can say that conditioner improved my hair greatly.</li>
            <li>I comb it through in the shower &amp; it&#x27;s so easy &amp; quick.  </li>
            <li>, then I let it air dry into my hair -- so amazing!</li>
            <li>Regardless,  it is still worth the price.</li>
            <li>I rarely have any tangles at all.</li>
            <li>Bought this at Ulta first, but it&#x27;s so much cheaper here!</li>
            <li>For someone with thick hair this would be great.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser (who I&#x27;ve been going to for over 21 years) says my hair has never been in better shape, and I can only attribute it to the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I also added the Argan Oil Treatment with it and it will always be in my shower as long as it is available!</li>
            <li>I really like the way my hair felt using this product.  </li>
            <li>They are gentle and give your hair just what it needs.  </li>
            <li>My hair is super fine, so it has too much conditioning and weighs my hair down.  </li>
            <li>Used like this, it lasts a long time &amp; I can easily comb through my hair.  </li>
            <li>My curls are very particular and this never fails to moisturize properly.  </li>
            <li>I live in a very hot weather country, I have very long curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and my hair is half way to my waist and baby fine.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t heavy and leaves you hair feeling soft, yet not baby fine.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t strip my hair, but it leaves it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Doesnt seem to wash out of hair completely.</li>
            <li>It does really well at replinishing moisture following hair coloring.</li>
            <li>worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li>It really conditions and detangles my (natural african american) hair.</li>
            <li>I put a dime sized pump in my hand and work it into my hair (minus my roots and the first 2 inches of my hair)</li>
            <li>every other time I have ordered this it was the real thing.</li>
            <li>My hair is very thick, long, curly/wavy, so most conditioners just don&#x27;t do the job even when I use a ton of it.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This can make it hard to use, and you don&#x27;t need it so thick -</li>

            <li> I love this conditioner! It really conditions and detangles my (natural african american) hair. It has great ingredients and is paraben free.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner we have found for curly hair. It isn&#x27;t heavy and leaves you hair feeling soft, yet not baby fine. Our hair is addicted to this product!</li>
            <li> Love it! Makes curly hair behave.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully and the pump is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my daughters hair. Makes it so easy to comb through. Also a great deal on price.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used!  Natural ingredients, with no strong chemical odor to it.  My hair is very thick, long, curly/wavy, so most conditioners just don&#x27;t do the job even when I use a ton of it.  This lasts a long time; it is so thick that on cold days it doesn&#x27;t want to come out of the pump. This can make it hard to use, and you don&#x27;t need it so thick - so  I use it by removing the pump and squeezing some into a plastic squirt condiment bottle and adding water to it so you can squeeze it out easily.  2 parts conditioner to 1 part water, shaken up.  I comb it through in the shower &amp; it&#x27;s so easy &amp; quick.  Used like this, it lasts a long time &amp; I can easily comb through my hair.  Love it!</li>
            <li> The conditioner itself is a usually a great product, but the one I bought had chunks in it and felt old than it should be.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT like the one at my salon!  This one leaves my hair feeling greasy and looking dirty.  The salon I go to charges more for this product so I thought I would buy it online.  I purchased the one at the salon after this one left my hair looking and feeling horrible.  No problems with the salon one.</li>
            <li> Having used Dermorganic conditioner for a couple of years now, I can say it is amazing stuff.  It doesn&#x27;t strip my hair, but it leaves it soft and manageable. A little goes a long way, and it has natural ingredients. It helps to detangle as well.</li>
            <li> every other time I have ordered this it was the real thing. This last time the conditioner is not the same. does not leave hair silky and nice feels tangled. Same with shampoo. Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> My hair feels silkier and softer than it ever has before buying the expensive $80+ bottle from the salon. After I have washed my hair I put a dime sized pump in my hand and work it into my hair (minus my roots and the first 2 inches of my hair), then I let it air dry into my hair -- so amazing!</li>
            <li> Bought this at Ulta first, but it&#x27;s so much cheaper here! Regardless,  it is still worth the price. I&#x27;ve incorporated this into my co-wash routine and I&#x27;m not turning back. Cruelty free, vegan, gluten free too! Very light sweet scent but excellent moisture. I have very sensitive skin yet I haven&#x27;t broken out once with this.</li>
            <li> Very small bottle, not worth the money</li>
            <li> I love these products</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work well for my hair but it works great to wash my cats.  My hair is super fine, so it has too much conditioning and weighs my hair down.  The rest of my family think it&#x27;s great though.  For someone with thick hair this would be great.</li>
            <li> I tried the Dermorganic shampoo because it was recommended to me and I loved it so I ordered the Dermorganic Daily Hydrating Conditioner. I was using an other conditioner with the shampoo until this one came and it was night and day! Using them both together is what works. My comb goes thru my hair like butter when I wash it and my hair is half way to my waist and baby fine. I rarely have any tangles at all. Its the best combination I have ever had. I also added the Argan Oil Treatment with it and it will always be in my shower as long as it is available!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only conditioner that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair frizzy, fried, or damaged feeling.  My curls are very particular and this never fails to moisturize properly.  Would recommend to anyone with curly hair.</li>
            <li> I live in a very hot weather country, I have very long curly hair. I also color greys regulary and this product is doing a great job for me right now.</li>
            <li> Someone recommended this product to me.  She was my hair dresser but I do not like to pay the prices that my hair dresser charges.  I really like the way my hair felt using this product.  It is not to smelly so I enjoy that.  My hair felt really great after I used this conditioner.  I would recommend this shampoo to any customer.</li>
            <li> Very heavy. Doesnt seem to wash out of hair completely.</li>
            <li> I have used Dermorganic for years now.  My hairdresser (who I&#x27;ve been going to for over 21 years) says my hair has never been in better shape, and I can only attribute it to the shampoo and conditioner.  They are gentle and give your hair just what it needs.  My hair is thick and a little wavy and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> My favorite conditioner for a great price!</li>
            <li> have been using it for a while and definitely can say that conditioner improved my hair greatly. worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li> This hair care product was prescribed by my hairdresser. It does really well at replinishing moisture following hair coloring. Cost is great and shipping and packaging were awesome.</li>
            <li> my hair was dry  &amp; damaged on the ends I started using this &amp; just matter of 2 days of use it made my hair look healthier more fuller then stringy.</li>
