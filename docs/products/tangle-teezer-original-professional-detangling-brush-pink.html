            <li>Does not even feel like I&#x27;m brushing my hair! :)  </li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>

            <li>Easy on hair.</li>
            <li>really easy to brush the hair.</li>
            <li>I can easily comb through it now.</li>
            <li>This brush makes combing out my daughter&#x27;s hair quick and far more pleasant for everyone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on my straight fine hair when I couldn&#x27;t find my own brush.</li>
            <li>Please, its easy to clean out any hair that gets stuck after each use.</li>
            <li>But I used it primarily while hair was drenched in conditioner</li>
            <li>My daughter enjoy brush her hair with this.</li>
            <li>something a 6 year old is reluctant to do- even on a good day.</li>
            <li>Plus the girls I nanny love playing with the cute funny shaped pink brush and will even brush their own hair without bribery with this!</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li>It is really worth to buy!</li>
            <li>recommend, it has improved her situation to the point where she actually likes to brush her own hair - what more can I say?</li>
            <li>Love it much</li>
            <li>This brush does not pull my hair out at all and my hair can be SUPER knotted up</li>
            <li>I wish I could be as enthusiastic about this product as many other reviewers.  </li>
            <li>All right with the the purchase and delivery.</li>
            <li>My daughter has thick curly hair and this does a great job getting the tangles out after she bathes.</li>
            <li>This gizmo really works!</li>
            <li>For the first time in a while I could brush sections of my hair from roots to ends.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I found something that actually worked on my tangles.</li>
            <li>so it really helped the knots slide right out.</li>
            <li>I struggle with tangles daily and this brush makes it so incredibly easy to eliminate them.</li>
            <li>My daughter has fine hair that requires regular care and maintenance...</li>
            <li>Makes my life so much easier to get all my tangles out.</li>
            <li>gentle teeth.</li>
            <li>but I think that is the point, so they gently remove the knots in your hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>No more tears for frizzy haired kids or fine haired kids!  </li>
            <li>However, I would recommend this for little girls because their thinner hair can be combed through with this quite easily and without tears.</li>
            <li>The bristles are flexible and not very hard</li>
            <li>My Granddaughter is extremely sensitive and it often comes to tears when I brush her hair.  </li>
            <li>This brush is actually very flexible with tiny bristles that will weave through my tangles.</li>
            <li>My daughter, for whom I bought the brush, told me that the brush hurt her just as much as her regular brush did.  </li>
            <li>Very useful, keeps the kids hair tangle free after showers, pool, or even a bad nights sleep.</li>
            <li>It works very well on my 4B/C curly hair, whether dry or wet.</li>

            <li> This brush makes combing out my daughter&#x27;s hair quick and far more pleasant for everyone. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t seem to break her very fine hair. Totally worth the money!</li>

            <li> All right with the the purchase and delivery.</li>
            <li> Perfect detangling brush for any child… No more battles with your daughter over brushing her hair anymore! The best ever!</li>
            <li> I heard about this watching a Youtube video, instantly opened my Amazon app and bought it. It works wonders! I keep my hair platinum and we all know lightening your hair can make it dry, it was always a wreck to try and brush thru while wet, not anymore! I&#x27;ve recommended this to a ton of friends already!</li>
            <li> My daughter has fine hair that requires regular care and maintenance...something a 6 year old is reluctant to do- even on a good day. The &#x27;hair brushing&#x27; routine has always been a difficult/impossible time! I must admit, to my shock and amazement - this hair brush WORKS!!!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend, it has improved her situation to the point where she actually likes to brush her own hair - what more can I say? Absolutely INCREDIBLE!</li>
            <li> really easy to brush the hair.</li>
            <li> This has been a lifesaver for me.  I have really thick curly hair that always ends up tangled, and trying to get through the tangles is a nightmare.  Not anymore!  This brush doesn&#x27;t hurt at all and it cuts way down on de-tangling time.  I have a lot of styling tools, but this one is a must have for everyone.</li>
            <li> It is really worth to buy! I did not feel any pain when I use tangle geezer! Best comb forever!</li>
            <li> I 100% swear by the Tangle Teezer. I have really thick hair and it&#x27;s just awful to comb out.. I heard about this baby from a good friend of mine and she told me she loved it, so I thought what the hell, I&#x27;ll try it. I&#x27;ve had it for months and I recently got 260 gram extensions, that&#x27;s a lot of damn hair! It works so much better than a loop brush, which is what you&#x27;re suppose to use. As a hair stylist, I totally recommend this &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34;. I won&#x27;t use at regular brush anymore!</li>
            <li> While this does work well, it didn&#x27;t quite meet my hopes. Running it through my hair hurt less than a standard brush but it took a lot longer and couldn&#x27;t always get through knots. For really bad tangles I would have to brush with this and then go back with a normal brush. However, I would recommend this for little girls because their thinner hair can be combed through with this quite easily and without tears. Plus the girls I nanny love playing with the cute funny shaped pink brush and will even brush their own hair without bribery with this!</li>
            <li> I have to start by saying, thank you to Shaun P.  What used to take me close to an hour now takes me 22 minutes.  Literally, I timed it.  I have long, thick hair.  Combing through my hair after a wash was always a struggle.  My arms would get tired; I would sweat like a bandit, and would have to rest after getting through each section of my hair.  I have never been one to brush my hair when it was wet; so I was skeptical about using a (detangling) hairbrush.  But I thought I would try it, even though I had never heard of it before.  What a difference!  Now I can wash, condition, detangle, comb, braid and go – all within 22 minutes.  It still takes my hair two days to dry completely because it’s so thick (I will not use blow dryers), but that’s okay; I’m just happy I can easily comb through it now.</li>
            <li> I should have bought this long time ago. My hair is always tangled beyond repair. This brush is actually very flexible with tiny bristles that will weave through my tangles. Works 100%.</li>
            <li> Does not even feel like I&#x27;m brushing my hair! :)  That says a lot for a naturally curly, thick lady! Love love love!</li>
            <li> This brush does not pull my hair out at all and my hair can be SUPER knotted up and it gets all of the knots out. I love this brush. It is really good for people who are tender-headed. The bristles are flexible and not very hard but I think that is the point, so they gently remove the knots in your hair. Best brush I have ever owned and worth every cent.</li>
            <li> the price and quality is very good</li>
            <li> Works great as shampoo aid as we&#x27;ll53 INDEPENDENCE AVE&lt;br /&gt;BRAINTREE, MA, 02184</li>
            <li> Best detangler ever! My kid loves this brush.</li>
            <li> Best thing for tangled hair since the invention of sliced bread!  No more tears for frizzy haired kids or fine haired kids!  Love it, every house should have one!!</li>
            <li> I wish I could be as enthusiastic about this product as many other reviewers.  My daughter, for whom I bought the brush, told me that the brush hurt her just as much as her regular brush did.  It is a cute brush but not the miracle brush it is made out to be.</li>
            <li> Saved my hair! I am so glad I found something that actually worked on my tangles. I struggle with tangles daily and this brush makes it so incredibly easy to eliminate them. I wish I would have found this before chopping a great amount of my hair off due to tangles :(</li>
            <li> I LOVE it! I would highly recommend this.</li>
