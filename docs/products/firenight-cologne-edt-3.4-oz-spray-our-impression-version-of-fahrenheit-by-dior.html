    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Really great!!</li>
            <li>Customer service was great too!</li>
            <li>Freaking awesome!</li>
            <li>I am happy for it, prise is very nice, also smell</li>
            <li>I had Fahrenheit and girls loved the smell as did</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve done a good job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>More I use it the more</li>
            <li>and I will probably order more just based on the price point.  </li>
            <li>This is very similar, as I cannot tell the difference and the price is the best offer you can get.</li>
            <li>outstanding and for the price</li>
            <li>This makes for an excellent daily cologne, and you just can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>If you love Fahrenheit buy this now.  </li>
            <li>Realy good, but not fahrenheit, it is firenight, smell is very close to fahreinheit.</li>
            <li>Smells like the real thing!!!</li>
            <li>Smells exactly the the original, maybe even better.</li>
            <li>I have been using original FAHRENHEIT for over 15 years.  </li>
            <li>You get what you pay for but is better than paying through the nose for the real stuff.</li>
            <li>Not a bad knock-off.</li>
            <li>Only drawback to this &amp;#34;version&amp;#34; is that the sillage and longevity are moderate at best.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that right on the box they do not claim to be the original stuff</li>
            <li>Try it, $15.00 is worth the risk</li>
            <li>You JUST can&#x27;t beat the price and FOR ME it gets really close to the original fragrance.</li>
            <li>Very close to the original (1988)</li>
            <li>Firenight is very close and since it is so cheap I can wear it as much as I want.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting great smelling</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve used item</li>
            <li>When I first spray it on my skin</li>
            <li>If you really like the original stuff but can&#x27;t afford it or if you need to have the original fragrance handy in a glove compartment or back pack while going on a hike or a long trip, this is the one you want to have with you.</li>
            <li>Now to be honest,, I&#x27;m not a heavy cologne guy, but when I was younger</li>
            <li>If you really want Fahrenheit, you&#x27;ll just have to buy Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>Regardless, the bottle that was shipped to me is a very close match to the real thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked and have come to the conclusion that if you are looking for a deal on an imitation, you will not find anything better than this deal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really not a bad scent, but only lasts about an hour to two hours even with four to five sprays.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in a pinch and want to smell decent for an hour or two, try this stuff out.  </li>
            <li>It has a decent smell, somewhat close to Fahrenheit</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s WAY better than those little bottles of oil that aren&#x27;t even close.</li>
            <li>Smells pretty similar to the original, not exact, but pretty close.</li>
            <li>The scent does not last for the whole day or any thing like that but for the price I&#x27;d spray this stuff on all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Smells very close to the original,Although not exactly.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Firenight actually smells like a long lost cousin of Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> Fahrenheit scent which unfortunately has undergone 4 reformulations over the past 25 years partly to do with allergic reactions of some individuals and partly to do with trying to maintain a &#x27;fresh&#x27; and current appeal to both existing and new consumers  ....  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t purchase imitation colognes, but Fahrenheit has always been a bit more on the expensive side (compared to say, a similar size bottle of Drakkar or Coolwater),</li>
            <li> CAREFULLY ITS NOT THE RESL THING</li>
            <li> it you can tell it is different but after a few minutes it smells almost identical.  </li>
            <li> keep it in my back pack and rub on a little here and a little there.</li>
            <li> It has never gone down in price and you&#x27;ll never see it lying at the bottom of WAl</li>
            <li> &quot; on the little bottle.  </li>
            <li> One bottle usually last me a year because it is expensive</li>
            <li> Firenight Cologne has an identical aroma (at least on my skin) as Farenheit at about 60% to 70% savings.  </li>
            <li> Again, it&#x27;s really not that bad</li>
            <li> you just can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> ITS FAKEA BOOT LEG STINKS READ THE AD</li>
            <li> This fragrance for me is bad.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a crap shoot as to whether or not it will smell like candy or grandma&#x27;s Lysol-jacked bathroom - not even attempting to be close to Fahrenheit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> being said, Firenight isn&#x27;t terrible.</li>

            <li> If you really like the original stuff but can&#x27;t afford it or if you need to have the original fragrance handy in a glove compartment or back pack while going on a hike or a long trip, this is the one you want to have with you. You JUST can&#x27;t beat the price and FOR ME it gets really close to the original fragrance.

I like the fact that right on the box they do not claim to be the original stuff (See Pics)</li>
            <li> Very close to the original (1988) Fahrenheit scent which unfortunately has undergone 4 reformulations over the past 25 years partly to do with allergic reactions of some individuals and partly to do with trying to maintain a &#x27;fresh&#x27; and current appeal to both existing and new consumers  ....  Only drawback to this &amp;#34;version&amp;#34; is that the sillage and longevity are moderate at best.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t even close to the sense of Farenheight.</li>
            <li> Really great!! Bought it as a gift!</li>
            <li> Now this cologne smells just like Fahrenheit. I&#x27;m very satisfied. I&#x27;ll be ordering this again.Customer service was great too!</li>
            <li> Long lasting great smelling</li>
            <li> More I use it the more I like- First time I&#x27;ve used item</li>
            <li> Smells like the real thing!!! YEEAAAA</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP ITS FAKEA BOOT LEG STINKS READ THE AD CAREFULLY ITS NOT THE RESL THING ITS A KNOCK OFF. SAVE UR MONEY WISH I CAN GET MY MONEY BACK</li>
            <li> Fahrenheit cologne has been out since 1988. It has never gone down in price and you&#x27;ll never see it lying at the bottom of WAl-Mart clearance rack for one reason; it&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, Firenight isn&#x27;t terrible. It&#x27;s WAY better than those little bottles of oil that aren&#x27;t even close. You know, it says \\&quot;Versace\\&quot; on the little bottle.  Then, you get it and it&#x27;s a crap shoot as to whether or not it will smell like candy or grandma&#x27;s Lysol-jacked bathroom - not even attempting to be close to Fahrenheit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firenight actually smells like a long lost cousin of Fahrenheit. It&#x27;s really not a bad scent, but only lasts about an hour to two hours even with four to five sprays. If you&#x27;re in a pinch and want to smell decent for an hour or two, try this stuff out.  Again, it&#x27;s really not that bad and I will probably order more just based on the price point.  I have Fahrenheit and basically use Firenight as another cologne, not a replacement.  If you really want Fahrenheit, you&#x27;ll just have to buy Fahrenheit. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Smells very close to the original,Although not exactly.A bargain compared to the actual brand.</li>
            <li> This fragrance for me is bad.</li>
            <li> Firenight Cologne has an identical aroma (at least on my skin) as Farenheit at about 60% to 70% savings.  Try it, $15.00 is worth the risk is you&#x27;re on a budget like myself.</li>
            <li> It has a decent smell, somewhat close to Fahrenheit but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  You get what you pay for but is better than paying through the nose for the real stuff.</li>
            <li> Now to be honest,, I&#x27;m not a heavy cologne guy, but when I was younger I had Fahrenheit and girls loved the smell as did I. This is very similar, as I cannot tell the difference and the price is the best offer you can get. I&#x27;ve looked and have come to the conclusion that if you are looking for a deal on an imitation, you will not find anything better than this deal.</li>
            <li> outstanding and for the price</li>
            <li> Not sure why people are complaining; may make sense if this company has had quality variance with certain batches. Regardless, the bottle that was shipped to me is a very close match to the real thing. I usually don&#x27;t purchase imitation colognes, but Fahrenheit has always been a bit more on the expensive side (compared to say, a similar size bottle of Drakkar or Coolwater), so I wasn&#x27;t going to fret about about $12 shipped to my door for Firenight. Very pleasantly surprised. They&#x27;ve done a good job. This makes for an excellent daily cologne, and you just can&#x27;t beat the price. Give it a shot; $12 isn&#x27;t that big of a gamble.</li>
            <li> Not a bad knock-off. Smells pretty similar to the original, not exact, but pretty close. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Realy good, but not fahrenheit, it is firenight, smell is very close to fahreinheit. I am happy for it, prise is very nice, also smell is like a fahrenheit.</li>
            <li> Freaking awesome! Smells exactly the the original, maybe even better. At a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> I have been using original FAHRENHEIT for over 15 years.  One bottle usually last me a year because it is expensive but I don&#x27;t get to wear it as often as I would like.  Firenight is very close and since it is so cheap I can wear it as much as I want.  When I first spray it on my skin it you can tell it is different but after a few minutes it smells almost identical.  My wife could not tell the difference.  Is it Fahrenheit?  No! But it is so close and so affordable you just can&#x27;t go wrong.  So it gets a solid 5 stars from me.  If you love Fahrenheit buy this now.  Hell get 2 bottles.</li>
