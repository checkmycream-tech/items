            <li>Great if you like to cut hair and such.</li>
            <li>It cuts smoothly.</li>
            <li>These days its really great when you buy a top quality item and down the road</li>
            <li>But its even better when the part is an exact replacement that fits and works just like the original part.</li>
            <li>It fits as if it was the original one</li>

            <li>We needed a new blade for our clippers, and this one fit the bill.</li>
            <li>and since the original Oster blade has worn out, I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to place the blade directly over the mounting holes when tightening it in place.</li>
            <li>and I installed it on the first try and it</li>
            <li>This blade perfectly fit my 20+ year old Oster clippers.</li>
            <li>The blades arived late but they work great.</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s more practical to order a new blade then having an old one sharpened.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast shipment!</li>
            <li>Clippers got to where they would not cut, ordered these, and now they cut like new!!  </li>
            <li>I have to cut my whole family&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and it is a very shatp blade.  </li>
            <li>A much smoother cut.</li>
            <li>This is identical to the original blade, so buy a few a make sure to change them regularly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I used to spend extra time going over missed spots but a fresh blade is all I needed.  </li>
            <li>We can tell we have a new replacement.</li>

            <li> Will order more when they get dull again!</li>
            <li> Oster clippers in general are long lasting, as are the blades, but these fixed ones (i.e. not interchangable without some work) are a little harder to sharpen.  </li>
            <li> bought at less than half price , bought a whole bunch , I have had no luck ever having these sharpened but at this price it was cheaper than sharpening them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long time since I changed the blade, and it made all the difference.</li>
            <li> The blade set wasn&#x27;t sharp enough to cut my either of my horse&#x27;s mane.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I spent so much time using a dull blade before.  </li>
            <li> One of the few times I actually ordered something</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d expect  the blades to be sharp.</li>
            <li> blade is super sharp and makes hair cutting a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very sharp and cuts evenly.</li>
            <li> I dropped my clippers and had a few teeth missing.</li>
            <li> This blade was purchased as a replacement for one which was identical except that it had two broken teeth due to having been dropped.</li>

            <li> Nice a sharp when arrived, works great.  Oster clippers in general are long lasting, as are the blades, but these fixed ones (i.e. not interchangable without some work) are a little harder to sharpen.  This one has an excellent edge and has kept it for a few months now without signs of dulling through steady use.</li>
            <li> This blade was purchased as a replacement for one which was identical except that it had two broken teeth due to having been dropped. It&#x27;s nice to have all the teeth when cutting hair. Replacement required a screwdriver and the ability to use it. It&#x27;s important to place the blade directly over the mounting holes when tightening it in place.</li>
            <li> Clippers got to where they would not cut, ordered these, and now they cut like new!!  Will order more when they get dull again!</li>
            <li> Perfect everything came like it said and everything works like new. Great if you like to cut hair and such.</li>
            <li> Great price. I looked at supply  places in my area. Alot more money for this blade. Great value. I use my clippers every day at work so its nice to get this at a good price.</li>
            <li> bought at less than half price , bought a whole bunch , I have had no luck ever having these sharpened but at this price it was cheaper than sharpening them</li>
            <li> I dropped my clippers and had a few teeth missing. This works wonderfully as a quick fix. Good as new!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I spent so much time using a dull blade before.  After getting this, the difference is night and day.  I used to spend extra time going over missed spots but a fresh blade is all I needed.  This is identical to the original blade, so buy a few a make sure to change them regularly.</li>
            <li> Needed a replacement blade for clippers.  Works great.  Gives the dogs a cool cut for the hot and humid weather in Louisiana.</li>
            <li> I have to cut my whole family&#x27;s hair (most of them guys) and since the original Oster blade has worn out, I needed a new one.  I was very glad that you still had this particular one available.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Love this brush and great quality. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These replacement blades did the trick. Old Oster now works like new and the dog has a great looking coat now.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted at a great price. Arrived quickly. Brand new in packaging and couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
            <li> These days its really great when you buy a top quality item and down the road you end up needing a replacement part and can find it. But its even better when the part is an exact replacement that fits and works just like the original part. It pays to buy products from companies like Oster.</li>
            <li> Great product, as decribed. It cuts smoothly. It fits as if it was the original one and it is a very shatp blade.  Would Definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> One of the few times I actually ordered something and I installed it on the first try and it worked!&lt;br /&gt;The blade is super sharp and makes hair cutting a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s more practical to order a new blade then having an old one sharpened.</li>
            <li> This blade perfectly fit my 20+ year old Oster clippers. It&#x27;s been a long time since I changed the blade, and it made all the difference. A much smoother cut. Thanks for the fast shipment!</li>
            <li> I have schnauzers. They are double coated dogs and regular clipper blades do nothing. These blades cut through the hair easily. Being able to groom your own pet saves so much money.</li>
            <li> We needed a new blade for our clippers, and this one fit the bill. Very sharp and cuts evenly. We can tell we have a new replacement.</li>
            <li> the best ever!!! 10 stars!</li>
            <li> The blade set wasn&#x27;t sharp enough to cut my either of my horse&#x27;s mane. You&#x27;d expect  the blades to be sharp.</li>
            <li> The blades arived late but they work great. I would recommend them to anyone. The site worked well. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great product at a fantastic price with lightening fast shipping!!  Great seller!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
