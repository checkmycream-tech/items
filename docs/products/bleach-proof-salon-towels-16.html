            <li>I will order some more .</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure of how the quality of towels would be</li>
            <li>The towels look to be a good quality and held up to the first washing well.</li>
            <li>I think these will do fine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll most likely order from them again since the quality is good for the price.</li>
            <li>The bleach proof concept of the towels has not been put to the test yet, but so far I am quite pleased with them.</li>
            <li>The towels are okay as I am not getting to much fabric falling off the new brand towels.</li>
            <li>great thick towel, worth the money absorbant and color resistant, just as described.</li>
            <li>I like the product and would order more towels in the future.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>These towels are nice and fluffy and absorbent.</li>
            <li>They are holding up nicely after quite a few washings.</li>
            <li>Customers are okay with these towels and the color due to color and highlights.</li>
            <li>These towels came in quickly and appears to be exactly what I expected them to be.  </li>
            <li>had these towels for about a month now and holding up very well so far.</li>
            <li>and I still have not tested the advertised claim that they are bleach proof, but I believe they will live up to the claim.  </li>
            <li>I have a salon with 15 stylists and have bought many towels over the past 12 years....</li>
            <li>They get washed almost daily (salon use) only had 2 so far that started to have the threading come loose.</li>

            <li> Hard to say since they have only been in the wash twice.</li>
            <li> disappointed I usually get my towels in the beauty supply house and thought these would be better there not</li>
            <li> will update in a few months to say how they hold up.</li>

            <li> disappointed I usually get my towels in the beauty supply house and thought these would be better there not</li>
            <li> We would and will buy them again.</li>
            <li> These towels are nice and fluffy and absorbent. They are holding up nicely after quite a few washings. I would recommend these salon towels.</li>

            <li> Always great:)  note that these are bleach proof, but not color proof! Color will still deposit on these towels.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great towels.</li>
            <li> had these towels for about a month now and holding up very well so far. They get washed almost daily (salon use) only had 2 so far that started to have the threading come loose. Also still holding up to bleaching. Would buy them again.</li>
            <li> No stain , great for bleach , no string . I will order some more . The price here is  a lot cheaper than the beauty supplies</li>
            <li> They seem to have somewhat fallen apart in the wash but it could have happened because it got wrapped around the spin cyle.  Hard to say since they have only been in the wash twice.</li>
            <li> These towels came in quickly and appears to be exactly what I expected them to be.  The price was fair and the quality good.  I think these will do fine.  I have not laundered them yet and I still have not tested the advertised claim that they are bleach proof, but I believe they will live up to the claim.  These are comparable to other towels I have purchased for use in a beauty salon.</li>

            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure of how the quality of towels would be so I  purchased one set to see...I&#x27;ve had them for a few weeks now and was surprised that they are holding up well and so I went ahead and made another order.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll most likely order from them again since the quality is good for the price.</li>
            <li> Great towels for salons! Hold up great in washer and dryer too!</li>
            <li> A lot of the towels were discolored</li>
