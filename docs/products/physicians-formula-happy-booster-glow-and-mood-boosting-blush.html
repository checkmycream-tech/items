            <li>This blush is a very nice color on my skin.</li>

            <li>but, this color would look good on anyone.</li>
            <li>It is on the light side so perfect for day wear.  </li>
            <li>Good product but damaged in shipping-</li>

            <li>Really nice blush.</li>
            <li>I liked the color and texture, and would repurchase this product.</li>
            <li>I am super duper happy to have found this product.  </li>
            <li>The color is a neutral so good for cool or warm</li>
            <li>Very pretty.subtle unless you put on darker.came in good time.good buy!</li>
            <li>I think just darker the skin the more brush strokes.</li>
            <li>and I can use this as a cover up, powder or blush, lovely compact with mirror and sponge</li>
            <li>Most blushes \\&quot;scream\\&quot; when you apply them to your skin, almost as if you would want people to know you were wearing blush.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>It gives my cheeks a very nice natural looking color</li>
            <li>Other than that it is flawless.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s has pretty packaging and smells nice.</li>
            <li>Healthy glow without needing much!</li>
            <li>The hearts are pretty :)</li>
            <li>I found nothing special about this blush.</li>
            <li>It wakes up my whole face and puts me in a better mood.  </li>
            <li>It has a very pretty finish and works with almost any skin color.</li>
            <li>I admit that the little hearts make me happy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny because I don&#x27;t need much and it goes on easily</li>
            <li>I am so happy about that too since this is such a cute little blusher that I just really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li>This blush is very gentle.</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t&#x27; use the brush that comes with it, use a regular blush brush and you&#x27;ll have way better coverage.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite make-up product in the bag, but I wear it occasionally.</li>
            <li>It goes on really smoothly and is buildable so if I want a little more pop of color I can achieve that.</li>
            <li>I really like this blush.</li>
            <li>The product is very sheer/transparent.</li>
            <li>I got it in Natural because I felt that Rose would be too pink for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally wear blush</li>
            <li>The natural really does look natural.</li>
            <li>which I should since I am so white (haha)</li>
            <li>I chose the color natural as I have paler skin</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>One application is all it takes to have a natural look.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who goes for that natural, glowy look.</li>
            <li>I would suggest a better blush brush, as the one given is weak.</li>

            <li> but I have never really found one that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of shimmer to it and that doesn&#x27;t make me look like a clown.</li>
            <li> Its also a lot tinier than expected.</li>
            <li> It can make you appear very pink, so apply carefully.</li>
            <li> Its very flat headed and I&#x27;m used to round brushes.</li>
            <li> It does come with a little mirror and a brush..</li>
            <li> I like it for summer, gives a little pinkish/bronze glow.  </li>
            <li> I have very dark skin</li>
            <li> I have a pale complexion and this blush completes my make-up.  </li>
            <li> Love this product but received it totally broken :(</li>
            <li> The brush on the other hand is a little tacky looking and annoying to apply.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>

            <li> I really like this blush. I don&#x27;t normally wear blush which I should since I am so white (haha) but I have never really found one that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of shimmer to it and that doesn&#x27;t make me look like a clown. This one doesn&#x27;t! I am so happy about that too since this is such a cute little blusher that I just really wanted to like it. I got it in Natural because I felt that Rose would be too pink for me. The natural really does look natural. It gives my cheeks a very nice natural looking color and I don&#x27;t look painted up or anything. It goes on really smoothly and is buildable so if I want a little more pop of color I can achieve that.</li>
            <li> The product is very sheer/transparent. It feels like you don&#x27;t see anything being applied but with just three brush strokes theres a beautiful blush finish. It has a very pretty finish and works with almost any skin color. I have very dark skin and it stands out perfectly on my skin. I think just darker the skin the more brush strokes. Other than that it is flawless. The brush on the other hand is a little tacky looking and annoying to apply. Its very flat headed and I&#x27;m used to round brushes. Its also a lot tinier than expected. If you join your pointer finger and thumb together to form a circle thats how big it is.</li>
            <li> Really nice blush. I keep coming back to it even though I have a ton of blush from other companies. Don&#x27;t&#x27; use the brush that comes with it, use a regular blush brush and you&#x27;ll have way better coverage.</li>
            <li> Love it! Healthy glow without needing much!</li>
            <li> This blush is a very nice color on my skin. It&#x27;s has pretty packaging and smells nice. It does have some sparkle in it but it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> I liked the color and texture, and would repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> I chose the color natural as I have paler skin but, this color would look good on anyone. Really great blush. It is on the light side so perfect for day wear.

            <li> I like it for summer, gives a little pinkish/bronze glow.  It&#x27;s funny because I don&#x27;t need much and it goes on easily but I tried to use it on my daughter for a dance recital and it just wouldn&#x27;t show up on her.  I have medium skin, no olive tones.</li>
            <li> Good product but damaged in shipping-</li>
            <li> If you need alittle color then this is the blush to use.</li>
            <li> I found nothing special about this blush. The hearts are pretty :)</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and I can use this as a cover up, powder or blush, lovely compact with mirror and sponge exceeded my expectations. When I washed it off no redness at all.</li>
            <li> This blush is very gentle. Most blushes \\&quot;scream\\&quot; when you apply them to your skin, almost as if you would want people to know you were wearing blush. One application is all it takes to have a natural look. It also smells amazing! I recommend this to anyone who goes for that natural, glowy look. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Ok.  I admit that the little hearts make me happy.  I have a pale complexion and this blush completes my make-up.  It is the perfect color of blush for me.  It wakes up my whole face and puts me in a better mood.  I have never been a huge fan of blush because oftentimes I end up looking like the joker because the color is all wrong.  I am super duper happy to have found this product.  :)</li>
            <li> Love this product but received it totally broken :(</li>

            <li> Very pretty.subtle unless you put on darker.came in good time.good buy!</li>
            <li> Not pigmented. Will not rebuy.</li>
