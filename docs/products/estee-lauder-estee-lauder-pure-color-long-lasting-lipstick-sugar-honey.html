            <li>this lipstick is a very nice color, am happy with it, but it fades very quickly, needs to be reapplied often and what I don&#x27;t like is the taste of it.but its overall a nice purchase,</li>
            <li>Having ordered it for myself, I still love it.</li>
            <li>but this is pretty good.</li>
            <li>one of my favorite lipsticks not only does it look great</li>
            <li>Amazing thank you very helpful!</li>
            <li>Are they genuine?  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>well worth my money!</li>
            <li>I first saw this color on a friend, and thought it was lovely.</li>
            <li>It last for a good while as well</li>
            <li>Doubt it true brand name lipstick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about it.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Firstly, this is a lipstick that comes from the gift bag, and not the full priced lipstick that is shown on the main picture.</li>
            <li>I am not sure but it is a good quality product.</li>
            <li>It really brightens up my face.</li>
            <li>So really unimpressed about that.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved the speedy delivery and of course you can never go wrong with Estee Lauder make up.</li>
            <li>I do like the color, but these lipsticks are watered down versions of the full priced ones.</li>

            <li> Pinker than I expected so</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars only because the tube was a little different from what I purchase usually; just the tube, but not the lipstick itself.  </li>
            <li> I thought the color is dark and will stay in for awhile</li>
            <li> Tube was small, not a full sized lipstick.</li>
            <li> not sure if i&#x27;ll buy this again...</li>
            <li> Disappointed, but wasn&#x27;t going to the trouble of returning it.</li>
            <li> Horrible purchase.</li>
            <li> Very very bad!  </li>

            <li> Estee Lauder makes the absolute best lipstick. The smell is lovely, and the texture is great. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color! Goes on smooth. Packaged well. I bought it because I wanted long lasting wear and it was supposed to be, but saying it lasts 20 min would be pushing it.</li>
            <li> I thought the color is dark and will stay in for awhile</li>
            <li> good medium &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; color for me</li>
            <li> I ordered Sugar Honey lipstick. I received Sugar Honey Shimmer. It was a gloss version of the lipstick I ordered.  Disappointed, but wasn&#x27;t going to the trouble of returning it.</li>
            <li> this lipstick is a very nice color, am happy with it, but it fades very quickly, needs to be reapplied often and what I don&#x27;t like is the taste of it.but its overall a nice purchase, not sure if i&#x27;ll buy this again...</li>
            <li> Nice product. Not the colour I ordered but this is pretty good. I uses it ofter. It last for a good while as well</li>
            <li> very nice, excellent product</li>
            <li> Color received was not what was listed. Tube was small, not a full sized lipstick. Doubt it true brand name lipstick. Horrible purchase.</li>
            <li> I loved the speedy delivery and of course you can never go wrong with Estee Lauder make up.</li>
            <li> Very very bad!  The lipstick came without a case / box and the color does not look like the picture at all.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite lipsticks not only does it look great it makes my lips feel great!!! well worth my money!</li>
            <li> I first saw this color on a friend, and thought it was lovely. Having ordered it for myself, I still love it. It really brightens up my face.</li>
            <li> Lipstick is just what I use.  I gave it four stars only because the tube was a little different from what I purchase usually; just the tube, but not the lipstick itself.  I will definitely try to purchase again.</li>
            <li> Firstly, this is a lipstick that comes from the gift bag, and not the full priced lipstick that is shown on the main picture. So really unimpressed about that. I do like the color, but these lipsticks are watered down versions of the full priced ones.</li>
            <li> one of the best brand that gives me Restraint to use their product its colors are excellent and moisturizer</li>
