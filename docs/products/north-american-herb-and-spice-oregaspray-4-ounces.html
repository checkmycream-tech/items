            <li>Awesome stuff!  </li>
            <li>but this spray is wonderful for uses where the oil is not as convenient....such as \\&quot;under the arms\\&quot; and elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>It is one of the best remedies in nature for healing...</li>
            <li>This product is exceptional!  </li>
            <li>Great product delivered as promised thank you</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to spray around to get rid of odors as well.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended this product and it does work great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the best kept secrets, and I&#x27;d almost like to keep it that way to make sure I always have a supply.  </li>
            <li>It is very strong though, aroma wise and taste wise!</li>
            <li>: If it&#x27;s really good for you, don&#x27;t expect it to taste like candy.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s good to take with a water or juice chaser.</li>
            <li>I wrote to them and thanked them for their wonderful customer support....just as important as getting a good product at a good price....</li>
            <li>forgot to mention how wonderful I think this seller is and would recommend them highly !!!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Although the product itself is very good, I don&#x27;t think it is worth $4.87 per ounce, but that&#x27;s just my opinion.</li>
            <li>This stuff is spectacular ...</li>
            <li>It whacks viruses right out of your body, it deordorizes the air, it repells bugs, and much more!!  </li>
            <li>I make sure my grown kids keep a supply in their homes every winter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the capsules, and read that the spray is even more potent because it works faster.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scent is refreshing and cleansing.</li>
            <li>We love the smell.</li>
            <li>This is an ideal natural, safe underarm deodorant spray, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>We use this for many purposes.</li>
            <li>Check the label - so many uses.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to hear about this about 18 months ago and always make sure I have it on hand and take it with me when I travel.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using this for about two years and we love it.  </li>
            <li>even as a spray to clean produce!  </li>
            <li>it has so many fabulous qualities for health....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true!  </li>
            <li>The scent and taste are strong and takes some getting use to</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic for sore throats.</li>
            <li>Leaves the house smelling fresh and the oils, like oregano, boost the immune system being anti viral, bacterial and anti fungal!</li>
            <li>I clean my fresh fruits and vegetables with it.</li>
            <li>Worth it though if nothing else will bring relief.</li>
            <li>but they are worth it.</li>
            <li>Not exactly tasteful but good to spray in the throat for colds, sore throat and/or sinuses.  </li>
            <li>however, they stepped up right away, with no hesitation, and took care of the problem immediately.  </li>
            <li>I sprayed the Oreagaspray on my leg three times a day (sometimes onto a band-aid) and it finally started to create a scab and now it is smooth!  </li>
            <li>Maybe for others, they see that it is worth that much.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>So it was very upsetting to get the package to find out</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s highly antiseptic.  </li>
            <li>would recommend it highly</li>
            <li>I would think that a product such as this which &amp;#34;retails&amp;#34; around $38 and is &amp;#34;on sale&amp;#34; for around $19, it would be reasonable to believe that a spray that is $4.87/count is a &amp;#34;count&amp;#34; referring to a bottle of the product.  </li>
            <li>It preserves my leafy green vegetables for up to 3 weeks after I clean them.</li>
            <li>I use this primarily to spray it in the back of my throat to knock down a cough or relieve a sore throat it works wonders, Ha if you can take the hit of a couple sprays in your throat, might drop you to your knees for a minute.  </li>
            <li>Unless this advertisement is changed to clearly indicate it is a price per ounce, I can only assume it is an intentional misleading.  </li>
            <li>At the first sign -just open wide and spray 2-3 spurts on the back of the throat.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I had a stubborn eczema spot on my leg that just would not completely heal--even with Rx steroid cream!  </li>

            <li> did I say I was fanatic.  </li>
            <li> I can only say I like this spray because it taste so very bad, but it does work.  </li>
            <li> no problem using all the ime to kill germs on contact.i spray this every where i feel the need to kill germs or bad bacteria</li>
            <li> I use this on my kids pillows and blankets when they get sick, spray it in the car to battle germs and spray it on a cloth to inhale when I&#x27;m sick.</li>

            <li> Great product delivered as promised thank you</li>
            <li> Good as a mosquito repellent</li>
            <li> I use this primarily to spray it in the back of my throat to knock down a cough or relieve a sore throat it works wonders, Ha if you can take the hit of a couple sprays in your throat, might drop you to your knees for a minute.  Worth it though if nothing else will bring relief.</li>
            <li> I am truly fanatic about ORegaSpray and oil of Oregano in general.  I only buy the North American Herb and Spice brand, because it is the strongest.  I use it for everything.  It&#x27;s highly antiseptic.  Read the book by Dr. Cass Ingram, \\&quot;The Cure is in the Cupboard,\\&quot; for the hundreds of ways you can use these products.  It&#x27;s one of the best kept secrets, and I&#x27;d almost like to keep it that way to make sure I always have a supply.  I clean my fresh fruits and vegetables with it. You can use the oil or spray. I just spray and rinse. I spray my countertop and sink with it.  It preserves my leafy green vegetables for up to 3 weeks after I clean them. It&#x27;s fantastic for sore throats. At the first sign -just open wide and spray 2-3 spurts on the back of the throat. Even if I&#x27;ve been around or near someone with a cold, etc. I spray my throat for safekeeping. THe capsules are excellent for infections, colds, etc.  I&#x27;ll stop...did I say I was fanatic.  It cleans the air in rooms, kills mold.....&#x27;nuf said?  I make sure my grown kids keep a supply in their homes every winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OBTW: If it&#x27;s really good for you, don&#x27;t expect it to taste like candy.</li>
            <li> I heard about oregano oil benefits on the Dr. Oz TV series in January and decided to try it out on my skin rash.  I had a stubborn eczema spot on my leg that just would not completely heal--even with Rx steroid cream!  I sprayed the Oreagaspray on my leg three times a day (sometimes onto a band-aid) and it finally started to create a scab and now it is smooth!  If you read the label, it has a plethora of uses...even as a spray to clean produce!  GREAT STUFF!  (o:</li>
            <li> Truly a multipurpose spray. Use it if your throats getting sore or feel a cold coming on and it really seems to help. It does burn a bit so it&#x27;s good to take with a water or juice chaser. It&#x27;s great to spray around to get rid of odors as well.</li>
            <li> This product is exceptional!  I&#x27;ve used the capsules, and read that the spray is even more potent because it works faster.  It&#x27;s true!  I use this product for several purposes.  It whacks viruses right out of your body, it deordorizes the air, it repells bugs, and much more!!  I&#x27;m planning to stock up on this product for the winter!</li>
            <li> Not exactly tasteful but good to spray in the throat for colds, sore throat and/or sinuses.  A friend recommended this product and it does work great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years as a purifier for body and environment.  It&#x27;s scent is refreshing and cleansing.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product 100%</li>
            <li> The only oil of oregano I buy is North American Herb and Spice. It is a quality spray with quality plants. I use this on my kids pillows and blankets when they get sick, spray it in the car to battle germs and spray it on a cloth to inhale when I&#x27;m sick. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> no problem using all the ime to kill germs on contact.i spray this every where i feel the need to kill germs or bad bacteria</li>
            <li> This product we used everywhere we goes, and anything and everything in our home. We love the smell. Excellent Product. Thanks</li>
            <li> This is an ideal natural, safe underarm deodorant spray, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> We use this for many purposes. Check the label - so many uses. It is very strong though, aroma wise and taste wise! Try to avoid getting on tongue if taking orally. We use this as a throat spray any time we get sick. Great product!</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I use this  when we feel a sore throat or cold coming on and are able to avoid getting sick. I was so glad to hear about this about 18 months ago and always make sure I have it on hand and take it with me when I travel.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff!  When you get that feeling like you&#x27;re starting to get some throat ailment, spray this a few times in your mouth.  Once the startling taste wears off, you feel amazingly better.  It works for me anyway!</li>
            <li> Oregano oil is a must in each home...it has so many fabulous qualities for health....I have the tincture which I use sublingually but this spray is wonderful for uses where the oil is not as convenient....such as \\&quot;under the arms\\&quot; and elsewhere.  It is one of the best remedies in nature for healing...but like anything else you must use regularly to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it highly and I do....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I forgot to mention how wonderful I think this seller is and would recommend them highly !!! I won&#x27;t go into detail....however, they stepped up right away, with no hesitation, and took care of the problem immediately.  I wrote to them and thanked them for their wonderful customer support....just as important as getting a good product at a good price....THANK YOU AGAIN....</li>
            <li> I use this in our wick style humidifier and it keeps the typical slime to a minimum!  Leaves the house smelling fresh and the oils, like oregano, boost the immune system being anti viral, bacterial and anti fungal!</li>
            <li> I can only say I like this spray because it taste so very bad, but it does work.  Had sore throat and a cold starting up sprayed this and took my oreganol pills and like magic everyone else was sick for days but I was not.</li>
            <li> I just recently got a kidney transplant and I basically don&#x27;t have an immune system. I started using this when I think I get colds, I just spray it in my mouth. It feels like they instantly go away. I swear by this product now. I was in the hospital for 10 days with about 10 mouth ulcers and the doctors couldn&#x27;t fix it until I went home and discovered this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend it to people who get sick easily or want to prevent it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is spectacular ...It heals everything. I had a cancer crusty start on my ear. The doc said she would remove on my following appt. I sprayed my ear 2x a day and it disappeared in 2 weeks. The doc was astounded.</li>
            <li> I would think that a product such as this which &amp;#34;retails&amp;#34; around $38 and is &amp;#34;on sale&amp;#34; for around $19, it would be reasonable to believe that a spray that is $4.87/count is a &amp;#34;count&amp;#34; referring to a bottle of the product.  So it was very upsetting to get the package to find out it is $4,87 per OUNCE.  Unless this advertisement is changed to clearly indicate it is a price per ounce, I can only assume it is an intentional misleading.  Although the product itself is very good, I don&#x27;t think it is worth $4.87 per ounce, but that&#x27;s just my opinion. Maybe for others, they see that it is worth that much.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this for about two years and we love it.  We&#x27;ve used it for everything...cleaning, to replace Lysol, to help ease asthma attacks, combat sinus congestion, strep, etc.  The scent and taste are strong and takes some getting use to but they are worth it.</li>
    </ol>
