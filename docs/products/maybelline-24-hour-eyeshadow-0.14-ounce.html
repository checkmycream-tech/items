            <li>I plan to get every color but the purple, the color payoff is streaky at best, even trying to build it up.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed and will be buying more colors!</li>
            <li>I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Stays put even after sweating and swimming and looks great.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re between 15 and 40, it will probably work great for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced no fading, smearing or sinking into creases with this product.  </li>
            <li>Very nice shade.  </li>
            <li>The color is very nice, but the quality...</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more colors; very impressed with the quality of this product!</li>
            <li>Good constancy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because its gorgeous in the pot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 67 and have really good skin, but this shadow caked on my eyelid.</li>
            <li>I Love it!</li>
            <li>I really love this eye shadow!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>but with a good primer under them they are fantastic!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own, but</li>
            <li>I like how this adds a highlight and nice shimmer to my brow bone without dusting my eyebrows or lashes with powder.</li>
            <li>beautiful ice white bright light ideal for the look!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase order fast and effective!</li>
            <li>Or went on easily and lasted for a good bit.</li>
            <li>and I love it more than my MAC paint pots!  </li>
            <li>just had to try it after all the nice reviews, and so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>with a good primer under it they stay just fine, and of course powder shadows on top also help them set.</li>
            <li>I cannot wait to buy more colors of this product.</li>
            <li>Again, I must say how pleased I am with this product.  </li>
            <li>A lovely product</li>
            <li>I like a smooth even coat that lasts all night!</li>
            <li>Love this eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>I tried applying with a brush, but found my finger tip worked better for me.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>this product on one of my favorite beauty bloggers websites</li>
            <li>I wont be buying any more Maybelline eye makeup.</li>
            <li>I love this gel eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>I just simply love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s awesome, and it lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>It stays on all day, is easy to apply with my fingertip, and I love the frosted look.  </li>
            <li>As Taupe is very matte, no shimmer, but gorgeous when applied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, stays put, and looks great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Beautiful but the white is cakey.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, last all day !!!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the color of this eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>Does not apply smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Color too light.</li>
            <li>Super easy to put on and lasts awhile.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much, it&#x27;s honestly a part of my daily eye makeup routine.</li>
            <li>The colour is beautiful and works excellent as a shadow base.</li>
            <li>Too Cool has been a nice&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn Too Cool this way for 18 hours or so with no creasing issues at all.</li>
            <li>Definitely not 24 hour, but still good for me.</li>
            <li>But if you do want it off, it&#x27;s pretty easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>Great as a primer for other eye shadows as well.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily and really stays and stays and stays until I remove my makeup</li>
            <li>Favorite eyeshadow by far,</li>
            <li>and then it comes right off.</li>
            <li>I need to say is it has a very visible brightening color, I don&#x27;t even need a brush or a sponge, I use clean fingers.</li>
            <li>Just make sure your skin is taunt or you&#x27;ll probably run into the same problem I did.</li>
            <li>I was totally satisfied, so I ordered the white.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need much at all!</li>
            <li>I always seem to be looking for bright white colors to use as a highlighter just below my eyebrow and in the inner corner of my eye.  </li>
            <li>I find it easy to apply with simply my finger.  </li>
            <li>I use a synthetic concealer brush to apply, and it&#x27;s easy to get a sheer wash or to build up the color.</li>
            <li>The product is smooth and really does last all day.  </li>
            <li>I do blend it to keep it from being too white which it does do if I don&#x27;t smooth it.  </li>
            <li>really does stay on all day and does not crease.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really go on very well</li>
            <li>and you couldn&#x27;t really see it.</li>
            <li>Too much</li>
            <li>I really like this eyeshadow</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, stays on a very long time.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much I am going to buy some of the other colors!</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and live in the high desert, but it looks lovely all day.  </li>
            <li>I use Too Cool as a base for brightly colored powder eyeshadows, primarily.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend staying away from this color, unless you want tons of glitter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as easy to put on as other cream eye shadows I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>These products are worth the money, I highly recommend this one because it can be used for several things.</li>
            <li>This is a very vibrant sparkly white color that lasts a long time and is easy to apply using your fingertips.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay a lot for it because it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li>and it lasts all day long :) Even when falling asleep with it on a couple times, it was still intact the next day.</li>
            <li>high duration easy to place makeup perfect summer night or as a base for shadows!</li>
            <li>I swatched this on my hand, its a gorgeous frosty white, great as a base for shadows, for the inner corner of your eye or alone blended as a highlighter.</li>
            <li>It helps them to stay on well, even helping prevent glitter fallout slightly, and since it is a frosty white it makes the colors placed on top of it really pop.</li>
            <li>I used it under a light green shadow and the color showed up highly pigmented and stayed in place.</li>
            <li>love this product and really does what the description says I only use small amounts</li>
            <li>It was a huge waste of money &amp; my time trying to apply it.</li>
            <li>I have VERY oily skin, especially my eyelids.  </li>
            <li>Very pearly white.</li>
            <li>I think this is a young person&#x27;s eye shadow.</li>
            <li>I wore the swatch all night and the next morning it looked exactly the same as it did when I applied it!</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly, is highly pigmented and last all day.</li>
            <li>The white color (too cool) is way to glittery and can not even be used as a good base--</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin, so I do find that it doesn&#x27;t last all day, but I think for someone with dry skin, it would stay on all day.</li>
            <li>as sometimes the glitter is a little much for daytime wear.  </li>

            <li> as sometimes the glitter is a little much for daytime wear.  </li>
            <li> I did also purchase the bronze which doesn’t stay put as long as the white but still works well enough for my oily Japanese eyes.  </li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t last as long as the others, I&#x27;ve noticed, but does last long for a white.</li>
            <li> Long lasting</li>
            <li> cool\\&quot; color I didn&#x27;t receive is a white color that I need to set off the other colors I ordered.</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy again and am looking forward to trying out the other colors in this series.</li>
            <li> Being Japanese, my upper lids fold over onto themselves and turn any shadow art I attempt into a greasy stripe inside the fold within a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I can usually get a white to last on my lids for maybe an hour, this one lasted almost 4-5.</li>
            <li> When I tested a different color of Color Tattoo I had some creasing after a few hours on</li>
            <li> so be careful.  </li>
            <li> Nice base for other shadows.</li>
            <li> It improves the color payoff of my other eyeshadow and it kept my eyeshadow from creasing and smudging.  </li>
            <li> I have tried to apply it by itself and with other products but it just doesn&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
            <li> This wears for hours without creasing or fading and I used it as a base or highlighter mostly.</li>
            <li> Just a little touch glisten-ups just where you want it.</li>
            <li> It went on patchy, which I don&#x27;t get because it wasn&#x27;t dried out at all.  </li>
            <li> color is uneven</li>
            <li> I thought the product may be dried</li>
            <li> It is pretty glittery, but I use it as a base and apply powder eye shadow over it so it doesn&#x27;t seem as sparkly then.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking that it wouldn&#x27;t crease or smear for at least 8 hours</li>
            <li> I did read other reviews that was difficult to apply</li>
            <li> Not good for eyes.</li>
            <li> After hearing rave reviews &amp; comparisons to MAC&#x27;s Paint Pots, I got this color and Tough</li>
            <li> Tough</li>
            <li> In stead of the \\&quot;too cool\\&quot; color I ordered, I received \\&quot; tough as taupe\\&quot; which is a brown color.</li>
            <li> I actually use this as an eyeshadow base and it makes the colors pop!</li>
            <li> It is very difficult for me to find shadows that stay put</li>
            <li> I got this shadow in Bad to Bronze color</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t even get to finish my makeup before it had done both badly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use as a eyeshadow base</li>
            <li> When you use it as a base you can make any color pop.</li>
            <li> I hate that!</li>
            <li> In fact, it looks horrible in just couple hours.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> beautiful ice white bright light ideal for the look! high duration easy to place makeup perfect summer night or as a base for shadows! I&#x27;m happy with my purchase order fast and effective!</li>
            <li> I have VERY oily skin, especially my eyelids.  Being Japanese, my upper lids fold over onto themselves and turn any shadow art I attempt into a greasy stripe inside the fold within a few hours.  It is very difficult for me to find shadows that stay put but this one does.  I find it easy to apply with simply my finger.  I did read other reviews that was difficult to apply but I did not find this so.  It stays put through work and my yoga or jog after work.  I did also purchase the bronze which doesn’t stay put as long as the white but still works well enough for my oily Japanese eyes.  I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I got this shadow in Bad to Bronze color &amp; it was creased within an hour of applying it.  It went on patchy, which I don&#x27;t get because it wasn&#x27;t dried out at all.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay a lot for it because it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Very white and shiny. Stays put even after sweating and swimming and looks great. I am very impressed and will be buying more colors!</li>
            <li> I use this under my brow , in the eye corners and under the eye a bit.  Very nice shade.  I do blend it to keep it from being too white which it does do if I don&#x27;t smooth it.  Nice base for other shadows.</li>
            <li> Good constancy. Very pearly white.</li>
            <li> After hearing rave reviews &amp; comparisons to MAC&#x27;s Paint Pots, I got this color and Tough As Taupe. I swatched this on my hand, its a gorgeous frosty white, great as a base for shadows, for the inner corner of your eye or alone blended as a highlighter. I wore the swatch all night and the next morning it looked exactly the same as it did when I applied it! I plan to get every color but the purple, the color payoff is streaky at best, even trying to build it up. It&#x27;s a shame because its gorgeous in the pot. Tough As Taupe is very matte, no shimmer, but gorgeous when applied. The Orange is also matte. These products are worth the money, I highly recommend this one because it can be used for several things.</li>
            <li> Maybelline 24 Hour Eyeshadow, Too Cool has been a nice&lt;br /&gt;Addition to my make-up. Just a little touch glisten-ups just where you want it.</li>
            <li> I think this is a young person&#x27;s eye shadow. I&#x27;m 67 and have really good skin, but this shadow caked on my eyelid. If you&#x27;re between 15 and 40, it will probably work great for you. Just make sure your skin is taunt or you&#x27;ll probably run into the same problem I did.</li>
            <li> In stead of the \\&quot;too cool\\&quot; color I ordered, I received \\&quot; tough as taupe\\&quot; which is a brown color. The \\&quot;too cool\\&quot; color I didn&#x27;t receive is a white color that I need to set off the other colors I ordered.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use as a eyeshadow base and I love it more than my MAC paint pots!  The product is smooth and really does last all day.  It improves the color payoff of my other eyeshadow and it kept my eyeshadow from creasing and smudging.  I love this product so much I am going to buy some of the other colors!</li>
            <li> I actually use this as an eyeshadow base and it makes the colors pop! I Love it! I cannot wait to buy more colors of this product.</li>
            <li> 24 hour last isn&#x27;t a lie</li>
            <li> The color is very nice, but the quality... Well, you get what you paid for.  I have used Chanel before and it cannot be compared.  In about 6-7 hours, my eyelids would feel irritated, I could not wait to get it off.</li>
            <li> After seeing this eye shadow advertised in a magazine, I went to Amazon to see how others had rated it.  I have used powder eye shadow all my life, and decided to try the bronze.  I was totally satisfied, so I ordered the white. as I have always used white beneath my brows for accent.  Again, I must say how pleased I am with this product.  It stays on all day, is easy to apply with my fingertip, and I love the frosted look.  I have very dry skin and live in the high desert, but it looks lovely all day.  I am deciding which color I want to try next.  I have tossed my pressed powder shadows away.  A lovely product and it comes in a glass container, not plastic!!</li>
            <li> I really love this eye shadow! I have really oily skin, so I do find that it doesn&#x27;t last all day, but I think for someone with dry skin, it would stay on all day. It&#x27;s as easy to put on as other cream eye shadows I&#x27;ve tried. It is pretty glittery, but I use it as a base and apply powder eye shadow over it so it doesn&#x27;t seem as sparkly then.</li>
            <li> color is uneven I hate that! I like a smooth even coat that lasts all night! Cant find it I will keep looking!!</li>
            <li> Substandard friable texture; it does not last all day at all. In fact, it looks horrible in just couple hours.  Unreturnable product, which I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the color of this eyeshadow.  You can add a lot to your eyelid to make it really white, or you can just put on a very sheer layer.  Great as a primer for other eye shadows as well.  Super easy to put on and lasts awhile.</li>
            <li> I need to say is it has a very visible brightening color, I don&#x27;t even need a brush or a sponge, I use clean fingers. I&#x27;ve been getting compliments, and I only used this. I don&#x27;t need much at all! Plus, it lasts ALL day, must have!</li>
            <li> The white color (too cool) is way to glittery and can not even be used as a good base--I highly recommend staying away from this color, unless you want tons of glitter.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeshadow.  It&#x27;s long-lasting and brightens my eyes, which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I was worried that these shadows wouldn&#x27;t work for me, as I have oily eyelids and cream shadows are iffy... but with a good primer under them they are fantastic! I use Too Cool as a base for brightly colored powder eyeshadows, primarily. It helps them to stay on well, even helping prevent glitter fallout slightly, and since it is a frosty white it makes the colors placed on top of it really pop. I use a synthetic concealer brush to apply, and it&#x27;s easy to get a sheer wash or to build up the color. When I tested a different color of Color Tattoo I had some creasing after a few hours on it&#x27;s own, but with a good primer under it they stay just fine, and of course powder shadows on top also help them set. I&#x27;ve worn Too Cool this way for 18 hours or so with no creasing issues at all. If I ever use up the pot I&#x27;ll definitely be looking to buy another!</li>
            <li> I like how this adds a highlight and nice shimmer to my brow bone without dusting my eyebrows or lashes with powder. It&#x27;s easy to apply, stays put, and looks great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: It&#x27;s sheer, not opaque. Don&#x27;t expect a solid white color.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much, it&#x27;s honestly a part of my daily eye makeup routine. Favorite eyeshadow by far, and it lasts all day long :) Even when falling asleep with it on a couple times, it was still intact the next day. But if you do want it off, it&#x27;s pretty easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> just had to try it after all the nice reviews, and so glad I did.  I tried applying with a brush, but found my finger tip worked better for me.&lt;br /&gt;This really does stay on all day and does not crease.  I would like to try a matte as sometimes the glitter is a little much for daytime wear.  It goes on easily and really stays and stays and stays until I remove my makeup and then it comes right off.</li>
            <li> I had heard a outs this product on one of my favorite beauty bloggers websites so I picked it up and I&#x27;m so glad I did! This wears for hours without creasing or fading and I used it as a base or highlighter mostly. Hours later, it looked like I just applied it. When you use it as a base you can make any color pop. I used it under a light green shadow and the color showed up highly pigmented and stayed in place. Would definitely buy again and am looking forward to trying out the other colors in this series.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really go on very well and you couldn&#x27;t really see it.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking that it wouldn&#x27;t crease or smear for at least 8 hours but I didn&#x27;t even get to finish my makeup before it had done both badly. I have tried to apply it by itself and with other products but it just doesn&#x27;t work well at all. It was a huge waste of money &amp; my time trying to apply it. I wont be buying any more Maybelline eye makeup.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t last as long as the others, I&#x27;ve noticed, but does last long for a white. I can usually get a white to last on my lids for maybe an hour, this one lasted almost 4-5. Definitely not 24 hour, but still good for me.</li>
            <li> Beautiful but the white is cakey. I thought the product may be dried so I purchased another with the same result. I&#x27;ve tried the bronze color and it was not cakey.</li>
            <li> I always seem to be looking for bright white colors to use as a highlighter just below my eyebrow and in the inner corner of my eye.  This is a very vibrant sparkly white color that lasts a long time and is easy to apply using your fingertips.  The eyeshadow has a consistency somewhere between a gel and a cream.  I will be purchasing more colors; very impressed with the quality of this product!</li>
            <li> Gloppy, does not blend.</li>
            <li> When added in corners of eye lids, it makes your eyes pop.  Too much and you look like a ghost so be careful.  Long lasting but  don&#x27;t leave on for 24 hours.  Not good for eyes.</li>
            <li> I really like this eyeshadow, it&#x27;s awesome, and it lasts all day long. The colour is beautiful and works excellent as a shadow base. I would definitely repurchase this item.</li>
            <li> love this product and really does what the description says I only use small amounts so I will b ordering again in the future</li>
            <li> Will not buy again.  Does not apply smoothly.  Color too light.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, last all day !!!</li>
            <li> I love this gel eyeliner.  Or went on easily and lasted for a good bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced no fading, smearing or sinking into creases with this product.  It glides on smoothly, is highly pigmented and last all day.</li>
            <li> I just simply love this stuff.  Goes on easy, stays on a very long time. My go to eye product.</li>
