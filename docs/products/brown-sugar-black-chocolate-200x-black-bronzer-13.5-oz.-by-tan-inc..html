            <li>Still looking for something better.</li>

            <li>It goes on smooth and i love the smell i love the no burnt skin after odor</li>
            <li>I love it thanks!!!</li>
            <li>Most important its easy shopping for me because i always know what lotion</li>
            <li>Be sure to clean your hands well before you tan.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>the bottle presentation is nice and shipping was fast</li>
            <li>Super cheap compared to in any stores around here.  </li>
            <li>This is the only tanning lotion that has worked on me this good.</li>
            <li>and I tan pretty easily</li>
            <li>Got here quickly.</li>
            <li>Stellar product!</li>
            <li>i will keep this very simple and say I LOVE this lotion!</li>
            <li>I used every last drop of this tanning lotion because I loved it so much.</li>
            <li>DEF WORTH BUYING.</li>
            <li>but I put it 3rd cause to be honest</li>
            <li>and I actually have a really nice tan..</li>
            <li>Feels wonderful on my skin, and really took dark to a new level.</li>
            <li>2nd is the smooth texture that makes it easy to spread and apply.</li>
            <li>The color of the lotion comes out dark which lead me to believe the lotion would provide good color.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful scent and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Got dark real fast and amazing color</li>
            <li>I tried this product for the first time in a trial package from my tanning salon.</li>
            <li>Mostly when i only tan like 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a lotion that would make me darker and this worked for the first couple of times I tanned.  </li>
            <li>Maybe better for someone just starting out to tan.  </li>
            <li>This product left me with noticeable color which is great because recently I have been tanning in a high pressure bed</li>
            <li>This lotion created a nice, dark brown color, not the oompa-loompa orange that some lotions leave.</li>
            <li>Buy Moisturizer to keep a nice dark tan</li>
            <li>A nice dark brown.</li>
            <li>Brown Sugar Black Chocolate 200x Black Bronzer by Tan Inc. is awesome !</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>and I was very allergic to the product after using 3x.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t absorb very well either.</li>
            <li>Very please with the service and product.</li>
            <li>Again as ive posted before im very picky about my tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>Love the smell... and I&#x27;ve only used 3x so far</li>
            <li>Great product, highly recommend this product for a deep dark tan!  </li>
            <li>Other lotions brands like Snooki or luminary have given me a better tan and lasted longer.</li>
            <li>the first bottle didn&#x27;t do that from a different vendor.</li>
            <li>So far I have noticed a darker tan an hour or so after tanning but seems to wash away after showering.</li>
            <li>Super dark yummy bronze..</li>
            <li>Made me dark very fast</li>
            <li>&amp; I am already pretty dark.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get as much color as I expected.</li>
            <li>Will order again in the near future.</li>
            <li>I was already pretty tanned but wanted to get really dark...</li>
            <li>I noticed a lot of new color after just one tan and also got a few positive comments the next day.  </li>
            <li>and I do see a little difference but not as much as I was expecting.</li>

            <li> and I do see a little difference but not as much as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is a knock off or the real brand name lotion</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as other products I&#x27;ve used in the last 4 years</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is much darker than my usual tanning lotion and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> 3rd is the darkness it leaves you dark</li>
            <li> I noticed big difference a few times after using it.</li>
            <li> less then half the price of my tanning salon same lotion</li>
            <li> I am naturally dark skinned</li>
            <li> The lotion does give you some color but your not super dark after using it a couple times.</li>
            <li> In a week of using black chocolate I saw a difference..</li>
            <li> I probably would say this would work for people with very pale skin other than that people who do tan ..</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time tanning</li>
            <li> I come out DARK !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this.</li>
            <li> actually it&#x27;s the worst</li>
            <li> Brown sugar has a horrible bronzer that turned my skin orange.</li>

            <li> I loved this tanning lotion. I can use it one time and already see that i&#x27;m shades darker. This is the only tanning lotion that has worked on me this good. Mostly when i only tan like 2-3 times a week. it will turn you a brownish no orangish.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Great bronzer. Smells great too! I should have bought more! This is now my go to lotion!</li>
            <li> Again as ive posted before im very picky about my tanning lotion. This is the best bronzer ive ever used. It goes on smooth and i love the smell i love the no burnt skin after odor i love my besutiful tan i get from using this product. No stain no streaks no funky discolorations. I alt this with lotion that is a accleration. Most important its easy shopping for me because i always know what lotion im going to buy.</li>
            <li> Wife has tried many different kinds for tanning bed use and likes this one the best.  Enough said.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is a knock off or the real brand name lotion but I love it.  I am already tan but was just looking for something to enhance my tan and this was it.  I noticed a lot of new color after just one tan and also got a few positive comments the next day.  The lotion itself is much darker than my usual tanning lotion and a little goes a long way.  Be sure to clean your hands well before you tan.</li>
            <li> Works great! Just what I needed. As soon as I used this lotion I noticed a difference. Very good price!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT AND SMELLS REALLY GOOD. MY BOYFRIEND AND I BOTH USE AND GIVES US BOTH GOOD COLOR. DEF WORTH BUYING. NO ORANGE HANDS WITH THIS ONE.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth. Nice scent. Bronzer is not overpowering. Don&#x27;t think I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion a great bargain for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;Makes me look brown instead or red... Buy Moisturizer to keep a nice dark tan</li>
            <li> So far I have noticed a darker tan an hour or so after tanning but seems to wash away after showering.</li>
            <li> Jwow works the best. A nice dark brown. Brown sugar has a horrible bronzer that turned my skin orange. I am naturally dark skinned so nothing turns me orange. Except for this product.</li>
            <li> Love,love,love this tanning lotion!! I noticed big difference a few times after using it. I don&#x27;t care to much for the smell afterwards, but this stuff if AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> Good for the price.  Dont be fooled by &amp;#34; dark&amp;#34; they all say that.</li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommend this product for a deep dark tan!  Smells great works better.</li>
            <li> The lotion does give you some color but your not super dark after using it a couple times. I probably would say this would work for people with very pale skin other than that people who do tan .. don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful on my skin, and really took dark to a new level.</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells and works great!</li>
            <li> Bought this product before and loved it but this is turning my hands and tan orange and the first bottle didn&#x27;t do that from a different vendor. Knock off.</li>
            <li> Like this product, nice smell</li>
            <li> This is the most awesome tanning lotion!! I love it thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this lotion... best around</li>
            <li> Brown Sugar Black Chocolate 200x Black Bronzer by Tan Inc. is awesome ! I use this lotion when I upgrade to the FGT Tanning Bed. I come out DARK !!! It has a wonderful scent and a little bit goes a long way. The price is excellent for the product !!!!</li>
            <li> Good color tans evenly worth the money.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as other products I&#x27;ve used in the last 4 years actually it&#x27;s the worst</li>
            <li> Love it!  No streaking and very nice golden tan.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! I have a hard time tanning so when I seen it had 200x bronzer and I&#x27;ve heard this is a great brand, I had to buy it.  Super cheap compared to in any stores around here.  Made me dark very fast and it smells amazing.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> In a week of using black chocolate I saw a difference.. it works great you should try it you will be very happy</li>
            <li> worked great !  less then half the price of my tanning salon same lotion</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lotion that would make me darker and this worked for the first couple of times I tanned.  I was already pretty tanned but wanted to get really dark...this doesn&#x27;t do it.  Maybe if I were starting out, it would work, but not after I&#x27;m already tanned.  Still looking for something better.</li>
            <li> Had a nice smell, but did not work at all for me.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb into the skin either. I tan a lot and have color, wanted to get a darker color and this just did not do it.  I did not see any difference at all.  Maybe better for someone just starting out to tan.  Will be returning.</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever there&#x27;s a lot of things that I like about this lotion. 1st is the scent of the lotion is smells really good like a coconut smell. 2nd is the smooth texture that makes it easy to spread and apply. 3rd is the darkness it leaves you dark but I put it 3rd cause to be honest I always think I can go a bit darker. 4th the bottle presentation is nice and shipping was fast</li>
            <li> Immediate results with this lotion!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best tanning lotion I have ever used!!! I&#x27;m light complected but tan fairly easyily. Just one use for 5 minutes had me hooked.. I don&#x27;t tan often, maybe a couple of 5 minute sessions a week and I actually have a really nice tan.. This is the only lotion I&#x27;ll use from now on.</li>
            <li> Loved it and let my friends use it and they loved as well.they&#x27;re wanting me to order them some as well</li>
            <li> great lotion!!!!! will be buying more!!!! great color and smells very good. and i am a guy!!!</li>
            <li> Got here quickly. Great tanning lotion. Very happy.</li>
            <li> awesome tan going here</li>
