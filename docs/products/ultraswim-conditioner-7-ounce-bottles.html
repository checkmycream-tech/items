            <li>I used the Ultraswim Shampoo and Conditioner religiously after every practice and my hair stayed in perfect condition.   </li>
            <li>A must have to keep your hair healthy.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>If you have thicker or more hair you may need to add a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair looks better now than it did before I started swimming.  </li>
            <li>This one works better.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The Ultra Swim products do what they promise; after an hour or more at the pool, my evening shower ALWAYS includes these.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s meant to be that way, but I&#x27;m used to conditioners that are more like a lotion.  </li>
            <li>It works OK</li>
            <li>Before I used Ultraswim shampoo and felt OK without using the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The result was better but still hair is bit sticky.  </li>
            <li>Love this conditioner, my kids love to swim</li>
            <li>I bought first for me and it works really good.</li>
            <li>cant find this product in any stores near me.very happy with item and pleased with the price i paid online.</li>
            <li>They appear fine, except that we have used 3 bottles already, because when the tops are depressed (closed)they don&#x27;t close well, and often leak.  </li>
            <li>One summer even though I shampooed after each swim my finely textured hair frizzed out.</li>
            <li>detangling)and see if I can finally have a happy hair washing experience.</li>
            <li>This does an excellent job of restoring your hair back to soft feel most people want.</li>
            <li>It never occurred to me to put the conditioner in before swimming to protect against chlorine from the beginning, but I tried it on the bottle&#x27;s suggestion, and the results have been fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great at conditioning hair, especially after swimming.  </li>
            <li>I swim daily and this conditioner (along with the compatible shampoo) has greatly improved my hair.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical this would be good but found it to be excellent.</li>
            <li>Leaves their hair soft, clean and smelling good.</li>
            <li>ships very securely and fast.....</li>
            <li>My daughter is in the pool so much you would expect her hair to be straw, but she is diligent about washing and conditioning with these products and she has amazingly healthy hair.  </li>
            <li>I saw such a good review on this product and the shampoo too.</li>
            <li>In combination with the shampoo it helps keep your hair from during green and brittle and it smells good too!</li>
            <li>and it helps my hair tremendously.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping from this company!</li>
            <li>This conditioner is so runny, not thick like most.</li>
            <li>The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather very well at all, so I ended up adding it to my regular shampoo and was able to create the results I wanted (more lathering ability).  </li>
            <li>Afterwards, my hair is silky and feels extra nice.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve probably tried everything else, right?</li>
            <li>They love to use it, it even makes combing hair much easier than many other conditioners.</li>
            <li>(She&#x27;s 14 and very responsible)</li>
            <li>sure enough, after my shower, I could tell that my hair felt</li>
            <li>These solved the problem and are Ok for daily use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for swimmers!!</li>
            <li>helped SOOO much!</li>
            <li>I could tell that my hair didn&#x27;t feel as good as it had after using the UltraSwim shampoo combo (mixed with my regular shampoo) and the UltraSwim conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have decided that I am going to mix this condition with my regular conditioner (which does a fantastic job</li>
            <li>We have lost much of this product in the swim bags.  </li>
            <li>The next summer I used this product and it&#x27;s combo conditioner and my hair remained smooth.</li>
            <li>I have color treated hair an this product works well without stripping too much color from it.</li>
            <li>I started using this stuff when swimming was really beating up my hair.  </li>
            <li>and I really felt like I was grasping at straws trying to do anything about it.  </li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>Seems to work, but I need to use it for a while to see how it really works.  </li>
            <li>so there was too much</li>
            <li>I swim daily and my hair is soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>quickly her blonde hair started looking &amp;#34;brassy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner left my hair soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>Highly recomended.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since then, I went to have my hair cut and mentioned to my stylist that I had begun swimming regularly in a highly treated pool.  </li>
            <li>My background in swimming comes from competitively swimming in high school and college about 8x a week, for 90 minutes during every swim.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This stuff really puts moisture back in your swimming pool hair and you don&#x27;t need to use very much.</li>
            <li>This product really helps when applied directly after your workout.</li>
            <li>i was able to get the knots out and not have her screaming and crying.</li>
            <li>It helps to keep her looking great despite being subjected to harsh exposure to heavily chlorinated pools</li>
            <li>and it works just like it says and makes your hair very soft as well</li>
            <li>They complement each other nicely and help remove the chlorine smell and rough textures from my hair.</li>
            <li>At first, I had no problems using my regular shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Ultra Swim Conditioner makes my hair softer and more manageable than ordinary conditioners.  </li>
            <li>The results are satisfactory, but if it was a little more effective at removing the chlorine smell and it was a little thicker and less watery, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>My 3 1/2 year old daughter has curly hair.</li>
            <li>and I really like my regular conditioner</li>
            <li>Like really runny regular condi</li>
            <li>Possibly the public pools (in Las Vegas) carry more chlorine than other -I</li>
            <li>Their hair, two very fine and one thick, is left soft and no trace of chlorine smell.</li>
            <li>I have tried more expensive products including Reflect H2O Swim Conditioner, but I believe that this product did just as good a job in keeping my hair black and soft as any other swim conditioner for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Yeah, this stuff is expensive, but if you swim fairly often it&#x27;s much cheaper than other brands per ounce like malibu.</li>
            <li>Without proper hair management, my hair would become brittle over the entire season and gradually become a light brown color when it used to be black.</li>
            <li>The second bottle which I had given to my older niece, used at the same time</li>
            <li>For those who swim frequently in chlorine/bromine pools, helps prevent dryness, especially if applied before swimming under swim cap.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought my children had not closed it properly, until I closed it</li>
            <li>This stuff makes a good stab at getting the hair back to his original bionic construct, but it is not perfect and while it is not super expensive, it is an extra cost over normal hair product.  </li>

            <li> I moved into a new apartment a few months ago and my hair began to feel dull and dry.</li>
            <li> This product took my blonde kiddos hair from crazy crunchy from summer in the pool back to, well, normal hair.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other conditioners after using the UltraSwim shampoo and they just do not work as well for some reason.  </li>
            <li> Even when my hair was wet!  </li>
            <li> This conditioner did not work for me as the other reviews stated.  </li>
            <li> once I started using this conditioner there are no more tangles and brushing their long hair takes only a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> If you use shampoo I recommend to use other conditioner.</li>
            <li> No more straw like hair from the pool or green blonde hair on my kids.</li>
            <li> When you spend hours in the pool every day it&#x27;s impossible to get the chlorine out without special products.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, black hair (male)</li>
            <li> Works well to keep chlorine damage down.</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair, it may leave it a big flat and greasy a few hours out.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown, almost black hair.  </li>
            <li> My daughter uses this and the companion conditioner everyday, often twice a day due to her practice schedule.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a contstant battle to keep his hair looking anything less than fried.  </li>
            <li> Plus it makes my hair so dry and hard like a straw.</li>
            <li> But this conditioner did little to help save my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Used with the UltraSwim shampoo, you won&#x27;t have a problem with straw or green hair.</li>
            <li> My children swim all year round.</li>
            <li> Their hair kept getting a green tint and always smelled of chlorine.</li>
            <li> I wet down my hair before swimming, apply a thin coat of this conditioner, then put on my swim</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s usual softness.</li>
            <li> I usually swim 3-4 times per week and my hair would feel like fiberglass if I didn&#x27;t use this.  </li>
            <li> and I usually leave the conditioner in my hair 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li> this conditioner is no better than anything you would buy from the store.</li>
            <li> (not sure the manufacture changed formula).  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to get it in all over because it&#x27;s so liquid.  </li>
            <li> The hair was hard to comb.  </li>
            <li> her hair was like hay so hard to manage this</li>
            <li> But lately the result hadn&#x27;t been well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick as I would like, but it works well.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner is very thin (diluted) compared to other conditioners I used.  </li>
            <li> At least they worked!</li>
            <li> Swimming often is very hard on hair.</li>
            <li> We are using plastic bags over the bottles, but the waste was disappointing.</li>
            <li> If you swim in public pool and hate dealing with chlorine in your hair , this is a must have.</li>
            <li> Not a great conditioner though</li>
            <li> In that respect, it is the worst conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used; my hair is as knotted after using this product as it is when I forgo conditioner completely.</li>
            <li> Because this conditioner is so expensive, the poor design of this bottle detracts from the value of this product.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in how watered down both the shampoo and conditioner seemed (</li>
            <li> It was a waste of my money. :(</li>
            <li> Seems a bit expensive though.</li>
            <li> I ended up going to the salon and unfortunately had to pay for the expensive shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner is very, very thin.  </li>
            <li> The results were disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect a lot, because frankly I know how bad chlorine is on my hair</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought first for me and it works really good. I swim daily and my hair is soft and healthy. So I decided to get a second set for my niece. Highly recomended.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Works well during the summer for my toe-headed swimmer.</li>
            <li> I moved into a new apartment a few months ago and my hair began to feel dull and dry. A few weeks ago I went to a new hair stylist and she immediately noticed the texture of my hair and asked if I am a swimmer (I&#x27;m not) then she suggested that there was a lot of chlorine in my apartment water. She recommended that I try a shampoo/conditioner that protects against chlorine and so I immediately went shopping on Amazon and came across this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and I have noticed a difference in the texture of my hair - it is back to it&#x27;s usual softness. The reason I gave this conditioner 3 stars is because it also is supposed to be a detangler and this product has no detangling qualities whatsoever. In that respect, it is the worst conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used; my hair is as knotted after using this product as it is when I forgo conditioner completely. My hair is very fine and easily knotted, and combing out my hair has become a painful and frustrating experience since I started using this conditioner. I have decided that I am going to mix this condition with my regular conditioner (which does a fantastic job detangling)and see if I can finally have a happy hair washing experience.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner for swimmers.  Used with the UltraSwim shampoo, you won&#x27;t have a problem with straw or green hair.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Must have for swimmers.</li>
            <li> Love it, it smells good and works wonders.  No more straw like hair from the pool or green blonde hair on my kids.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the UltraSwim Conditioner in helping to improve swimmer&#x27;s hair.  However, my excitement is detracted by the bottles.  They appear fine, except that we have used 3 bottles already, because when the tops are depressed (closed)they don&#x27;t close well, and often leak.  We have lost much of this product in the swim bags.  At first, I thought my children had not closed it properly, until I closed it and it leaked.  The second bottle which I had given to my older niece, used at the same time (She&#x27;s 14 and very responsible) the closed bottle leaked all over her outfit in the bag and bleached it. Because this conditioner is so expensive, the poor design of this bottle detracts from the value of this product. We are using plastic bags over the bottles, but the waste was disappointing.</li>
            <li> This will parallel my review of the shampoo.  This does an excellent job of restoring your hair back to soft feel most people want. I have tried other conditioners after using the UltraSwim shampoo and they just do not work as well for some reason.  Yeah, this stuff is expensive, but if you swim fairly often it&#x27;s much cheaper than other brands per ounce like malibu.</li>
            <li> Excellent chlorine removal hair products. My children swim all year round. Leaves their hair soft, clean and smelling good. Hubby uses it too</li>
            <li> I was skeptical this would be good but found it to be excellent. Works well.</li>
            <li> cant find this product in any stores near me.very happy with item and pleased with the price i paid online.</li>
            <li> If you swim in public pool and hate dealing with chlorine in your hair , this is a must have. When used with Ultraswim conditioner it does an excellent job of taking chlorine out of your hair.</li>
            <li> My 3 1/2 year old daughter has curly hair. This conditioner does NOTHING to get tangles out. It was a waste of my money. :(</li>
            <li> I like using the Ultra Swim Conditioner with the Ultra Swim Shampoo. They complement each other nicely and help remove the chlorine smell and rough textures from my hair.</li>
            <li> What would you expect from the chlorine removing products of Ultra Swim? Excellent, immediate results. Enough said! I recommend this product to anyone that swims.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown, almost black hair.  The type that usually doesn&#x27;t have real complaints when it comes to chlorine.  That was before I started swimming in a hotel pool that LOADS their water with hydrogen peroxide (and salt it tastes like, too!).  At first, I had no problems using my regular shampoo and conditioner.  About a week into swimming every day - even with a cap - and my hair started feeling like straw.  Absolutely horrible.  I tried leaving my regular conditioner in longer and even left some on the ends after my shower in the hopes of helping things.  Didn&#x27;t work.  So I started browsing the web and came across UltraSwim.  Thank goodness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased both the UltraSwim Chlorine-Removal Shampoo and the UltraSwim Conditioner.  I was disappointed in how watered down both the shampoo and conditioner seemed (the reason for giving 4*s and not 5).  The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather very well at all, so I ended up adding it to my regular shampoo and was able to create the results I wanted (more lathering ability).  I made sure to keep the UltraSwim conditioner on the directed 3 minutes and sure enough, after my shower, I could tell that my hair felt better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt that the chlorine-removal properties of the UltraSwim shampoo were what I was experiencing and I really like my regular conditioner, so I stopped using the UltraSwim conditioner and went back to using my regular conditioner.  The results were disappointing.  I could tell that my hair didn&#x27;t feel as good as it had after using the UltraSwim shampoo combo (mixed with my regular shampoo) and the UltraSwim conditioner.  I switched back to the UltraSwim conditioner and the results improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I went to have my hair cut and mentioned to my stylist that I had begun swimming regularly in a highly treated pool.  She said she couldn&#x27;t tell.  Even when my hair was wet!  After another appointment 2 months later - my stylist still can&#x27;t feel any chemical build-up.  If you are at your wit&#x27;s end and just can&#x27;t take it anymore, this is probably a good buy for you.  You&#x27;ve probably tried everything else, right?r wit&#x27;s end and just can&#x27;t take it anymore, this is probably a good buy for you.  You&#x27;ve probably tried everything else, right?</li>
            <li> My background in swimming comes from competitively swimming in high school and college about 8x a week, for 90 minutes during every swim. I have thick, black hair (male) that becomes very rough and coarse over the swim season because I do not wear a swim cap in the pool. Without proper hair management, my hair would become brittle over the entire season and gradually become a light brown color when it used to be black. I have tried more expensive products including Reflect H2O Swim Conditioner, but I believe that this product did just as good a job in keeping my hair black and soft as any other swim conditioner for a fraction of the price. I used the Ultraswim Shampoo and Conditioner religiously after every practice and my hair stayed in perfect condition.   *DISCLAIMER: I will post an almost identical product review on the Ultraswim Shampoo because I believe these products go best \\&quot;hand-in-hand\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This conditioner did not work for me as the other reviews stated.  I even used it with their chlorine removing shampoo specified. Possibly the public pools (in Las Vegas) carry more chlorine than other -I don&#x27;t know.  But this conditioner did little to help save my hair.  I returned it.  Thank you Amazon for being so wonderful on your product guarantee.</li>
            <li> My lifeguards use this through out the summer along with the shampoo.  A must have to keep your hair healthy.  It smells great.</li>
            <li> For those who swim frequently in chlorine/bromine pools, helps prevent dryness, especially if applied before swimming under swim cap.</li>
            <li> Great at getting out chlorine and even helps hair in salt water pools, but watch out.  If you have thin hair, it may leave it a big flat and greasy a few hours out.</li>
            <li> This, along with the UltraSwim Shampoo, is the only thing that works on my sons hair.  He refuses to wear a swim cap so it&#x27;s a contstant battle to keep his hair looking anything less than fried.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff and the shampoo as well.  My daughter is in the pool so much you would expect her hair to be straw, but she is diligent about washing and conditioning with these products and she has amazingly healthy hair.  I buy them by the 4 pack for the best deal.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a competitive swimmer and without Ultraswim shampoo and conditioner her hair looked greenish. These solved the problem and are Ok for daily use. Plus, we add a swim body gel and the chlorine smell is gone. The conditioner is a little thin, but not bad. If you have thicker or more hair you may need to add a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> ships very securely and fast.....best conditioner for the swimmer in the family!</li>
            <li> This product took my blonde kiddos hair from crazy crunchy from summer in the pool back to, well, normal hair.  He had not gotten to the &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; stage, but he could do a spiky do without product.  Works well to keep chlorine damage down.</li>
            <li> Ultra Swim Conditioner makes my hair softer and more manageable than ordinary conditioners.  I usually swim 3-4 times per week and my hair would feel like fiberglass if I didn&#x27;t use this.  I use it along with Ultra Swim Shampoo as soon as I get out of the pool and I usually leave the conditioner in my hair 2-3 minutes. The results are satisfactory, but if it was a little more effective at removing the chlorine smell and it was a little thicker and less watery, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> and it works just like it says and makes your hair very soft as well, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> UltraSwim Conditioner and its UltraSwim shampoo will take the chlorine smell and stiffness out of your hair.  I recommend them both.</li>
            <li> One summer even though I shampooed after each swim my finely textured hair frizzed out. What a disaster. The next summer I used this product and it&#x27;s combo conditioner and my hair remained smooth. It works well with both salt and chlorine  water. I can now swim without worry that my hair will get ruined!</li>
            <li> My son uses this for times a weeks. Great product. Noticeable difference in this hair.</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair an this product works well without stripping too much color from it. I use it after washing my hair once(no repeat) with the UltraSwim shampoo.</li>
            <li> I started using this stuff when swimming was really beating up my hair.  I didn&#x27;t expect a lot, because frankly I know how bad chlorine is on my hair and I really felt like I was grasping at straws trying to do anything about it.  But, this stuff is amazing.  I wet down my hair before swimming, apply a thin coat of this conditioner, then put on my swim cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swim a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I go back to the locker room, wash my hair, reapply conditioner, rinse again, and hit the road.  My hair looks better now than it did before I started swimming.  And, I&#x27;m in the pool 6 days a week.</li>
            <li> Helpful chlorine-removal product, when used in conjunction with the UltraSwim shampoo.  Not a great conditioner though, so I condition with my regular product afterward.  Very fast shipping from this company!</li>
            <li> Daughter loves the way it leaves her hair, this combined with the shampoo.  The multi pack was especially convenient for me due to the lower cost vs buying them one at a time especially since she goes thru it rather quickly due to swim practice everyday.</li>
            <li> Do not know what I would do without it1.  Swimming often is very hard on hair. So, it is great to have a conditioner that helps keep my hair looking and feeling great.  i always wet my hair  and coat it with the conditioner before I go into the water and then I use the ultra-swim shampoo and conditioner when I get out.</li>
            <li> this conditioner is no better than anything you would buy from the store. wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Because I swim 3-5 times a week. I go through a lot of this product. It works great, takes out the chorine and I see no chlorine damage on my hair.  This four pack was a good value and I never run out when I need to go for a swim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris Wodke&lt;br /&gt;Author: Running for My Life-Winning for CMT</li>
            <li> Helps hair not be as crunchy after daily swims.</li>
            <li> Its very good for all who like to swim.</li>
            <li> UltraSwim Conditioner is excellent. In combination with the shampoo it helps keep your hair from during green and brittle and it smells good too!</li>
            <li> I have used other more expensive after swim conditioners. This one works better.  That frizzy ness is gone and my hair feels silky again.</li>
            <li> Both my daughters are swimmers. This conditioner smells great and helps with their chlorine damaged hair. They can use it after every shampoo if they want.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner for swimmers!</li>
            <li> Great for pool string hair, makes hair smooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Ultra Swim since I was a kid to rinse chlorine out of my hair after swimming.  It works great!  It never occurred to me to put the conditioner in before swimming to protect against chlorine from the beginning, but I tried it on the bottle&#x27;s suggestion, and the results have been fantastic.</li>
            <li> Second swimmer son&#x27;s hair is like straw from the chlorine.  This stuff makes a good stab at getting the hair back to his original bionic construct, but it is not perfect and while it is not super expensive, it is an extra cost over normal hair product.  Probably the best stuff out there though for this application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick as I would like, but it works well.  It&#x27;s a good companion to the Ultra Swim shampoo. Scent is pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t break me out. I like the four pack, and the price is fair.</li>
            <li> Like really runny regular condi</li>
            <li> This is a must for swimmers.  It is a great size, perfect for all the swim bags, and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> my blonde hair daughter started on a swim team...quickly her blonde hair started looking &amp;#34;brassy&amp;#34;.  This swimmer conditioner along with the shampoo has solved the issue...she has beautiful hair now!</li>
            <li> My daughter is a collegiate swimmer and she loves this stuff. When you spend hours in the pool every day it&#x27;s impossible to get the chlorine out without special products.  This conditioner works well for her.</li>
            <li> Great at conditioning hair, especially after swimming.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my three swim club teens. Their hair kept getting a green tint and always smelled of chlorine. This product really works. Their hair, two very fine and one thick, is left soft and no trace of chlorine smell. However we did find that if this product is not rinsed out properly it will leave your hair with a crispy coating.</li>
            <li> Seems to work, but I need to use it for a while to see how it really works.  Seems a bit expensive though.</li>
            <li> Chlorine can do a number on your hair. My daughter uses this and the companion conditioner everyday, often twice a day due to her practice schedule. It helps to keep her looking great despite being subjected to harsh exposure to heavily chlorinated pools</li>
            <li> This, and their shampoo, are terrific! Even with my regular shampoo/conditioner, my hair seemed to take a couple of washings to get that chlorine &#x27;feel&#x27; out of it. The Ultra Swim products do what they promise; after an hour or more at the pool, my evening shower ALWAYS includes these. Afterwards, my hair is silky and feels extra nice. Highly recommend for swimmers!!</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair did not improve after two weeks of using this product.  I ended up going to the salon and unfortunately had to pay for the expensive shampoos and conditioners.  At least they worked!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is very, very thin.  Maybe it&#x27;s meant to be that way, but I&#x27;m used to conditioners that are more like a lotion.  It works OK I guess, but it&#x27;s hard to get it in all over because it&#x27;s so liquid.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff really puts moisture back in your swimming pool hair and you don&#x27;t need to use very much. Use it with the Ultra Swim shampoo.</li>
            <li> I use the conditioner before I go swimming and it helps my hair tremendously. I still wear a cap to keep my hair from moving around and getting tangled. The cap combined with the conditioner is perfect. I aslo use the shampoo and conditioner after I swim and they are great.</li>
            <li> This is great for kids who swim.  I use it for my daughters in the summer.  They love to use it, it even makes combing hair much easier than many other conditioners.</li>
            <li> I swim three to four times a week.  Before I used Ultraswim shampoo and felt OK without using the conditioner.  But lately the result hadn&#x27;t been well (not sure the manufacture changed formula).  The hair was hard to comb.  So I ordered this conditioner.  I applied the conditioner and left it on for 3 min per instruction.  The result was better but still hair is bit sticky.  The conditioner is very thin (diluted) compared to other conditioners I used.  I estimate shampoo to conditioner ratio to be 1 to 2.5.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner, my kids love to swim and I have had such issues with tangles in their long hair, once I started using this conditioner there are no more tangles and brushing their long hair takes only a few seconds.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is so runny, not thick like most.</li>
            <li> I swim daily and this conditioner (along with the compatible shampoo) has greatly improved my hair.  I rub it into my hair before I swim and then use it again after swimming when I shampoo.</li>
            <li> Swimming 3 times a week for excersise can cause  your hair to be dry.  This product really helps when applied directly after your workout.</li>
            <li> my daughter is mixed and the chlorine in my pool was off so there was too much and i didnt know it. her hair was like hay so hard to manage this helped SOOO much! i was able to get the knots out and not have her screaming and crying. i still have some for this summer</li>
            <li> I saw such a good review on this product and the shampoo too. I used it once but the conditioner doesn&#x27;t moiturize my hair at all. Plus it makes my hair so dry and hard like a straw. If you use shampoo I recommend to use other conditioner.</li>
            <li> Good chlorine removal shampoo</li>
            <li> I have short hair so I don&#x27;t use a swim cap.  This conditioner left my hair soft and tangle free.</li>
