            <li>To me, this scent is light, very captivating; clean, yet soft, and slightly musky, but in a pleasant way.</li>

            <li>always nice compliments and last all day</li>
            <li>Loved this....totally as expected.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite scent in the whole world, so fresh and sweet.</li>
            <li>but this is my fav perfume price is ok a little more then TJ Maxx has it.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I had been searching for.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft, smooth and uplifting.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>rather just order it online especially if I can get it for a better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used Curve Crush for about ten years and have had so many compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li>After wearing it several more times I noticed over and over how it lasted all day, even when I had become used to smelling Crush</li>
            <li>This is the 3rd time I have purchased this perfume &amp; have been 100% satisfied each time.</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance and it last all day.</li>
            <li>One day I noticed the scent on my child and realized how good it actually smelled, not only that</li>
            <li>I have used it for years and will continue to use it as long as I can. : )</li>
            <li>Ive tried different more pricey perfumes ad get so many compliments with Curve that I don&#x27;t get with any other products.</li>
            <li>The scent is very soft, and fresh.</li>
            <li>I got the exact same thing I could have paid twice as much for in the store!!!</li>
            <li>Great delivery and bottle was bigger than I expected for the money!!!</li>
            <li>Very girly scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m unsure why or if maybe I received a defective one, but this perfume didn&#x27;t really smell appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I REALLY DIDN&#x27;T TRY ANYTHING KNEW</li>
            <li>If your body chemistry works with this perfume, don&#x27;t be surprised if you get proposed to by total strangers or your SO suddenly rips your clothes off and makes sweet love to you.  </li>
            <li>I get more compliments when I wear this than any other scent that I have ever worn.</li>
            <li>Surprised on how quickly the vendor sent my shipment; definitely will buy from this business again.</li>
            <li>Either a very old bottle or a knock-off, but this was not the Curve Crush</li>
            <li>It is a very soft scent that lasts all day and it is not over powering.</li>
            <li>A very soft fragrance...</li>
            <li>Love this cologne and had a hard time finding this size locally for the right price.</li>
            <li>I washed the container and it was fine, but it was a mess.</li>
            <li>Soft scent</li>
            <li>I would recommend it if you like a soft baby powder smell.</li>
            <li>An old boyfriend gave me this has a present.</li>
            <li>Before the spray bottle was empty, I purchased it for myself.&lt;br /&gt;Scent is very alluring/sexy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like it, it&#x27;s reasonably priced enough where you can pass it on to a friend without feeling like you wasted too much money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m serious! :)</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s soft, smooth and uplifting.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> rather just order it online especially if I can get it for a better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used Curve Crush for about ten years and have had so many compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li> After wearing it several more times I noticed over and over how it lasted all day, even when I had become used to smelling Crush</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd time I have purchased this perfume &amp; have been 100% satisfied each time.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance and it last all day.</li>
            <li> One day I noticed the scent on my child and realized how good it actually smelled, not only that</li>
            <li> I have used it for years and will continue to use it as long as I can. : )</li>
            <li> Ive tried different more pricey perfumes ad get so many compliments with Curve that I don&#x27;t get with any other products.</li>
            <li> The scent is very soft, and fresh.</li>
            <li> I got the exact same thing I could have paid twice as much for in the store!!!</li>
            <li> Great delivery and bottle was bigger than I expected for the money!!!</li>
            <li> Very girly scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure why or if maybe I received a defective one, but this perfume didn&#x27;t really smell appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I REALLY DIDN&#x27;T TRY ANYTHING KNEW</li>
            <li> If your body chemistry works with this perfume, don&#x27;t be surprised if you get proposed to by total strangers or your SO suddenly rips your clothes off and makes sweet love to you.  </li>
            <li> I get more compliments when I wear this than any other scent that I have ever worn.</li>
            <li> Surprised on how quickly the vendor sent my shipment; definitely will buy from this business again.</li>
            <li> Either a very old bottle or a knock-off, but this was not the Curve Crush</li>
            <li> It is a very soft scent that lasts all day and it is not over powering.</li>
            <li> A very soft fragrance...</li>
            <li> Love this cologne and had a hard time finding this size locally for the right price.</li>
            <li> I washed the container and it was fine, but it was a mess.</li>
            <li> Soft scent</li>
            <li> I would recommend it if you like a soft baby powder smell.</li>
            <li> An old boyfriend gave me this has a present.</li>
            <li> Before the spray bottle was empty, I purchased it for myself.&lt;br /&gt;Scent is very alluring/sexy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like it, it&#x27;s reasonably priced enough where you can pass it on to a friend without feeling like you wasted too much money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious! :)</li>
            <li> At first I was not impressed, and I thought the scent was too mature for me.</li>
            <li> It lasts long too.</li>
            <li> I even sprayed it on my letters to my husband during his military basic training.</li>
            <li> The scent didn&#x27;t stay long as well.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy this a long time ago &amp; decided to re-order.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected.  </li>
            <li> and I will re order when empty</li>
            <li> I usually buy it at a local store</li>
            <li> Yucky smell ,fake perfume nothing like the real one ,</li>
            <li> Was wrapped in bubble wrap, but when I opened the packaging the container was covered in a dark slimy substance that smelled minty.  </li>
            <li> I always buy a few bottles at a time.</li>
            <li> but lately when I go they never have anyone in the beauty area to take it out of the case</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I hate putting down products, but this had a funky baby wipes smell to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not into all those expensive perfumes.</li>
            <li> so sorry I lost my money</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this perfume one of my faves. It has a sweet smell with a hit of powder I think.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite scent in the whole world, so fresh and sweet. I have no idea why local stores seem to be taking this off the shelf. I&#x27;m so glad I can find it on Amazon and for a great price!</li>

            <li> Great delivery and bottle was bigger than I expected for the money!!! :) heck of a deal. Very happy! Will do business again</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful fragrance that I have enjoyed for years.  Amazon had the best price.  The delivery was quick and the product was just what I have always loved.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this perfume, and Amazon sells it for the price of the much smaller bottle. Can&#x27;t beat the product or the price anywhere!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I have bought it a couple times and I always get complements about how good I smell.</li>
            <li> Love the product and love the price</li>
            <li> This is my signature perfume. I&#x27;ve been wearing this for about 15 years. It is very light and does not overwhelm your nose. I don&#x27;t smell it on myself but others smell it when they enter the room and I always get compliments. People always enter a room I&#x27;m in and say &amp;#34;What is that perfume? It smells so good!&amp;#34; That&#x27;s how I knew this was my go to perfume.</li>
            <li> it was fine and a great price worked really well for that and came really fast  great deal like not have to go to store to get it.</li>
            <li> An old boyfriend gave me this has a present. Before the spray bottle was empty, I purchased it for myself.&lt;br /&gt;Scent is very alluring/sexy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had numerous compliments from both men and women.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.  It works well with my body.  Ive tried different more pricey perfumes ad get so many compliments with Curve that I don&#x27;t get with any other products.</li>
            <li> always comments on this from people  you smell so nice what are you wearing? always nice compliments and last all day</li>
            <li> My husband bought me this scent years ago and I instantly fell in love with it!  I&#x27;m not into all those expensive perfumes. This does the trick. Get compliments on this all the time.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this because I love the smell. Its just a perfect scent for the summer. I have received it in like 3 days after I have placed the order.</li>
            <li> What you see is what you get.  I got the exact same thing I could have paid twice as much for in the store!!!</li>
            <li> This perfume was just ok. I absolutely love the mens version of this brand. That&#x27;s why I purchased this one. I&#x27;m unsure why or if maybe I received a defective one, but this perfume didn&#x27;t really smell appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I hate putting down products, but this had a funky baby wipes smell to it. That&#x27;s the best way I could explain it. I ended up giving to a friend who liked the scent.&lt;br /&gt;This perfume might be others favorite. However, for me it just did not work.</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume since for over 10 years, and I&#x27;m still just as in love with it today as I was when I first started using it. Aside from it&#x27;s pleasant scent, the scent seems to last all day and beyond! I find that during the fall and winter, I can smell the scent on my scarves days or weeks after I&#x27;ve last worn them. I even sprayed it on my letters to my husband during his military basic training. The letters still to this day smell of Curve Crush. He loved the scent so much himself, he asked me to wear it on our wedding day. To me, this scent is light, very captivating; clean, yet soft, and slightly musky, but in a pleasant way. I cannot even tell you how many compliments I&#x27;ve gotten over the years wearing this stuff. I personally feel this spray is one of the best deals for quality at a reasonable price on the market. If you&#x27;re on the fence about trying this, I encourage you to take the plunge. If you don&#x27;t like it, it&#x27;s reasonably priced enough where you can pass it on to a friend without feeling like you wasted too much money. But if you love it, you will have found a forever-fragrance-friend as I have!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I usually buy it at a local store but lately when I go they never have anyone in the beauty area to take it out of the case so id rather just order it online especially if I can get it for a better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not good at describing the scent but it is a sweet smell. Im not a big fan of overly citrus or overly floral like smells but this one is just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im a fan of this curve</li>
            <li> A former coworker and also my ex wife wore this from time to time.  To my male brain, it was basically liquid sex attractant.  I&#x27;ve never been around a perfume that so perfectly toyed with my sense of smell and my desires for female companionship and intimacy.  If your body chemistry works with this perfume, don&#x27;t be surprised if you get proposed to by total strangers or your SO suddenly rips your clothes off and makes sweet love to you.  It&#x27;s that good...I&#x27;m serious! :)</li>
            <li> Yucky smell ,fake perfume nothing like the real one ,so sorry I lost my money</li>
            <li> i finally got my perfume. i love it, it&#x27;s in good conditions and at a good price..</li>
            <li> My wife said it was OK, wasn&#x27;t to impressed with it. The scent didn&#x27;t stay long as well.  God Bless</li>
            <li> Good fragrance, good smell, I recommend it, you will feel fresh, and receives compliments are good, comes in good condition, well packaged. Thank You. I would buy again</li>
            <li> Loved this....totally as expected.</li>
            <li> I have used Curve Crush for about ten years and have had so many compliments on the scent. People have asked me numerous times what I am wearing that smells so good. I would recommend this fragrance to anyone who wants a light scent that is not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> I love this scent ! It&#x27;s affordable and it smells great ...I get a ton of compliments on it , people always asking what is that ? It smells so good !</li>
            <li> My husband gave me this perfume as a Christmas gift several years ago. At first I was not impressed, and I thought the scent was too mature for me. I wore it from time to time just because I had it. One day I noticed the scent on my child and realized how good it actually smelled, not only that but it was hours after appling and with just a hug she smelled so good.  After wearing it several more times I noticed over and over how it lasted all day, even when I had become used to smelling Crush it was still going strong on my shirt, scarves, and jacket just from contact. It is now one of my favorites and my husband loves it too. This perfume has a very rich, musk smell but very feminie and lovely.</li>
            <li> The exquisite combination of flowers and spices makes this a wonderful fragrance at a reasonable price. Surprised on how quickly the vendor sent my shipment; definitely will buy from this business again.</li>
            <li> Love it , it smells very good!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! Crush is the way to go to get that special guy:)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light and sweet just for me!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.  I get compliments every time I wear it.  The value of my purchase is insurpassable.  This is the 3rd time I have purchased this perfume &amp; have been 100% satisfied each time.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected.  The packaging left a bit to be desired.  Was wrapped in bubble wrap, but when I opened the packaging the container was covered in a dark slimy substance that smelled minty.  I washed the container and it was fine, but it was a mess.</li>
            <li> Love the scent.  Very mild and not overpowering.  My husband loved it and said it was the best so far.</li>
            <li> Super Great Perfume i purchased for my Wife</li>

            <li> I get more compliments when I wear this than any other scent that I have ever worn. It is a very soft scent that lasts all day and it is not over powering.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this a long time ago &amp; decided to re-order. A very soft fragrance... almost powdering... but the plus is, it lasts all day. Nice consistent smell. Pleased.</li>
            <li> CURVE CRUSH WAS INTRODUCED TO ME BY A FRIEND THAT KNEW THAT I WORE NOTHING BUT ETERNITY.

BUT NOW I BUY NOTHING BUT CURVE CRUSH BECAUSE IT REALLY COMPLIMENT MY BODY CHEMISTRY IN A VERY FRESH, CLEAN AND SENUAL WAY AND I CAN&#x27;T SMELL IT DURING THE DAY BUT EVERYONE WOULD SAY TO ME,\\&quot;WHAT IS THAT YOU ARE WEARING\\&quot; AND I AM PROULD TO SAY, CURVE CRUSH.</li>
