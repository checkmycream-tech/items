    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>; That sounds awesome.</li>
            <li>If once a day does the trick, great.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li>He still used a face wash regimen, but this Proactiv has been a great supplement to that.</li>
            <li>My son has fairly severe acne</li>
            <li>Over all a good product, but pricey.</li>
            <li>Others may feel the price is fair.</li>
            <li>It is  a good product that I have used since it has come to the market.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice but not overpowering, and the consistency is a &#x27;non-greasy, fluidlike gel&#x27; as advertised.</li>
            <li>but if I am being completely honest....</li>
            <li>It worked as good or better than her prescription medicine that the dermatologist gave her to help with the Folliculitis infection.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The benzoyl peroxide is an effective, but drying, acne treatment.</li>
            <li>Research indicated that benzoyl peroxide is effective at reducing bacteria on the skin and in the pore.</li>
            <li>I wonder whether this superior dispersing ability may be why the product seems to work slightly better.  </li>
            <li>The gel formula isn&#x27;t sticky or too tacky like others and the best part is that it isn&#x27;t like a high gloss lotion that makes your skin shine like a beacon.</li>
            <li>The good news is that the acne cleared up significantly.</li>
            <li>As always with benzoyl peroxide (an oxidizing agent), be sure to stay out of the sun during treatment and take care not to spill or allow contact onto clothing to avoid bleaching.</li>
            <li>It is a drying agent which is probably what helps many people with acne.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall evaluation, it&#x27;s an OK product.  </li>
            <li>and he is now seeing a dermatologist (and getting better results).</li>
            <li>but that is what she needed as what most bothers her skin is sweat and the skin oils that clog the pores and hair</li>
            <li>saying, this product is everything it claims to be and more.  </li>
            <li>The Proactiv smelled better, but otherwise was identical and worked just as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>Her report: the product worked like most acne products she uses.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve normally used it for spot treatment with great results.</li>
            <li>She has tried other Proactiv products and she said this is the one she likes the best.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply with no visible residue</li>
            <li>This Proactiv+ is quite an easy addition to your face cleaning routine</li>
            <li>So, fine.</li>
            <li>And maybe more note worthy here</li>
            <li>This product was great, especially during the hot and humid months when acne is more challenging.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and smooth and goes on with a matte rather than glossy finish, so my make-up can go over it (and you do need to wear some sort of sunscreen over any benzoyl peroxide product because of the way it interacts with sunlight).</li>
            <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s supposed to set this product apart from the cheap drugstore variety (e.g. Clearasil) is its so-called patented &amp;#34;SMART TARGET&amp;#34; delivery system which is supposed to &amp;</li>
            <li>He does like that this goes on sort of smoothly and without a color or shiny finish.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and shouldn&#x27;t bother anyone at all.</li>
            <li>If I hadn&#x27;t been through what I&#x27;ve been through and taken Acutane, I would definitely try to Proactiv products as I really do hear excellent things about them.  </li>
            <li>I suspect that if you&#x27;ve got a major breakout problem, it would be much more effective and way cheaper to go buy a tube of cheap 5% or 10% concentration benzoyl peroxide from your drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise an individual may be in the market for RetinA .05% cream, which is more helpful for more severe cases of acne, and I most definately encourage anyone to see a dermatologist before they invest in any product.</li>
            <li>It helped to significantly manage acne and wasn&#x27;t drying at all on my face.</li>
            <li>This product goes on very lightly and dries to a lovely matte finish that is completely unnoticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Actually, for me, this kind of breakout is new.  </li>
            <li>daughter applied the Proactiv to clean skin and dabbed it onto the spots that needed some help.  </li>
            <li>The gels smooths/glides on easily and gets absorbed instantaneously.  </li>
            <li>My face feels so clean after every use, and persistent problem areas have already disappeared.</li>
            <li>This has proven to be mild on her skin</li>
            <li>and while most Proactiv products are great at their purpose, this one is a big miss with corporate fancy jargon to lure the gullible in.</li>
            <li>The lotion makes it easy to apply to the whole face.</li>
            <li>If this proves to be accurate, I have to wonder whether the container is much bigger than it needs to be, perhaps to give the impression of there being more product in it.  </li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>and we have used many products to help clear it up.  </li>
            <li>This product smells nice, goes on smoothly, and works as well as expected.  </li>
            <li>I did not spend $90 on it, so I have no need to reduce my cognitive dissonance by fooling myself that it&#x27;s worth that amount of money.</li>
            <li>However, anyone can patent the name of a &amp;#34;technology&amp;#34; like &amp;#34;SMART TARGET&amp;#34; to make it sound like there&#x27;s something more hi-tech going on than just smearing benzoyl peroxide into your pores with your finger (the same way you would with a tube of Clearasil).</li>
            <li>results that are worth the $90.</li>
            <li>results that are worth the $90.</li>
            <li>It does make his skin feel nice, just not enough to justify the price difference.</li>
            <li>I know it works for some people and in that case it may be worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing here that makes it worth a hundred bucks</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t need your money for other things and like the look of the bottle and the cachet of the brand name, then it will be a good purchase for you.</li>
            <li>I hoped right, and this seems to be working well for</li>
            <li>Having tried many other products like this on the market, this product has proven to be the one that works the best for his skin and helps the most resolve the random break out issues he experiences from time to time.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not bad, I didn&#x27;t see much in noticeable results.  </li>
            <li>The bottom line, for me, is that liking it slightly better doesn&#x27;t come near justifying paying almost 20 times as much for Proactiv+.</li>
            <li>He said he really liked the way his skin felt using it, however...for blemishes, he said that it wasn&#x27;t much different than much else he has used.</li>
            <li>There is a very good chance that the Proactive Line is all you need, but I will also point out that RetinA and other prescription meds cost the same, so you might want to get it right the first time.</li>
            <li>Just because it has a fancy name and a patented label does not mean it is more effective than the usual finger/tube application process.</li>
            <li>Because of the pricetag, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you&#x27;ve never tried B.P first.</li>
            <li>but when you&#x27;ve reached that point, you&#x27;d be willing to pay for just about anything.</li>
            <li>product is more creamy than anything and applying it was quite simple as you blot it on the areas that are affected.  </li>
            <li>For that reason, I suspect that this is a big scam -- a way for you to think that by spending $90, you&#x27;re getting a product that&#x27;s better than Clearasil.</li>
            <li>effective than I expected.</li>
            <li>Pore Targeting Treatment really works!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>My son didn&#x27;t know that and his favorite towel has white blotches.</li>
            <li>In any case, I&#x27;ll be going back to another product with benzoyl peroxide, so I&#x27;ll know more in a couple of weeks</li>
            <li>She first uses the Proactiv cleanser and then applies the pore treatment.</li>
            <li>it works just as well as the $7 tube of Clean &amp; Clear Benzoyl Peroxide.  </li>
            <li>This is 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide, which is similar to many items that are sold at a much lower price point.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty large bottle</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much from this as proactive seems to be a success due to marketing rather than containing anything innovative.</li>
            <li>This does dry skin, as most acne treatments do.</li>
            <li>His skin seems to clear up well and quickly with those, so he sticks with that.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re afflicted with acne and large pores, give it a try.</li>
            <li>We have used this Proactiv+Pore Targeting Treatment and it is certainly improving her skin.</li>
            <li>Make sure not to get too much on as it can dry out your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also think the price at 90.00 is very high for this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you buy this, you are not buying a more effective ingredient, you are buying expensive ads in fashion magazines, etc.  </li>
            <li>I did like that it wasn&#x27;t greasy feeling (and my skin knows greasy feeling) and that it doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot to treat around my nose and chin.</li>
            <li>and yet it really works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We have not noticed any drying of her skin, but at 13, her skin is very oily.</li>
            <li>I like that it is light enough that she can still use a sunscreen this summer.</li>
            <li>On the whole I did see improvement, but my face is pretty sensitive-</li>
            <li>There are some other treatments available through doctors that are just as good if not better</li>
            <li>Prior to Acutane, I used numerous products containing benzoyl peroxide, as that seemed to be what helped me the most.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It comes out just a little at a time and feels more like a lotion than a medicinal cream.</li>
            <li>Real action without compromises.</li>
            <li>Some products are too drying and cause redness, others cause too much oil, and still others are completely ineffective.</li>
            <li>While the price is hefty, the results are absolutely worth it, and I will be buying the entire Proactiv+ line from here out.</li>
            <li>I think the price is sort of high for a product like this, and maybe would recommend trying a similar, lower priced product (or two) first.</li>
            <li>I have teflon skin, but my husband&#x27;s is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>One especially hot summer (I live in South Florida), my back started breaking out - probably due to the clothing I was wearing for work.  </li>
            <li>You can purchase that concentration or higher at your local drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the same active ingredient as Clearasil, you&#x27;re not going to do much better with this product at clearing your acne.</li>
            <li>like the way it soaks right in, gives a dry, matte finish, and--for me--it does not cause my skin to overproduce oil.  </li>
            <li>In my teens, I had perfectly clear skin.  </li>
            <li>I have a clear, dewy complexion that practically glows.</li>
            <li>Though a gentle product, it still irritated my skin (in 40s), but worked wonderfully on my teenage son.  </li>
            <li>So, if you have sensitive skin, this may not be for you, but if you&#x27;re a teenager or don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, it has cleared up an onery patch of acne off my son&#x27;s temple.  </li>
            <li>But it can cause sensitive skin undue stress.</li>
            <li>So far we like this product a lot.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After using this, a bumpy rash developed, so that was sort of the end of the experiment.</li>
            <li>#34;guide medicine directly into pores&amp;#34; with &amp;#34;laser precision.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that I like it</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found that its&#x27; working so far.</li>
            <li>I read once that doctors are more likely than other consumers to buy generic medicines, because they realize it&#x27;s the drug, not the brand name and marketing costs, that does the job.</li>
            <li>, in short, I think this product works, but the $90 price tag is ridiculous because you could purchase something just as effective for $5.</li>
            <li>, in short, I think this product works, but the $90 price tag is ridiculous because you could purchase something just as effective for $5.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth trying if you&#x27;ve tried out other benzoyl peroxide preparations</li>
            <li>He has been using the Proactiv treatment for about a week and a half and so far we really don&#x27;t see that much change.  </li>
            <li>It goes on grease less and soaks in quickly.  </li>
            <li>This can happen particularly if a person smears it over their entire face</li>
            <li>She used it at night when it first came in because she had a bit of swelling starting on her shoulders from the folliculitis and the next morning when she got up the swelling was gone and the sore had already started to heal.  </li>
            <li>However, after using it in large sections of my face once a day for about 3 days, the skin got really really dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>Most acne medications dry my skin out further, but I&#x27;ve heard about Proactive for about half my life at this point, so when I was given the option to try, I eagerly accepted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this product to try for my daughter in hopes that it would help her Folliculitis and general acne.  </li>
            <li>I am pairing this with my regular cleansing wipes, so it&#x27;s not the complete program for this review</li>
            <li>I told him to stop using it this morning as I think it may be more irritating to his face.  </li>
            <li>so I expected this to much the same.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible that the thin gel is a more efficacious medium, since it&#x27;s easier to get an even, intentional amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For an over the counter acne treatment, this is perfectly suitable for the odd mild yet inconvenient case of acne,i.e.</li>
            <li>A half-ounce tube of any generic brand of benzoyl peroxide lasts me much longer than 90 days, for less than $5.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> If you don&#x27;t need your money for other things and like the look of the bottle and the cachet of the brand name, then it will be a good purchase for you.</li>
            <li> I hoped right, and this seems to be working well for</li>
            <li> Having tried many other products like this on the market, this product has proven to be the one that works the best for his skin and helps the most resolve the random break out issues he experiences from time to time.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not bad, I didn&#x27;t see much in noticeable results.  </li>
            <li> The bottom line, for me, is that liking it slightly better doesn&#x27;t come near justifying paying almost 20 times as much for Proactiv+.</li>
            <li> He said he really liked the way his skin felt using it, however...for blemishes, he said that it wasn&#x27;t much different than much else he has used.</li>
            <li> There is a very good chance that the Proactive Line is all you need, but I will also point out that RetinA and other prescription meds cost the same, so you might want to get it right the first time.</li>
            <li> Just because it has a fancy name and a patented label does not mean it is more effective than the usual finger/tube application process.</li>
            <li> Because of the pricetag, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you&#x27;ve never tried B.P first.</li>
            <li> but when you&#x27;ve reached that point, you&#x27;d be willing to pay for just about anything.</li>
            <li> product is more creamy than anything and applying it was quite simple as you blot it on the areas that are affected.  </li>
            <li> For that reason, I suspect that this is a big scam -- a way for you to think that by spending $90, you&#x27;re getting a product that&#x27;s better than Clearasil.</li>
            <li> effective than I expected.</li>
            <li> Pore Targeting Treatment really works!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li> My son didn&#x27;t know that and his favorite towel has white blotches.</li>
            <li> In any case, I&#x27;ll be going back to another product with benzoyl peroxide, so I&#x27;ll know more in a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> She first uses the Proactiv cleanser and then applies the pore treatment.</li>
            <li> it works just as well as the $7 tube of Clean &amp; Clear Benzoyl Peroxide.  </li>
            <li> This is 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide, which is similar to many items that are sold at a much lower price point.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty large bottle</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from this as proactive seems to be a success due to marketing rather than containing anything innovative.</li>
            <li> This does dry skin, as most acne treatments do.</li>
            <li> His skin seems to clear up well and quickly with those, so he sticks with that.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re afflicted with acne and large pores, give it a try.</li>
            <li> We have used this Proactiv+Pore Targeting Treatment and it is certainly improving her skin.</li>
            <li> Make sure not to get too much on as it can dry out your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also think the price at 90.00 is very high for this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you buy this, you are not buying a more effective ingredient, you are buying expensive ads in fashion magazines, etc.  </li>
            <li> I did like that it wasn&#x27;t greasy feeling (and my skin knows greasy feeling) and that it doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot to treat around my nose and chin.</li>
            <li> and yet it really works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have not noticed any drying of her skin, but at 13, her skin is very oily.</li>
            <li> I like that it is light enough that she can still use a sunscreen this summer.</li>
            <li> On the whole I did see improvement, but my face is pretty sensitive-</li>
            <li> There are some other treatments available through doctors that are just as good if not better</li>
            <li> Prior to Acutane, I used numerous products containing benzoyl peroxide, as that seemed to be what helped me the most.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It comes out just a little at a time and feels more like a lotion than a medicinal cream.</li>
            <li> Real action without compromises.</li>
            <li> Some products are too drying and cause redness, others cause too much oil, and still others are completely ineffective.</li>
            <li> While the price is hefty, the results are absolutely worth it, and I will be buying the entire Proactiv+ line from here out.</li>
            <li> I think the price is sort of high for a product like this, and maybe would recommend trying a similar, lower priced product (or two) first.</li>
            <li> I have teflon skin, but my husband&#x27;s is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> One especially hot summer (I live in South Florida), my back started breaking out - probably due to the clothing I was wearing for work.  </li>
            <li> You can purchase that concentration or higher at your local drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the same active ingredient as Clearasil, you&#x27;re not going to do much better with this product at clearing your acne.</li>
            <li> like the way it soaks right in, gives a dry, matte finish, and--for me--it does not cause my skin to overproduce oil.  </li>
            <li> In my teens, I had perfectly clear skin.  </li>
            <li> I have a clear, dewy complexion that practically glows.</li>
            <li> Though a gentle product, it still irritated my skin (in 40s), but worked wonderfully on my teenage son.  </li>
            <li> So, if you have sensitive skin, this may not be for you, but if you&#x27;re a teenager or don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, it has cleared up an onery patch of acne off my son&#x27;s temple.  </li>
            <li> But it can cause sensitive skin undue stress.</li>
            <li> So far we like this product a lot.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> After using this, a bumpy rash developed, so that was sort of the end of the experiment.</li>
            <li> #34;guide medicine directly into pores&amp;#34; with &amp;#34;laser precision.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that I like it</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found that its&#x27; working so far.</li>
            <li> I read once that doctors are more likely than other consumers to buy generic medicines, because they realize it&#x27;s the drug, not the brand name and marketing costs, that does the job.</li>
            <li> , in short, I think this product works, but the $90 price tag is ridiculous because you could purchase something just as effective for $5.</li>
            <li> , in short, I think this product works, but the $90 price tag is ridiculous because you could purchase something just as effective for $5.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth trying if you&#x27;ve tried out other benzoyl peroxide preparations</li>
            <li> He has been using the Proactiv treatment for about a week and a half and so far we really don&#x27;t see that much change.  </li>
            <li> It goes on grease less and soaks in quickly.  </li>
            <li> This can happen particularly if a person smears it over their entire face</li>
            <li> She used it at night when it first came in because she had a bit of swelling starting on her shoulders from the folliculitis and the next morning when she got up the swelling was gone and the sore had already started to heal.  </li>
            <li> However, after using it in large sections of my face once a day for about 3 days, the skin got really really dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> Most acne medications dry my skin out further, but I&#x27;ve heard about Proactive for about half my life at this point, so when I was given the option to try, I eagerly accepted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this product to try for my daughter in hopes that it would help her Folliculitis and general acne.  </li>
            <li> I am pairing this with my regular cleansing wipes, so it&#x27;s not the complete program for this review</li>
            <li> I told him to stop using it this morning as I think it may be more irritating to his face.  </li>
            <li> so I expected this to much the same.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible that the thin gel is a more efficacious medium, since it&#x27;s easier to get an even, intentional amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For an over the counter acne treatment, this is perfectly suitable for the odd mild yet inconvenient case of acne,i.e.</li>
            <li> A half-ounce tube of any generic brand of benzoyl peroxide lasts me much longer than 90 days, for less than $5.  </li>
            <li> I use benzoyl peroxide on a daily basis and really didn&#x27;t expect the Proactiv+ Pore Targeting Treatment to be any different from the generic brands I usually buy.  </li>
            <li> As a result, it disperses very well, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> think the product page should mention the fact that some people are sensitive to the active ingredient Benzoyl peroxide, and also that you should avoid sunllight while using this.</li>
            <li> Overall I would purchase this again or recommend it to anyone having difficulty with minor acne breakouts (like my two teenage kids).</li>
            <li> and since you don&#x27;t use it all over your face, just on problem areas, it should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazingly enough, this doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> Other than the active ingredient (benzoyl peroxide), there are only 10 other components, including sweet almond oil, a couple of emulsifiers, compounds typically found in soap/lotion products, and a fragrance.</li>
            <li> The primary ingredient - benzoyl peroxide - is in very weak solution, 2.5%.  </li>
            <li> The lotion feels soft and smooth, it applies evenly without feeling unpleasant or greasy, and it leaves a matte finish that doesn&#x27;t affect my makeup.  </li>
            <li> Used it on a minor breakout and the Proactiv cleared it in two days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not having trouble with my skin drying out because I&#x27;m only using it once a day--under the Hydrator, then under my Bare Minerals liquid</li>
            <li> have been using this product the same way I use other blemish treatments now - at night, once a day, as a spot treatment (if/as needed), and then I wash it off in the morning.  </li>
            <li> so it reacted similarly to this product as it did other Benzoyl Peroxide type lotions.</li>
            <li> us, the price is sort of prohibitive, so we mostly only be tempted to try this if other over-the-counter items weren&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> However, they really dry up your skin</li>
            <li> It did dry her skin just a bit</li>
            <li> He uses bathroom papertowels now mostly to dry his face after using these types of products.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, with pores that are prone to irritation and clogging mainly by dry skin.</li>
            <li> it was very flaky and the acne actually got worse.</li>
            <li> Avoid the sun at all costs or use lots of sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 4/5 stars, OTC benzyl peroxide product that can still dry out your skin resulting in red, flaky, and itchy skin - that&#x27;s with 1 use per day for only a few days.</li>
            <li> I mean, this is a nice product, but it is so overpriced as to be laughable.</li>
            <li> And it should not be a heavy application, as a tiny bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After less than two weeks, the improvement in brightness and skin clarity is obvious.</li>
            <li> Benzoyl peroxide is the active ingredient, and one is warned to test this product in a few small areas first.  </li>
            <li> It has dried up his face and is flaky in some places but the acne is still very red and irritated.  </li>
            <li> If there is a fragrance, it is minimal and I don&#x27;t even notice</li>
            <li> It is drying, so be careful where you use</li>
            <li> After just a couple of days, those trouble spots are gone and back under control.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping that this Pore Targeting gel might help me keep a few small problem-prone areas clear.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a little expensive, especially if you buy the whole line</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this actually helps with pore reduction.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used benzyl peroxide products in the past, including prescription strength that was 5%-10% in concentration (had to be mixed by the pharmacist on the spot).</li>
            <li> It gives you peace of mind knowing that you will not have to suffer with the pain from a disease that you have no control over other than trying to find something that will help counteract the problem.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why as it is a very low dose benzoyl peroxide.  </li>
            <li> For her, it did not beat up the other products she uses.  </li>
            <li> He uses this Proactiv product for those problem areas and it works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> He uses it with other Proactive + products as well.</li>
            <li> little goes a very, very long way.</li>
            <li> There is a slight odor, but it is not strong enough to bother me and it fades quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The active ingredient is benzoyl peroxide 2.5%, and this is something I&#x27;ve used on and off for years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what Smart Target Benzoyl Peroxide Delivery Technology is, but to judge by the painful red lump on my cheek, apparently my skin can defeat it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very hard to care for sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> the odd blackhead spot patch around the usual t-zone areas or the occasional whtehead that needs dried out</li>
            <li> Dry your face and put a small amount into your hand and rub it into the skin on your face.</li>
            <li> Think dime size or less for this area.</li>
            <li> I have noticed no change in my  pores but my skin feels softer and looks slightly smoother.&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li> I even have less blackheads on my nose that I did before I started.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re targeting heavy acne or zits, you could use one of the zit creams which are typically 10% benzoyl peroxide.  </li>
            <li> This one didn&#x27;t dry her skin out hardly at all in comparison to some of the others that dried her skin out terribly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had no reaction to it, but he dried out and got flaky.</li>
            <li> but I do every few months with my cycle.</li>
            <li> The proactiv+ system really dried my sons skin out -</li>
            <li> Tackling acne is unfortunately not cheap and before taking a chance on anything please visit a specialist to see where you are at.</li>
            <li> He has tried a few things.</li>
            <li> It worked - my skin cleared up, and I haven&#x27;t had those same issues since, except for random break outs here and there.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While I&#x27;m testing a sample, this product is expensive enough that I&#x27;d have tried to return it if I had bought this and gotten these results.  </li>
            <li> The bad news is that it was dry, itchy, flaky, and a bit red.</li>
            <li> This has been helpful so far in reducing the size and it hasn&#x27;t dried my skin too badly.</li>
            <li> My son sometimes has problem areas with acne, not super bad, but here and there (especially where his hair/bangs are on his forehead.)</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to argue with success!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If not, you can slowly increase the application.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t disagree that this works, but, like the rest of the Proactiv line, it is seriously overpriced.</li>
            <li> and I passed it to my college age daughter for her always tough appraisal.  </li>
            <li> and I have observed in previous reviews complaints that users skin was drying out and painful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> cleans your face like it should</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of proactiv products, using them exclusively through my 30&#x27;s.  I tried this product on both myself and my son.  It goes on grease less and soaks in quickly.  Though a gentle product, it still irritated my skin (in 40s), but worked wonderfully on my teenage son.  So, if you have sensitive skin, this may not be for you, but if you&#x27;re a teenager or don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, it has cleared up an onery patch of acne off my son&#x27;s temple.  Hooray!  This is a pretty large bottle and since you don&#x27;t use it all over your face, just on problem areas, it should last a long time.  It says 3 months, but I think it will last longer for our usage.</li>
            <li> Cleanses as promised. Real action without compromises. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> This is 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide, which is similar to many items that are sold at a much lower price point. It&#x27;s possible that the thin gel is a more efficacious medium, since it&#x27;s easier to get an even, intentional amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very hard to care for sensitive, acne-prone skin. This does dry skin, as most acne treatments do. But it can cause sensitive skin undue stress. I have teflon skin, but my husband&#x27;s is very sensitive. I had no reaction to it, but he dried out and got flaky. So I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth trying if you&#x27;ve tried out other benzoyl peroxide preparations and it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin overmuch. Because of the pricetag, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you&#x27;ve never tried B.P first.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often get blemishes but I do every few months with my cycle. The deep ones that take forever to go away and hurt. This has been helpful so far in reducing the size and it hasn&#x27;t dried my skin too badly.</li>
            <li> The ingredients list for this product is refreshingly simple. Other than the active ingredient (benzoyl peroxide), there are only 10 other components, including sweet almond oil, a couple of emulsifiers, compounds typically found in soap/lotion products, and a fragrance. Apply this product in trouble spots and you should see results fast. As always with benzoyl peroxide (an oxidizing agent), be sure to stay out of the sun during treatment and take care not to spill or allow contact onto clothing to avoid bleaching. The fragrance is nice but not overpowering, and the consistency is a &#x27;non-greasy, fluidlike gel&#x27; as advertised.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer - I&#x27;ve never used an entire Proactiv regime.  In my teens, I had perfectly clear skin.  By the time I hit my mid 20s, everything got out of whack and I suffered from bouts of acne.... to the point where my dermatologist and I finally decided to turn to Acutane.  It worked - my skin cleared up, and I haven&#x27;t had those same issues since, except for random break outs here and there.  Prior to Acutane, I used numerous products containing benzoyl peroxide, as that seemed to be what helped me the most.  They all worked, but the effects weren&#x27;t lasting (which is why we turned to Acutane).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only Proactiv product I had tried prior to this one was the body wash.  One especially hot summer (I live in South Florida), my back started breaking out - probably due to the clothing I was wearing for work.  The body wash did seem to help, but it was not a product I continuously use (only on an as-needed basis).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product the same way I use other blemish treatments now - at night, once a day, as a spot treatment (if/as needed), and then I wash it off in the morning.  It works..... but if I am being completely honest.... for me.... it works just as well as the $7 tube of Clean &amp; Clear Benzoyl Peroxide.  If I hadn&#x27;t been through what I&#x27;ve been through and taken Acutane, I would definitely try to Proactiv products as I really do hear excellent things about them.  They&#x27;re pricey.... but when you&#x27;ve reached that point, you&#x27;d be willing to pay for just about anything.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this product.  While it&#x27;s not bad, I didn&#x27;t see much in noticeable results.  The primary ingredient - benzoyl peroxide - is in very weak solution, 2.5%.  It is a drying agent which is probably what helps many people with acne. I&#x27;m not sure how this actually helps with pore reduction.  If you&#x27;re targeting heavy acne or zits, you could use one of the zit creams which are typically 10% benzoyl peroxide.  However, they really dry up your skin so use sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall evaluation, it&#x27;s an OK product.  I think it&#x27;s a little expensive, especially if you buy the whole line but if you&#x27;re afflicted with acne and large pores, give it a try.</li>
            <li> The proactiv+ system really dried my sons skin out - it was very flaky and the acne actually got worse. We had to stop using it and he is now seeing a dermatologist (and getting better results).</li>
            <li> So far we like this product a lot. Having suffered with acne for years, my daughter has tried everything. Some products are too drying and cause redness, others cause too much oil, and still others are completely ineffective. This has proven to be mild on her skin and she said that it doesn&#x27;t cause dryness or tightness. No discomfort in using it.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;m unsure about it the price. $90 seems awfully steep. But I guess if it works (which time will tell for us) then it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used benzyl peroxide products in the past, including prescription strength that was 5%-10% in concentration (had to be mixed by the pharmacist on the spot). I&#x27;ve normally used it for spot treatment with great results. The Proactiv seems to be an OTC version with only 2.5% concentration. However, after using it in large sections of my face once a day for about 3 days, the skin got really really dry and flaky. The good news is that the acne cleared up significantly. The bad news is that it was dry, itchy, flaky, and a bit red. Avoid the sun at all costs or use lots of sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 4/5 stars, OTC benzyl peroxide product that can still dry out your skin resulting in red, flaky, and itchy skin - that&#x27;s with 1 use per day for only a few days.</li>
            <li> For an over the counter acne treatment, this is perfectly suitable for the odd mild yet inconvenient case of acne,i.e. the odd blackhead spot patch around the usual t-zone areas or the occasional whtehead that needs dried out and if I only use it in those areas I can avoid drying my skin out. I do have sensitive skin and I have observed in previous reviews complaints that users skin was drying out and painful. This can happen particularly if a person smears it over their entire face and they may only need it on their chin, nose or forehead. So please use only on affected areas as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise an individual may be in the market for RetinA .05% cream, which is more helpful for more severe cases of acne, and I most definately encourage anyone to see a dermatologist before they invest in any product. Tackling acne is unfortunately not cheap and before taking a chance on anything please visit a specialist to see where you are at. There is a very good chance that the Proactive Line is all you need, but I will also point out that RetinA and other prescription meds cost the same, so you might want to get it right the first time.</li>
            <li> I got this product to try for my daughter in hopes that it would help her Folliculitis and general acne.  She loves it and will use this from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is more creamy than anything and applying it was quite simple as you blot it on the areas that are affected.  She used it at night when it first came in because she had a bit of swelling starting on her shoulders from the folliculitis and the next morning when she got up the swelling was gone and the sore had already started to heal.  She also had the same affect with the hormone acne on her face.  It did dry her skin just a bit but that is what she needed as what most bothers her skin is sweat and the skin oils that clog the pores and hair follicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter applied the Proactiv to clean skin and dabbed it onto the spots that needed some help.  It worked as good or better than her prescription medicine that the dermatologist gave her to help with the Folliculitis infection.  The Proactiv will last quite a bit longer for her than her medicine from the doc at almost the same price.  She has tried other Proactiv products and she said this is the one she likes the best.  This one didn&#x27;t dry her skin out hardly at all in comparison to some of the others that dried her skin out terribly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So saying, this product is everything it claims to be and more.  It gives you peace of mind knowing that you will not have to suffer with the pain from a disease that you have no control over other than trying to find something that will help counteract the problem.</li>
            <li> My son has fairly severe acne and we have used many products to help clear it up.  He has been using the Proactiv treatment for about a week and a half and so far we really don&#x27;t see that much change.  It has dried up his face and is flaky in some places but the acne is still very red and irritated.  I told him to stop using it this morning as I think it may be more irritating to his face.  I am not sure why as it is a very low dose benzoyl peroxide.  He may be allergic to it and I should have tested on him beforehand.  I also think the price at 90.00 is very high for this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;I have a neighbor who swears by it as it has cleared up both her daughters acne, so I guess it may work for some people.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something in this that maybe can trigger an allergic reaction?  After using this, a bumpy rash developed, so that was sort of the end of the experiment.</li>
            <li> I am pairing this with my regular cleansing wipes, so it&#x27;s not the complete program for this review (wipes are not ProActive product). On the whole I did see improvement, but my face is pretty sensitive- so it reacted similarly to this product as it did other Benzoyl Peroxide type lotions. I did like that it wasn&#x27;t greasy feeling (and my skin knows greasy feeling) and that it doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot to treat around my nose and chin. Think dime size or less for this area. I think it&#x27;s the gel-like medium that helps it to spread father and wider. Overall I would purchase this again or recommend it to anyone having difficulty with minor acne breakouts (like my two teenage kids).</li>
            <li> I do not have severe acne.  I like the Proactiv &amp;#34;Completion Perfecting Hydrator&amp;#34;, which is the third step in the Proactive treatment plan, because it gives me a bit of moisture without acting like a pore-clogging moisturizer.  I was hoping that this Pore Targeting gel might help me keep a few small problem-prone areas clear.  I hoped right, and this seems to be working well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a pump head that gives just a tiny bit at a time.  The gels smooths/glides on easily and gets absorbed instantaneously.  I&#x27;m not having trouble with my skin drying out because I&#x27;m only using it once a day--under the Hydrator, then under my Bare Minerals liquid foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not wearing it on weekends out in the yard, while I don&#x27;t have makeup on.  The directions warn against exposing yourself to sunlight while using this.  So, on weekends I use it at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it soaks right in, gives a dry, matte finish, and--for me--it does not cause my skin to overproduce oil.  If there is a fragrance, it is minimal and I don&#x27;t even notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For severe problems, the directions say you can use it up to three times a day.  Benzoyl peroxide is the active ingredient, and one is warned to test this product in a few small areas first.  If once a day does the trick, great.  If not, you can slowly increase the application.  And it should not be a heavy application, as a tiny bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the product page should mention the fact that some people are sensitive to the active ingredient Benzoyl peroxide, and also that you should avoid sunllight while using this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t disagree that this works, but, like the rest of the Proactiv line, it is seriously overpriced. It is just 2.5% benzoyl peroxide in a gel form, which can be purchased for a fraction of this price.  A friend in another country asked me to bring their series for her sister. I bought one set of the Proactiv and several Target sets. The Proactiv smelled better, but otherwise was identical and worked just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benzoyl peroxide is an effective, but drying, acne treatment. There are some other treatments available through doctors that are just as good if not better and they don&#x27;t ruin (bleach) your sheets and towels.</li>
            <li> I mean, this is a nice product, but it is so overpriced as to be laughable. With the same active ingredient as Clearasil, you&#x27;re not going to do much better with this product at clearing your acne. I read once that doctors are more likely than other consumers to buy generic medicines, because they realize it&#x27;s the drug, not the brand name and marketing costs, that does the job. If you buy this, you are not buying a more effective ingredient, you are buying expensive ads in fashion magazines, etc.  But maybe you don&#x27;t care, and you don&#x27;t want to have an embarrassing tube of Clearasil on your counter.  So, fine. This product smells nice, goes on smoothly, and works as well as expected.  It won&#x27;t do miracles (for that you need to see a dermatologist), but I like it.  It comes out just a little at a time and feels more like a lotion than a medicinal cream. It is drying, so be careful where you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  If you don&#x27;t need your money for other things and like the look of the bottle and the cachet of the brand name, then it will be a good purchase for you.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. I did not spend $90 on it, so I have no need to reduce my cognitive dissonance by fooling myself that it&#x27;s worth that amount of money. Also, I&#x27;m a research scientist who teaches research methods. I hope that will give you some context for my thoughts about this product. In short, I think it&#x27;s a scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way this product goes on and feels. It&#x27;s light and smooth and goes on with a matte rather than glossy finish, so my make-up can go over it (and you do need to wear some sort of sunscreen over any benzoyl peroxide product because of the way it interacts with sunlight). Research indicated that benzoyl peroxide is effective at reducing bacteria on the skin and in the pore. This product has a 2.5% concentration. You can purchase that concentration or higher at your local drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s supposed to set this product apart from the cheap drugstore variety (e.g. Clearasil) is its so-called patented &amp;#34;SMART TARGET&amp;#34; delivery system which is supposed to &amp;#34;guide medicine directly into pores&amp;#34; with &amp;#34;laser precision.&amp;#34; That sounds awesome. However, anyone can patent the name of a &amp;#34;technology&amp;#34; like &amp;#34;SMART TARGET&amp;#34; to make it sound like there&#x27;s something more hi-tech going on than just smearing benzoyl peroxide into your pores with your finger (the same way you would with a tube of Clearasil). Just because it has a fancy name and a patented label does not mean it is more effective than the usual finger/tube application process. The only &amp;#34;active ingredient&amp;#34; listed on this product is 2.5% benzoyl peroxide. Nothing else. For that reason, I suspect that this is a big scam -- a way for you to think that by spending $90, you&#x27;re getting a product that&#x27;s better than Clearasil. I suspect that if you&#x27;ve got a major breakout problem, it would be much more effective and way cheaper to go buy a tube of cheap 5% or 10% concentration benzoyl peroxide from your drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the inactive ingredients in this product is almond oil. It probably helps to balance out the dryness caused by any bp product. It also has fragrance, which can be irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in short, I think this product works, but the $90 price tag is ridiculous because you could purchase something just as effective for $5. Unfortunately, when we spend $90 on a product, we feel a need to validate our behavior and &amp;#34;see&amp;#34; results that are worth the $90. Otherwise, we feel like we made a $90 mistake, and that&#x27;s upsetting.our drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the inactive ingredients in this product is almond oil.

            <li> I use benzoyl peroxide on a daily basis and really didn&#x27;t expect the Proactiv+ Pore Targeting Treatment to be any different from the generic brands I usually buy.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that I like it better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proactiv+ dispenses as a gel but becomes almost a liquid when applied to the skin.  As a result, it disperses very well, and a little goes a long way.  I wonder whether this superior dispersing ability may be why the product seems to work slightly better.  It has no fragrance and is invisible on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The description of the Pore Targeting Treatment indicates it is a 90-day supply.  If this proves to be accurate, I have to wonder whether the container is much bigger than it needs to be, perhaps to give the impression of there being more product in it.  A half-ounce tube of any generic brand of benzoyl peroxide lasts me much longer than 90 days, for less than $5.  The bottom line, for me, is that liking it slightly better doesn&#x27;t come near justifying paying almost 20 times as much for Proactiv+.</li>
            <li> This product, Proactiv + Pore Targeting Treatment came to me through the VINE program and I passed it to my college age daughter for her always tough appraisal.  Her report: the product worked like most acne products she uses.  Easy to apply with no visible residue and it did seem to reduce pore size.  For her, it did not beat up the other products she uses.  And maybe more note worthy here, this stuff is really expensive.  Over all a good product, but pricey.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from this as proactive seems to be a success due to marketing rather than containing anything innovative. I occasionally use a benzoyl peroxide spot treatment so I expected this to much the same. I was pleasantly surprised. The lotion makes it easy to apply to the whole face. After a week of using just once a day I have had zero breakouts . I have noticed no change in my  pores but my skin feels softer and looks slightly smoother.&lt;br /&gt;More effective than I expected.</li>
            <li> Proactiv+ Pore Targeting Treatment really works! The gel formula isn&#x27;t sticky or too tacky like others and the best part is that it isn&#x27;t like a high gloss lotion that makes your skin shine like a beacon. Used it on a minor breakout and the Proactiv cleared it in two days. That&#x27;s pretty awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Follow the warnings and directions for use and all went well for us.&lt;br /&gt;As with all Proactiv products, it&#x27;s on the pricier spectrum but it&#x27;s hard to argue with success!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This product was great, especially during the hot and humid months when acne is more challenging. It helped to significantly manage acne and wasn&#x27;t drying at all on my face.</li>
            <li> My son sometimes has problem areas with acne, not super bad, but here and there (especially where his hair/bangs are on his forehead.) He has tried a few things. He does like that this goes on sort of smoothly and without a color or shiny finish. He said he really liked the way his skin felt using it, however...for blemishes, he said that it wasn&#x27;t much different than much else he has used. I think the price is sort of high for a product like this, and maybe would recommend trying a similar, lower priced product (or two) first. For instance, my son likes the combination of two products I got here on amazon: [[ASIN:B001MA7QFO Topix Benzoyl Peroxide Wash]] and regular [[ASIN:B001E76B0G Witch Hazel]]. His skin seems to clear up well and quickly with those, so he sticks with that. Plus the price is good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For us, the price is sort of prohibitive, so we mostly only be tempted to try this if other over-the-counter items weren&#x27;t working. Others may feel the price is fair. It does make his skin feel nice, just not enough to justify the price difference. As an aside, if you haven&#x27;t used this type of medicine (benzoyl peroxide), please know that it will bleach your bath towels. My son didn&#x27;t know that and his favorite towel has white blotches. He uses bathroom papertowels now mostly to dry his face after using these types of products.</li>
            <li> This Proactiv+ is quite an easy addition to your face cleaning routine and yet it really works. You use this after you wash your face with another cleaner (I&#x27;m assuming that Proactiv has a cleaner like that, as the bottle says this is Step Two in a three step process). Dry your face and put a small amount into your hand and rub it into the skin on your face. Make sure not to get too much on as it can dry out your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it and I&#x27;ve found that its&#x27; working so far. I even have less blackheads on my nose that I did before I started. The smell is light and shouldn&#x27;t bother anyone at all. It is pricey but it does work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what Smart Target Benzoyl Peroxide Delivery Technology is, but to judge by the painful red lump on my cheek, apparently my skin can defeat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, for me, this kind of breakout is new.  My skin is usually in the \\&quot;annoying and eye-catching\\&quot; range, but I never have painful breakouts.  Until I started using this--now I have several.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t explain why.  The active ingredient is benzoyl peroxide 2.5%, and this is something I&#x27;ve used on and off for years.  It can&#x27;t be a reaction to that.  In any case, I&#x27;ll be going back to another product with benzoyl peroxide, so I&#x27;ll know more in a couple of weeks or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this worked for me I&#x27;d have nothing else to complain about.  The lotion feels soft and smooth, it applies evenly without feeling unpleasant or greasy, and it leaves a matte finish that doesn&#x27;t affect my makeup.  There is a slight odor, but it is not strong enough to bother me and it fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m testing a sample, this product is expensive enough that I&#x27;d have tried to return it if I had bought this and gotten these results.  I know it works for some people and in that case it may be worth the investment.  But now that I&#x27;ve tried it, I wish I had stayed with my regular benzoyl peroxide product.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter lives with me and has been plagued with acne this spring. We have used this Proactiv+Pore Targeting Treatment and it is certainly improving her skin. She first uses the Proactiv cleanser and then applies the pore treatment. This product goes on very lightly and dries to a lovely matte finish that is completely unnoticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have not noticed any drying of her skin, but at 13, her skin is very oily. I like that it is light enough that she can still use a sunscreen this summer.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, with pores that are prone to irritation and clogging mainly by dry skin. Most acne medications dry my skin out further, but I&#x27;ve heard about Proactive for about half my life at this point, so when I was given the option to try, I eagerly accepted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazingly enough, this doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. After less than two weeks, the improvement in brightness and skin clarity is obvious. I have a clear, dewy complexion that practically glows. My face feels so clean after every use, and persistent problem areas have already disappeared. My pores have definitely cleared up and they&#x27;ve basically diminished to the point of invisibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a very, very long way. One bottle is a 90-day treatment. While the price is hefty, the results are absolutely worth it, and I will be buying the entire Proactiv+ line from here out. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li> Did not give relief to clogged pores.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the same as 5-10$ acne treatment. There&#x27;s nothing here that makes it worth a hundred bucks and while most Proactiv products are great at their purpose, this one is a big miss with corporate fancy jargon to lure the gullible in. &amp;#34;Smart Target&amp;#34;? There&#x27;s no nanotech bugs in here healing your acne.</li>
            <li> My son is using a face wash product that has helped, but there have been several areas where the acne is especially stubborn.  He uses this Proactiv product for those problem areas and it works extremely well.  After just a couple of days, those trouble spots are gone and back under control.  He still used a face wash regimen, but this Proactiv has been a great supplement to that.</li>
            <li> It is  a good product that I have used since it has come to the market. There are very expensive products on the market but this one does the job just as well.</li>
            <li> I myself do not use this product, but my teenage son does. Having tried many other products like this on the market, this product has proven to be the one that works the best for his skin and helps the most resolve the random break out issues he experiences from time to time. He uses it with other Proactive + products as well.</li>
