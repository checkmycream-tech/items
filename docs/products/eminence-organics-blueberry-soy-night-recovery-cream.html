            <li>I thought I would LOVE this, but could not get passed the smell.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>I love this cream and use it night and day.</li>
            <li>and this makes my skin look moist and healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this face cream.</li>
            <li>Have used Coconut Age Corrective moisturizer which I adore and thought I needed something more in a more arid climate.  </li>
            <li>Also still love my Coconut Age Corrective moisturizer and use in daytime.</li>
            <li>I have combo oily skin, and I was very excited to try this, since I have a tinny bit of wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Wonderful stuff, I have used it for a long time!</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll be switching over to this for most nights in particular instead of the Eight Greens (also good, but I like this one more).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products on and off over the years, and I&#x27;m so grateful to Amazon for selecting and stocking this fabulous line from Hungary.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li>This stuff is just as good if not better, and smells great.  </li>
            <li>Love this Cream and Received Quickly  </li>
            <li>This product line is fantastic  </li>
            <li>I love the product and keep it in the fridge to keep it fresh.  </li>
            <li>It really does feel like a nice treat at the end or start of the day--</li>
            <li>And cheaply....  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for years and still enjoy lathering it on every eve.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin so smooth.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin so hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is so delightful to put on your face, because you can feel the difference instantly - - the skin feels so very luxuriously smooth.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product that I have been using for several years.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, but I&#x27;m very much into fruity/foody type scents; however, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s overpowering</li>
            <li>I love the smell so much, that I&#x27;d probably buy it even if it didn&#x27;t work so well, just for the glorious smell!  </li>
            <li>I first discovered the brand at a spa I had visited / love the Organic Sun Defense mineral powder.</li>
            <li>First of all this is my favorite skin care line.</li>
            <li>Like spreading cool silk on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I also love mixing it with the Nasberry treatment, which has a smell I don&#x27;t really care for, but the blueberry masks</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product and shipping was fast</li>
            <li>, Resist C15 Super Booster (a vitimin C and E lotion) and the Eminence Blueberry Soy Night Recovery Cream.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about my moisturizers and this stuff does the trick!!</li>
            <li>It absorbs very well and smells fabulous.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li>This item was shipped quickly and in the original package, brand new, unused!  </li>
            <li>but this made be break out all over - cleared right up after discontinuing use.</li>
            <li>Eminence offers so many different products I&#x27;ll have to get a few travel kits to find the line that&#x27;s best for me.  </li>
            <li>The product itself I love, we live in the high Rockies (think 10,000 feet)</li>
            <li>I noticed a big difference in my skin--no more dry patches and my face has a healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly and in sturdy packaging.</li>
            <li>I discovered it when my daughter gifted me with the sampler collection last year.  </li>
            <li>It really does plump up those wrinkles as well!</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more soon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more combo with the occasional spot here</li>
            <li>It is absolutely DIVINE!</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>An entire dinky-sized sample lasted me more than a week, often being used twice a day.</li>
            <li>I love Eminence products and will definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and although the ingredients are natural, it smells heavenly.</li>
            <li>Really fabulous and worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Bought their various sample products for friends to try, most of whom are now firm converts to the cult of this amazing range.</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully and the smell isn&#x27;t overbearing; but is a little odd.</li>
            <li>Thick night cream, perfect for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I personally think it&#x27;s fine as is, but I don&#x27;t need alot on, even despite having combo-dry skin.</li>
            <li>So far, I have to say this is my most favorite, and I have quite a few so far.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>the nasberry and the two combined really jump started my mid-30s skin.</li>
            <li>I really like the Eminence Stone Crop Moisturizer</li>
            <li>My skin didn&#x27;t like it much.  </li>
            <li>In the morning, after cleansing my skin, my face feels so much fresher and brighter.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different creams to find something that actually moisturized at night and didn&#x27;t make my skin feel like it was burning or sticky or just</li>
            <li>Have been using at night and really like it so far!  </li>
            <li>If you can water it down for your skin and make it last longer it would be more economical.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely pleased with the product after trying a sample and plan on purchasing a full-sized product this week, despite being tight on funds.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li>I live in Minnesota…</li>
            <li>more dry skin even after a long night sleep.&lt;br /&gt;Definite</li>
            <li>my skin is dewy and soft and supple!</li>
            <li>But this stuff and Eminence&#x27;s many other products are simply the bomb.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the past year and am pleased with the results...great texture and smell.  </li>
            <li>Though I have 57 year old mature skin and live in a very dry climate and therefore use this full strength</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a positive difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s a typical Eminence whip--nice and thick, smells great,</li>
            <li>smells amazing, wanted it to work - after two days, i&#x27;m either suddenly allergic to blueberries or something in the jar or its expired - but my face tightened so hard, it didnt feel like my skin</li>
            <li>I like this moisturizer so far.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my now-sensitive skin nor cause breakouts for me, and it&#x27;s not greasy whatsoever ( a rarity with natural products, it seems).</li>
            <li>Smells natural like blueberry yogurt.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered one for aging skin and one for sensitive skin and can&#x27;t wait to try those.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;84 year old look like 65 years young.&lt;br /&gt;used</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft in the morning, even during the winter.  </li>
            <li>When I do run out I will most definitely be buying another little jar!</li>
            <li>I see a major difference in the hydration of my skin, particularly on my forehead, where my skin looks about 10 years younger!!</li>
            <li>After a month of using this product I now have more wrinkles then when I started, not good.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT; it is lasting me forever too, so it is well worth the expensive price.</li>
            <li>really noticed a difference in my skin after using it a week, especially when combined with the nasberry, but I noticed an even bigger one by the time I ran out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 25 years old, and a big fan of eminence products.</li>
            <li>Tried all the usual high end brands and going more organic in the past 10 years.</li>
            <li>I thought other women would really benefit.</li>
            <li>: doesn&#x27;t seem that moisturzing (compared to other whips), and it absolutely broke me out.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week so far, but I swear my skin is softer, yet firmer in only that amount of time!</li>
            <li>The blueberry scent is amazing and although it is expensive, the container should last you several months.</li>

            <li> I love the smell, but I&#x27;m very much into fruity/foody type scents; however, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s overpowering</li>
            <li> I love the smell so much, that I&#x27;d probably buy it even if it didn&#x27;t work so well, just for the glorious smell!  </li>
            <li> I first discovered the brand at a spa I had visited / love the Organic Sun Defense mineral powder.</li>
            <li> First of all this is my favorite skin care line.</li>
            <li> Like spreading cool silk on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I also love mixing it with the Nasberry treatment, which has a smell I don&#x27;t really care for, but the blueberry masks</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product and shipping was fast</li>
            <li> , Resist C15 Super Booster (a vitimin C and E lotion) and the Eminence Blueberry Soy Night Recovery Cream.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about my moisturizers and this stuff does the trick!!</li>
            <li> It absorbs very well and smells fabulous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> This item was shipped quickly and in the original package, brand new, unused!  </li>
            <li> but this made be break out all over - cleared right up after discontinuing use.</li>
            <li> Eminence offers so many different products I&#x27;ll have to get a few travel kits to find the line that&#x27;s best for me.  </li>
            <li> The product itself I love, we live in the high Rockies (think 10,000 feet)</li>
            <li> I noticed a big difference in my skin--no more dry patches and my face has a healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly and in sturdy packaging.</li>
            <li> I discovered it when my daughter gifted me with the sampler collection last year.  </li>
            <li> It really does plump up those wrinkles as well!</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more combo with the occasional spot here</li>
            <li> It is absolutely DIVINE!</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> An entire dinky-sized sample lasted me more than a week, often being used twice a day.</li>
            <li> I love Eminence products and will definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and although the ingredients are natural, it smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> Really fabulous and worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Bought their various sample products for friends to try, most of whom are now firm converts to the cult of this amazing range.</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully and the smell isn&#x27;t overbearing; but is a little odd.</li>
            <li> Thick night cream, perfect for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I personally think it&#x27;s fine as is, but I don&#x27;t need alot on, even despite having combo-dry skin.</li>
            <li> So far, I have to say this is my most favorite, and I have quite a few so far.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> the nasberry and the two combined really jump started my mid-30s skin.</li>
            <li> I really like the Eminence Stone Crop Moisturizer</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t like it much.  </li>
            <li> In the morning, after cleansing my skin, my face feels so much fresher and brighter.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different creams to find something that actually moisturized at night and didn&#x27;t make my skin feel like it was burning or sticky or just</li>
            <li> Have been using at night and really like it so far!  </li>
            <li> If you can water it down for your skin and make it last longer it would be more economical.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely pleased with the product after trying a sample and plan on purchasing a full-sized product this week, despite being tight on funds.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> I live in Minnesota…</li>
            <li> more dry skin even after a long night sleep.&lt;br /&gt;Definite</li>
            <li> my skin is dewy and soft and supple!</li>
            <li> But this stuff and Eminence&#x27;s many other products are simply the bomb.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past year and am pleased with the results...great texture and smell.  </li>
            <li> Though I have 57 year old mature skin and live in a very dry climate and therefore use this full strength</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a positive difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s a typical Eminence whip--nice and thick, smells great,</li>
            <li> smells amazing, wanted it to work - after two days, i&#x27;m either suddenly allergic to blueberries or something in the jar or its expired - but my face tightened so hard, it didnt feel like my skin</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer so far.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my now-sensitive skin nor cause breakouts for me, and it&#x27;s not greasy whatsoever ( a rarity with natural products, it seems).</li>
            <li> Smells natural like blueberry yogurt.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered one for aging skin and one for sensitive skin and can&#x27;t wait to try those.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;84 year old look like 65 years young.&lt;br /&gt;used</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft in the morning, even during the winter.  </li>
            <li> When I do run out I will most definitely be buying another little jar!</li>
            <li> I see a major difference in the hydration of my skin, particularly on my forehead, where my skin looks about 10 years younger!!</li>
            <li> After a month of using this product I now have more wrinkles then when I started, not good.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT; it is lasting me forever too, so it is well worth the expensive price.</li>
            <li> really noticed a difference in my skin after using it a week, especially when combined with the nasberry, but I noticed an even bigger one by the time I ran out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 years old, and a big fan of eminence products.</li>
            <li> Tried all the usual high end brands and going more organic in the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> I thought other women would really benefit.</li>
            <li> : doesn&#x27;t seem that moisturzing (compared to other whips), and it absolutely broke me out.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week so far, but I swear my skin is softer, yet firmer in only that amount of time!</li>
            <li> The blueberry scent is amazing and although it is expensive, the container should last you several months.</li>
            <li> My forehead is generally quite dry and after only a couple of weeks using this product</li>
            <li> I would love to purchase this product again, but right now I&#x27;m going to look for something a little less expensive...</li>
            <li> The gal who does my facials recommended this since I have such dry skin especially my forehead.</li>
            <li> It is concentrated, so a tiny bit goes a very long way</li>
            <li> skin was so tight and had this light little bumps that i immediately had to cover my face with heavy moisturizers to get rid of the feeling</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to only use it in the summer because it&#x27;s too harsh on my sensitive &amp; dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> The cream smells so good, but unfortunately I found it to be a little too heavy on my face.</li>
            <li> I carefully researched the condition, purchased The Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Clearing Facial Wash, Paula&#x27;s Choice Skin</li>
            <li> It just feels strange on the face.</li>
            <li> I do use other Eminence products, especially masques, but found this showed the fastest results.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also designed to be mixed with other products, if so desired, which is something that the company encourages; you can even find videos on Youtube.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt my face (just a little sting with the BHA Liquid but nothing like the harsh &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34; the doctor prescribed) and my skin is much improved.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this cream has been a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin</li>
            <li> Though I do not normally go for the fruity smells what this cream does to my skin</li>
            <li> It also lasts a long time because you only need a little.  </li>
            <li> Then, I wanted to return the product and they wanted to give half of the money back</li>
            <li> I use it day or night and especially during months when my skin gets a little dry.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I was suffering from the worst dry skin I&#x27;ve ever experienced, and it just wasn&#x27;t quite as moisturizing as I was expecting after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 40s, and my skin is dry and quite sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Yes it smells a little fruity, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> , I will never go back to any other products after using EO!!</li>
            <li> and I fully expect it to last a few months.</li>
            <li> So only a small amount is necessary and watering down with a few drops of water or another cream/serum will make it easier to spread on.</li>
            <li> after applying this cream, my face feels tight and dry.  </li>
            <li> And....I wouldn&#x27;t consider getting it anywhere other than Amazon.</li>
            <li> I usually use the same cream for morning and night, but I thought I would give this product a try.</li>
            <li> but something is different with them in the past year or so.</li>
            <li> and like it&#x27;s thick consistency, it would be easy to slightly dilute it with water to thin it down for someone with younger skin who doesn&#x27;t want it quite so thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used it during the day when my skin was feeling a little dry.</li>
            <li> I have moderately dry skin and do not find this too heavy to wear as a daytime moisturizer as well, which I do.</li>
            <li> However it only lasted me about a month and a half, which isn&#x27;t very long when it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a little soon to tell.</li>
            <li> so if you like lighter creams I would either add a little water when using or choose one of Eminences day</li>
            <li> so I put a little water in my palm and mix together before applying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money I got rashes on my face.</li>
            <li> Use them everyday.  </li>
            <li> Manufacturer doesn&#x27;t recommend using it if the seal was open or broken.</li>
            <li> Just wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about this product, maybe because I have been overwhelmed by an intoxicating grape smell on my face that feels like a heavy cream layered on my face.  </li>
            <li> noticed a few negative comments on the product&#x27;s thickness.</li>
            <li> Not sure what &amp;#34;recovery cream&amp;#34; this one was suppose to do, but all it did for me was gag me and break me out.  </li>
            <li> Knowing I got the real thing, I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> The past few products I&#x27;ve ordered from them are either irritating, or cause break-outs, or just don&#x27;t seem to moisturize.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s too thick, just add water.</li>
            <li> It is thick</li>
            <li> During the dry, cold winter months I use this cream during the day also.  </li>
            <li> The seals on both were broken.</li>
            <li> She prescribed mirvaso ($90.00 cream) that hurt my face and made the condition worse.</li>
            <li> The seal was broken.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s just not worth the money. :(</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Do your skin a favor and skip all the artificial stuff in the expensive Dermatologica, etc.  </li>
            <li> - i&#x27;ve never had an experience so bad.  </li>
            <li> Use sparingly, otherwise will go on very sick.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t love this product any more than I do.  Like spreading cool silk on my skin.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of discretionary income, but this goes in the necessity column for me.  I&#x27;ve tried many products on and off over the years, and I&#x27;m so grateful to Amazon for selecting and stocking this fabulous line from Hungary.  I feel regal just wearing it.  I discovered it when my daughter gifted me with the sampler collection last year.  I am hooked.  If I&#x27;m breathing, I&#x27;m wearing Eminence.  And....I wouldn&#x27;t consider getting it anywhere other than Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very effective in providing nighttime moisture for my face. Creamy and organic, actually does smell like blueberries!</li>
            <li> Great product. Thanks</li>
            <li> This product line is fantastic  All products are quality</li>
            <li> I started seeing a change in my skin almost immediately.  I use this at night in a heavier layer and use it as a day moisturizer too.  I love the product and keep it in the fridge to keep it fresh.  I&#x27;ve been looking for an organic line and this fits the bill.  I&#x27;ve ordered the Bamboo firming serum and the Coconut moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li> This night cream is the most luscious I&#x27;ve ever used. It absorbs very well and smells fabulous. It really does plump up those wrinkles as well! I have moderately dry skin and do not find this too heavy to wear as a daytime moisturizer as well, which I do. Really fabulous and worth the extra money. I will definitely order more soon.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer so far. It&#x27;s still a little soon to tell. But I&#x27;ve liked just about everything I&#x27;ve purchased from Eminence.</li>
            <li> Perfect nighttime moisturizer. I&#x27;ve even used it during the day when my skin was feeling a little dry.</li>
            <li> smells amazing, wanted it to work - after two days, i&#x27;m either suddenly allergic to blueberries or something in the jar or its expired - but my face tightened so hard, it didnt feel like my skin - i&#x27;ve never had an experience so bad.  skin was so tight and had this light little bumps that i immediately had to cover my face with heavy moisturizers to get rid of the feeling</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this if you&#x27;re at all acne-prone. I wish I had read all of the reviews before purchasing. I&#x27;ve used many Eminence products and would consider most of them 5-star but this cream clogged my pores and gave me tons of acne. I don&#x27;t have a big issue with acne - I&#x27;m more combo with the occasional spot here and there but this made be break out all over - cleared right up after discontinuing use.</li>
            <li> This night cream is &amp;#34;off-the-charts-amazing&amp;#34;!!! It is concentrated, so a tiny bit goes a very long way and I fully expect it to last a few months. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week so far, but I swear my skin is softer, yet firmer in only that amount of time! And the smell!!! It is absolutely DIVINE! I love the smell so much, that I&#x27;d probably buy it even if it didn&#x27;t work so well, just for the glorious smell!  ;-) I also appreciate that it is organic and isn&#x27;t loaded with chemicals and preservatives. Though I have 57 year old mature skin and live in a very dry climate and therefore use this full strength and like it&#x27;s thick consistency, it would be easy to slightly dilute it with water to thin it down for someone with younger skin who doesn&#x27;t want it quite so thick. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product! I will continue to buy it in the future!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely pleased with the product after trying a sample and plan on purchasing a full-sized product this week, despite being tight on funds. I love the smell, but I&#x27;m very much into fruity/foody type scents; however, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s overpowering and it smells natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as its effectiveness, I was really impressed with what the product did. I do use other Eminence products, especially masques, but found this showed the fastest results. I also love mixing it with the Nasberry treatment, which has a smell I don&#x27;t really care for, but the blueberry masks the nasberry and the two combined really jump started my mid-30s skin. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my now-sensitive skin nor cause breakouts for me, and it&#x27;s not greasy whatsoever ( a rarity with natural products, it seems). I&#x27;ve even worn it under an SPF cream without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really noticed a difference in my skin after using it a week, especially when combined with the nasberry, but I noticed an even bigger one by the time I ran out and now I&#x27;m going through a bit of withdraw ha. So far, I have to say this is my most favorite, and I have quite a few so far. It really does feel like a nice treat at the end or start of the day--one that actually does something for once. I think I&#x27;ll be switching over to this for most nights in particular instead of the Eight Greens (also good, but I like this one more). I also like using it with the Bamboo Firming fluid underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a few negative comments on the product&#x27;s thickness. I wanted to add that Eminence makes their products concentrated so that you can add water to make the products a consistency that you prefer, but without losing the overall effectiveness of the product itself. They&#x27;re also designed to be mixed with other products, if so desired, which is something that the company encourages; you can even find videos on Youtube. If it&#x27;s too thick, just add water. I personally think it&#x27;s fine as is, but I don&#x27;t need alot on, even despite having combo-dry skin. An entire dinky-sized sample lasted me more than a week, often being used twice a day. So only a small amount is necessary and watering down with a few drops of water or another cream/serum will make it easier to spread on.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! The smell is amazing! The product itself I love, we live in the high Rockies (think 10,000 feet) so my skin sees its fair share of damage. I am very picky about my moisturizers and this stuff does the trick!! It feel so good and smooth rubbing it in each night and in the morning my skin is dewy and soft and supple! Its awesome! I would recommend!</li>
            <li> Great night cream!...I have been using Eminence for 10 years now and this is my favorite of their night creams.</li>
            <li> I love most all Eminence products. This product smells like a blueberry smoothie and feels good on my skin. My skin has not had any adverse reactions to this product and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Okay. I&#x27;m going to only use it in the summer because it&#x27;s too harsh on my sensitive &amp; dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> I usually use the same cream for morning and night, but I thought I would give this product a try. I love it! Though I do not normally go for the fruity smells what this cream does to my skin is amazing! I will continue to purchase. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> Love this product;  great results, and love the smell!</li>
            <li> Smells natural like blueberry yogurt.  My skin looks more hydrated since I&#x27;ve been using it / my eyes are not irritated by any chemicals and I&#x27;ve had no break outs or allergic reactions.  I use it every night.  Eminence offers so many different products I&#x27;ll have to get a few travel kits to find the line that&#x27;s best for me.  I&#x27;ve ordered one for aging skin and one for sensitive skin and can&#x27;t wait to try those.  I first discovered the brand at a spa I had visited / love the Organic Sun Defense mineral powder.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product. It smells great, feels great going on. After a month of using this product I now have more wrinkles then when I started, not good.</li>
            <li> Love the creamy texture...and the smell is awesome!</li>
            <li> Does the job.  And cheaply....  Do your skin a favor and skip all the artificial stuff in the expensive Dermatologica, etc.  This stuff is just as good if not better, and smells great.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Thick night cream, perfect for dry skin. Makes your skin feel great in mornings specially during winter and spring.&lt;br /&gt;~Sakshi</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of two different eminence organic skincare. The seals on both were broken. I returned the products.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have been using it for years and still enjoy lathering it on every eve. My husband also loves it and uses it regularly. The smell is divine and I am always pleased with the hydrated feeling of my skin upon waking in the morning. I definitely would recommend it and will be purchasing this item again.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Makes your skin so smooth.  I use it at night and use a different Eminence moisturizer during the day.</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully and the smell isn&#x27;t overbearing; but is a little odd. I love Eminence products and will definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> after applying this cream, my face feels tight and dry.  doens&#x27;t moisturize at all...waste of money.  it&#x27;s either doesn&#x27;t work or it&#x27;s an expired jar</li>
            <li> This is a great face cream to use at night (as it doesn&#x27;t have an SPF for daytime use).  This item was shipped quickly and in the original package, brand new, unused!  I love, love, love the smell of this cream and it works great!  Leaves my skin so hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it! It&#x27;s a waste of money I got rashes on my face. Then, I wanted to return the product and they wanted to give half of the money back</li>
            <li> I look 10 years  younger.&lt;br /&gt;84 year old look like 65 years young.&lt;br /&gt;used this product for about 5 years</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, works even better! Definitely noticed a difference in my skin the next am, I use along side the Neroli age correcting hydrating mist..I had my mother try and she noticed next morning results as well, I will never go back to any other products after using EO!!</li>
            <li> did not do anything for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 years old, and a big fan of eminence products. I have combo oily skin, and I was very excited to try this, since I have a tinny bit of wrinkles around my eyes. The cream smells so good, but unfortunately I found it to be a little too heavy on my face. It made my skin breakout around the hair line.  I really like the Eminence Stone Crop Moisturizer, I do believe it works great. I will keep using this, but instead i will add a some drops of water, so dilute. Oh, and I didn&#x27;t see any improvement on my wrinkles.  [[ASIN:B000LEDR82 Eminence Organic Skincare. Stone Crop Whip Moisturizer]]</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Eminence in Park City, UT and just love their moisturizers!  The smell is wonderful and my skin looks great!</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and saw my dermatologist. She prescribed mirvaso ($90.00 cream) that hurt my face and made the condition worse. I carefully researched the condition, purchased The Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Clearing Facial Wash, Paula&#x27;s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid, Resist C15 Super Booster (a vitimin C and E lotion) and the Eminence Blueberry Soy Night Recovery Cream. It didn&#x27;t hurt my face (just a little sting with the BHA Liquid but nothing like the harsh &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34; the doctor prescribed) and my skin is much improved. I use the Blueberry Soy as a day moisturizer too and add MD Solar Sciences Tinted Mineral Beauty Balm SPF 50. I was not paid for this review and I don&#x27;t write them often but the products made such a difference I thought other women would really benefit.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Eminence products.  Use them everyday.  During the dry, cold winter months I use this cream during the day also.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Great wonderful smelling</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this cream has been a lifesaver. It smells great, but not too overpowering. I noticed a big difference in my skin--no more dry patches and my face has a healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly and in sturdy packaging. Very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Skin so smooth after apply a thin layer&lt;br /&gt;No more dry skin even after a long night sleep.&lt;br /&gt;Definite a great product and continue to use.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it lasts forever.  Use sparingly, otherwise will go on very sick.  I have combo skin and it&#x27;s rejuvenating for my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t like it much.  My skin became a tiny bit agitated.  Gave it to my mom and she loves it.  I love their Calendula and Apricot cream best.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing.  Feels even better</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT; it is lasting me forever too, so it is well worth the expensive price. When I do run out I will most definitely be buying another little jar!</li>
            <li> I thought I would LOVE this, but could not get passed the smell.  Not sure what &amp;#34;recovery cream&amp;#34; this one was suppose to do, but all it did for me was gag me and break me out.  I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> Eminence is the best! If you have dry skin and you are vegan, you can&#x27;t get a better moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Eminence makes nourishing skincare products</li>
            <li> Amazing for day and night. Smells incredible. I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a positive difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> One of the best creams. Smells great but not too strong. I wake up with wonderful skin in the morning. Heavier cream, but I have never broke out from it.</li>
            <li> I love the scent. It is a lovely creamy feel, and does not make you break out!  It also lasts a long time because you only need a little.  With that being said, I was hoping to get the fall scent (I&#x27;m guessing pumpkin), but I don&#x27;t need more yet!</li>
            <li> The seal was broken. Manufacturer doesn&#x27;t recommend using it if the seal was open or broken. Mine was ended up not using the product. Just wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff, I have used it for a long time! I love this product! I will buy this again.I also use the daytime!</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh. Tried all the usual high end brands and going more organic in the past 10 years. But this stuff and Eminence&#x27;s many other products are simply the bomb. Its the only skin care line that I&#x27;ve used that visibly and tactilely makes a difference. Put a plastic surgeon friend onto Eminence and she is blown away. I use this with the Bamboo Skin Firmer ..and in 1 year I look 5 years younger...so I&#x27;ve been told. And, the West Australian sun is one of the meanest that exists. Bought their various sample products for friends to try, most of whom are now firm converts to the cult of this amazing range.</li>
            <li> Such a difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> First of all this is my favorite skin care line. This cream is so rich and nourishing and smells so delicious you want to eat it!  It is definitely a thicker night cream so if you like lighter creams I would either add a little water when using or choose one of Eminences day creams.&lt;br /&gt;But I love this cream and use it night and day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past year and am pleased with the results...great texture and smell.  It&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I live in Minnesota….hard on skincare.  This is the richest and replenishing cream ever</li>
            <li> I really liked this face cream, but it wasn&#x27;t quite as great as I was hoping. It smells amazing, probably my favorite smelling face product ever. However it only lasted me about a month and a half, which isn&#x27;t very long when it is so expensive. If you can water it down for your skin and make it last longer it would be more economical. I was suffering from the worst dry skin I&#x27;ve ever experienced, and it just wasn&#x27;t quite as moisturizing as I was expecting after reading the reviews.  I would love to purchase this product again, but right now I&#x27;m going to look for something a little less expensive...</li>
            <li> I have been using the Organic Blueberry Night Recovery Cream for several nights.  It is so delightful to put on your face, because you can feel the difference instantly - - the skin feels so very luxuriously smooth.  In the morning, after cleansing my skin, my face feels so much fresher and brighter. I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> Have been experimenting with the different products that Emerinence supports. Like this one a lot but my personal fav. It works well and I like the fruity smells. Like the feeling in the morning. It&#x27;s just a personal preference.</li>
            <li> Love this Cream and Received Quickly  I am quite please with this cream.  I have very dry skin and this makes my skin look moist and healthy.</li>
            <li> This is my to-go cream.  I use it day or night and especially during months when my skin gets a little dry.  My skin feels smooth and although the ingredients are natural, it smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> I love this face cream. It is thick so I put a little water in my palm and mix together before applying. The blueberry scent is amazing and although it is expensive, the container should last you several months.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.  I&#x27;m in my late 40s, and my skin is dry and quite sensitive.  I have tried many different creams to find something that actually moisturized at night and didn&#x27;t make my skin feel like it was burning or sticky or just plan gross.  This cream is great, my skin loves it!  Yes it smells a little fruity, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last and it&#x27;s relatively pleasant, so it is tolerable for me.  My skin is so soft in the morning, even during the winter.  This stuff actually does what it says it will.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this from an &amp;#34;official&amp;#34; Eminence vendor, because it seems a few Amazon vendors aren&#x27;t selling the real deal. Knowing I got the real thing, I&#x27;m disappointed. The past few products I&#x27;ve ordered from them are either irritating, or cause break-outs, or just don&#x27;t seem to moisturize. That&#x27;s what happened here.&lt;br /&gt;The good: it&#x27;s a typical Eminence whip--nice and thick, smells great, all natural.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: doesn&#x27;t seem that moisturzing (compared to other whips), and it absolutely broke me out.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, and it pains me to say this, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend Eminence products anymore. I don&#x27;t know if their quality control is gone, or if they changed &amp;#34;recipes,&amp;#34; or they&#x27;re using different ingredients or suppliers....but something is different with them in the past year or so. And it&#x27;s just not worth the money. :(</li>
            <li> This is a great product that I have been using for several years. Just was convenient for me to order it online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A really good day cream.</li>
            <li> Have used Coconut Age Corrective moisturizer which I adore and thought I needed something more in a more arid climate.  Have been using at night and really like it so far!  Also still love my Coconut Age Corrective moisturizer and use in daytime.</li>
            <li> Made my skin breakout</li>
            <li> Love this product and shipping was fast</li>
            <li> Smells as great as it feels</li>
            <li> The gal who does my facials recommended this since I have such dry skin especially my forehead. This is an easy to use product after cleaning your face at night and applying, smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling at all. This is the only thing I will use as a moisturizing product at night.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about this product, maybe because I have been overwhelmed by an intoxicating grape smell on my face that feels like a heavy cream layered on my face.  It just feels strange on the face.</li>
            <li> Eminence Blueberry Soy Night Recovery Cream works so well for me!! My forehead is generally quite dry and after only a couple of weeks using this product I see a major difference in the hydration of my skin, particularly on my forehead, where my skin looks about 10 years younger!!</li>
