            <li>This stuff holds my hair in place and does not flake at all, this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>I have used many styling products in my hair to keep it neat, but the got2b glued is THE BEST.</li>
            <li>Best Gel , my Husband love it</li>
            <li>For fine hair that will not stay put this is wonderful.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good hair gel</li>
            <li>Which is a good product, but I just don&#x27;t like how it tends to flake a bit after a couple hours.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a good look.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was good, no problems there.</li>
            <li>it is a good gel.</li>
            <li>but it is still a good product maybe to someone else</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t get super crunchy and makes my hair look perfect.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this gel!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great gel, strongest hold I&#x27;ve ever used, and washes off hands easy.</li>
            <li>Great strong hold.</li>
            <li>It amazing gel (glue) for the price</li>
            <li>This controls the hair and you can achieve amazing spikes and mohawks with this.  </li>
            <li>AMAZING hair gel.</li>
            <li>This is a nice styling gel</li>
            <li>and it seemed like I had covered my face in some kind of ultra damp glue.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, excellent product.</li>
            <li>As a guy with hair that does whatever it wants, this gel tames it perfectly.</li>
            <li>Very strong hair gel.</li>
            <li>This stuff is quite amazing when it comes to hold, which is lovely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried almost every strong holding gel on the market!</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t feel very comfortable with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong sculpting gel that holds your hair in almost any position and has nice even shine without looking too glossy.</li>
            <li>would recommend if you are looking for a great product that is not strong smelling, has great hold and most importantly looks great and doesn&#x27;t flake off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but Gorilla Snot Gel was better.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>It also smells better, in my opinion, than the gels out there that have that alcohol smell.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>before i get in the shower my hair still mostly retains its form.</li>
            <li>It works as it&#x27;s supposed to, and buying a twin pack is more cost effective&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>Love this thing.</li>
            <li>Will buy more as needed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand this, but many ladies of all cultures wear lace front wigs, but some of them use the glue to wear the wig for weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing is better than this product at the moment.</li>
            <li>I am growing my hair out and it is thicker than most.  </li>
            <li>I love this gel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many hairgels overtime.</li>
            <li>before i get in the shower my hair still mostly retains its form.</li>
            <li>Then I noticed more and more hair loss and decided to stop all hair care products.</li>
            <li>The hold is phenomenal, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>love this hair gel</li>
            <li>Love this product I would buy this over and over again.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so much better than the sticky, gooey &#x27;glue&#x27;.</li>
            <li>This product is one of the best gels that Ive bought for having to put my hair up on a daily basis, and have it stay there.</li>
            <li>However, I have been thoroughly pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so many mom&#x27;s come up to ask what I use on his hair.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
            <li>Great for styling my straight hair.</li>
            <li>I also like it better than the got2b &amp;#</li>
            <li>This gel is a pretty good replacement.  </li>
            <li>And it washes out quite easily, which is lovely.</li>
            <li>Dries fast and has a good hold.</li>
            <li>Great gel for the price, better than the yellow bottle.</li>
            <li>La looks was strong but always Flaked.</li>
            <li>And amazingly it washes out of your hair pretty easily.</li>
            <li>Best gel for spiking your hair, hands down.</li>
            <li>I ride my motorcycle with this gel and my hair is fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve previously been using the yellow-bottle got2be spiking gel/glue which is basically like a thicker version, but when they came out with this I was SO impressed.</li>
            <li>It is great for spiking short hair and easily holds all day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Carefully, remove the scarf, and you will have laid edges, as well as a secure wig.  </li>
            <li>Lightly run fingers and palm through hair.</li>
            <li>Great to keep short hair spiked!</li>
            <li>it is more useful.</li>
            <li>; gives a flake free hold</li>
            <li>I have to say this gel is very very strong, it is like putting glue in your hair, I have used many gels and this one by far is supreme</li>
            <li>Super strong hold, no flaking or greasy look or feel.</li>
            <li>I have bought this before at a store but this time ordered thru Amazon and it holds like no other, and got a good purchase price with (paqck of 2) I will purchase this way again.</li>
            <li>I think the advertised purpose of using it for unique hairstyles is the way it should be used since it does provide a lot of structure for your hair.</li>
            <li>I was impressed that it was able to hold and last the entire day.  </li>
            <li>I have used countless brands of hair gel that last 20 plus years, and I have to say, this is easily the best product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>But it really does hold as well or better.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re on the fence, i would 100% say give it a try because with my thick, curly hair - this stuff is perfect.</li>
            <li>Not a bad price either.</li>
            <li>Super Glue type stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will purchase more when I&#x27;m low!</li>
            <li>It was becoming more obvious in the summer months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is a real gel just strong stuff.  </li>
            <li>My hair wants to lay forward on my forehead and need something really strong to get to to go backwards for a prohibition style haircut.  </li>
            <li>I use this to keep my mustaches smooth and curled and also to keep my full beard looking very neat.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and dries fast.</li>
            <li>Most types of gels don&#x27;t work well (aren&#x27;t strong enough) to hold my hair in place.</li>
            <li>Amazing for asian hair.  </li>
            <li>This hair gel is nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li>It holds the entire day, adds a nice shine to your hair, and doesn&#x27;t damage your hair.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This stuff is powerful.</li>
            <li>This stuff is powerful.</li>
            <li>Not sticky, and like the other reviews say, holds just as good as the glu once set.</li>
            <li>Awesome gel, ridiculous strong hold, only gel I use.</li>
            <li>But, this stuff is quite mild and I really like that.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using and have been for a while \\&quot;short sexy hair\\&quot; and that stuff is like glue indeed.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>, I pay more than this locally for 1 tube.  </li>
            <li>Okay this glue does definitely hold.</li>
            <li>It is the hardest hold ever and its fast drying!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using this same brand for more than 2 yrs</li>
            <li>While the edges are still DAMP with the gel, position the wig the way you want it ON THE WIG CAP FIRST, then push the wig lace onto the gel.  </li>
            <li>, I am glad I finally thought to look on Amazon to find it here.  </li>
            <li>I have use many different product and they were sticky and that it did not hold up in the heat (Phoenix).  </li>
            <li>I love this product and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>Used for about 8 months consistently and noticed hair loss after about 3 months</li>
            <li>I personally love this gel, and I have been using it for several years.</li>
            <li>Love it to spike my short hair.</li>
            <li>Holds up pretty well even after they wear a hat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear, so it blends in with the hair better, isn&#x27;t nearly as sticky, and doesn&#x27;t cause flakes in the hair.</li>
            <li>I was using Tigi Bed Head Head Shrink Gel, which is fantastic stuff, but they apparently discontinued the product.  </li>
            <li>received the packed in a timely manner and it works good as usually.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear gel and at first I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to have the same hold.</li>
            <li>placed the gel on my edges, and with a brush or fine tooth comb, just lay the edges by combing the hair back.  </li>
            <li>No other type of gel I&#x27;ve used can own up to what this stuff does - and I also use the hairspray by this same brand, which I also HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much stronger -</li>
            <li>I felt perhaps I purchased a product with too much structure.</li>
            <li>It can hold the style the whole day under any weather condition.</li>
            <li>but now they are available at our local drug store as well.</li>
            <li>I have used them for going on 9 years now, Thanks amazon for always stocking them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>did not work very well with what i needed</li>
            <li>If you have wavy or curly hair and want it straight, then this stuff is for you.</li>
            <li>By the time he gets home from aftercare, and then straight to soccer practice, there&#x27;s no time to shower and redo the mohawk.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have to use too much.</li>
            <li>I used to use the Got2b which was the white one, but this one is Clear Gel, and works as great as the other Got2b type.</li>
            <li>It flakes so much, but as long as you don&#x27;t touch you&#x27;re hair, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>I love the wet and crunchy look!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other gels and edge controls</li>
            <li>and if you run your fingers through it after it&#x27;s dry you get a more natural hold look that I also really like.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s certainly not bad at all especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes the wig would shift, regardless of how many bobby pins was holding it down.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting hold and very easy to style.</li>
            <li>allows me to buy more for less.</li>
            <li>I had to quickly adjust to using only a nickel sized amount.  </li>
            <li>For a better hold, or to ensure that the wig will stay for the next 8 hours (maybe longer), keep the wig hair pinned back and wrap a silk scarf around your head and tie it for about 10 mins.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than the regular gel in the yellow bottle.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really not that strong of a hold like they describe it to be.  </li>
            <li>It was applied on the wet hair let with a strong hold and shine.  </li>
            <li>Yes, this is strong holding stuff, but the product seems industrial strength and a bit rough on the hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s high quality gel.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It may not be waterproof like the other got2be, but if you don&#x27;t use shampoo it wont come out easy..</li>
            <li>If I put it in my hair when its still a little wet, it keeps the wet look and has awesome hold.  </li>
            <li>My 11 year old son applies this himself, it&#x27;s like a gel, but sets much firmer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If anyone is curious about the differences between this and the Glued Got2B one, it&#x27;s that this one comes in an actual transparent liquid form and it makes your hair shine more.</li>
            <li>The gel will leave a white residue, or probably cause bacteria if it&#x27;s not washed off for several days or weeks.id edges, as well as a secure wig.  </li>
            <li>No matter how strong the hold typically my hair can &amp;#34;break on through&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a female and I&#x27;ve got super thick hair cut into a pixie(the top</li>
            <li>For me, I have pretty thick hair which isn&#x27;t always easy to persuade to do what I want it to do.</li>
            <li>While I was loving my biosilk rock hard gelee for the hardest holding factor,I&#x27;ve come across this gem to hold my very wiry coarse curly hair!</li>
            <li>Its usually not a concern for me since I wash my hair everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have natural 4c hair and 4D edges!</li>
            <li>+ it&#x27;s a  little less water resistant which is good when you want to wash it out.</li>
            <li>You can imagine how hard it is to have a long Mohawk stay up the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;I needed a great product as my son plays soccer too.</li>
            <li>The hold is really strong, but it doesn&#x27;t ever look or feel stiff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every other &#x27;ultra-strong&#x27; gel known to man, and the best they could do was make my hair slick and slimy, or simply limp - which was not a look</li>
            <li>This product also works on natural hair.</li>
            <li>you want something that will keep your wigs in place, whether they are lace front or just a wig that you want to match the natural hair line.</li>
            <li>I was 35 years old at the time.</li>
            <li>Still I continued to use it cause it made my hair style complete.</li>
            <li>Use in on my 10 year old - holds up his Mohawk</li>
            <li>also use it on my 8 year old.  </li>
            <li>Doesnt really flake unless you touch it constantly.</li>
            <li>so overall, highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to anyone its low price as well!</li>
            <li>i prefer the glue usually, but the gel does a fantastic job as well - and holds any shape into place</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really not like glue ;-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for over a month now and it definitely beats all the other hair gel that I have used before (including Short Sexy hair Gel and American Crew).</li>
            <li>I have used everything from American Crew Firm Hold, to Axe Pomade, to La looks, and finally to the top echelon Gel.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair, so I need a strong gel to hold it in place.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that this stuff literally feels like glue, if you even try to scratch your head with this stuff in, your sure to feel a pinch like no other.</li>
            <li>Feels like gel when you squeeze it out but holds like no other gel I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>No more buying special glue removing shampoo.</li>
            <li>Be careful though because you literally only have like 30 seconds to do your hair once it is applied because it dries very fast</li>
            <li>so I like that it is not sticky all day long and that it holds very well with short hair.</li>
            <li>Holds my hair (about 2in long) straight up on end for the entire day... and then some.  </li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t rinse it out at night, I wake up in the morning with nearly the same hair style.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little practice to get it right for your hairstyle because it holds so well.</li>
            <li>Some of the other Got2b Glued products leave a really sticky residue on your hair</li>
            <li>I have a full, thick, illustrious head of hair.</li>
            <li>Used the yellow tube (Glued) for years and always felt it was sticky and a little hard to make sure the white was completely blended.</li>
            <li>this is not joke, when the tube says warning do not apply too much, well, there is a reason, I applied like regular gel, not a good idea, my hair was freaking hard in 2 minutes, I had to shower again, this gel totally does the job, why pay for other products that don&#x27;t work when this one works amazing.</li>

            <li> I have used many styling products in my hair to keep it neat, but the got2b glued is THE BEST.</li>
            <li> Best Gel , my Husband love it</li>
            <li> For fine hair that will not stay put this is wonderful.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good hair gel</li>
            <li> Which is a good product, but I just don&#x27;t like how it tends to flake a bit after a couple hours.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a good look.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was good, no problems there.</li>
            <li> it is a good gel.</li>

            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this gel!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great gel, strongest hold I&#x27;ve ever used, and washes off hands easy.</li>
            <li> Great strong hold.</li>
            <li> It amazing gel (glue) for the price</li>
            <li> This controls the hair and you can achieve amazing spikes and mohawks with this.  </li>
            <li> AMAZING hair gel.</li>
            <li> This is a nice styling gel</li>
            <li> and it seemed like I had covered my face in some kind of ultra damp glue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, excellent product.</li>
            <li> As a guy with hair that does whatever it wants, this gel tames it perfectly.</li>
            <li> Very strong hair gel.</li>
            <li> This stuff is quite amazing when it comes to hold, which is lovely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every strong holding gel on the market!</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t feel very comfortable with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strong sculpting gel that holds your hair in almost any position and has nice even shine without looking too glossy.</li>
            <li> would recommend if you are looking for a great product that is not strong smelling, has great hold and most importantly looks great and doesn&#x27;t flake off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but Gorilla Snot Gel was better.</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> It also smells better, in my opinion, than the gels out there that have that alcohol smell.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> before i get in the shower my hair still mostly retains its form.</li>
            <li> It works as it&#x27;s supposed to, and buying a twin pack is more cost effective&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> Love this thing.</li>
            <li> Will buy more as needed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand this, but many ladies of all cultures wear lace front wigs, but some of them use the glue to wear the wig for weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing is better than this product at the moment.</li>
            <li> I am growing my hair out and it is thicker than most.  </li>
            <li> I love this gel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many hairgels overtime.</li>
            <li> before i get in the shower my hair still mostly retains its form.</li>
            <li> Then I noticed more and more hair loss and decided to stop all hair care products.</li>
            <li> The hold is phenomenal, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> love this hair gel</li>
            <li> Love this product I would buy this over and over again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so much better than the sticky, gooey &#x27;glue&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best gels that Ive bought for having to put my hair up on a daily basis, and have it stay there.</li>
            <li> However, I have been thoroughly pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so many mom&#x27;s come up to ask what I use on his hair.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
            <li> Great for styling my straight hair.</li>
            <li> I also like it better than the got2b &amp;#</li>
            <li> This gel is a pretty good replacement.  </li>
            <li> And it washes out quite easily, which is lovely.</li>
            <li> Dries fast and has a good hold.</li>
            <li> Great gel for the price, better than the yellow bottle.</li>
            <li> La looks was strong but always Flaked.</li>
            <li> And amazingly it washes out of your hair pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Best gel for spiking your hair, hands down.</li>
            <li> I ride my motorcycle with this gel and my hair is fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously been using the yellow-bottle got2be spiking gel/glue which is basically like a thicker version, but when they came out with this I was SO impressed.</li>
            <li> It is great for spiking short hair and easily holds all day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Carefully, remove the scarf, and you will have laid edges, as well as a secure wig.  </li>
            <li> Lightly run fingers and palm through hair.</li>
            <li> Great to keep short hair spiked!</li>
            <li> it is more useful.</li>
            <li> ; gives a flake free hold</li>
            <li> I have to say this gel is very very strong, it is like putting glue in your hair, I have used many gels and this one by far is supreme</li>
            <li> Super strong hold, no flaking or greasy look or feel.</li>
            <li> I have bought this before at a store but this time ordered thru Amazon and it holds like no other, and got a good purchase price with (paqck of 2) I will purchase this way again.</li>
            <li> I think the advertised purpose of using it for unique hairstyles is the way it should be used since it does provide a lot of structure for your hair.</li>
            <li> I was impressed that it was able to hold and last the entire day.  </li>
            <li> I have used countless brands of hair gel that last 20 plus years, and I have to say, this is easily the best product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> But it really does hold as well or better.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re on the fence, i would 100% say give it a try because with my thick, curly hair - this stuff is perfect.</li>
            <li> Not a bad price either.</li>
            <li> Super Glue type stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love it and will purchase more when I&#x27;m low!</li>
            <li> It was becoming more obvious in the summer months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is a real gel just strong stuff.  </li>
            <li> My hair wants to lay forward on my forehead and need something really strong to get to to go backwards for a prohibition style haircut.  </li>
            <li> I use this to keep my mustaches smooth and curled and also to keep my full beard looking very neat.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and dries fast.</li>
            <li> Most types of gels don&#x27;t work well (aren&#x27;t strong enough) to hold my hair in place.</li>
            <li> Amazing for asian hair.  </li>
            <li> This hair gel is nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li> It holds the entire day, adds a nice shine to your hair, and doesn&#x27;t damage your hair.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This stuff is powerful.</li>
            <li> This stuff is powerful.</li>
            <li> Not sticky, and like the other reviews say, holds just as good as the glu once set.</li>
            <li> Awesome gel, ridiculous strong hold, only gel I use.</li>
            <li> But, this stuff is quite mild and I really like that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using and have been for a while \\&quot;short sexy hair\\&quot; and that stuff is like glue indeed.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> , I pay more than this locally for 1 tube.  </li>
            <li> Okay this glue does definitely hold.</li>
            <li> It is the hardest hold ever and its fast drying!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this same brand for more than 2 yrs</li>
            <li> While the edges are still DAMP with the gel, position the wig the way you want it ON THE WIG CAP FIRST, then push the wig lace onto the gel.  </li>
            <li> , I am glad I finally thought to look on Amazon to find it here.  </li>
            <li> I have use many different product and they were sticky and that it did not hold up in the heat (Phoenix).  </li>
            <li> I love this product and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Used for about 8 months consistently and noticed hair loss after about 3 months</li>
            <li> I personally love this gel, and I have been using it for several years.</li>
            <li> Love it to spike my short hair.</li>
            <li> Holds up pretty well even after they wear a hat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear, so it blends in with the hair better, isn&#x27;t nearly as sticky, and doesn&#x27;t cause flakes in the hair.</li>
            <li> I was using Tigi Bed Head Head Shrink Gel, which is fantastic stuff, but they apparently discontinued the product.  </li>
            <li> received the packed in a timely manner and it works good as usually.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear gel and at first I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to have the same hold.</li>
            <li> placed the gel on my edges, and with a brush or fine tooth comb, just lay the edges by combing the hair back.  </li>
            <li> No other type of gel I&#x27;ve used can own up to what this stuff does - and I also use the hairspray by this same brand, which I also HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much stronger -</li>
            <li> I felt perhaps I purchased a product with too much structure.</li>
            <li> It can hold the style the whole day under any weather condition.</li>
            <li> but now they are available at our local drug store as well.</li>
            <li> I have used them for going on 9 years now, Thanks amazon for always stocking them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> did not work very well with what i needed</li>
            <li> If you have wavy or curly hair and want it straight, then this stuff is for you.</li>
            <li> By the time he gets home from aftercare, and then straight to soccer practice, there&#x27;s no time to shower and redo the mohawk.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to use too much.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Got2b which was the white one, but this one is Clear Gel, and works as great as the other Got2b type.</li>
            <li> It flakes so much, but as long as you don&#x27;t touch you&#x27;re hair, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I love the wet and crunchy look!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other gels and edge controls</li>
            <li> and if you run your fingers through it after it&#x27;s dry you get a more natural hold look that I also really like.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s certainly not bad at all especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes the wig would shift, regardless of how many bobby pins was holding it down.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting hold and very easy to style.</li>
            <li> allows me to buy more for less.</li>
            <li> I had to quickly adjust to using only a nickel sized amount.  </li>
            <li> For a better hold, or to ensure that the wig will stay for the next 8 hours (maybe longer), keep the wig hair pinned back and wrap a silk scarf around your head and tie it for about 10 mins.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than the regular gel in the yellow bottle.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really not that strong of a hold like they describe it to be.  </li>
            <li> It was applied on the wet hair let with a strong hold and shine.  </li>
            <li> Yes, this is strong holding stuff, but the product seems industrial strength and a bit rough on the hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s high quality gel.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It may not be waterproof like the other got2be, but if you don&#x27;t use shampoo it wont come out easy..</li>
            <li> If I put it in my hair when its still a little wet, it keeps the wet look and has awesome hold.  </li>
            <li> My 11 year old son applies this himself, it&#x27;s like a gel, but sets much firmer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If anyone is curious about the differences between this and the Glued Got2B one, it&#x27;s that this one comes in an actual transparent liquid form and it makes your hair shine more.</li>
            <li> The gel will leave a white residue, or probably cause bacteria if it&#x27;s not washed off for several days or weeks.id edges, as well as a secure wig.  </li>
            <li> No matter how strong the hold typically my hair can &amp;#34;break on through&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female and I&#x27;ve got super thick hair cut into a pixie(the top</li>
            <li> For me, I have pretty thick hair which isn&#x27;t always easy to persuade to do what I want it to do.</li>
            <li> While I was loving my biosilk rock hard gelee for the hardest holding factor,I&#x27;ve come across this gem to hold my very wiry coarse curly hair!</li>
            <li> Its usually not a concern for me since I wash my hair everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have natural 4c hair and 4D edges!</li>
            <li> + it&#x27;s a  little less water resistant which is good when you want to wash it out.</li>
            <li> You can imagine how hard it is to have a long Mohawk stay up the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;I needed a great product as my son plays soccer too.</li>
            <li> The hold is really strong, but it doesn&#x27;t ever look or feel stiff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every other &#x27;ultra-strong&#x27; gel known to man, and the best they could do was make my hair slick and slimy, or simply limp - which was not a look</li>
            <li> This product also works on natural hair.</li>
            <li> you want something that will keep your wigs in place, whether they are lace front or just a wig that you want to match the natural hair line.</li>
            <li> I was 35 years old at the time.</li>
            <li> Still I continued to use it cause it made my hair style complete.</li>
            <li> Use in on my 10 year old - holds up his Mohawk</li>
            <li> also use it on my 8 year old.  </li>
            <li> Doesnt really flake unless you touch it constantly.</li>
            <li> so overall, highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to anyone its low price as well!</li>
            <li> i prefer the glue usually, but the gel does a fantastic job as well - and holds any shape into place</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really not like glue ;-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a month now and it definitely beats all the other hair gel that I have used before (including Short Sexy hair Gel and American Crew).</li>
            <li> I have used everything from American Crew Firm Hold, to Axe Pomade, to La looks, and finally to the top echelon Gel.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, so I need a strong gel to hold it in place.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this stuff literally feels like glue, if you even try to scratch your head with this stuff in, your sure to feel a pinch like no other.</li>
            <li> Feels like gel when you squeeze it out but holds like no other gel I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> No more buying special glue removing shampoo.</li>
            <li> Be careful though because you literally only have like 30 seconds to do your hair once it is applied because it dries very fast</li>
            <li> so I like that it is not sticky all day long and that it holds very well with short hair.</li>
            <li> Holds my hair (about 2in long) straight up on end for the entire day... and then some.  </li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t rinse it out at night, I wake up in the morning with nearly the same hair style.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to get it right for your hairstyle because it holds so well.</li>
            <li> Some of the other Got2b Glued products leave a really sticky residue on your hair</li>
            <li> I have a full, thick, illustrious head of hair.</li>
            <li> Used the yellow tube (Glued) for years and always felt it was sticky and a little hard to make sure the white was completely blended.</li>
            <li> this is not joke, when the tube says warning do not apply too much, well, there is a reason, I applied like regular gel, not a good idea, my hair was freaking hard in 2 minutes, I had to shower again, this gel totally does the job, why pay for other products that don&#x27;t work when this one works amazing.</li>
            <li> It will be much cheaper in the long run, since I use a lot less.  </li>
            <li> Small amounts will hold for a day or two, large amounts for up to 4-5 days.</li>
            <li> Your hair will Definitely stay in place &amp; a lot goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I will definitely only use this gel for a long as I have hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand long enough that nothing else comes to mind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found this instead of having to wade through other lame</li>
            <li> All day long..</li>
            <li> All day long..</li>
            <li> I usually get anything from the normal stores, but when I saw the price and the reviews, I said why not?</li>
            <li> long I&#x27;m guessing), which I sometimes decide to put into a mohawk.</li>
            <li> so I naively assumed it&#x27;d be stronger or at least as strong as got2bglued (and no flakes).</li>
            <li> A very small amount goes a long way and a tube lasts me a whole year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was initially buying this because I felt like my facial hair was a little bit patchy and unruly</li>
            <li> It is a little sticky and a white residue may form but only after days of build up.</li>
            <li> Towel dry hair thoroughly and get all the dampness out.</li>

            <li> this is a must buy for any African American girl who is having trouble finding the balance between hold and softness.  </li>
            <li> My hair is typically about 4 or 5 inches long and a nickle sized dab of this will hold it back all day.  </li>
            <li> Not much is needed so a tube goes a long way.</li>

            <li> My edges stay down all day.</li>

            <li> It took me around a half hour just to get my hair</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this in all my typical places (Target, CVS, Walgreens)</li>
            <li> I know it says &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t flake&amp;#34; on the package, and that&#x27;s just not true.</li>
            <li> I just want something that holds tight.  </li>
            <li> , but this does hold tight.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably end up using this over the spiking glue when I have shorter hair though, as it&#x27;s less messy and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li> It is a bit stiff, but it will literally hold down ANY hairstyle.</li>
            <li> I mix a little with got2b  fatastic mousse before styling, On windy days I use a little paste along the part line.</li>
            <li> It controls my hair for days without any flakes and doesnt weigh my curls down!</li>
            <li> The pomades were just globby putty your put on your head and made mine look dried out..</li>
            <li> The gel should be dried by then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is required to get &#x27;volume&#x27; out of limp hair.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks my hair stopped falling out.</li>
            <li> Found this styling gel a few years ago and haven&#x27;t used anything since.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried probably over 12 different types of gels, from the expensive ones, and other choices, but nothing compares to this gel.</li>
            <li> Really stiff hair glue.  </li>
            <li> Apply a small amount (0.5 inch dia) to one palm, rub hands together to spread.</li>
            <li> When used correctly it doesn&#x27;t make you look like Pat Riley all slimy and slick (unless you like slimy and slick).  </li>
            <li> Gives a rock hard hold.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it would hold a crazy style in place, but as for a simple haircut that just needs to stay in place throughout the day, you get out the shower, put this in and be done, this is it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so freaking thick and grows so fast it&#x27;s annoying</li>
            <li> Usually my hair is still well spiked even after I sleep on it!</li>
            <li> Or even worse, my 4c coils would be standing at attention around the edges of the wig usually at about 10:00 in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> issue is that if you&#x27;re a side sleeper, it can really mess up your hair, which can be difficult to fix.</li>
            <li> I went back to using the Argon Oil edge control which wasn&#x27;t bad, but whenever i would sweat, my edges would revert, and sometimes i would catch my reflection in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> and I hate that, especially if I&#x27;m exercising and work up a sweat.  </li>
            <li> As a guy cursed with ultra-soft floppy non-dense hair that is very difficult to tame and get off my forehead, this was a godsend.</li>
            <li> I was actually skeptical because it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; as the Argon Oil Edge Control?  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the got2b products.</li>
            <li> I was afraid this was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> but it was very uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive, doesn&#x27;t smell bad and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li> If you are sick of sticky glue of the Got2be Glu but still want the hold, this is your solution.</li>
            <li> But holy crap does it flake like a mother.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but Gorilla Snot Gel was better.</li>
            <li> This gel is one of the best. I have been using it 6 days a week since 2010. It holds the entire day, adds a nice shine to your hair, and doesn&#x27;t damage your hair. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a nice styling gel but it&#x27;s really not that strong of a hold like they describe it to be.  I&#x27;m using and have been for a while \\&quot;short sexy hair\\&quot; and that stuff is like glue indeed.  This one doesn&#x27;t come that close but it&#x27;s certainly not bad at all especially for the price.  So all in all it&#x27;s a good hair gel but it&#x27;s really not like glue ;-)</li>
            <li> I have used many styling products in my hair to keep it neat, but the got2b glued is THE BEST. It is exactly as stated. It keeps your hair in place for days until you decide to shampoo your hair. Best of all it does not flake and you don&#x27;t have to use alot to get great results. Love it...</li>
            <li> Works Perfectly! I always buy this brand!</li>
            <li> Used the yellow tube (Glued) for years and always felt it was sticky and a little hard to make sure the white was completely blended. This stuff if AWESOME! It&#x27;s a clear gel and at first I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to have the same hold. It does!!! It&#x27;s WAY faster to do my sons hair and it definitely holds! Will only use the black tube now. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I use gel every day - I have wiry hair that needs taming.  I was using Tigi Bed Head Head Shrink Gel, which is fantastic stuff, but they apparently discontinued the product.  This gel is a pretty good replacement.  It&#x27;s much stronger - I had to quickly adjust to using only a nickel sized amount.  It will be much cheaper in the long run, since I use a lot less.  It also smells better, in my opinion, than the gels out there that have that alcohol smell.</li>
            <li> I was initially buying this because I felt like my facial hair was a little bit patchy and unruly and I&#x27;d seen some advice on using this for facial hair. It did its job but it was very uncomfortable to use. I felt like my hairs became very solid and it seemed like I had covered my face in some kind of ultra damp glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did what it needed to but I didn&#x27;t feel very comfortable with it. I think the advertised purpose of using it for unique hairstyles is the way it should be used since it does provide a lot of structure for your hair. I felt perhaps I purchased a product with too much structure.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my husband because he doesn&#x27;t like his hair to move.  The kids call this Dad&#x27;s hair glue.  He applies this to wet hair and allows it to air dry.  Your hair will he hard &amp; crunchy and will definitely not move.  Great price for 2 tubes, I pay more than this locally for 1 tube.  Best price is here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love this. It can hold the style the whole day under any weather condition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a month now and it definitely beats all the other hair gel that I have used before (including Short Sexy hair Gel and American Crew). If anyone is curious about the differences between this and the Glued Got2B one, it&#x27;s that this one comes in an actual transparent liquid form and it makes your hair shine more.</li>
            <li> Best gel there is. Super strong hold, no flaking or greasy look or feel. Holds spikes and waves well. I ride my motorcycle with this gel and my hair is fine.</li>
            <li> Okay this glue does definitely hold. My hair is so freaking thick and grows so fast it&#x27;s annoying the amount of gel&#x27;s I&#x27;ve gone through because it doesn&#x27;t hold without like four layers of the stuff. This stuff is quite amazing when it comes to hold, which is lovely. And it washes out quite easily, which is lovely. But holy crap does it flake like a mother. I know it says &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t flake&amp;#34; on the package, and that&#x27;s just not true. It flakes so much, but as long as you don&#x27;t touch you&#x27;re hair, you&#x27;ll be fine. It amazing gel (glue) for the price and I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a gel like this for a while!!! It fulfill my need. My hair stays the way I need it to be. I bought it from amazon but now they are available at our local drug store as well. I recommend you wash your hair at the end of the day.. or you may lose hair. All you need is water and some shampoo..</li>
            <li> This is the best hair gel ever&lt;br /&gt; Your hair will Definitely stay in place &amp; a lot goes a long way. It can be &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; once it dries. If you have a problem  with that mix it half &amp; half with this same brands spiking gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every strong holding gel on the market! While I was loving my biosilk rock hard gelee for the hardest holding factor,I&#x27;ve come across this gem to hold my very wiry coarse curly hair! For those of you who dont want crunchy curls this is not for you! I love the wet and crunchy look! It controls my hair for days without any flakes and doesnt weigh my curls down! It locks them in! I&#x27;m in love with this gel! It is the hardest hold ever and its fast drying! Will buy this forever!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, excellent product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff that will hold for a tornado!</li>
            <li> The title says it all. I have used everything from American Crew Firm Hold, to Axe Pomade, to La looks, and finally to the top echelon Gel. Got2Be! The pomades were just globby putty your put on your head and made mine look dried out.. American crew was alright.. It took me around a half hour just to get my hair the way i wanted it (because it kept drooping and wouldn&#x27;t set I think because it was too watered down). La looks was strong but always Flaked. This Gel combines all the positives from the best gels in the world with out any of the negatives... Let me just say this, It takes me 1/4th the time to do my hair now... It may not be waterproof like the other got2be, but if you don&#x27;t use shampoo it wont come out easy.. Example, I set my hair @ 4am monday. Work all day, sleep that night, tuesday morning before i get in the shower my hair still mostly retains its form. Ridiculous!!!!!!! BEST EVER! IF YOU WANT GEL YOULL REGRET NOT GETTING THIS. TRUST ME!</li>
            <li> Great product and price. This product also works on natural hair.</li>
            <li> Feels like gel when you squeeze it out but holds like no other gel I&#x27;ve ever used. I will definitely only use this gel for a long as I have hair lol.</li>
            <li> Only hair gel I use. I can go to sleep and wake up with my hair perfect. Doesn&#x27;t flake like cheaper hair gels. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It works as it&#x27;s supposed to, and buying a twin pack is more cost effective&lt;br /&gt;And allows me to buy more for less.</li>
            <li> exellent......i love it</li>
            <li> Love this thing. Strong and got me through a couple of bad haircuts.  Will buy more as needed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great gel, strongest hold I&#x27;ve ever used, and washes off hands easy. But...I tried this product to replace got2bglued spiking glue. Which is a good product, but I just don&#x27;t like how it tends to flake a bit after a couple hours. This was called Ultra Glued so I naively assumed it&#x27;d be stronger or at least as strong as got2bglued (and no flakes). Short story short, it&#x27;s not. I don&#x27;t recommend for long-ish spikes if you have thick, coarse hair, though you could probably manage if you have the freeze spray. I&#x27;ll probably end up using this over the spiking glue when I have shorter hair though, as it&#x27;s less messy and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li> Great product excellent price</li>
            <li> I bought this for my BF and this is now the only gel he uses. It is a bit stiff, but it will literally hold down ANY hairstyle. Be careful though because you literally only have like 30 seconds to do your hair once it is applied because it dries very fast</li>
            <li> received the packed in a timely manner and it works good as usually. i&#x27;ve been using this same brand for more than 2 yrs and it&#x27;s high quality gel. so overall, highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for those wear lace front wigs.  I&#x27;m allergic to lace front glue.  I don&#x27;t understand this, but many ladies of all cultures wear lace front wigs, but some of them use the glue to wear the wig for weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want something that will keep your wigs in place, whether they are lace front or just a wig that you want to match the natural hair line. This is the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently i didn&#x27;t know how to use this gel, and totally dissed it.  I went back to using the Argon Oil edge control which wasn&#x27;t bad, but whenever i would sweat, my edges would revert, and sometimes i would catch my reflection in the mirror.  It wasn&#x27;t a good look.  Sometimes the wig would shift, regardless of how many bobby pins was holding it down.  Or even worse, my 4c coils would be standing at attention around the edges of the wig usually at about 10:00 in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, while i would be discussing a case with physicians or patients or co workers, their eyes would drrriiiiift up to my hairline, then back to my face.  It was becoming more obvious in the summer months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear Lace fronts as a protective style while growing my 4c hair.  So i decided to give the Got2be glue another try.  I was actually skeptical because it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; as the Argon Oil Edge Control?  But if you wash it out at the end of the day, you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I placed the gel on my edges, and with a brush or fine tooth comb, just lay the edges by combing the hair back.  Place your wig cap on without covering the wet edges.  While the edges are still DAMP with the gel, position the wig the way you want it ON THE WIG CAP FIRST, then push the wig lace onto the gel.  For a better hold, or to ensure that the wig will stay for the next 8 hours (maybe longer), keep the wig hair pinned back and wrap a silk scarf around your head and tie it for about 10 mins.  The gel should be dried by then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carefully, remove the scarf, and you will have laid edges, as well as a secure wig.  All day long..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, i always wash the gel out.  You will need to use soap and water or shampoo, because the wig will not come off just by pulling on it.  And it if did?  It might take along your hair with it.  This stuff is powerful. Also, please wash the lace of your wig once you remove it every night.  The gel will leave a white residue, or probably cause bacteria if it&#x27;s not washed off for several days or weeks.id edges, as well as a secure wig.

            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the got2b products. I have used them for going on 9 years now, Thanks amazon for always stocking them. They seem to be getting harder and harder to find in stores. I will likely have to buy a 10 year supply soon if they ever do decide to change formulas or discontinue the product. Great for spiking hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent nongreasy invincible as advertised!!!!</li>
            <li> I have to say this gel is very very strong, it is like putting glue in your hair, I have used many gels and this one by far is supreme</li>
            <li> Fulfills needs perfectly! Nothing is better than this product at the moment. Highly recommended to anyone its low price as well!</li>
            <li> Does the job, solid.  I just want something that holds tight.  I have hair that grows in ten different directions it seems.  No matter how strong the hold typically my hair can &amp;#34;break on through&amp;#34;, but this does hold tight.  Unlike the spiking gels and some of the other stuff it is not waxy it is a real gel just strong stuff.  Super Glue type stuff.  I don&#x27;t know that it would hold a crazy style in place, but as for a simple haircut that just needs to stay in place throughout the day, you get out the shower, put this in and be done, this is it.  No extra smells, no Axe body wash competing with a a different smell for the deodorant and another for the hair gel, this does one thing and one thing only, you put it in your hair to hold it in place, and it does that job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other note, I am glad I finally thought to look on Amazon to find it here.  I have been looking for this in all my typical places (Target, CVS, Walgreens) and they have all been out for the last month or so.  They all have the Got2b Spiking Formula (yellow container that looks just like this) but none have had this in stock since January.  I was afraid this was discontinued.  I loaded up just in case.</li>
            <li> I have use many different product and they were sticky and that it did not hold up in the heat (Phoenix).  Got this Got2b stuff from the supermarket.  I was impressed that it was able to hold and last the entire day.  It was applied on the wet hair let with a strong hold and shine.  Beware, that it is crunchy definitely not a feel for your spouse or companion on a date night.  Decided to run my hands through it to eliminate the crunchy and to my surprise my hair stayed in style with out the crunchy feel.  However, my hair did lose it wet shiny look.  I am growing my hair out and it is thicker than most.  I have stopped using the sticky stuff and the promenade.  This stuff is great!</li>
            <li> This worked miracles on my hard to tame natural 4c hair  this is a must buy for any African American girl who is having trouble finding the balance between hold and softness.  I love it and will purchase more when I&#x27;m low!</li>
            <li> I love this gel.  Ordering it here since I can&#x27;t find it locally anymore.  Not a bad price either.</li>
            <li> I use this hair gel every day.  Some of the other Got2b Glued products leave a really sticky residue on your hair and I hate that, especially if I&#x27;m exercising and work up a sweat.  But, this stuff is quite mild and I really like that.  I have quite short hair so I like that it is not sticky all day long and that it holds very well with short hair.</li>
            <li> Most types of gels don&#x27;t work well (aren&#x27;t strong enough) to hold my hair in place. This stuff definitely gets the job done. It&#x27;s inexpensive, doesn&#x27;t smell bad and doesn&#x27;t flake. I love this product and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great for styling wigs. Especially, spikes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried probably over 12 different types of gels, from the expensive ones, and other choices, but nothing compares to this gel. This is the only Gel that lasts me all day, and doesn&#x27;t flake during the day. I used to use the Got2b which was the white one, but this one is Clear Gel, and works as great as the other Got2b type.</li>
            <li> Not sticky like the paste but holds the same. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have used countless brands of hair gel that last 20 plus years, and I have to say, this is easily the best product I&#x27;ve used. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> As a guy cursed with ultra-soft floppy non-dense hair that is very difficult to tame and get off my forehead, this was a godsend. I&#x27;ve tried every other &#x27;ultra-strong&#x27; gel known to man, and the best they could do was make my hair slick and slimy, or simply limp - which was not a look I liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this gel, I could finally sport a short hairstyle and still have my hair stay up the way I want it to. It sets within minutes and can hold up to the strongest wind gusts. It does make your hair slightly stiff (though its not immediately apparent unless someone touches it). A very small amount goes a long way and a tube lasts me a whole year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One issue is that if you&#x27;re a side sleeper, it can really mess up your hair, which can be difficult to fix. Its usually not a concern for me since I wash my hair everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how I apply it: Towel dry hair thoroughly and get all the dampness out. This is required to get &#x27;volume&#x27; out of limp hair. Apply a small amount (0.5 inch dia) to one palm, rub hands together to spread. Lightly run fingers and palm through hair. Wash gel off hands and shake them off so they are wet but not dripping. Sculpt hair with wet hands. Wash and dry hands. All done!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many hairgels overtime. I have ridiculously difficult hair (&#x27;pig hair&#x27;), and this is the only gel that is able to style at once without making it look like a gelmet. Lasts in a bit of rain too, and even if my children decide to slap my head, the hair still stays in shape.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for about a week but I can honestly say this is THEE best gel/edge control I&#x27;ve ever tried!! I have natural 4c hair and 4D edges! Not kidding. I have tried so many other gels and edge controls but nothing compares to this product. My edges stay down all day. It is a little sticky and a white residue may form but only after days of build up. I recommend!!</li>
            <li> If you are sick of sticky glue of the Got2be Glu but still want the hold, this is your solution. Not sticky, and like the other reviews say, holds just as good as the glu once set.</li>
            <li> I mix a little with got2b  fatastic mousse before styling, On windy days I use a little paste along the part line. For fine hair that will not stay put this is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Example, I set my hair at 5am monday. Work all day, sleep that night, tuesday morning before i get in the shower my hair still mostly retains its form. Ridiculous!!!!!!! BEST EVER! IF YOU WANT GEL YOULL REGRET NOT GETTING THIS. FYI BEst PRice EVer.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and basically no other product I&#x27;ve ever tried worked. This stuff holds my hair in place and does not flake at all, this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing for asian hair.  This controls the hair and you can achieve amazing spikes and mohawks with this.  Stays in well and doesn&#x27;t get flaky at the end of the day.  My gel of choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand long enough that nothing else comes to mind. Whether your hair is longer or shorter, nothing else compares. I&#x27;m glad I found this instead of having to wade through other lame products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was good, no problems there.</li>
            <li> Best gel on the market&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there over the years. Nothing comes close to this. Great strong hold. Not like cement. No flakes. A must have!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me, but the formula seems to have changed. Yes, this is strong holding stuff, but the product seems industrial strength and a bit rough on the hair.</li>
            <li> Holds my hair (about 2in long) straight up on end for the entire day... and then some.  If I don&#x27;t rinse it out at night, I wake up in the morning with nearly the same hair style.  If I put it in my hair when its still a little wet, it keeps the wet look and has awesome hold.  If I put it in my hair when its dry, it doesn&#x27;t look wet, but it also doesn&#x27;t hold as well then.</li>
            <li> Great to keep short hair spiked!</li>
            <li> Great gel! Thought I found the holy grail of hair gels. Used for about 8 months consistently and noticed hair loss after about 3 months but I though I was just losing my hair due to age. It&#x27;s a strong sculpting gel that holds your hair in almost any position and has nice even shine without looking too glossy. I have a full, thick, illustrious head of hair. I was 35 years old at the time. Still I continued to use it cause it made my hair style complete. Then I noticed more and more hair loss and decided to stop all hair care products. Within a few weeks my hair stopped falling out. Went back to my Dep and La Looks gel eventually and haven&#x27;t noticed any hair loss. Had to be Got2B glued that caused my hair loss. I would not recommend this gel for anyone!</li>
            <li> The only gel that will work for my husband who has wavy/curly hair!</li>
            <li> Hair gel is personal, I guess, so different people will like different gels depending on their hair style and type. For me, I have pretty thick hair which isn&#x27;t always easy to persuade to do what I want it to do. I&#x27;ve been using this gel for years and it works well. Not much is needed so a tube goes a long way. Absolutely no flaking or stickiness which are a couple of reasons I switched to this from whatever I was using before.</li>
            <li> I personally love this gel, and I have been using it for several years. The hold is phenomenal, and it lasts all day. Usually my hair is still well spiked even after I sleep on it!</li>
            <li> love this hair gel i use it all the time and buy it all the time. Holds your hair very good!</li>
            <li> Really stiff hair glue.  Love it to spike my short hair.</li>
            <li> Used it for a synthetic wig as part of an anime cosplay, works like a dream.</li>
            <li> Great gel for the price, better than the yellow bottle.</li>
            <li> With the hairspray, it makes my hair look great.</li>
            <li> it is a good gel. did not work very well with what i needed but it is still a good product maybe to someone else it is more useful.</li>
            <li> Best gel for spiking your hair, hands down. If you are using glue...STOP. This stuff is perfect and doesn&#x27;t leave that dandruff looking residue + it&#x27;s a  little less water resistant which is good when you want to wash it out. No more buying special glue removing shampoo.</li>
            <li> If you have wavy or curly hair and want it straight, then this stuff is for you. Rub it into damp hair and in a few minutes wallah, straight hair.</li>
            <li> Very strong hair gel. Long lasting hold and very easy to style.</li>
            <li> I have bought this before at a store but this time ordered thru Amazon and it holds like no other, and got a good purchase price with (paqck of 2) I will purchase this way again.</li>
            <li> I usually get anything from the normal stores, but when I saw the price and the reviews, I said why not? this is not joke, when the tube says warning do not apply too much, well, there is a reason, I applied like regular gel, not a good idea, my hair was freaking hard in 2 minutes, I had to shower again, this gel totally does the job, why pay for other products that don&#x27;t work when this one works amazing. I will be getting this from now on. totally happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, so I need a strong gel to hold it in place. This is perfect for the price. It&#x27;s much better than the regular gel in the yellow bottle. It&#x27;s clear, so it blends in with the hair better, isn&#x27;t nearly as sticky, and doesn&#x27;t cause flakes in the hair. And it holds just as well.</li>
            <li> My hair wants to lay forward on my forehead and need something really strong to get to to go backwards for a prohibition style haircut.  This stuff is the only thing I found that would hold.  And amazingly it washes out of your hair pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Best Gel , my Husband love it</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Be careful, you could hurt people with your hair after applying this product.  It will hold up all day and when you shampoo, they will go away.</li>
            <li> Gives a rock hard hold. Small amounts will hold for a day or two, large amounts for up to 4-5 days.</li>
            <li> Love this product I would buy this over and over again. It works, it holds, and it does its job too.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so much better than the sticky, gooey &#x27;glue&#x27;. But it really does hold as well or better. It is great for spiking short hair and easily holds all day.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best gels that Ive bought for having to put my hair up on a daily basis, and have it stay there. Would recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> I mistakingly ordered this product as I thought it was something else. However, I have been thoroughly pleased with the results. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Use in on my 10 year old - holds up his Mohawk the entire day!!&lt;br /&gt;Great product, isn&#x27;t sticky or flaky. You can imagine how hard it is to have a long Mohawk stay up the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;I needed a great product as my son plays soccer too. By the time he gets home from aftercare, and then straight to soccer practice, there&#x27;s no time to shower and redo the mohawk. I&#x27;ve had so many mom&#x27;s come up to ask what I use on his hair.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend if you are looking for a great product that is not strong smelling, has great hold and most importantly looks great and doesn&#x27;t flake off.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old son applies this himself, it&#x27;s like a gel, but sets much firmer.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my 8 year old.  Lasts all day. Holds up pretty well even after they wear a hat.</li>
            <li> This hair gel is nothing short of amazing. I&#x27;m a female and I&#x27;ve got super thick hair cut into a pixie(the top is 4-5\\&quot; long I&#x27;m guessing), which I sometimes decide to put into a mohawk. No other type of gel I&#x27;ve used can own up to what this stuff does - and I also use the hairspray by this same brand, which I also HIGHLY recommend. My hair is rock solid with both of these products combined. [[ASIN:B0009VQ8X8 Got2b Glued Blasting Freeze Spray, 12 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a volunteer firefighter/EMT and I cook part-time, and even through an 8 hour+ shift in a smoky, humid kitchen or running any type of call, this stuff will not budge(not counting helmet hair). Highly, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Awesome gel, ridiculous strong hold, only gel I use.</li>
            <li> AMAZING hair gel. I&#x27;ve previously been using the yellow-bottle got2be spiking gel/glue which is basically like a thicker version, but when they came out with this I was SO impressed. it gives the perfect amount of hold and you don&#x27;t even need to use a ton. doesn&#x27;t get super crunchy and makes my hair look perfect. if you&#x27;re on the fence, i would 100% say give it a try because with my thick, curly hair - this stuff is perfect.</li>
            <li> I use this to keep my mustaches smooth and curled and also to keep my full beard looking very neat.</li>
            <li> Dries fast and has a good hold. Don&#x27;t have to use too much.</li>
            <li> Great for styling my straight hair. Easy to use and dries fast. Doesnt really flake unless you touch it constantly. Great price for two tubes.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and met all expectations.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. As a guy with hair that does whatever it wants, this gel tames it perfectly. The hold is really strong, but it doesn&#x27;t ever look or feel stiff.</li>
            <li> Found this styling gel a few years ago and haven&#x27;t used anything since.  My hair is typically about 4 or 5 inches long and a nickle sized dab of this will hold it back all day.  It takes a little practice to get it right for your hairstyle because it holds so well. When used correctly it doesn&#x27;t make you look like Pat Riley all slimy and slick (unless you like slimy and slick).  I also like it better than the got2b &amp;#34;spiking glue&amp;#34; because you might as well use gorilla glue at that point. The &amp;#34;styling gel&amp;#34; gives a flake free hold and if you run your fingers through it after it&#x27;s dry you get a more natural hold look that I also really like.  Great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> i prefer the glue usually, but the gel does a fantastic job as well - and holds any shape into place</li>
            <li> your hair wont move an inch with this stuff in. My only complaint is that this stuff literally feels like glue, if you even try to scratch your head with this stuff in, your sure to feel a pinch like no other. Otherwise, great product.</li>
