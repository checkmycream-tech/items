            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have found this at Amazon, no one had it around here.  </li>
            <li>And i loved it so much i bought some.</li>
            <li>Worked well for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, although when I bought the same product at the salon it seemed to work better.</li>
            <li>And this price is so good for the big spray!!</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t tell this product does any better than Herbal Essences detangler or Suave detangler that I usually buy at Walmart.</li>
            <li>It works like a conditoner, you just have to lightly spray it on when your hair is wet, just not too much or your hair will be flat when dry.</li>

            <li> I used it, daily, for a couple of weeks and could tell absolutely no benefit (certainly not 12 benefits).  </li>
            <li> This stuff helps with the tangles immensely without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> I am usually a believer that you get what you pay for, but occasionally I have to doubt that belief.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a terrific leave in conditioner, and use it everyday!</li>
            <li> It definitely wasn&#x27;t worth the outrageous price.</li>

            <li> I used it, daily, for a couple of weeks and could tell absolutely no benefit (certainly not 12 benefits).  I&#x27;ve had better benefits from Infusium that I can buy at WalMart for just a few bucks.  I am usually a believer that you get what you pay for, but occasionally I have to doubt that belief.  This is one of those times.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent leave in moisturizer and conditioner.</li>
            <li> great product. My hairdresser used this on my hair so I searched for it here and had it delivered to my door.</li>
            <li> Smells good, although when I bought the same product at the salon it seemed to work better.</li>
            <li> I substitute this in place of conditioner that has to be rinsed out.  It has way more benefits, and is MUCH faster when getting ready to go out the door.  Love it!</li>
            <li> CHANGED my frizzy hair to HEALTHY!!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this at one of my appts. And i loved it so much i bought some. It works like a conditoner, you just have to lightly spray it on when your hair is wet, just not too much or your hair will be flat when dry.</li>
            <li> Worked well for fine hair.  It left my hair soft and healthy feeling.  Did not &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; my split ends as claimed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell this product does any better than Herbal Essences detangler or Suave detangler that I usually buy at Walmart. It definitely wasn&#x27;t worth the outrageous price.</li>
            <li> Best product I have ever used to control summer frizz and leave hair soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> All the fuzzies are gone.  Use sparingly.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I have fine hair that can get limp easily, so I never use conditioner.  However, since I&#x27;ve been growing it out, dealing with tangles has been a pain.  This stuff helps with the tangles immensely without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> Always spritz this on my hair before blowdrying my hair or if I air dry. Cuts down frizz and leaves a healthy soft shine. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Great for the hair, just don&#x27;t over-apply or you can experience some build up.  I have very porous hair and it&#x27;s great for me.</li>
            <li> Best thing I have every used on my hair.  It&#x27;s a terrific leave in conditioner, and use it everyday! Have been for 5 years.</li>
            <li> Great product, love the size!</li>
            <li> Not as good as It&#x27;s a 10 leave in but it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have found this at Amazon, no one had it around here.  It helps detangle my hair and gives my hair the vitamins and nutrients it needs.</li>
            <li> Will never be without this!! And this price is so good for the big spray!! Wow!! Love Amazon Prime!</li>
            <li> Awesome product, and extremely happy that it now comes in a bigger size.  Yea!!</li>
