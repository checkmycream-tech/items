            <li>Perfect for aspiring MUA or even just your averaged person that loves to do their makeup.</li>
            <li>&amp; I must say when it comes to smudging, this is the BEST brush you will EVER use!</li>
            <li>Excellent service</li>
            <li>Everyone needs a brush like this in their collection, it&#x27;s a perfect brush for applying a darker color in the outer v of your lid, or anywhere that you want a color in a finite space.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s great for blending and even getting eyeshadow in the crease of the eyes and on the lower lash line.</li>
            <li>If you want something as good as Sigma&#x27;s and MAC&#x27;s for a fair price, get this Bdellium brush!</li>
            <li>Because of my hooded eyes, I really love creating a defined crease &amp; this brush is PERFECT for that.</li>
            <li>This brush a great for creating a strong \\&quot;v\\&quot; shape with my eyeshadow and is perfect for blending colors to the lower lash line.    </li>
            <li>Thanks Bdellium for a great brush for a great price!!!!</li>
            <li>I love using my pencil brush!  </li>
            <li>I love this brush!</li>
            <li>As a makeup artist I love this brush and use it ritually!</li>
            <li>These brushes are really nice.  </li>
            <li>I cant afford Mac brushes &amp; don&#x27;t own any.</li>
            <li>First of all, the quality is incredible.</li>
            <li>The ferrule &amp; handle are impeccably made &amp; feel fantastic in your hand.</li>
            <li>I like this brush because it is good for applying shadow accurately below and along the lower lash line.</li>
            <li>The bristles are perfectly dense, yet feel amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>Love this brush the bristles are soft very good for blending.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I love this line of  brushes.</li>
            <li>Simply the best result!</li>
            <li>&amp; I cannot say enough wonderful things about it.</li>
            <li>It picks up &amp; distributes pigment perfectly because of its density &amp; I simply go back &amp; forth in the crease to blend it out without taking away the color&#x27;s intensity.</li>
            <li>you can make a v with your finger. :)</li>
            <li>Love love love this brush.</li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for about a year and after so many washes it hasn&#x27;t lost its shape,</li>
            <li>Love this brush - precise application makes for an effortless makeup routine!  </li>
            <li>This creates the perfect \\&quot;v\\&quot; for blending and creating a smokey eye also not bad at using it underneath the eye for smudging liner or creating a soft line with shadow... and it&#x27;s quite cheap for what it is.</li>
            <li>Favorite for detailed crease work, or blending out under eye shadows.</li>
            <li>Being a makeup gal having great brushes is the only way to apply makeup and make it look like quality..</li>
            <li>Buy ELF brushes instead, they work great and last forever.</li>
            <li>This pencil tip brush works very well and have nice quality bristles.</li>
            <li>They are soft and strong, and the makeup application is nice.  </li>
            <li>This is one of those great multi-tasker brushes that I could not live without!</li>
            <li>I have so much love for the Bdellium Tools brand as a whole.</li>
            <li>This brush is nice and soft.</li>
            <li>This blends well and not a bad price.</li>
            <li>they are worth while.</li>
            <li>None of my other brushes were very good or precise for this specific area.</li>
            <li>i love this brand, i have many other brushes and they are all quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used and own tons of brushes and this pencil brush hands down my favorite and I will definitely be repurchasing more as the need arises.</li>
            <li>I own several Bdellium brushes &amp; they are definitely the ones I reach for the most.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, between uses I just wipe it off to use it on different colors, I also use it to cut crease.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I certainly would not compare this to MAC&#x27;s pencil brush.</li>
            <li>This is a great little brush when you need a bit of precision (e.g. darkening the outside of your crease, applying shadow on your lower lash line, even contouring your nose).  </li>
            <li>The price is very affordable.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>It washes very well, maintains its shape</li>
            <li>This is a little gem right here :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and will definitely purchase again in the near future</li>
            <li>But as long as you are gentle, I think it is a precise tool for the job.</li>
            <li>The tip of the brush is really more rounded that a typical pencil brush.  </li>
            <li>This brush is very dense &amp; yet very soft on my eye.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re high quality but inexpensive brushes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li>These brushes perform like a luxury product at an affordable price, so this sweet little brush is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right size if you have smaller eyes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m disappointed, so I&#x27;m still on the hunt for the perfect pencil brush.</li>
            <li>I have small, hooded eyes, so I love to use this brush to define my crease.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I love this brush; it&#x27;s not so small that it doesn&#x27;t blend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a small blending brush</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this brush over more expensive options!</li>
            <li>WOW WOW!  </li>
            <li>I am a professional makeup artist and I received a set of bdellium brushes as a gift.  </li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>Most pencil brushes are so small, you would have to go back with another blending brush.</li>
            <li>Very soft the smell was a little harsh but after washing it aired out and was fine!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s firm but feels gentle on the eyes, still looks brand new.</li>
            <li>I have had this brush for a year &amp; not a single hair has shed or frayed out!</li>

            <li> I have a small asian lid &amp; was surprised how the brush picked up the eyeshadow &amp; when I applied it to my lid, I did it with not much effort.  </li>
            <li> This pencil blending brush is one I use almost every single day</li>
            <li> If you use it carefully I think it does well.</li>
            <li> It is stiff enough for the job.</li>
            <li> It is small, dense, and tapered enough to place and blend color in the \\&quot;outer V\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It was very rough and irritated my eye area.</li>
            <li> I agree with the previous reviewer that this is not really a pencil brush.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and just save your money, not worth it.</li>
            <li> Obviously the bristles are stiff so--I would be careful with that delicate under eye skin.</li>
            <li> This brush is a little scratchy.</li>
            <li> I have lots of brushes but this is the one I use  everyday to difusse eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I washed it with soap and olive oil and the bristles were still extremely hard</li>
            <li> Despite the disappointment i&#x27;d like to add that it arrived sooner than expected and in a well packaged manner.</li>
            <li> No need to buy the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad one....</li>

            <li> Maybe I got a bad one.... It actually hurts my eyelids to use this, I&#x27;ve tried soaking it in conditioner over night and that didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m disappointed, so I&#x27;m still on the hunt for the perfect pencil brush.</li>
            <li> I like this brush because it is good for applying shadow accurately below and along the lower lash line. It is stiff enough for the job. If you use it carefully I think it does well. Obviously the bristles are stiff so--I would be careful with that delicate under eye skin. But as long as you are gentle, I think it is a precise tool for the job. I am glad I bought it.

            <li> I have so much love for the Bdellium Tools brand as a whole. They&#x27;re high quality but inexpensive brushes. Perfect for aspiring MUA or even just your averaged person that loves to do their makeup. This pencil brush is no exception. It&#x27;s firm but soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t hurt when you swipe eyeshadow in the lash line.

            <li> I am a professional makeup artist and I received a set of bdellium brushes as a gift.  These brushes are really nice.  They are soft and strong, and the makeup application is nice.  The price is very affordable.  I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> I love this line of  brushes. Simply the best result!</li>
            <li> I own several Bdellium brushes &amp; they are definitely the ones I reach for the most. This pencil blending brush is one I use almost every single day &amp; I cannot say enough wonderful things about it. First of all, the quality is incredible. The ferrule &amp; handle are impeccably made &amp; feel fantastic in your hand. The bristles are perfectly dense, yet feel amazingly soft. I have had this brush for a year &amp; not a single hair has shed or frayed out! I have never had a pencil brush maintain its shape this well. Bdellium, how do you do it? I have small, hooded eyes, so I love to use this brush to define my crease. It picks up &amp; distributes pigment perfectly because of its density &amp; I simply go back &amp; forth in the crease to blend it out without taking away the color&#x27;s intensity. That&#x27;s why I love this brush; it&#x27;s not so small that it doesn&#x27;t blend. Most pencil brushes are so small, you would have to go back with another blending brush. Because of my hooded eyes, I really love creating a defined crease &amp; this brush is PERFECT for that. I also use this brush to smudge my lower lash line. I smudge out my eyeliner in my waterline, then I apply &amp; smudge out eye shadow on the lower lash line, all with this brush! I have also used it to smudge out my upper lash line &amp; I must say when it comes to smudging, this is the BEST brush you will EVER use! It distributes the color evenly &amp; beautifully. This is one of those great multi-tasker brushes that I could not live without! These brushes perform like a luxury product at an affordable price, so this sweet little brush is worth every penny. Bdellium rocks!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent service I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and will definitely purchase again in the near future</li>
            <li> This brush is nice and soft. Seems like a quality material but it is not a \\&quot;pencil\\&quot; brush. It&#x27;s more like a small blending brush but if that&#x27;s what you want than it&#x27;s great. I certainly would not compare this to MAC&#x27;s pencil brush. Despite the disappointment i&#x27;d like to add that it arrived sooner than expected and in a well packaged manner.</li>
            <li> I agree with the previous reviewer that this is not really a pencil brush. The tip of the brush is really more rounded that a typical pencil brush.  I use this brush to do the \\&quot;outer V\\&quot; when doing my eye makeup.  It is small, dense, and tapered enough to place and blend color in the \\&quot;outer V\\&quot;. I have experienced no shedding with this brush and I really like it.</li>
            <li> This creates the perfect \\&quot;v\\&quot; for blending and creating a smokey eye also not bad at using it underneath the eye for smudging liner or creating a soft line with shadow... and it&#x27;s quite cheap for what it is. Being a makeup gal having great brushes is the only way to apply makeup and make it look like quality.. you can make a v with your finger. :)</li>
            <li> Great price, a bit scratchy</li>
            <li> I love using my pencil brush!  This brush a great for creating a strong \\&quot;v\\&quot; shape with my eyeshadow and is perfect for blending colors to the lower lash line.    Bdellium has a quality product that rivals pricey department store brands!</li>
            <li> Favorite for detailed crease work, or blending out under eye shadows.</li>
            <li> Love love love this brush. It washes very well, maintains its shape and I just love it. So happy to have it in my collection.</li>
            <li> Love this brush the bristles are soft very good for blending.</li>
            <li> Everyone needs a brush like this in their collection, it&#x27;s a perfect brush for applying a darker color in the outer v of your lid, or anywhere that you want a color in a finite space.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great pencil brush... perfect for blending shadows in the crease.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! As a makeup artist I love this brush and use it ritually! It&#x27;s great for blending and even getting eyeshadow in the crease of the eyes and on the lower lash line.</li>
            <li> This tool is the best!</li>
            <li> i love this brand, i have many other brushes and they are all quality. check them out bc they are worth while. cant beat the price</li>
            <li> This brush is a little scratchy. Especially for something that&#x27;s supposed to be for the eyes. It works, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it regularly.</li>
            <li> Very soft the smell was a little harsh but after washing it aired out and was fine! No shedding at all!</li>
            <li> It was perfect! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> This is a great little brush when you need a bit of precision (e.g. darkening the outside of your crease, applying shadow on your lower lash line, even contouring your nose).  Wonderful value.</li>
            <li> Did my research looking for a blender brush.  This blends well and not a bad price.</li>
            <li> This is my 1st Bdellium purchase. I have a small asian lid &amp; was surprised how the brush picked up the eyeshadow &amp; when I applied it to my lid, I did it with not much effort.  WOW WOW WOW!  This brush is very dense &amp; yet very soft on my eye. I am very excited!!! I will be ordering more brushes from Bdellium!!!!  I cant afford Mac brushes &amp; don&#x27;t own any. I am hooked on Bdellium!  Thanks Bdellium for a great brush for a great price!!!!</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and just save your money, not worth it. Buy ELF brushes instead, they work great and last forever.</li>
            <li> This brush did not work for me. It was very rough and irritated my eye area. I washed it with soap and olive oil and the bristles were still extremely hard</li>
            <li> This brush is Amazing!!! I like all the brushes from Bdellium tools. No need to buy the expensive ones. This is a little gem right here :)</li>
            <li> I use this brush all the time.  It&#x27;s just the right size if you have smaller eyes.  Overuse, though, will cause your eyelids to get sore some.</li>
            <li> This pencil tip brush works very well and have nice quality bristles. If you want something as good as Sigma&#x27;s and MAC&#x27;s for a fair price, get this Bdellium brush!</li>
            <li> I have lots of brushes but this is the one I use  everyday to difusse eyeliner. It&#x27;s easy to clean, between uses I just wipe it off to use it on different colors, I also use it to cut crease. I&#x27;ve had it for about a year and after so many washes it hasn&#x27;t lost its shape, It&#x27;s firm but feels gentle on the eyes, still looks brand new. I even bought a second one to give to my sister!</li>
            <li> Love this brush - precise application makes for an effortless makeup routine!  So glad I bought this brush over more expensive options!</li>
