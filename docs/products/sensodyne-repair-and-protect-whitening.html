            <li> This toothpaste is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> better then getting it at the Supermarket</li>
            <li> Works great on my sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Whitening and sensitivity toothpaste. Perfect!</li>
            <li> I have used almost every major brand toothpaste out there and this one is by far my favorite. I really like the flavor of the paste and it keeps my teeth from being sensitive all day long. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever noticed any particular whitening effects but it&#x27;s a nice clean flavor and has never given either of any moments of sensitivity.</li>
            <li> This is the best for sensitive teeth.  If you are older and having trouble with&lt;br /&gt;Hot or cold,. and eating or just aches ..this will stop all of it so you can feel better. It works in a day it two after brushing as needed. It continues to work when used 2x a day.&lt;br /&gt;No other brand is as good at pain relief.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years and it eliminated the discomfort that I was having previous to using it.</li>
            <li> This  toothpaste is great for those with sensitive teeth and gums, but the major bonus is the whitening element. I drink occasional coffee and red wine and my teeth are still pearly white!  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is the best sensitivity toothpaste on the market. Their new whitening one has a warming sensation that I don&#x27;t like, so I was thrilled to see this one available as it has the original flavor and feel.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothpaste.  Your mouth feels really clean after a brushing.</li>
            <li> Save your hard earned money. You can buy the exact same product at Walmart for $8.98. It pays to do your research.</li>
            <li> I use this toothpaste all the time, otherwise I would not be able to eat some fruits and/or berries - it helps me a lot with that. I would recommend to buy it with whitening. I used without whitening before and my teeth look yellowish, now after 1 month of using this one, my teeth much whiter.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and have consistently been using the Sensodyne brand for years. I&#x27;m very happy with the results. Solid product that I will reorder.</li>
            <li> I suppose it does it&#x27;s job as I don&#x27;t feel any sensitivity but I don&#x27;t care for the taste of it.  It leaves a weird after taste and want to brush my teeth again.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll get it again.</li>
            <li> The best toothpaste you can ever have.</li>
            <li> I feel as if my mouth is cleaner for a longer period of time ... I&#x27;m talking well into the afternoon.  I used to have sensitive teeth after my wisdom teeth were pulled.  It helped with that and I continued to use it after.  Very satisfied with the viscosity.</li>
            <li> My roots are exposed. this helps less the pain.</li>
            <li> This is great toothpaste for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I found out during graduate school that I had been grinding my teeth at night.  Unfortunately, quite a bit of damage had been done before I realized this.  I had to get a crown and I have a couple of other teeth with damage.  This makes my teeth pretty sensitive.  Also, I get canker sores when I use toothpaste with sodium lauryl sulfate.  Further, I drink a lot of tea, which can stain the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste is perfect for me.  It helps immensely with the sensitive teeth (I also have to wear a plastic mouth guard at night, but that&#x27;s a separate issue).  I have pretty much no pain now, except when I drink or eat something that&#x27;s extremely cold.  This toothpaste does not have sodium lauryl sulfate, and I hardly ever get canker sores now (maybe one every 3-4 months instead of 2 a week).  And, while I don&#x27;t think my teeth will ever be as white as a television commercial, this toothpaste definitely cuts down on the tea staining.  I&#x27;ve probably been using this toothpaste for at least 3 years now, if not longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pretty standard mint flavor, with no added colors.  It gets my teeth clean but doesn&#x27;t feel harsh or abrasive.  The dentist never comments on my toothpaste choice, which must mean it&#x27;s doing its job.  If you have sensitive teeth, a sensitivity to sodium lauryl sulfate, or drink a lot of tea/coffee/etc., this might be a good toothpaste for you.  If you&#x27;re like me and have all three of those issues, this toothpaste should definitely do you some good.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  So thankful not to have to run to WalMart for it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums, but not with this.  Thanks sensodyne!</li>
            <li> would rather buy 1 at a time...</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive gums and, therefore, use the toothpaste my dentist recommended: Sensodyne.  It seems to help a great deal.</li>
            <li> good stuff, teeth lost sensitivity. Takes one month to kick in.</li>
            <li> I use this toothpaste daily. Have not had pain since!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my mouth feeling clean. I do not care for the taste. I use other Sensodyne products and like them fine.</li>
