            <li>I have had great results with my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying that I will never use the DevaCurl One Conditioner again because I think that all the Deva products are great and maybe my hair just needed a change.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, fast shipping, excellent merchant!</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>conditioner is amazing for my hair and I will continue to buy from this seller.</li>
            <li>Wonderful conditioer, leaves hair soft and not frizzy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried tons of curly hair/dry hair conditioners and this is by far one of the best.</li>
            <li>enjoying this product</li>
            <li>I like white label on the conditioner the best.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>Nothing else works better for curly hair.</li>
            <li>It helps curl my hair so that the waves are much more pronounced.</li>
            <li>and I did notice that it helped condition my hair better.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not a DEVA CONCEPT PRODUCT!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have been buying products for many many years.  </li>
            <li>I felt I had to use a lot more of it</li>
            <li>The DevaCurl conditioner has a more salon-type smell to it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this every time I shower, and I use the no-poo every 3-4 (sometimes more) days.</li>
            <li>It never builds up but leaves my hair so strong and shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>My hair was dry and brittle, devacare products and coconut oil have changed this for good!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used both and haven&#x27;t noticed a huge change in formula besides the scent, so I&#x27;d say if someone wanted to decide between the two, choose based on scent.</li>
            <li>I use this in the shower, lightly rinse it out, and then use the angel gel.  </li>
            <li>DevaCare conditioner is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I also take hot showers despite knowing better.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is creamy and washes out clean.</li>
            <li>I have wavy, kind of frizzy, Burnett, medium course and length past my sternum- kind of hair.</li>
            <li>I found that the DevaCurl One Condition seemed less effective in that it did not \\&quot;stick to my hair\\&quot; for lack of a better description.</li>
            <li>, it easily and completely washed out when rinsing my hair and it did not leave the smooth silky feeling</li>
            <li>This is the real deal, thick creamy and awesome</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found anything that works half as good.</li>
            <li>This one has a scent very much like their gels.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and I live in south Florida where the humidity is frequently 80% or better.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>what i expected - love these products.</li>
            <li>If you have curly hair, find a salon that is trained in Curly Girl cutting (the Curly Girl book is great too!) and switch to Deva.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s color really well with this conditoner.  </li>
            <li>Really like that about this product.</li>
            <li>One Condition is much thicker and creamier.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t really the sort of thing you buy without knowing that it works for you, and it really, really works for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve fought with my hair my whole life.</li>
            <li>The scent on this one is very fruity/candy like.</li>
            <li>Different color and smell from the original.</li>
            <li>Plus, I color my own hair and it usually fades quite fast, but my hair has held</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the recommended curly hair stuff throughout my adult life, and I was pretty much resigned to have frizzy, undefined curls or frizzy</li>
            <li>This conditioner is very moisturizing and thick and great for curly hair, especially in the winter when my hair is dryer.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for thick, curly, coarse hair - both as a leave-in and as a wash-out.</li>
            <li>My hair is very wavy with some ringlets and needs thick conditioning in order for my waves and curls to act appropriately.</li>
            <li>, heat wrecked straight hair, when I finally gave in and bought some DevaCurl products.</li>
            <li>Even with squish to condish, leaving my conditioner in a long time, and the hot water, my color sticks around for quite a while.</li>
            <li>This product worked very well for both my daughter with different curl patterns.</li>
            <li>Smells sweet and kinda like skittles as a few users have remarked.</li>
            <li>I think that switching to this brand has really helped me retain the red, which usually fades quickly for</li>
            <li>This has a regular top, which is entirely preferable to the pump as the bottle can just be left upside down.  </li>
            <li>Like this conditioner, paired with DevaCare Low-Poo shampoo - my split ends have been so much reduced since starting to use this that I didn&#x27;t have any after waiting 6 months to cut my hair recently so that it grew from chin to shoulder length.</li>
            <li>There are no other products on the market that I&#x27;ve found that work as well as these.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it and a little goes a very long way.</li>

            <li> enjoying this product</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast shipping, excellent merchant! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Wonderful conditioer, leaves hair soft and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! I use it with the devacare no poo and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my hair when using these products. I only wish the 32 oz. conditioner was on the amazon subscribe and save menu just like the shampoo is.</li>
            <li> Different color and smell from the original. What is it?</li>
            <li> Like this conditioner, paired with DevaCare Low-Poo shampoo - my split ends have been so much reduced since starting to use this that I didn&#x27;t have any after waiting 6 months to cut my hair recently so that it grew from chin to shoulder length.</li>
            <li> I have boticelli curls and I live in south Florida where the humidity is frequently 80% or better. I co-wash with it, I use it as regular conditioner, I use it as a leave in. It never builds up but leaves my hair so strong and shiny and healthy. This is the best conditioner I have ever found, and even though it&#x27;s pricey.. I&#x27;ve never found anything that works half as good.</li>
            <li> I have been using Deva Care for curly hair for about the last year. I use the one for color-treated hair; it smells WAY better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is non-lathering, so it does take a little getting used to, but it has minimized my frizz by 50%.</li>
            <li> for all us  curly heads this  deva curl is the best. they have this white label and a green label  I like white label on the conditioner the best. it&#x27;s for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I have been buying One Condition for a long time, But just realized I was getting ripped off by another company! This is the real deal, thick creamy and awesome Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is amazing for my hair and I will continue to buy from this seller. This is a legit product, not watered down.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is very moisturizing and thick and great for curly hair, especially in the winter when my hair is dryer. I&#x27;ve tried tons of curly hair/dry hair conditioners and this is by far one of the best. A little goes a long way and it lasts for a while.</li>
            <li> I have been using DevaCare products for the last 10 years and they are just what curly hair needs. There are no other products on the market that I&#x27;ve found that work as well as these.</li>
            <li> I use the deva curl products always, and they are perfect for my hair.  I use this in the shower, lightly rinse it out, and then use the angel gel.  No shampoo. Ever since I started this routine about a year ago, the frizz is gone.  The only thing that annoys me about the deva products is the pump, which results in about a tenth of the bottle being left in the bottom absent Herculean efforts.  This has a regular top, which is entirely preferable to the pump as the bottle can just be left upside down.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> what i expected - love these products.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for thick, curly, coarse hair - both as a leave-in and as a wash-out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Deva convert and will only use these products on my curls. If you have curly hair, find a salon that is trained in Curly Girl cutting (the Curly Girl book is great too!) and switch to Deva. You won&#x27;t regret your decision and may decide you actually like having curly hair!</li>
            <li> I have always ordered the DevaCurl One Condition and ordered this one by mistake.  It&#x27;s the best mistake I have ever made.  I have had great results with my hair.  Plus, I color my own hair and it usually fades quite fast, but my hair has held it&#x27;s color really well with this conditoner.  I&#x27;m not saying that I will never use the DevaCurl One Conditioner again because I think that all the Deva products are great and maybe my hair just needed a change.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry and brittle, devacare products and coconut oil have changed this for good!  I went &amp;#34;curly girl&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
            <li> Could not comb my hair after I used this product. I have a friend that loves it.....so buyer beware. I color my hair so that my be part of the problem.</li>
            <li> I use this one condition every day. I wash my hair one or two times a week but condition every day. This conditioner is creamy and washes out clean. Love. I do wish the Deva curl products were cheaper but Amazon has the best prices I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Treats hair as if I were at the salon! This is a repeat order and I would not be using it if it didn&#x27;t work as well as it does.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Nothing else works better for curly hair. Would recommend this to anyone with frizzy or curly hair. Thank you</li>
            <li> Smells sweet and kinda like skittles as a few users have remarked. I have wavy, kind of frizzy, Burnett, medium course and length past my sternum- kind of hair. It helps curl my hair so that the waves are much more pronounced. Really like that about this product. Down fall, big down fall, is that it doesn&#x27;t condition well.. I must use a leave-in-conditioner just so that my hair will be manageable. I tried using the No-Poo (shampoo) and I did notice that it helped condition my hair better.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and this stuff is great. I use all of the Deva Care and Deva Curl products.</li>
            <li> DEVA CARE ONE CONITION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a DEVA CONCEPT PRODUCT!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have been buying products for many many years.  This product came in yellow and it was to be WHITE in color.  The smell was not the same.  ORIGIONAL DEVA CURL PRODUCTS are WHITE in COLOR unless it is the LOO POO Shampoo or the GEL.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased a big bottle of the DevaCurl One Condition and couldn&#x27;t wait for it to run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DevaCare One Condition is much thicker and creamier. My hair is very wavy with some ringlets and needs thick conditioning in order for my waves and curls to act appropriately. I found that the DevaCurl One Condition seemed less effective in that it did not \\&quot;stick to my hair\\&quot; for lack of a better description. I felt I had to use a lot more of it, it easily and completely washed out when rinsing my hair and it did not leave the smooth silky feeling that DevaCare does after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, my hair does not feel weighed down or oily with DevaCare or Curl. However, the DevaCurl conditioner did not control my frizzies as well either. So I now use the DevaCare No-Poo and One Condition exclusively.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t really the sort of thing you buy without knowing that it works for you, and it really, really works for me. I&#x27;ve fought with my hair my whole life. When I was a kid, my ringlets would be brushed out, and my hair would frizz out like nobody&#x27;s business. I fell into a straightening rut, then just started throwing my hair up in a bun or something. I&#x27;ve tried all the recommended curly hair stuff throughout my adult life, and I was pretty much resigned to have frizzy, undefined curls or frizzy, heat wrecked straight hair, when I finally gave in and bought some DevaCurl products. I was holding off because the price is prettttty high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DevaCare conditioner is fantastic. I squish to condish with it and put a bit in at the end of my shower as it says on the bottle. The scent on this one is very fruity/candy like. The DevaCurl conditioner has a more salon-type smell to it. I&#x27;ve used both and haven&#x27;t noticed a huge change in formula besides the scent, so I&#x27;d say if someone wanted to decide between the two, choose based on scent. This one has a scent very much like their gels. The DevaCare line is supposed to be for color treated hair, and I do dye my hair red. I also take hot showers despite knowing better. Even with squish to condish, leaving my conditioner in a long time, and the hot water, my color sticks around for quite a while. I think that switching to this brand has really helped me retain the red, which usually fades quickly for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this every time I shower, and I use the no-poo every 3-4 (sometimes more) days. I also use the styling cream and the defining gels. The combination has my hair looking the best it ever has. My curls are defined, not frizzy, not crunchy, and just everything I wanted when I started looking to wear my hair how it grows. I highly recommend trying this brand if you have curly hair and nothing else has seemed to work in the past.</li>
            <li> This product worked very well for both my daughter with different curl patterns. It&#x27;s worth it and a little goes a very long way. I see healthier hair !</li>
