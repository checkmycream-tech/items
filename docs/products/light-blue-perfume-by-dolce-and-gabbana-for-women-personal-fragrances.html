            <li>I love it, my favorite by far to date:)</li>
            <li>Mademoiselle Chanel&lt;br /&gt;Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue&lt;br /&gt;Giorgio</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I get for being cheap.</li>
            <li>The lovely fragrance is well worth it, though.</li>
            <li>Its light scent mesmerizes people.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I bought it as a gift, and I had a massage attached to it for free.</li>
            <li>I love its fresh smell.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a pop tart flavor, nor is it cheap.</li>
            <li>Not only is it the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot; - unlike the counterfeit D&amp;B I received off another website - but I also got it at great price!  </li>
            <li>OH so good  best smell in a long long time...........</li>
            <li>This D&amp;G is by far my new favorite, its perfect for my personality and still has a softness I can wear without bothering my students to much.</li>
            <li>A unique fragrance.</li>
            <li>Will not give credit unless in original packaging, this was a Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have original packaging.</li>
            <li>I love light blue and always get nice compliments when I have it on.</li>
            <li>original order came damaged...</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t smell like the original one....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean, not overly floral.  </li>
            <li>This is by far one of my favorite perfumes!</li>
            <li>(Figures, eh?)&lt;br /&gt;I was travelling one day and walked into a rest room where I smelled what I thought was my old favorite perfume!</li>
            <li>I got the package quickly and it was all in original packaging and sealed with the plastic wrapping.</li>
            <li>Department store may cost more than Amazon&#x27;s, but you are getting the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Which is good... but not when we&#x27;re in public!</li>
            <li>I love spraying it on, and I really appreciate the compliments I receive while wearing it.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast too:)</li>
            <li>its what she wears and she loved getting it for Christmas last year.</li>
            <li>it smells sweet , almost to the point it burns my nose and throat, like a chemical smell.</li>
            <li>Smells good but doesn&#x27;t last longer than an hour.</li>
            <li>Everthing it&#x27;s ok , arrive just in time in my local, the package don&#x27;t have any troubble and the price is so cheap for that reason a buy more, my wife loveit</li>
            <li>The first bottle I purchased of Dolce Gabbana light blue was from Macy&#x27;s, I loved it -</li>
            <li>and I hope they are able to get the authentic product in the future.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly from the seller.</li>
            <li>Light Blue smells amazing, and the fragrance lasts all day.</li>
            <li>The pkg came very fast and securely wrapped.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, fresh and just the right touch of fruit/floral.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;DG Light Blue is still my favorite Perfume ever, its light and citrusy.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a nice, simple, and sophisticated scent that suits the modern woman.</li>
            <li>So peaceful and light.  </li>
            <li>, Amazon did the right thing and immediately provided a full refund.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I know of others priced higher that don&#x27;t smell as nice as Light Blue.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li>(It was $80.00/bottle in most retail places), naturally looking at Amazon!</li>
            <li>Clean and crisp scent.</li>
            <li>However I sprayed perfume and it smelled strong and not like the original LIGHT BLUE DOLCE GABBANA.</li>
            <li>This is the only scent I ever get amazing comments about.</li>
            <li>I love Dolce and Gabgana Light Blue.</li>
            <li>It was a nice birthday present for my girlfrined, but I can&#x27;t help feeling like I cheated on this one coz</li>
            <li>However, when I received this in the mail, I couldn&#x27;t get the top off once again, and the fragrance was nothing like the DG Light Blue that I am used too.  </li>
            <li>A blend of flowers and fruity notes: apple, bluebells, jasmine, bamboo and white rose.</li>
            <li>AND IT WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t have the lovely smell of Light Blue and the fragrance is gone in seconds.  </li>
            <li>It lasts all day too, which makes it worth the money</li>
            <li>An old friend in St. Louis said this was mellow and not sickening sweet or over powering.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the 90 dollars depending on where you buy it.</li>
            <li>I love the Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue perfume.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 100% satisfied and will continue to save the 40-50% and buy DG Light Blue through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Light Blue.  </li>
            <li>i love it and it is obviously the original</li>
            <li>It is authentic, not an imitation, and I love the scent of course.</li>
            <li>I receive the product, I knew that it does not smell right.</li>
            <li>I saw all these reviews about bogus bottles and the perfume not smelling right, which made me paranoid that I was going to get ripped off since I saw the reviews after placing my order.</li>
            <li>The packaging looked right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Light Blue for a couple of years now and this was the most inexpensive bottle I purchased, but didn&#x27;t smell like the real thing.</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable too.  </li>
            <li>was the original smell LIGHT BLUE.</li>
            <li>Just really like the smell!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve bought it from many different retailers.  </li>
            <li>I receive compliments daily on how lovely this scent is.</li>
            <li>I remember when this perfume first came out about seven years ago or something.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am unsure of exactly how they do it</li>
            <li>Although the packaging is an excellent knock off, the fragrance is fake-</li>
            <li>This is my first time purchasing this brand of perfume in women&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>first &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; fragrance purchase in over 20 years</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what it should be.</li>
            <li>Especially for the one you love</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S THE ONLY WAY TO GET THE AUTHENTIC AND QUALITY PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>This is a similar musky scent, slightly more flowery.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite things to smell on my wife... such a turn on...</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like Dolce &amp; Gabbana.  </li>
            <li>I smelled it first at a Club and one of the girl in my group had wore this cologne.</li>
            <li>Funny</li>
            <li>I came home and looked it up and sure enough</li>
            <li>It starts off a bit citrusy and then develops into a gentle, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze and last for most of the day.</li>
            <li>Very classy and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And, in turn, she purchases the men&#x27;s D &amp; G Light Blue for me as it&#x27;s just right for me as well.</li>
            <li>It is so fresh and clean and the smell lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>and shipping was so fast that i forgot i brought it</li>
            <li>I bought DG Light Blue through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the speedy service.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The perfume I received from the seller NuBeauty was not the real fragrance.</li>
            <li>I am a Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue lover.  </li>
            <li>I am very grateful for that.</li>
            <li>They are very helpful and respond promptly.</li>
            <li>I was very dissatisfied with this product</li>
            <li>Company was cleaver enough to advertise with all the indications that this was genuine Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>I purchased this and am thoroughly convinced it is not the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing Light Blue for over 5 years.</li>
            <li>When I opened the box and sprayed the perfume, it smelled nothing like Light Blue.</li>
            <li>this.i feel this shouldn&#x27;t be sold even with a somewhat lower price its too much to pay ... for the smell of alcohol.</li>
            <li>&amp; Gabbana Light Blue</li>
            <li>The smell is absolutely intoxicating.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li>I expected the product to be authentic since it was provided by Amazon and not by another seller.  </li>
            <li>The title in Dolche &amp; Gabbana Light Blue is off centered and the gold paint in the lettering is bleeding over bottle..</li>
            <li>SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THE REAL STUFF.</li>
            <li>Did not smell anything like Dolce &amp; Gabana light blue.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter and she loves the light blue perfume.  </li>
            <li>I appreciated the expedited delivery because it was part of her birthday gift.</li>
            <li>DO NOT buy if want the real thing.</li>
            <li>but this is the 1st fragrence to really make a difference and work this well.</li>
            <li>I ordered Light Blue thinking</li>
            <li>Ive worn D&amp;G Light Blue for 4 years and I KNOW this smell</li>
            <li>While reading through a magazine recently, my wife opened one of those fragrance tabs, smelled it and made the \\&quot;mmmmmmmmmmm\\&quot; sound then rubbed it on her wrists and neck.  </li>
            <li>This did not smell like the Light Blue I purchased in the department store.</li>
            <li>I came to know that its D&amp;G light blue after asking her.</li>
            <li>I just received Dolce and Gabbana Light Blue from amazon fulfillment.</li>
            <li>That whole Italy/ Germany thing confuses me because I&#x27;ve read conflicting opinions on if it can be made in Germany and be real.</li>
            <li>My wife loves D &amp; G Light Blue and it compliments her perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both my wife and I really like it.</li>
            <li>She really likes it</li>
            <li>A  DOLCE GABBANA LIGHT BLUE PERFUME</li>
            <li>A lady in my office said she wanted some of dolce and gabbana light blue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing Dolce and Gabanna Light Blue for 6 years.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and she really likes it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s naturally a lighter scent so you will tend to use more if you want it to last longer even if you buy it at the department store.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this fragrance and have half of this office interested in purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>The box it came with is a regular carton instead of the velvety box the original comes with.</li>
            <li>Not only is it clean smelling but its also make my mouth water...</li>
            <li>I am sending the product back and expect a full refund from the seller.</li>
            <li>and If I could I would have sent it back for a full refund.</li>
            <li>I got this perfume in high school and am just finishing my first bottle (I am 24 years old now).</li>
            <li>The box had black fingerprints on it, although the box appeared authentic because it was velvet with clouds.</li>
            <li>decent price as well</li>
            <li>I quickly glanced over to see what magazine she was looking at and later when she wasn&#x27;t around</li>
            <li>My wife said she would never order this particular scent again.</li>
            <li>Definitely a classic, it even smells just like the name &amp;#34;Light Blue&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It may seem weird that it took me over 7 years to go through a bottle of perfume, but I only wore it on special occasions because I loved it that much!</li>
            <li>is a list of perfumes that contain dangerously high levels of toxins that may cause migraine headaches, dermatitis, respiratory illness, hormonal disorders, and organ failure:&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using it for years and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>like the perfume not what i expected but the perfume is just fine like to use or wear every day</li>
            <li>I asked the only other woman in there what her lovely perfume was, and she told me Dolce Gabbana Light Blue.</li>
            <li>A FEW DOLLARS MORE</li>
            <li>Smells fresh and last all day.</li>
            <li>I was in Grand Cayman a few years ago and the hotel had a spa and the scent of the spa</li>
            <li>After I wore it a few times, I started to like it better.</li>
            <li>Great for daytime and casual wear.</li>
            <li>in a way it reminds me of cologne which is why I love it so much (I absolutely love the smell of cologne and would totally wear it if that weren&#x27;t super weird for a female).</li>
            <li>I did get a defective product and they did promptly send me a new one.</li>
            <li>HOW CAN THEY LIVE WITH THEMSELVES?</li>
            <li>Arrived new and on time.  </li>
            <li>Light Blue is the only perfume I wear</li>
            <li>I have used light blue for years, and it is absolutely different from what arrived.</li>
            <li>My third bottle of Light Blue.</li>
            <li>Went to Macy&#x27;s over the thanksgiving and got set for D&amp;G Light Blue but after checking prices on amazon I though why to pay some extra at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Long lasting, no chance of going too heavy on this as it&#x27;s so light, it teases a person to come closer to see where the refreshing scent is coming from.</li>
            <li>The perfume smells exactly the same.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, she loved it, and thought I spent way more than I actually did.</li>
            <li>I would buy this again even though this bottle is huge so who knows how long it will last.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is a watered down version of the original.  </li>
            <li>this is certainly a gift that gives back to ME every time my girlfriend wears it.</li>
            <li>I find it hard to get a deal better then</li>
            <li>It is very alluring to the male olfactory sense...something I can say from experience.</li>
            <li>This, however is completely counterfeit.  </li>
            <li>It was considered \\&quot;old inventory.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>My husband goes wild whenever I put this on</li>
            <li>A young co-worker who I work with was wearing this.  </li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was old or a knock off.</li>
            <li>to the scent you get direct.</li>
            <li>but now I feel it is either old or deluted.</li>
            <li>I kept my old bottle just to compare.</li>
            <li>And the bottles were a complete match.</li>
            <li>Most perfumes give me headaches, but not Light Blue!</li>
            <li>I let it go thinking maybe DG changed its formulation, plus I bought it from Amazon- a reputable company so it couldn&#x27;t be fake, right?</li>
            <li>Was a little hesitant about this when I first got it, but really do like it now.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because it was considerably cheaper than where I usually purchase and also had free shipping.</li>
            <li>soft enough for day and intimate enough for evening where.</li>
            <li>The scent is lovely, it is the company I purchased the product from, they sold inferior product, I think they know it was not good from the start.  </li>
            <li>When that same bottle was about to run out, I went to Macy&#x27;s to look for a new perfume since DG does not smell the way it used to.</li>
            <li>My wife says it is the same product that she buys at the big department store at the mall, just at a much lower price.</li>
            <li>Also noticed at least three of the ingredients are highly toxic, below is information on BHT, listed on the package of Light Blue from Macy&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the perfume was yellow and is typically clear.  </li>
            <li>recently purchased a new bottle at Macy&#x27;s as I was running low..  </li>
            <li>Actually is the second bottle I&#x27;ve bought so far.</li>
            <li>not too strong not to weak.</li>
            <li>I saw the &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; reviews but thought I would try to buy it at least one time through Amazon since I&#x27;ve been so pleased with my other purchases through the site.  </li>
            <li>EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED FASTER THAN EXPECTED.  </li>

            <li> I love it, my favorite by far to date:)</li>
            <li> Mademoiselle Chanel&lt;br /&gt;Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue&lt;br /&gt;Giorgio</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I get for being cheap.</li>
            <li> The lovely fragrance is well worth it, though.</li>
            <li> Its light scent mesmerizes people.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I bought it as a gift, and I had a massage attached to it for free.</li>
            <li> I love its fresh smell.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a pop tart flavor, nor is it cheap.</li>
            <li> Not only is it the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot; - unlike the counterfeit D&amp;B I received off another website - but I also got it at great price!  </li>
            <li> OH so good  best smell in a long long time...........</li>
            <li> This D&amp;G is by far my new favorite, its perfect for my personality and still has a softness I can wear without bothering my students to much.</li>
            <li> A unique fragrance.</li>
            <li> Will not give credit unless in original packaging, this was a Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have original packaging.</li>
            <li> I love light blue and always get nice compliments when I have it on.</li>
            <li> original order came damaged...</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell like the original one....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clean, not overly floral.  </li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite perfumes!</li>
            <li> (Figures, eh?)&lt;br /&gt;I was travelling one day and walked into a rest room where I smelled what I thought was my old favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> I got the package quickly and it was all in original packaging and sealed with the plastic wrapping.</li>
            <li> Department store may cost more than Amazon&#x27;s, but you are getting the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which is good... but not when we&#x27;re in public!</li>
            <li> I love spraying it on, and I really appreciate the compliments I receive while wearing it.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast too:)</li>
            <li> its what she wears and she loved getting it for Christmas last year.</li>
            <li> it smells sweet , almost to the point it burns my nose and throat, like a chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t last longer than an hour.</li>
            <li> Everthing it&#x27;s ok , arrive just in time in my local, the package don&#x27;t have any troubble and the price is so cheap for that reason a buy more, my wife loveit</li>
            <li> The first bottle I purchased of Dolce Gabbana light blue was from Macy&#x27;s, I loved it -</li>
            <li> and I hope they are able to get the authentic product in the future.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly from the seller.</li>
            <li> Light Blue smells amazing, and the fragrance lasts all day.</li>
            <li> The pkg came very fast and securely wrapped.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, fresh and just the right touch of fruit/floral.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;DG Light Blue is still my favorite Perfume ever, its light and citrusy.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a nice, simple, and sophisticated scent that suits the modern woman.</li>
            <li> So peaceful and light.  </li>
            <li> , Amazon did the right thing and immediately provided a full refund.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I know of others priced higher that don&#x27;t smell as nice as Light Blue.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> (It was $80.00/bottle in most retail places), naturally looking at Amazon!</li>
            <li> Clean and crisp scent.</li>
            <li> However I sprayed perfume and it smelled strong and not like the original LIGHT BLUE DOLCE GABBANA.</li>
            <li> This is the only scent I ever get amazing comments about.</li>
            <li> I love Dolce and Gabgana Light Blue.</li>
            <li> It was a nice birthday present for my girlfrined, but I can&#x27;t help feeling like I cheated on this one coz</li>
            <li> However, when I received this in the mail, I couldn&#x27;t get the top off once again, and the fragrance was nothing like the DG Light Blue that I am used too.  </li>
            <li> A blend of flowers and fruity notes: apple, bluebells, jasmine, bamboo and white rose.</li>
            <li> AND IT WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have the lovely smell of Light Blue and the fragrance is gone in seconds.  </li>
            <li> It lasts all day too, which makes it worth the money</li>
            <li> An old friend in St. Louis said this was mellow and not sickening sweet or over powering.  </li>
            <li> It is well worth the 90 dollars depending on where you buy it.</li>
            <li> I love the Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue perfume.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 100% satisfied and will continue to save the 40-50% and buy DG Light Blue through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Light Blue.  </li>
            <li> i love it and it is obviously the original</li>
            <li> It is authentic, not an imitation, and I love the scent of course.</li>
            <li> I receive the product, I knew that it does not smell right.</li>
            <li> I saw all these reviews about bogus bottles and the perfume not smelling right, which made me paranoid that I was going to get ripped off since I saw the reviews after placing my order.</li>
            <li> The packaging looked right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Light Blue for a couple of years now and this was the most inexpensive bottle I purchased, but didn&#x27;t smell like the real thing.</li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable too.  </li>
            <li> was the original smell LIGHT BLUE.</li>
            <li> Just really like the smell!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve bought it from many different retailers.  </li>
            <li> I receive compliments daily on how lovely this scent is.</li>
            <li> I remember when this perfume first came out about seven years ago or something.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am unsure of exactly how they do it</li>
            <li> Although the packaging is an excellent knock off, the fragrance is fake-</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing this brand of perfume in women&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> first &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; fragrance purchase in over 20 years</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what it should be.</li>
            <li> Especially for the one you love</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S THE ONLY WAY TO GET THE AUTHENTIC AND QUALITY PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This is a similar musky scent, slightly more flowery.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite things to smell on my wife... such a turn on...</li>
            <li> It smells exactly like Dolce &amp; Gabbana.  </li>
            <li> I smelled it first at a Club and one of the girl in my group had wore this cologne.</li>
            <li> Funny</li>
            <li> I came home and looked it up and sure enough</li>
            <li> It starts off a bit citrusy and then develops into a gentle, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze and last for most of the day.</li>
            <li> Very classy and clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And, in turn, she purchases the men&#x27;s D &amp; G Light Blue for me as it&#x27;s just right for me as well.</li>
            <li> It is so fresh and clean and the smell lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> and shipping was so fast that i forgot i brought it</li>
            <li> I bought DG Light Blue through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the speedy service.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The perfume I received from the seller NuBeauty was not the real fragrance.</li>
            <li> I am a Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue lover.  </li>
            <li> I am very grateful for that.</li>
            <li> They are very helpful and respond promptly.</li>
            <li> I was very dissatisfied with this product</li>
            <li> Company was cleaver enough to advertise with all the indications that this was genuine Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue</li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> I purchased this and am thoroughly convinced it is not the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Light Blue for over 5 years.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box and sprayed the perfume, it smelled nothing like Light Blue.</li>
            <li> this.i feel this shouldn&#x27;t be sold even with a somewhat lower price its too much to pay ... for the smell of alcohol.</li>
            <li> &amp; Gabbana Light Blue</li>
            <li> The smell is absolutely intoxicating.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li> I expected the product to be authentic since it was provided by Amazon and not by another seller.  </li>
            <li> The title in Dolche &amp; Gabbana Light Blue is off centered and the gold paint in the lettering is bleeding over bottle..</li>
            <li> SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THE REAL STUFF.</li>
            <li> Did not smell anything like Dolce &amp; Gabana light blue.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves the light blue perfume.  </li>
            <li> I appreciated the expedited delivery because it was part of her birthday gift.</li>
            <li> DO NOT buy if want the real thing.</li>
            <li> but this is the 1st fragrence to really make a difference and work this well.</li>
            <li> I ordered Light Blue thinking</li>
            <li> Ive worn D&amp;G Light Blue for 4 years and I KNOW this smell</li>
            <li> While reading through a magazine recently, my wife opened one of those fragrance tabs, smelled it and made the \\&quot;mmmmmmmmmmm\\&quot; sound then rubbed it on her wrists and neck.  </li>
            <li> This did not smell like the Light Blue I purchased in the department store.</li>
            <li> I came to know that its D&amp;G light blue after asking her.</li>
            <li> I just received Dolce and Gabbana Light Blue from amazon fulfillment.</li>
            <li> That whole Italy/ Germany thing confuses me because I&#x27;ve read conflicting opinions on if it can be made in Germany and be real.</li>
            <li> My wife loves D &amp; G Light Blue and it compliments her perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both my wife and I really like it.</li>
            <li> She really likes it</li>
            <li> A  DOLCE GABBANA LIGHT BLUE PERFUME</li>
            <li> A lady in my office said she wanted some of dolce and gabbana light blue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Dolce and Gabanna Light Blue for 6 years.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> and she really likes it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s naturally a lighter scent so you will tend to use more if you want it to last longer even if you buy it at the department store.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this fragrance and have half of this office interested in purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> The box it came with is a regular carton instead of the velvety box the original comes with.</li>
            <li> Not only is it clean smelling but its also make my mouth water...</li>
            <li> I am sending the product back and expect a full refund from the seller.</li>
            <li> and If I could I would have sent it back for a full refund.</li>
            <li> I got this perfume in high school and am just finishing my first bottle (I am 24 years old now).</li>
            <li> The box had black fingerprints on it, although the box appeared authentic because it was velvet with clouds.</li>
            <li> decent price as well</li>
            <li> I quickly glanced over to see what magazine she was looking at and later when she wasn&#x27;t around</li>
            <li> My wife said she would never order this particular scent again.</li>
            <li> Definitely a classic, it even smells just like the name &amp;#34;Light Blue&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It may seem weird that it took me over 7 years to go through a bottle of perfume, but I only wore it on special occasions because I loved it that much!</li>
            <li> is a list of perfumes that contain dangerously high levels of toxins that may cause migraine headaches, dermatitis, respiratory illness, hormonal disorders, and organ failure:&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> like the perfume not what i expected but the perfume is just fine like to use or wear every day</li>
            <li> I asked the only other woman in there what her lovely perfume was, and she told me Dolce Gabbana Light Blue.</li>
            <li> A FEW DOLLARS MORE</li>
            <li> Smells fresh and last all day.</li>
            <li> I was in Grand Cayman a few years ago and the hotel had a spa and the scent of the spa</li>
            <li> After I wore it a few times, I started to like it better.</li>
            <li> Great for daytime and casual wear.</li>
            <li> in a way it reminds me of cologne which is why I love it so much (I absolutely love the smell of cologne and would totally wear it if that weren&#x27;t super weird for a female).</li>
            <li> I did get a defective product and they did promptly send me a new one.</li>
            <li> HOW CAN THEY LIVE WITH THEMSELVES?</li>
            <li> Arrived new and on time.  </li>
            <li> Light Blue is the only perfume I wear</li>
            <li> I have used light blue for years, and it is absolutely different from what arrived.</li>
            <li> My third bottle of Light Blue.</li>
            <li> Went to Macy&#x27;s over the thanksgiving and got set for D&amp;G Light Blue but after checking prices on amazon I though why to pay some extra at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, no chance of going too heavy on this as it&#x27;s so light, it teases a person to come closer to see where the refreshing scent is coming from.</li>
            <li> The perfume smells exactly the same.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, she loved it, and thought I spent way more than I actually did.</li>
            <li> I would buy this again even though this bottle is huge so who knows how long it will last.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a watered down version of the original.  </li>
            <li> this is certainly a gift that gives back to ME every time my girlfriend wears it.</li>
            <li> I find it hard to get a deal better then</li>
            <li> It is very alluring to the male olfactory sense...something I can say from experience.</li>
            <li> This, however is completely counterfeit.  </li>
            <li> It was considered \\&quot;old inventory.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> My husband goes wild whenever I put this on</li>
            <li> A young co-worker who I work with was wearing this.  </li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was old or a knock off.</li>
            <li> to the scent you get direct.</li>
            <li> but now I feel it is either old or deluted.</li>
            <li> I kept my old bottle just to compare.</li>
            <li> And the bottles were a complete match.</li>
            <li> Most perfumes give me headaches, but not Light Blue!</li>
            <li> I let it go thinking maybe DG changed its formulation, plus I bought it from Amazon- a reputable company so it couldn&#x27;t be fake, right?</li>
            <li> Was a little hesitant about this when I first got it, but really do like it now.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because it was considerably cheaper than where I usually purchase and also had free shipping.</li>
            <li> soft enough for day and intimate enough for evening where.</li>
            <li> The scent is lovely, it is the company I purchased the product from, they sold inferior product, I think they know it was not good from the start.  </li>
            <li> When that same bottle was about to run out, I went to Macy&#x27;s to look for a new perfume since DG does not smell the way it used to.</li>
            <li> My wife says it is the same product that she buys at the big department store at the mall, just at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> Also noticed at least three of the ingredients are highly toxic, below is information on BHT, listed on the package of Light Blue from Macy&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the perfume was yellow and is typically clear.  </li>
            <li> recently purchased a new bottle at Macy&#x27;s as I was running low..  </li>
            <li> Actually is the second bottle I&#x27;ve bought so far.</li>
            <li> not too strong not to weak.</li>
            <li> I saw the &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; reviews but thought I would try to buy it at least one time through Amazon since I&#x27;ve been so pleased with my other purchases through the site.  </li>
            <li> EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED FASTER THAN EXPECTED.  </li>
            <li> When first opened fragrance would last approximately 4/5 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Now, after a little over a month I can just barely smell it when my wife first applies it?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only concern I have WITH THIS ONE is that the smell of the perfume doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> The staying power gets me through the work day, but it&#x27;s necessary to reapply before a dinner out, so a bottle doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> this common additive used to prevent oxidation in a wide variety of foods and cosmetics is listed by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) in 2005 as \\&quot;reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen\\&quot; on the basis of experimental findings in animals.</li>
            <li> The lid is darker blue and the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long, which leads me to believe this is a knock off.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am not sure this is the real stuff.  </li>
            <li> This one for some reason, the smell doesn&#x27;t last long, I don&#x27;t smell it on myself, no one can, even my fianc&amp;eacute;.</li>
            <li> It just oesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like it to.</li>
            <li> But when I tried a sample of DG Light Blue from Macy, I realized that the one I got from Amazon was really a fake.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting this for so long, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the department stores retail price of $80.00</li>
            <li> In addition it came in just a few days directly to my door and no driving or shopping.</li>
            <li> It has a hint of musk and lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i Have the same perfume from other seller (DiscountPerfumes )...</li>
            <li> This particular scent is weak and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The box was poorly designed--letters off center, etc...makes me think that this is not authentic D&amp;G Light Blue</li>
            <li> However, not sure if it is because it was an old bottle, but it did not smell anything like a bottle I purchase at Dillards or Macys.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and purchased it from Amazon with a $5- $7 savings.</li>
            <li> and finally i broke down</li>
            <li> But I am making this review as a warning to potential buyers and as a heads up to Amazon too so that they will be aware that their suppliers are selling them fake perfumes.</li>
            <li> This perfume is not true is Generic</li>
            <li> Too bad .. it was more affordable but not quality</li>
            <li> Spears Curious</li>
            <li> received just as expected.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was gonna save some cash, but just like many others, I RECEIVED A FAKE!!</li>
            <li> This ruins my amazon experience.</li>
            <li> Some reviews state that the fragrance is a fake, but it smells and appears to be the real thing.  </li>
            <li> Watered down perfume.</li>
            <li> Not too over powering and does not smell watered down.  </li>
            <li> I still have half a bottle and everytime I look at it</li>
            <li> Took 3 weeks to get delivery, couldn&#x27;t cancel order in less than 24 hours after I placed the order.  </li>
            <li> the smell is slightly off...</li>
            <li> This perfume does not have the typical &amp;#34;feminine smell&amp;#34; of fruity flowers, rainbows and unicorns.</li>
            <li> Half the price at Amazon than anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> this size typically go for like 80$+ in department stores.</li>
            <li> and I did find it a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> ...disappointed i feel ripped off dnt waste your money.</li>
            <li> Was definitely an OLD stale bottle or a knockoff.</li>
            <li> Items was old and stale smelling.</li>
            <li> I have gotten a few compliments on this scent.  </li>
            <li> but it was not fresh at the least.</li>
            <li> like is usually does.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways the smell is A+ if you are a woman you are missing out not wearing this!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this product for years and have ordered from Amazon in the past.  </li>
            <li> I sent the fake product back but no refund.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed that it did not have the same smell as the smaller one I ordered..</li>
            <li> Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this makes me wary to order perfume from amazon, although they did give me my money back.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday but didn&#x27;t want any sickening sweet scent.  </li>
            <li> I get mad due to the amount I spent.</li>
            <li> I received a broken bottle unseal packaging and less than 1/3 of the content.</li>
            <li> Hard to tell someone leave in the packaging</li>
            <li> and he said it reminded him of those bad car scent things, those that smell of musty old leather.</li>
            <li> It makes us all nauseous and the girl with the terrible allergy goes home if there is not another office available for her to work</li>
            <li> but no more perfumes!</li>
            <li> I usually wear dream Angel, Heavenly, by Victoria&#x27;s Secret.  </li>
            <li> My wife has asthma and this is one of the very few fragrances that she can use that does not set her asthma off!</li>
            <li> With subtle hints of amber, cedarwood and musk.</li>
            <li> It has citrus notes, along with subtle floral notes.</li>
            <li> Got what I paid for, but not happy with end result.</li>
            <li> Montana Secret Celebrity&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer</li>
            <li> After Hours Body Spray&lt;br /&gt;Quiksilver (for men)&lt;br /&gt;Victoria&#x27;s Secret Dream Angels Heavenly</li>
            <li> She has used this particular fragrance before, and feels that what we received is a poor \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot;!!!!</li>
            <li> I am really really not happy with my expensive buy from this seller</li>
            <li> I was confused in case if I get those fake ones but after receiving my package.</li>
            <li> So that makes me think that maybe is fake??????????</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if I bought a fake..</li>
            <li> but when the perfume arrived it was fake.  </li>
            <li> I still believe the product is subpar and fake, but customer service is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please</li>
            <li> there is no way this is&#x27;nt a fake</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> It had to be fake.</li>
            <li> The smell is wrong</li>
            <li> ONLINE RESEARCH SAYS THAT IT COULD BE A FAKE PRODUCT.&lt;br</li>
            <li> needs to be posted as FAKE.</li>
            <li> Sad that D&amp;G is no longer producing this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND PERFUME ONLINE</li>
            <li> The box and bottle and scent were obviously fake.  </li>
            <li> I never do that with an expensive perfume</li>
            <li> DISAPPOINTING gift for my girl friend.</li>
            <li> really disappointment</li>
            <li> However, I was so disappointed because I received a fake product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now the product leaks because of bad sealing and can&#x27;t return it</li>
            <li> It appears that he&#x27;s done it before... selling bad products.</li>
            <li> Worse of all, The scent is horrible!!</li>
            <li> and I started sneezing non-stop and got sick to my stomach!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned my lesson:(</li>
            <li> I have never ordered perfume on line and was disappointed...</li>
            <li> IT IS HORRIBLE HOW SOMEONE CAN SELL SOMETHING FAKE AND RIP OFF YOUR MONEY...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just really like the smell!</li>
            <li> Purchased this product on line and it didn&#x27;t appear to be the same quality or have the same longevity as store bought. Too bad .. it was more affordable but not quality</li>
            <li> Light Blue is the only perfume I wear and I&#x27;ve bought it from many different retailers.  This was an excellent price for the size.  I get complimented daily on the scent.  Love it and have no intentions of wearing anything else.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume as it reminds me of someone special, and boy does it do the trick!  It&#x27;s the only scent I like besides the scent I use myself.</li>
            <li> it smells so good. and shipping was so fast that i forgot i brought it and it came like the next day. i love it and i just love amazon</li>
            <li> This is the best perfume for her... i love this smell, i don&#x27;t change for anything.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance!</li>
            <li> I know that we should rate the product, not the vendor. But I am making this review as a warning to potential buyers and as a heads up to Amazon too so that they will be aware that their suppliers are selling them fake perfumes. I bought DG Light Blue through Amazon. Not a third party seller, but from Amazon itself. I thought I am getting a good deal because its much cheaper in Amazon compared to department stores. However, I was so disappointed because I received a fake product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I receive the product, I knew that it does not smell right. I let it go thinking maybe DG changed its formulation, plus I bought it from Amazon- a reputable company so it couldn&#x27;t be fake, right? So I just let it go. When that same bottle was about to run out, I went to Macy&#x27;s to look for a new perfume since DG does not smell the way it used to. But when I tried a sample of DG Light Blue from Macy, I realized that the one I got from Amazon was really a fake. Since then, I never ever bought perfumes through Amazon anymore. Department store may cost more than Amazon&#x27;s, but you are getting the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DG Light Blue is still my favorite Perfume ever, its light and citrusy. But I always buy them from either Macy&#x27;s or Sephora. As for Amazon, I still do most of my shopping through Amazon.... but no more perfumes!</li>
            <li> Orders this for my girlfriend and she is extremely happy with it. I have looked around and this price is the best I have found, plus the shipping was very fast! Order now?!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! It&#x27;s my favorite! I always shop around for good prices and I was pretty satisfied with yours. I&#x27;ll probably order from you next time.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting this for so long, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the department stores retail price of $80.00 plus. I got this at a very good price. After ordering,received in good shape and in 4 days! Thanks for the speedy service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Great product and great service!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was considerably cheaper than where I usually purchase and also had free shipping. Have been wearing this fragrance for a couple years and was completely satisfied with item received.</li>
            <li> The perfume I received from the seller NuBeauty was not the real fragrance. I have been buying this scent for years and was very disappointed to receive an imposter. In addition, the perfume had leaked during shipping. I am sending the product back and expect a full refund from the seller.</li>
            <li> I am a Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue lover.  I purchased this item before from amazon and it was perfect so I decided to purchase it again from amazon this time through a third party vender.  I received a knock off verison and it was horrible and made me sick to my stomach.  I returned this product and I am still waiting for my refund. This is a wonderful product but be careful when ordering.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a great smell. It is not too overwhelming, but light and airy. Great for any occasion!</li>
            <li> I love Dolce and Gabgana Light Blue. The only concern I have WITH THIS ONE is that the smell of the perfume doesn&#x27;t last that long. Last time I bought the perfume in macy&#x27;s for $80 and I could smell the perfume on my clothes and me the next day. This one for some reason, the smell doesn&#x27;t last long, I don&#x27;t smell it on myself, no one can, even my fianc&amp;eacute;. So that makes me think that maybe is fake?????????? It was cheap I paid $40 but I won&#x27;t buy it again from this website.</li>
            <li> This perfume doesn&#x27;t just smell great, it last all day too.  I love it and always get nice comments.</li>
            <li> Satisfaction with purchase,&lt;br /&gt;Seller and price was good, shipping quick and packaged safely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Light Blue for a couple of years now and this was the most inexpensive bottle I purchased, but didn&#x27;t smell like the real thing. I&#x27;m wondering if I bought a fake..</li>
            <li> This is definitely a nice, simple, and sophisticated scent that suits the modern woman. It is very alluring to the male olfactory sense...something I can say from experience. It was a nice birthday present for my girlfrined, but I can&#x27;t help feeling like I cheated on this one coz this is certainly a gift that gives back to ME every time my girlfriend wears it. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased when I found this cologne before Christmas, and the price was excellant. Would like to see more from this seller of advertised fragrances.</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for my wife.  She loves it and I like the way it smells when she puts it on.</li>
            <li> one wasnt enough i had to purchase two for the price i found them for i couldnt just buy one</li>
            <li> Love it! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the service I received from this company. I did get a defective product and they did promptly send me a new one. I am very grateful for that. They were very courteous and didn&#x27;t even cause me any additional costs. They are very helpful and respond promptly. Thank you for being so prompt and kind in this matter.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes.  However, when I received this in the mail, I couldn&#x27;t get the top off once again, and the fragrance was nothing like the DG Light Blue that I am used too.  I was very dissatisfied with this product and If I could I would have sent it back for a full refund.</li>
            <li> This transaction was extremely smooth with this seller and I would definitely recommend them to others.  The fragrance is amazing and has been my favorite for years!</li>
            <li> Was a gift. She loved it</li>
            <li> Got a good deal on this and my woman loves it. I would buy this again even though this bottle is huge so who knows how long it will last.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, fresh, not too strong.  A blend of flowers and fruity notes: apple, bluebells, jasmine, bamboo and white rose. With subtle hints of amber, cedarwood and musk. This is one of my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my supervisor. This is her favorite scent. I checked around for pricing and this was the best price I could find. In addition it came in just a few days directly to my door and no driving or shopping. I am very pleased with the ease and speed of delivery.</li>
            <li> This is the only scent I ever get amazing comments about. I love it. and use it often. soft enough for day and intimate enough for evening where. The perfect scent</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes and the saving by purchasing thru Amazon was a bonus. Product arrived earlier than estimated delivery and made my day!</li>
            <li> Really enjoy it. You better try and experience my excitement.. It&#x27;s gentle and all time good. I already recommend it to my friends.  They are agree with me.</li>
            <li> Smells so nice.  Get lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> Company was cleaver enough to advertise with all the indications that this was genuine Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue but when the perfume arrived it was fake.  Do not buy from this company.  I haven&#x27;t filed my claim yet but I&#x27;m sure it will be a fight to have my money returned.  Embarrassed to be duped by these thugs...thought I had taken the proper precautions</li>
            <li> MY SISTER HAD THE 1.4 OZ. BOTTLE BEFORE HAND AND SAID IF I COULD GET HER ANOTHER ONE THAT WOULD BE GREAT...SO INSTEAD I WENT BIG AND GOT THE 3.4 OZ. WHEN SHE OPENED THE GIFT I THOUGHT SHE WAS GONNA HIT THE FLOOR!!!!!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH I ONLY PAID A FEW DOLLARS MORE AND IT WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY.  AWESOME DELIVERY TIME ALSO.THANKS AGAIN.BH</li>
            <li> I purchased this and am thoroughly convinced it is not the real deal.  After wearing it several times, I realized that by the time I sprayed it and walked downstairs, there was no longer any lingering fragrance.  I had purchased this before from department stores and know that it lasts with you all day.  Very disappointed that this could happen at Amazon.  Expect it on ebay, but not amazon!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my signature scent. I get compliments all the time. I had always purchased it from another vendor thinking I would not be able to find a better price but, one day I just decided to look elsewhere and I did find it a little cheaper. I find it hard to get a deal better then Amazon, they are the best.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a few years now.  The price at Amazon couldn&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Good product! Great smell. Nice gift for christmas! my wife loves it. Devido a custos de alfândega não vale a pena adquiri-lo dos EUA.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Light Blue for over 5 years. When I opened the box and sprayed the perfume, it smelled nothing like Light Blue. Definitely a knock off.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this seller--The Perfume Spot. I truly believe the perfume I received is a knock off.  The box was poorly designed--letters off center, etc...makes me think that this is not authentic D&amp;G Light Blue--I gave it to my niece today for her birthday.  She said it smells fine, but we shall see if the scent lasts etc...I should have stuck with Lord &amp; Taylor or Nordstroms....I&#x27;ve learned my lesson:(</li>
            <li> Edit: Amazon was able to solve my problem to my satisfaction. I still believe the product is subpar and fake, but customer service is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do not buy this parfume. I have used light blue for years, and it is absolutely different from what arrived. It smells similar but not the same, box is cheaper and item is produced in germany ( should be Italy). And the best part? You cannot return it. Very bad experience!~</li>
            <li> My wife feels we&#x27;ve been ripped-off!!!! She has used this particular fragrance before, and feels that what we received is a poor \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot;!!!! She has forbidden me from purchasing fragrances on-line in the future.  We&#x27;re VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in good faith. I&#x27;ve been using this fragrance for years. However, not sure if it is because it was an old bottle, but it did not smell anything like a bottle I purchase at Dillards or Macys. Got what I paid for, but not happy with end result.</li>
            <li> I receive compliments daily on how lovely this scent is. It&#x27;s light, airy and perfect for the summer. It&#x27;s truly my signature fragrance and i wear it all the time from spring thru summer.</li>
            <li> I could only give it 4 stars as it is not made in America, even though it comes up Made in USA under the amazon search - What&#x27;s up with that??? I happen to love this perfume and get complements when I wear it. My husband likes it too! ,,, on me!</li>
            <li> there is no way this is&#x27;nt a fake i use this all the time ,had a bottle for a year and it never smelled like this.i feel this shouldn&#x27;t be sold even with a somewhat lower price its too much to pay ... for the smell of alcohol.</li>
            <li> Watered down perfume. The perfume only lasted 10 minuted max. No lie!!!! I still have half a bottle and everytime I look at it I get mad due to the amount I spent. So I decided to write a review 3 yrs laters.</li>
            <li> Dolce and Gabbana Light Blue is my ALL time favorite fragrance!!! It can be worn anytime of the day. It is light and airy simply a WONDERFUL fragrance!! I saved almost $30.00 by purchasing online through Amazon as compared to buying it at the local department store.</li>
            <li> Always in love with this and with the price on Amazon even makes it more cool.</li>
            <li> love this scent.  The pkg came very fast and securely wrapped.  The price was very reasonable too.  I would def order from them again.</li>
            <li> This was a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exactly what I had been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue By Dolce &amp; Gabbana For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray</li>
            <li> My wife has used this since they came out and we have purchased from Amazon before.  This, however is completely counterfeit.  The fragrance is a watered down version of the original.  I must say though, Amazon did the right thing and immediately provided a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should get rid of their vendor that provides this.</li>
            <li> I buy this every year for my daughter. She loves the fragrance and I love to catch the scent when she wears it.  A unique fragrance. Delightful.  Yes, it&#x27;s expensive but I know of others priced higher that don&#x27;t smell as nice as Light Blue.</li>
            <li> I have never ordered perfume on line and was disappointed...the perfume was yellow and is typically clear.  It also did not smell like is usually does.  It was considered \\&quot;old inventory.\\&quot;  However, the company was very easy to work with on returning the perfume and refunding my money.</li>
            <li> The scent is lovely, it is the company I purchased the product from, they sold inferior product, I think they know it was not good from the start.  Will not give credit unless in original packaging, this was a Christmas gift.  Hard to tell someone leave in the packaging don&#x27;t throw away the box!  Took 3 weeks to get delivery, couldn&#x27;t cancel order in less than 24 hours after I placed the order.  Company doesn&#x27;t seem to be on the up and up.  Now the product leaks because of bad sealing and can&#x27;t return it I don&#x27;t have original packaging.</li>
            <li> I remember when this perfume first came out about seven years ago or something. The smell is absolutely intoxicating. My husband goes wild whenever I put this on and he can&#x27;t keep his hands off of me. Which is good... but not when we&#x27;re in public! I&#x27;m just kidding that is definetely a perk of this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am unsure of exactly how they do it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps they just jampack a ton of pheremones in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways the smell is A+ if you are a woman you are missing out not wearing this!</li>
            <li> It had to be fake. The smell is wrong there&#x27;s no way it&#x27;s the real thing. It smells like a bottle of lime juice</li>
            <li> I ordered a 3.4 fl.oz and it came as a 3.3 fl.oz  the smell is slightly off...the words on front should be in white compared to the one i seen in macys smh...disappointed i feel ripped off dnt waste your money.</li>
            <li> I saw all these reviews about bogus bottles and the perfume not smelling right, which made me paranoid that I was going to get ripped off since I saw the reviews after placing my order. But when it arrived I was very happy to find that it smells just like I remember and lasts just as long too.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, get compliments every time i wear it. Great price also, ten times better than airport duty free. Hooked for life</li>
            <li> love the scent-lasts from morning until night with just a spray-get many compliments from both men and women 0f any age</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume I have ever worn where I get compliments almost daily.  The fresh, light, citrus-y scent is amazing. Most perfumes give me headaches, but not Light Blue! I have finally found My Perfume.</li>
            <li> i love it and it took no time to arrive. it was also better priced than anywhere else. i get a lot of compliments when i wear it.</li>
            <li> Go to any store and they want 93$ for this same bottle. I got this for my wife&#x27;s bday and she loved it and i saved about 40 bucks. cant complain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this scent since the first time I smelled it on someone else. I finally broke down and purchased it from Amazon with a $5- $7 savings. I&#x27;ll purchase it again from Amazon when I need more. It arrived within three days on my doorstep.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. This is a lovely scent that lingers all day and night... Clean and crisp scent.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this product for years and have ordered from Amazon in the past.  I expected the product to be authentic since it was provided by Amazon and not by another seller.  Although the packaging is an excellent knock off, the fragrance is fake- it doesn&#x27;t have the lovely smell of Light Blue and the fragrance is gone in seconds.  Amazon needs more quality control.  Amazon handled this well for me and I hope they are able to get the authentic product in the future.</li>
            <li> Whenever I wear this, I am always asked what the scent is! It&#x27;s fresh, clean, and fruity and perfect for the summer time!</li>
            <li> omg.. it smells awesome and lasts all day.. Have gotten many many compliments on how good the fragrance smells even from people i do not know..</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing this brand of perfume in women&#x27;s. I think this was great buy. I love the fragrance. I think I have a new favorite perfume!!!</li>
            <li> I cant say enough about this perfume, I have used it for years, and I always get asked what I am wearing by people because it just smells so divine!!!! It lasts all day too, which makes it worth the money and then some!! Buy it, you will not be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Is the best perfume ever!!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THAT PERFUME. I RECOMEND.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume and it was delivered on time!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my go to perfume!  I love the fresh scent, people are always stopping me to ask what I&#x27;m wearing:). I love it, my favorite by far to date:)</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY WIFE AND IT CAUSED SEVERE ALLERGIC REACTION TO HER SKIN. ONLINE RESEARCH SAYS THAT IT COULD BE A FAKE PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO AMAZON WILL NOT ALLOW RETURN AS THEY CONSIDER THIS HAZARDOUS/FLAMMABLE.</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking I was gonna save some cash, but just like many others, I RECEIVED A FAKE!! The glue in the product packaging is coming apart. The title in Dolche &amp; Gabbana Light Blue is off centered and the gold paint in the lettering is bleeding over bottle.. Worse of all, The scent is horrible!! I also I asked my husband to smell it and he said it reminded him of those bad car scent things, those that smell of musty old leather. SOO, BUYER BEWARE!! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THE REAL STUFF.</li>
            <li> My third bottle of Light Blue. I get lots of compliment when I have it on. Smells fresh and last all day.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this purchase. I love the smell of this fragrance and have half of this office interested in purchasing this product. I for one will encourage my co-workers to go for it.</li>
            <li> one word for this ---- COUNTERFEIT</li>
            <li> I was pleased to get the best price in town on this perfume. It is authentic, not an imitation, and I love the scent of course. Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I had been wearing another frangrance for 20+ years and never even considered another until my friend wore this and I was hooked!!&lt;br /&gt;My first &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; fragrance purchase in over 20 years and I love it!!  It&#x27;s light and clean and smells great on anyone.</li>
            <li> Best price I could find! I just ordered another bottle, quick delivery also!</li>
            <li> It does not smell the same as what I have purchased from a department store.  It seems to be a weaker scent.</li>
            <li> I got this perfume in high school and am just finishing my first bottle (I am 24 years old now). It may seem weird that it took me over 7 years to go through a bottle of perfume, but I only wore it on special occasions because I loved it that much! I didn&#x27;t want to run out of it but am finally finishing my bottle! This perfume does not have the typical &amp;#34;feminine smell&amp;#34; of fruity flowers, rainbows and unicorns. It is a different smell that I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on- in a way it reminds me of cologne which is why I love it so much (I absolutely love the smell of cologne and would totally wear it if that weren&#x27;t super weird for a female). It is a smell you will definitely need to smell for yourself. I promise you will not be disappointed with it! Dolce and Gabbana made an amazing perfume with this one!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. LOVE LOVE LOVE the smell!&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. NONE!</li>
            <li> Was definitely an OLD stale bottle or a knockoff. Did not smell anything like Dolce &amp; Gabana light blue. I will never buy perfume online again.</li>
            <li> Tons of compliments! Very true to the notes. Men have come up to me asking me what I was wearing. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I love light blue and always get nice compliments when I have it on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what it should be.</li>
            <li> exactly what i ordered awesome</li>
            <li> This product definitely didn&#x27;t smell like it should of. Don&#x27;t purchase from this seller. It appears that he&#x27;s done it before... selling bad products.</li>
            <li> When first opened fragrance would last approximately 4/5 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Now, after a little over a month I can just barely smell it when my wife first applies it?&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO NO ONE!</li>
            <li> This is really nice and fresh to wear in the summer time and you don&#x27;t have to worry about the bugs.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am not sure this is the real stuff.  The lid is darker blue and the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long, which leads me to believe this is a knock off.  I wish I had returned it.</li>
            <li> Received item quickly! Love this scent it is perfect for any occasion!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites!  Great price and great service!</li>
            <li> The first bottle I purchased of Dolce Gabbana light blue was from Macy&#x27;s, I loved it - I just looked and was made in the UK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased a new bottle at Macy&#x27;s as I was running low..  When I got it home and tried it, it did not smell the same.  It smelled like mosquito spray and I started sneezing non-stop and got sick to my stomach!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I looked at where it was made, it now says Germany (not UK like my last bottle).  Also noticed at least three of the ingredients are highly toxic, below is information on BHT, listed on the package of Light Blue from Macy&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;BHT (Butylated Hydroxytoluene): this common additive used to prevent oxidation in a wide variety of foods and cosmetics is listed by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) in 2005 as \\&quot;reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen\\&quot; on the basis of experimental findings in animals. It is also used in jet fuels, rubber petroleum products, transformer oil and embalming fluid. As if this were not enough, the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) warns that BHT should not be allowed to enter the environment, can cause liver damage, and is harmful to aquatic organisms.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More info:&lt;br /&gt;Which perfumes should I avoid?&lt;br /&gt;Here is a list of perfumes that contain dangerously high levels of toxins that may cause migraine headaches, dermatitis, respiratory illness, hormonal disorders, and organ failure:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Fierce&lt;br /&gt;American Eagle Seventy Seven&lt;br /&gt;AXE Bodyspray For Men - Shock&lt;br /&gt;Bath &amp; Body Works Japanese Cherry Blossom&lt;br /&gt;Britney Spears Curious&lt;br /&gt;Calvin Klein Eternity (for men)&lt;br /&gt;Calvin Klein Eternity (for women)&lt;br /&gt;Clinique Happy&lt;br /&gt;Coco Mademoiselle Chanel&lt;br /&gt;Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue&lt;br /&gt;Giorgio Armani Acqua Di Gio&lt;br /&gt;Halle by Halle Berry&lt;br /&gt;Hannah Montana Secret Celebrity&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer Lopez J.

            <li> Shipped quick! I love this perfume. Smells beautiful. Not so strong. I would definitely recommend you buying this for your wife, girlfriend, mother, daughter, aunt, cousin, or best friend. Great price!</li>
            <li> excelente producto, lo recomiendo</li>
            <li> perfect just as described,</li>
            <li> Great gift. Especially for the one you love</li>
            <li> Love my light blue great price</li>
            <li> Was a little hesitant about this when I first got it, but really do like it now.  I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!  Had many compliments about the beautiful fragrance</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes!!  Half the price at Amazon than anywhere else.  Great perfume for the money!  Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Been wearing this for about 10 years, always purchased from a mall store - came packaged great and even better was that I didn&#x27;t have to go to the store to buy it-always get compliments and great smell lasts throughout the day</li>
            <li> What a rip off!!! The scent goes away after 10 minutes. The box it came with is a regular carton instead of the velvety box the original comes with. The silver colored part of the bottle came off after a day. I bought an original from a reputable web store and was finally satisfied. DON&#x27;T BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!! AMAZON check this seller and ban it! This ruins my amazon experience. We need trustworthy sellers.</li>
            <li> IT IS HORRIBLE HOW SOMEONE CAN SELL SOMETHING FAKE AND RIP OFF YOUR MONEY...IT&#x27;S A SHAME! HOW CAN THEY LIVE WITH THEMSELVES? ALWAYS BUY FROM REPUTABLE DEPARTMENT STORE...IT&#x27;S THE ONLY WAY TO GET THE AUTHENTIC AND QUALITY PRODUCT. BEWARE! DON&#x27;T BE STUPID LIKE ME TO BUY THIS JUNK!</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my perfume. Its like aromatherapy to me. So peaceful and light.  Have worn it for 3 years now.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Love it!  Love it!  Not only is it the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot; - unlike the counterfeit D&amp;B I received off another website - but I also got it at great price!  So happy!</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife.  She is very pleased.  Product actually delivered one day ahead of promised delivery date.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves the light blue perfume.  I appreciated the expedited delivery because it was part of her birthday gift.</li>
            <li> When it arrived inmediately I detected that the perfume didn&#x27;t smell anything like it was supposed to and  i Have the same perfume from other seller (DiscountPerfumes )... That&#x27;s what I get for being cheap. It&#x27;s better to buy perfume at the store to avoid getting a knock-off, lesson Learned. I want my money back</li>
            <li> original order came damaged... they refunded money and sent good replacement. they went the extra mile to correct order. THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> the perfume doesn&#x27;t smell the same, box was smashed alot was already leaked out. DO NOT buy if want the real thing. needs to be posted as FAKE. DISAPPOINTING gift for my girl friend. i know you get what you pay for but was mislead</li>
            <li> This D&amp;G is by far my new favorite, its perfect for my personality and still has a softness I can wear without bothering my students to much. Since I teach I cant have to strong of a scent on but this is the 1st fragrence to really make a difference and work this well.</li>
            <li> Excelente perfume, me hab&amp;iacute;a asustado antes de comprarlo porque hab&amp;iacute;an unos comentarios negativos sobre el mismo, pero realmente es muy bueno, no es el que tiene mayor fijaci&amp;oacute;n a la piel pero realmente es muy bueno, recomendado!!!</li>
            <li> Sad that D&amp;G is no longer producing this fragrance.  It smells great and was very popular.  Thank goodness Amazon has it stocked up for now.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter. She loves this scent &amp; was very happy with it - came as expected. The price was the best she&#x27;s seen around. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> This is smell so good. I love it.</li>
            <li> I usually wear dream Angel, Heavenly, by Victoria&#x27;s Secret.  This is a similar musky scent, slightly more flowery. I love it!</li>
            <li> Just the same as you find in the stores.  My wife says it is the same product that she buys at the big department store at the mall, just at a much lower price. My wife has asthma and this is one of the very few fragrances that she can use that does not set her asthma off!</li>
            <li> received just as expected.  shipping was also good.</li>
            <li> Such a pleasing scent, both to me and others. I love spraying it on, and I really appreciate the compliments I receive while wearing it. The staying power gets me through the work day, but it&#x27;s necessary to reapply before a dinner out, so a bottle doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like. The lovely fragrance is well worth it, though.</li>
            <li> I receive compliments almost daily with this cologne. Its light scent mesmerizes people. They always want to know the name of it. I have been using it for years and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume! Very light scent that lasts all day. Great for people with sensitive allergies.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell like the original one.... really disappointment</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite things to smell on my wife... such a turn on... Not only is it clean smelling but its also make my mouth water...</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly from the seller. Price was reasonable and it was packaged good.Very satisfied with my purchase there.</li>
            <li> This came in a brand new box perfect for my sisters birthday gift. She always asks me what I&#x27;m wearing when I wear it. We both just love it! I get a lot of compliments. Shipping was fast too:)</li>
            <li> my mom swears by this stuff. its what she wears and she loved getting it for Christmas last year. decent price as well</li>
            <li> Smells delish! I love this perfume! I bought this after getting a sample in JCP, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it great price</li>
            <li> EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED FASTER THAN EXPECTED.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND PERFUME ONLINE THAT ISN&#x27;T A \\&quot;KNOCK OFF\\&quot; BUT THIS IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN WEARING FOR YEARS.  THANK GOODNESS.</li>
            <li> A young co-worker who I work with was wearing this.  I was in Grand Cayman a few years ago and the hotel had a spa and the scent of the spa was wonderful.  It smells exactly like Dolce &amp; Gabbana.  I had to have it!!!</li>
            <li> WOW COULDN&#x27;T GET FASTER SHIPPING!  SMELLS WONDERFUL!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Good product for a good price, great deal! It was delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I ordered Light Blue thinking I was getting an amazing deal.  Well, it was too good to be true.  The box and bottle and scent were obviously fake.  When I contacted the seller he blamed his distributor and promised a refund.  I sent the fake product back but no refund.  Just excuses.  Do not do business with this seller.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite perfumes! Such a great price too! I was always jealous because a co-worker of mine would always wear this and finally i broke down a bought some! I never regretted it too! It just a wonderful smell that draws you in!</li>
            <li> Light and delicious, like a rainwater mist, lemons, cut grass.  Long lasting, no chance of going too heavy on this as it&#x27;s so light, it teases a person to come closer to see where the refreshing scent is coming from.</li>
            <li> Comparable to Valentino&#x27;s Valentina - Prada&#x27;s Milano, and Lancome&#x27;s Miracle. Love the fragrance. Not too sweet smelling, more on the musky side.</li>
            <li> I chose to be a classic fragrance which I found excellent detail for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;It is the product shipped meets specified by the seller.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product and seller, quality criteria.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller several times with NO reply. Ive worn D&amp;G Light Blue for 4 years and I KNOW this smell and so does my husbands and even my friends because it is all I wear but this item I got... NO way, NO how is this legit! It smells nothing like the D&amp;G LB ive ever ordered... it smells sweet , almost to the point it burns my nose and throat, like a chemical smell. I am really really not happy with my expensive buy from this seller and I will def not do buisness with them ever again. Shame on you for not answering your customers multiple emails.</li>
            <li> The bigger bottle does not smell like the smaller one...I was disappointed that it did not have the same smell as the smaller one I ordered.. I will order smaller the next time</li>
            <li> conforme con el producto y la entrega del mismo conforme con el producto y la entrega del mismo  conforme con el producto y la entrega del mismo</li>
            <li> While reading through a magazine recently, my wife opened one of those fragrance tabs, smelled it and made the \\&quot;mmmmmmmmmmm\\&quot; sound then rubbed it on her wrists and neck.  I quickly glanced over to see what magazine she was looking at and later when she wasn&#x27;t around, I went to the page and then ordered it via Amazon.  This is a great smelling fragrance.  Not too over powering and does not smell watered down.  It&#x27;s very clean.  Great for women of all ages.</li>
            <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t last longer than an hour. Not satisfied. Should&#x27;ve read more reviews before purchasing! Be cautious before ordering brand name perfume online.</li>
            <li> This did not smell like the Light Blue I purchased in the department store. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Everthing it&#x27;s ok , arrive just in time in my local, the package don&#x27;t have any troubble and the price is so cheap for that reason a buy more, my wife loveit</li>
            <li> I smelled it first at a Club and one of the girl in my group had wore this cologne. I came to know that its D&amp;G light blue after asking her. Went to Macy&#x27;s over the thanksgiving and got set for D&amp;G Light Blue but after checking prices on amazon I though why to pay some extra at Macy&#x27;s. I was confused in case if I get those fake ones but after receiving my package. I am really happy.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> This particular scent is weak and doesn&#x27;t last long. My wife said she would never order this particular scent again.</li>
            <li> Dolce &amp; Gabbana is always a quality product! Reccomended perfume for any occasion. This is her third bottle in a row!</li>
            <li> My mother loves this perfume because it gets others to comment on how good she smells! It was the perfect Christmas gift for her</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my wife&#x27;s b-day! She loved it... she does not want to share it with anyone!</li>
            <li> CAUTION *** This perfume is not true is Generic ***</li>
            <li> Love it!  Always receive compliments when wearing it.</li>
            <li> Great aroma....never got so many compliment on a scent.</li>
            <li> C&#x27;mon it&#x27;s Dolce and Gabbana and this is one of the freshest scents out there!!  I love this perfume.  It just oesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like it to.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife, she liked the scent and so did I. Is a bit pricey (like most DG items).</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday but didn&#x27;t want any sickening sweet scent.  An old friend in St. Louis said this was mellow and not sickening sweet or over powering.  Did research on the web and this was confirmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> Light Blue smells amazing, and the fragrance lasts all day. It has citrus notes, along with subtle floral notes. It&#x27;s perfect to use all year.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Good quality, I will order again...&lt;br /&gt;I bought it as a gift, and I had a massage attached to it for free.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my mother&#x27;s birthday as she loves this scent. I love it as well and the price can not be beat!!!! Bottles this size typically go for like 80$+ in department stores. I got the package quickly and it was all in original packaging and sealed with the plastic wrapping. Needless to say, she loved it, and thought I spent way more than I actually did.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness, someone sells authentic fragrance. Sure, try eBay if you want cheap Counterfeits. The genuine fragrance is very nice.</li>
            <li> She Liked it even though the package was damaged</li>
            <li> Ordered my perfume and never even got it!! So I message the seller (perfumes boutique) don&#x27;t buy from them.and ask if I can get a replacement since I paid $54 for something I never even got and they said no there&#x27;s nothing they can do.so I emailed amazon and they got my money back for me. I have never ever had a problem with Amazon.so I went to another website and bought it !</li>
            <li> This smells amazing! It is so fresh and clean and the smell lasts all day long. It is well worth the 90 dollars depending on where you buy it.</li>
            <li> I love the Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue perfume. I have been wearing it for years. The price was really good, but it took over 3 weeks for it to arrive. I contacted the seller and was told because of Hurricane Sandy it was delayed. Funny all my bills arrived on time!</li>
            <li> Items was old and stale smelling. Paid a lot of money for some stale/old perfume and had no one to contact about the issue</li>
            <li> OH so good  best smell in a long long time...........Great price with Amazon!!  One happy daughter in law  love this smell last all day too!!!</li>
            <li> I just received Dolce and Gabbana Light Blue from amazon fulfillment. The box came unsealed and without cellophane. The fragrance has a yellow tinge to it and has an off smell to it. The box had black fingerprints on it, although the box appeared authentic because it was velvet with clouds. I don&#x27;t know if it was old or a knock off. I don&#x27;t know if it was tampered with but it was not fresh at the least. I called amazon and they refunded me. But who is their distributor? Also, I ordered  the 3.4 ounce bottle and the bottle says it was made in Germany. That whole Italy/ Germany thing confuses me because I&#x27;ve read conflicting opinions on if it can be made in Germany and be real. Last, when I got it, it wound up being 3.3 ounces. Go figure. Anyway, this makes me wary to order perfume from amazon, although they did give me my money back. I will buy this at the dept. store next time.</li>
            <li> My wife loves D &amp; G Light Blue and it compliments her perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, in turn, she purchases the men&#x27;s D &amp; G Light Blue for me as it&#x27;s just right for me as well.</li>
            <li> This perfume is for every day use. I love its fresh smell. The price was good here too. I enjoy it and will purchase more.</li>
            <li> I LOVE jasmine and musk, and used to wear a perfume by Artistry called &amp;#34;Memories&amp;#34; that I just LOVED, but then it was discontinued. (Figures, eh?)&lt;br /&gt;I was travelling one day and walked into a rest room where I smelled what I thought was my old favorite perfume! I asked the only other woman in there what her lovely perfume was, and she told me Dolce Gabbana Light Blue. I came home and looked it up and sure enough, I went to their web site and found that Jasmin and Musk are in there, so I started looking for deals (It was $80.00/bottle in most retail places), naturally looking at Amazon! Yep!! Wonderful scent, GREAT price! Love Amazon!</li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t try and save money on a knock off.  I purchased it on amazon but from dolce and gabbana and it smells identical (because it is) to the scent you get direct. My girlfriend has worn it for years as her favorite scent (which I love) and I wanted to give her a refill. Lovely.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife based on the technical literature. It is made with synthetic Ambergris. Both my wife and I really like it. It isn&#x27;t a pop tart flavor, nor is it cheap. It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend. Actually is the second bottle I&#x27;ve bought so far. She really likes it</li>
            <li> I will never use this shop again in my life! I received a broken bottle unseal packaging and less than 1/3 of the content.</li>
            <li> Perfume was delivered fast and packaging looked good. However I sprayed perfume and it smelled strong and not like the original LIGHT BLUE DOLCE GABBANA. I ENDED UP BUYING A  DOLCE GABBANA LIGHT BLUE PERFUME AT Macy&#x27;s  and the smell was different and  was the original smell LIGHT BLUE. I contacted seller and no response.</li>
            <li> I got this at a great price but now I feel it is either old or deluted. The scent is very low. Things I learn by trhing to save money. Why write a review this company wont do anything about it...</li>
            <li> I ordered without ever smelling it or using it before. I never do that with an expensive perfume but since it was Dolce &amp; Gabbana I took a chance and was not disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> I love it. Always get compliments on how I smell with this on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lovely perfume. A very good buy!</li>
            <li> like the perfume not what i expected but the perfume is just fine like to use or wear every day</li>
            <li> I always receive compliments on this fragrance.Definitely a classic, it even smells just like the name &amp;#34;Light Blue&amp;#34;.  Great for daytime and casual wear.</li>
            <li> A lady in my office said she wanted some of dolce and gabbana light blue. I had my one of my co-workers  pick up a bottle from all of us and we gave it to her for her birthday. We had 2 people to have terrible allergic reactions to this perfume. One had to be taken to the hospital she couldnt breathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once in a while the lady we brought the perfume for will forget about the allergic reaction and wear it. It makes us all nauseous and the girl with the terrible allergy goes home if there is not another office available for her to work in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In school they sprinkle this awful smelling stuff when a child vomits. Thats what this perfume smells like. In our opinion, its BAD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw someone say something about fruity smell, maybe rotten fruit. I wouldnt put this on a stinking dog.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance and the price was very good for this perfume. It&#x27;s my favorite perfume. Good price for the quantity..</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and it is a very comforting and beautiful smell.  It lasts her all day and is NOT overpowering.</li>
            <li> Arrived new and on time.  This is a great perfume</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes! Great price on Amazon for the 3.3oz size. I was super happy when I saw it, and I ordered it!</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff smells superb!  It was very inexpensive compared to in store prices, and it got here on time and in great shape.  I am extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister. Can&#x27;t beat the price! Even beats the &amp;#34;Purfumania&amp;#34; stores that you see at the mall. Packaging was perfect.</li>
            <li> ONCE AGAIN YOU MADE MY WIFES DAY, AFTER A HELLACIOS TAX SEASON I SENT HER 2 BOTTLES. THEY WERE NOT ONLY ON TIME BUT THEY WERE ABOUT $20.00 CHEAPER THAN ANY PRICE I COULD FIND!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Dolce and Gabanna Light Blue for 6 years. It&#x27;s naturally a lighter scent so you will tend to use more if you want it to last longer even if you buy it at the department store. I saw the &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; reviews but thought I would try to buy it at least one time through Amazon since I&#x27;ve been so pleased with my other purchases through the site.  I kept my old bottle just to compare. The packaging looked right. I&#x27;ve seen it enough now to recognize it. And the bottles were a complete match. The perfume smells exactly the same. I&#x27;m 100% satisfied and will continue to save the 40-50% and buy DG Light Blue through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Perfection!! My favorite scent</li>
            <li> I have gotten a few compliments on this scent.  It took me awhile to get used to.  It&#x27;s clean, not overly floral.  The smell lasts all day on me.  After I wore it a few times, I started to like it better.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> I recommend this excellent product, is very entertaining, and good quality, is easy to use and not failed me since I got it</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  It starts off a bit citrusy and then develops into a gentle, fresh scent.  Some reviews state that the fragrance is a fake, but it smells and appears to be the real thing.  The bottle has a made in Germany sticker and Dolce has a factory there.</li>
            <li> This is exquisite perfume.  My daughters (28 and 32) love it and it smells so nice on them, I decided to give it a try.  Very classy and clean.</li>
            <li> When someone greets you and says, &amp;#34;You smell delicious&amp;#34;, you know you&#x27;re wearing the perfect perfume.  I love the smell of Light Blue.  It&#x27;s light, fresh and just the right touch of fruit/floral.  It smells so good people can&#x27;t help but tell you.</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume in the store and loved it, so when I was able to purchase it online a bit cheaper I was even happier!</li>
            <li> It was for my girlfriend, and she loved it ! Thanks</li>
            <li> This is one of her favorite scents for the summer time.  What can I say... it smells good and she really likes it.  That&#x27;s 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li> i love it and it is obviously the original</li>
            <li> Excelent! I&#x27;m very happy</li>
            <li> Best perfume I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my mom and is very happy with perfume, recommended 100%</li>
            <li> Wonderful/ I girlfriend love it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume. It has a hint of musk and lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I have smelled it on several women and they all smell delicious.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only perfume that I will buy for my wife.</li>
            <li> not too strong not to weak. doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze and last for most of the day. It&#x27;s ok scent.</li>
            <li> Wonderful light and clean scent. I always get compliments on what I am wearing and it can be worn all seasons of the year.</li>
