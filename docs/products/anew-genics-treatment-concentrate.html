            <li>I have used many and am satisfied with Avon anew and Genics.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I run out, I will probably just stick to using the Anew Day Cream until I get more worried about signs of aging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Genics cream for a while and this concentrate is much better because it is like a gel and not cream.</li>
            <li>Been using genics cream ever since it came out and love it.</li>
            <li>Product arrived on time, love the Anew Genics line of products</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I see a lessening of the fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I feel like these products together have evened out my skin tone and helped battle the fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with this product after the first application!</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth.</li>
            <li>and now I am a confirmed believer.  </li>
            <li>greasy ~ goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>Received the concentrate a few days ago and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to buy via Amazon Prime or a seller that has close to a 100% positive feedback score.</li>
            <li>I really think this product does exactly what it claims, my skin feels softer and more even and more youthful texture.</li>
            <li>I think it is a solid value not a miracle cream but a good value for the price</li>
            <li>Gave it five stars based on current happiness with product.</li>
            <li>I use several Anew products, all with good results.</li>
            <li>and I truely think its because I took care of my skin</li>
            <li>~ you can apply your makeup right after&lt;</li>
            <li>Great face lotion for everyday!</li>
            <li>On the first day my forehead lines were reduced by 1/3.</li>
            <li>I am buying my next one here for sure....</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast as well!</li>
            <li>I would totally recommend this to anyone that wants to have fantastic looking skin!</li>
            <li>I even feel like my freckles have faded just a bit which I guess would mean my skin is becoming more even.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my skin after finishing this bottle of product.  </li>
            <li>I have been an avid Clinique and user for the last decade but now that I&#x27;m approaching 40 the signs of aging have become more than Clinique can handle.</li>
            <li>I am nearing 40, but my skin looks pretty young thanks to these products.</li>
            <li>Love using this 2x a day following the ANEW CLINICAL Resurfacing Expert Smoothing Fluid.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend this product to apply under your moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Not sure if this was too old to be effective -- maybe it was sitting in a warehouse somewhere??</li>
            <li>This stuff is bringing back my youthful glow and it already eased the depth of the wrinkles around my mouth and laugh lines.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say conclusively that it has made me look younger, but it has helped with the dry skin issue. :)</li>
            <li>I am new to this from Avon.</li>
            <li>So far, I do like this, but I am concerned about whether or not there is enough product to make the cost worth it.</li>
            <li>Where it takes very little of the Anew Day Cream to moisturize, I find I have to pump out more of this concentrate to cover my face and neck.</li>
            <li>Helps keep my sensitive skin clear.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>When I was near the end of the bottle, I started using twice a day as recommended.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So soft...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always getting complements on my skin and told I look like I&#x27;m in my early 30&amp;#34;s.&lt;br /&gt;try</li>
            <li>so I wanted to try this now that I am getting older and have been moving around between different climates.</li>
            <li>Then once I stopped using it, I noticed I looked a bit run down, not as fresh.  </li>
            <li>Definitely see an improvement in my acne scars and a new found smoothness in my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I notice a major difference in my skin on my face &amp; neck when I use this product &amp; I like the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to say, but I&#x27;m hopeful (and realistic!</li>
            <li>It really help me on some dark spots in face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I Also have sensitive skin that is prone to break out with some of the other Anew products that I have tried</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a pretty hard person to convince and I have no qualms with returning something if I don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li> Have not used it long enough to expect results tho.</li>
            <li> This is the only OTC product that keeps my rosacea under control for minimal redness and flakiness.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this.. and way less expensive than on Avon itself.. goes well with Anew Genics night cream</li>
            <li> I can tell when I don&#x27;t use it, my skin looks dry.</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way too.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This serum works. It works... It works,,...It does. You have to use it to believe it. It smooths out lines on the face. Evens out skin tone, doesn&#x27;t clog the pores.</li>
            <li> My favorite product.  This is the only OTC product that keeps my rosacea under control for minimal redness and flakiness.  And it&#x27;s not made for that purpose.  Go figure!!!</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend this product to apply under your moisturizer. I could tell when I ran out and didnt have another one already on order. I wont let that happen again.</li>
            <li> Love Anew Genics.  Helps keep my sensitive skin clear. I can recommend it based on personal experience.</li>
            <li> I never want to be without this stuff. I can tell when I don&#x27;t use it, my skin looks dry.</li>
            <li> Best stuff i have ever used.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft. I love it.</li>
            <li> The product took over a month to arrive and I only received it after complaining; then it was sent priority mail.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle. I like this product fairly well for the price I think it is a solid value not a miracle cream but a good value for the price</li>
            <li> I really think this product does exactly what it claims, my skin feels softer and more even and more youthful texture.</li>
            <li> I have been an avid Clinique and user for the last decade but now that I&#x27;m approaching 40 the signs of aging have become more than Clinique can handle. 1 use with this cream and I was hooked! My skin is so smooth. On the first day my forehead lines were reduced by 1/3. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and ladies. ... my lines are GONE! I Also have sensitive skin that is prone to break out with some of the other Anew products that I have tried but I have no breakouts with this product. This will be a staple in my bathroom until Avon discontinues it like they do all of their best products.</li>
            <li> I notice a major difference in my skin on my face &amp; neck when I use this product &amp; I like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Gave it five stars based on current happiness with product. Have used it a few times and like the way it absorbs and how my skin feels. Have not used it long enough to expect results tho.</li>
            <li> I use this product because I have really dry skin and don&#x27;t like the look of aging when I see my reflection in the mirror. I can&#x27;t say conclusively that it has made me look younger, but it has helped with the dry skin issue. :)</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Avon skin care.  I wanted to try this one and have not been disappointed.  My skin does feel firmer and I see a lessening of the fine lines.  If you try this I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this awhile ago and used it every now and again. I did not notice anything.  When I was near the end of the bottle, I started using twice a day as recommended.  Still I did not really notice anything.  Then once I stopped using it, I noticed I looked a bit run down, not as fresh.  So I bought a second bottle and now I am a confirmed believer.  I feel like my skin glows now. I even feel like my freckles have faded just a bit which I guess would mean my skin is becoming more even. I have sensitive skin but this has not given me any issues besides making me look better.  I do use an Avon moisturizer after applying the Genics, but I think any moisturizer would be OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a pretty hard person to convince and I have no qualms with returning something if I don&#x27;t like it.  I also don&#x27;t give out great reviews without warrant.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Yes it does work. My skin is smoother in a matter of a week. I use it am and pm. I also yes the cream and the eye cream.</li>
            <li> This is part of Avon&#x27;s very good anti aging products.  I have used many and am satisfied with Avon anew and Genics.&lt;br /&gt;I get comments on how good my  skin looks...of course some of it is heredity.Mom and Grandma  had good skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Avon anti aging line and cleansers to all</li>
            <li> I am new to this from Avon. I am addicted to the Anew Day Cream so I wanted to try this now that I am getting older and have been moving around between different climates. So far, I do like this, but I am concerned about whether or not there is enough product to make the cost worth it. Where it takes very little of the Anew Day Cream to moisturize, I find I have to pump out more of this concentrate to cover my face and neck. To stretch out my use of it, I am now just concentrating on the lines at my mouth and forehead. When I run out, I will probably just stick to using the Anew Day Cream until I get more worried about signs of aging.</li>
            <li> Great product....thank you for speedy delivery, too..</li>
            <li> Love this.. and way less expensive than on Avon itself.. goes well with Anew Genics night cream</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels amazing since I started using this product!  So soft...it has taken at least 5 years off of my age. A little goes a long way too. I would totally recommend this to anyone that wants to have fantastic looking skin!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I&#x27;ve used the Genics cream for a while and this concentrate is much better because it is like a gel and not cream. Just a personal preference I guess. On Avon website I paid $40! I am buying my next one here for sure....</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product after the first application! It is light and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell like some other products I tried! The shipping was fast as well! Just make sure to buy via Amazon Prime or a seller that has close to a 100% positive feedback score.</li>
            <li> avon anew line is the best.</li>
            <li> love love love this skin cream!  when combined with the eye treatment this stuff is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;Non greasy ~ goes on smoothly ~ you can apply your makeup right after&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 46 and I&#x27;m always getting complements on my skin and told I look like I&#x27;m in my early 30&amp;#34;s.&lt;br /&gt;try it ~ you will be hooked!</li>
            <li> Been using genics cream ever since it came out and love it. Received the concentrate a few days ago and am very happy with it. I use several Anew products, all with good results. My skin looks great. People don&#x27;t believe I am 55.</li>
            <li> Feels like silk when you put it on, and it has improved the overall appearance of my skin.  I put this on at night, wait about 10 minutes before I apply my Anew Ultimate 7s Night cream, and then I hit the bed.  I feel like these products together have evened out my skin tone and helped battle the fine lines.  I am nearing 40, but my skin looks pretty young thanks to these products.</li>
            <li> the price was good and i liked the product.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time, love the Anew Genics line of products</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my skin after finishing this bottle of product.  Not sure if this was too old to be effective -- maybe it was sitting in a warehouse somewhere??</li>
            <li> Used Avon for over 20 years but got away from it when i lost my avon rep.Started using box store brands and my skin shows it.I have always looked 10 years younger than my age and I truely think its because I took care of my skin but I owe it to Avon!&lt;br /&gt;I found this product on Amazon and for less,which is always good.It arrived yesterday and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.I already see a difference with 2 applications!!!! Oh my gosh! This stuff is bringing back my youthful glow and it already eased the depth of the wrinkles around my mouth and laugh lines.AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;I will never be with out this concentrate,as  I am using it with the avon anew Ulimate day cream,also purchased from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for making it available and thanks Avon!!!!!! Love it!!!!!</li>

            <li> I love this product. I have used it for a long time. This website was the best price for it.</li>
            <li> Definitely see an improvement in my acne scars and a new found smoothness in my cheeks. good stuff&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve run out of this product and will repurchase!</li>
            <li> I like the way this lotion feels and smells.  Does it work?  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to say, but I&#x27;m hopeful (and realistic! lol)!!</li>
