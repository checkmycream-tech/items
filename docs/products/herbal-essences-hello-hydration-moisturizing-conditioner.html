            <li>Awesome conditioner at a very affordable price.  </li>
            <li>so finding a conditioner that worked for my needs was very, very important to keep breakage at a minimum.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent, an orchid vanilla.</li>

            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Great for de-tangling, gives great slip and I love the smell and the thick creamy consistency of it.</li>
            <li>Herbal Essences has several great products, and I think this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It was fine.</li>
            <li>Of course, the slip equals fine detangling agent and the scent. . .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure if you read the reviews the users mostly use this conditioner in conjunction with something else.</li>
            <li>During the process of this on your hair its fine</li>
            <li>and it has so much slip that you must make sure you&#x27;ve got one of those bath mats with grip in your bathtub!  </li>
            <li>I have recently signed up to get this item through the Subscribe and Save program - LOVE LOVE LOVE it!</li>
            <li>The name is completely accurate when it says &amp;#34;hydration&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, available everywhere and works like a dream.  </li>
            <li>lovely product because it&#x27;s cheap and useful.</li>
            <li>but of all the cone free conditions I tried Hello hydration has been much better - People its worth a try</li>
            <li>At first use I fell in love with this conditioner</li>
            <li>and wow i am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I wish they still made the original formula that came out in 1972.</li>
            <li>Daughter liked it, but we didn&#x27;t love it, expected it to be more hydrating and make hair softer and silkier</li>
            <li>It smells great, makes my hair smooth, keeps my very long hair from getting tangled, and is just an overall good conditioner.</li>
            <li>After trying it for myself probably the only good thing i can say about it is the smell.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend trying it out for anyone that&#x27;s looking for a good conditioner.</li>
            <li>I needed a shampoo and conditioner that was more moisturizing, so I decided to try this since I&#x27;ve alway liked Herbal Essences, since way back in the day when it first came out.</li>
            <li>Really good on dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and it leave my hair very soft and well conditioned.</li>
            <li>I added this to my cowashes as a last rinse because it has amazing slip.  </li>
            <li>This is my top fav condition for my natural 4a hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the rich, creamy consistency</li>
            <li>Yes, you read right as if I had used shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best conditioner for African American women that are natural!  </li>
            <li>As soon as I put it on it makes my hair super smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I am african american and this product works great on me.  </li>
            <li>this will totally be a stable 4 me :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how exactly to describe it, but let&#x27;s just say that in a given week, 3-7 women will stop me on the street to ask me about my hair regimen.  </li>
            <li>Will buy more at a later time.</li>
            <li>(this is an independent review, nobody told me or paid me to say this) : )</li>
            <li>I love it and it will now be my regular.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>A couple of months after using it I experienced massive hair shedding, which was not normal.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of my first purchase being the large bottle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d seen other posts where people said it made their hair come out but compared to the great reviews, it just didn&#x27;t seem likely that it&#x27;d make my hair come out.  </li>
            <li>My hair was super soft and manageabe.</li>
            <li>Large clumps of my hair started coming out in the shower after using this product.</li>
            <li>It is very thick and smells great.</li>
            <li>Didnt even really nheed to be detangled.</li>
            <li>It is really hydrating for my hair.</li>
            <li>So I bought a bottle and the price was reasonable for the size.</li>
            <li>Really creamy and moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li>I would recommend herbal essence to any one it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>this product is also available in your local grocery or pharmacy.</li>
            <li>Generally mix it with olive and coconut oil for DCs or more recently for Pre-poos.</li>
            <li>Always leaves my hair soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>so I could set it in a high bun.  </li>
            <li>I just wish it smelled a little better (hints the 4 stars)</li>
            <li>and I must say this have left my hair feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I prefer this to the Tresemme Natural conditioner, because its thicker thus I don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
            <li>but i wanted to try something new</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>and I have tried so many conditioner and shampoo over the past 3 years</li>
            <li>For my natural hair this is the only thing that I can use to detangle with because my hair is really thick and this has great slip and actually leaves my hair feeling moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want to try this product I&#x27;d say be smart and go to your local store and buy the travel size and not a bottle.</li>
            <li>I purchased this at the recommendation of a natural hair blogger that I follow.</li>
            <li>I stopped straighten my hair for a bit and went to weave braids and natural styles to give it a break.</li>
            <li>, i have been searching for a conditioner for over 6 months that works with my natural 3c neck length hair</li>
            <li>i have natural 4b/4c hair and it feels so</li>
            <li>i had to moisturize 3 times a day just to keep it somewhat soft</li>
            <li>No heavy or greasy hair.</li>
            <li>I am natural and have 4a hair</li>
            <li>Leaves my 4c hair really soft.</li>
            <li>I have used conditioners that I wish I would have looked at the name because they made my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>I have 4C natural hair</li>
            <li>The ONLY thing new was the HH!  </li>
            <li>I just recently jumped on the Subscribe &amp; Save bandwagon and I personally think it is worth it for items that you know you&#x27;re going to need on a regular basis.   </li>
            <li>When I switched back to my old conditioner, I no longer had this problem.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair and my daughter is mixed and I use this on both of our hair.</li>
            <li>I have thick, curly, and frizzy hair and there are very few products that are good to my hair.</li>
            <li>the only new thing that I had added recently was this conditioner.</li>
            <li>While it is great for detangling (the silicones gives the slip) it can turn out badly because of the same thing - the silicones.</li>
            <li>wow, my fingers just passes through my hair with such ease, I will totally recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Friends,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long curly natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I have dry, curly hair (a blond afro no less!)</li>

            <li> I have thick african american curly hair this leaves my curls soft and hydrated !!</li>
            <li> I am just sad that it is no longer available with Amazon Prime Subscription.</li>
            <li> Other than that, definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> It wasnt until I went back and read some other reviews that mentioned signifigant hair loss that I realized HH was the culprit.</li>
            <li> I use it to co wash only or mixed with a little bit of water in spray bottle for day to day maintenance.</li>
            <li> I prefer Herbal Essences above any other shampoo or conditioner out there on the market!</li>
            <li> Other conditioners require you to use so much if you want it to actually work, but Herbal Essences Conditioners are so thick I find myself using much less than cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman with shoulder length very thick and coarse natural hair that I usually wear striaght via flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have thin, dry, brittle hair and after people recommending this product so much I decided to try it out.</li>

            <li> My hair is healty (except the visible thinging around the nape due to the shedding).</li>

            <li> I guess it is moisturizing, but it also weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li> , I am not sure if the other ingredients nils it out</li>
            <li> However, I think it could be improved by making the hair a little softer.</li>
            <li> It is with a heavy heart that I post this review.</li>
            <li> I buy this stuff in bulk, use it everyday, and I have no complaints.  </li>
            <li> For a while, I used a shampoo that really dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> and it dried my hair out to the point</li>
            <li> I cowash my relaxed hair everyday.  </li>
            <li> I had some serious breakages due to silicone overload.</li>
            <li> i usually use the Moroccan oil by organix</li>
            <li> I had started leaving conditioner in my hair, usually my Aussie Moist, but this time I decided to use HH.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, the conditioner I received is literally a solid similar to silly putty.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m using it until it&#x27;s done then no more.</li>
            <li> This does have dimethicone in it which I&#x27;ve read can build up on hair and cause breakage, so I shampoo her hair at least once every 2 weeks to strip those buildups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I keep at least 3 bottles at all times.  </li>
            <li> A subtle scent that lingers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the base I use for my deep conditioning mix.</li>
            <li> I also use this as the base for my deep conditioning sometimes.</li>
            <li> so I know it&#x27;s not my hair being unhealthy.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> After drying my hair it was so difficult for me to run a comb through it!  </li>
            <li> It worked beutifully until my hair started falling out from it :(.</li>
            <li> y disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate that I can never use the conditioner again.</li>
            <li> and i absolutely hate it.</li>
            <li> i might load my hair up with olive oil and castor oil and rewash my hair because i hate the feeling</li>
            <li> but I began to get an awful case of dandruff.</li>

            <li> GREAT PRODUCT AT A GREAT PRICE!!!</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, and frizzy hair and there are very few products that are good to my hair. This is one of them! The smell is light and the moisture that it gives your hair is wonderful.  The only thing is that you have to switch between this conditioner and maybe another one because your hair can get \\&quot;too used\\&quot; to it and then cause it to be dull. Other than that, definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> I have thick african american curly hair this leaves my curls soft and hydrated !!&lt;br /&gt;  this will totally be a stable 4 me :)</li>
            <li> Sigh...It is with a heavy heart that I post this review. I am an African American woman with shoulder length very thick and coarse natural hair that I usually wear striaght via flat iron. I purchased this at the recommendation of a natural hair blogger that I follow. At first use I fell in love with this conditioner My hair was super soft and manageabe. Coming through it was a joy. Didnt even really nheed to be detangled. It was awesome. A couple of months after using it I experienced massive hair shedding, which was not normal. I don;t shed like that. I never thought to blame the Hello Hydration. I thought it was diet or stress. I stopped straighten my hair for a bit and went to weave braids and natural styles to give it a break. When I started straightnening again I tried out a different shampoo and conditioner, still not knowing what had caused my hair to fall out. It was fine. My hair is healty (except the visible thinging around the nape due to the shedding). I recently went back to the Hello Hydration conditioner and low and behold a couple of weeks later my hair was shedding agian. It wasnt until I went back and read some other reviews that mentioned signifigant hair loss that I realized HH was the culprit. I hate that I can never use the conditioner again. It worked beutifully until my hair started falling out from it :(.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite conditioners.  It&#x27;s great for co-washing and has excellent slip.  I love the smell and it leave my hair very soft and well conditioned.</li>
            <li> Large clumps of my hair started coming out in the shower after using this product. Not only that, but I began to get an awful case of dandruff. When I switched back to my old conditioner, I no longer had this problem. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT! IT WILL RUIN YOUR HAIR!</li>
            <li> now we are all co-washing instead of using shampoo.  I also shave with it and it might work well as a floor wax. lovely product because it&#x27;s cheap and useful.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is OMG, i have been searching for a conditioner for over 6 months that works with my natural 3c neck length hair and I have to say I found it, this is the best I have experienced so far, the slip is wow, my fingers just passes through my hair with such ease, I will totally recommend it.  CG talks about staying away from cones etc, but I got to say this condition has Dimethicone, I am not sure if the other ingredients nils it out but of all the cone free conditions I tried Hello hydration has been much better - People its worth a try</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! It&#x27;s the base I use for my deep conditioning mix. It leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> Friends,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long curly natural hair.  I don&#x27;t know how exactly to describe it, but let&#x27;s just say that in a given week, 3-7 women will stop me on the street to ask me about my hair regimen.  Well, I tell them this, I leave herbal essences, Hello Hydration Conditioner in my hair after I shower, then I blow dry it, upside down, with two hair dryers. And it looks perfect almost all of the time.  I buy this stuff in bulk, use it everyday, and I have no complaints.  It smells great.  Always leaves my hair soft and pretty.</li>
            <li> so i read the reviews and tried this today and i absolutely hate it. my hair feels like straw...i usually use the Moroccan oil by organix but i wanted to try something new and this is awful. i have natural 4b/4c hair and it feels so YUCK... i might load my hair up with olive oil and castor oil and rewash my hair because i hate the feeling</li>
            <li> I just recently jumped on the Subscribe &amp; Save bandwagon and I personally think it is worth it for items that you know you&#x27;re going to need on a regular basis.   Other conditioners require you to use so much if you want it to actually work, but Herbal Essences Conditioners are so thick I find myself using much less than cheaper alternatives. Must buy for me.</li>
            <li> Really good on dry hair.  I use this as a conditioner and sometimes as a co-wash.  It is very thick and smells great.</li>
            <li> For a while, I used a shampoo that really dried out my hair. I was looking for something that will moisturize it back to the way it was. That was when I found this. It is really hydrating for my hair. I already began to notice the changes in about 2 or 3 days. I have loved it ever since! This is a must.  Of course this might  not be the best hydration/moisturizing shampoo or conditioner out there, but it is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have thin, dry, brittle hair and after people recommending this product so much I decided to try it out. So I bought a bottle and the price was reasonable for the size. After trying it for myself probably the only good thing i can say about it is the smell. After drying my hair it was so difficult for me to run a comb through it!  I probably will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> The conditioner arrived on time and packaged very nicely. The product is what it shows in the picture.  Will buy more at a later time.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!! This product is awesome! I just did the aphogee protein treatment on my hair and it dried my hair out to the point were i had to moisturize 3 times a day just to keep it somewhat soft i heard about this product i used it last night for a cowash and made a moistureizer with it and wow i am very pleased. My hair feels awesome i have a new love!!</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences&#x27;s Hello Hydration is great for my hair!  I prefer Herbal Essences above any other shampoo or conditioner out there on the market!</li>
            <li> Hello Hydration Moisturizing Conditioner lives up to its name.  It is moisturizing!  I really like the rich, creamy consistency and it has so much slip that you must make sure you&#x27;ve got one of those bath mats with grip in your bathtub!  Of course, the slip equals fine detangling agent and the scent. . . this is conditioner candy for the hair.  I love the scent, an orchid vanilla. A subtle scent that lingers. I would purchase it for the scent alone.  Luckily, it&#x27;s one of the best conditioners in the drugsstore world.  It&#x27;s cheap, available everywhere and works like a dream.  My hair feels great when I use this and I also use it as a leave-in.  No heavy or greasy hair. All in all, Hello Hydration is quite a value.</li>
            <li> As soon as I put it on it makes my hair super smooth and soft. I also use it as a leave in conditioner. I am natural and have 4a hair and i absolutely love this product. and its cheap! (this is an independent review, nobody told me or paid me to say this) : )</li>
            <li> i absolutly love this moisturizing conditioner.  I am african american and this product works great on me.  i also use this product at my salon love it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the bomb. I hope that they do not change the ingredients in it. I would be reall y disappointed. I have natural hair and my daughter is mixed and I use this on both of our hair. For my natural hair this is the only thing that I can use to detangle with because my hair is really thick and this has great slip and actually leaves my hair feeling moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my mixed daughter with curly hair this is also a life saver. I use it to co wash only or mixed with a little bit of water in spray bottle for day to day maintenance. This does have dimethicone in it which I&#x27;ve read can build up on hair and cause breakage, so I shampoo her hair at least once every 2 weeks to strip those buildups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/27/13 This is an update: This conditioner has silicones in it. It would be prudent to use a purifying shampoo every other week to strip your hair of the cones to avoid breakage. I am speaking from experience. I had some serious breakages due to silicone overload. I knew the reason for breakage because I keep a log on my hair regimen and the only new thing that I had added recently was this conditioner. While it is great for detangling (the silicones gives the slip) it can turn out badly because of the same thing - the silicones.</li>
            <li> I needed a shampoo and conditioner that was more moisturizing, so I decided to try this since I&#x27;ve alway liked Herbal Essences, since way back in the day when it first came out. This one, however, doesn&#x27;t get a thumbs up. I guess it is moisturizing, but it also weighs my hair down. In addition, I feel like I need to shampoo my hair every day because it feels sort of oily by the second day. I wish they still made the original formula that came out in 1972.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is awesome. Leaves your hair shiny and silky. I love it and it will now be my regular.</li>
            <li> Really creamy and moisturizing conditioner. Leaves my 4c hair really soft. I also use this as the base for my deep conditioning sometimes. I just wish it smelled a little better (hints the 4 stars) but in all really good conditioner. I would definitely recommend trying it out for anyone that&#x27;s looking for a good conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this conditioner.  It does well to keep my hair looking and smelling great.  I have recently signed up to get this item through the Subscribe and Save program - LOVE LOVE LOVE it!</li>
            <li> This is my top fav condition for my natural 4a hair. I have been using it for over 2 years and still loving it.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences has several great products, and I think this is my favorite. It smells great, makes my hair smooth, keeps my very long hair from getting tangled, and is just an overall good conditioner. However, I think it could be improved by making the hair a little softer. I have used conditioners that I wish I would have looked at the name because they made my hair so soft. But for the price, I think it&#x27;s an awesome conditioner!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best conditioner for African American women that are natural!  The name is completely accurate when it says &amp;#34;hydration&amp;#34;.  I use this conditioner to deep condition and cowash my hair.  I also use it with my daughter&#x27;s relaxed hair.  Awesome conditioner at a very affordable price.  I keep at least 3 bottles at all times.  I am just sad that it is no longer available with Amazon Prime Subscription.</li>
            <li> I cowash my relaxed hair everyday.  I added this to my cowashes as a last rinse because it has amazing slip.  I had started leaving conditioner in my hair, usually my Aussie Moist, but this time I decided to use HH.  Later that day, I decided to rinse my hair so I could set it in a high bun.  I&#x27;m leaning over the tub with my hair in the shower and I&#x27;m combing my hair and just seeing strands and strands and then friggin CLUMPS of hair hit the bottom of tub!  The ONLY thing new was the HH!  I&#x27;d seen other posts where people said it made their hair come out but compared to the great reviews, it just didn&#x27;t seem likely that it&#x27;d make my hair come out.  Boy was I wrong.  You can try it if you want to, but be warned!</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d save money and time by buying this off amazon instead of the store. I&#x27;ve never had an issue with this product before. Sadly, the conditioner I received is literally a solid similar to silly putty.</li>
            <li> The smell is heavenly! I use this product to revive my dead/dying extensions and it&#x27;s just superb for my hair(I&#x27;m Nigerian)</li>
            <li> This product is excellent, it arrived fast and is great for your hair. I would recommend herbal essence to any one it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure if you read the reviews the users mostly use this conditioner in conjunction with something else. I&#x27;ve used this on it&#x27;s on and it leaves my hair feeling stripped. Yes, you read right as if I had used shampoo. During the process of this on your hair its fine but what&#x27;s the point of having a conditioner that claims moisture if when you rinse it off your hair feels like straw. I made the mistake of my first purchase being the large bottle and I&#x27;m using it until it&#x27;s done then no more. I have very healthy  curly hair and I use coconut oil to seal the moisture to my hair shaft so I know it&#x27;s not my hair being unhealthy. If you want to try this product I&#x27;d say be smart and go to your local store and buy the travel size and not a bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is but this one just &amp;#34;does it&amp;#34; for me in the scent department. It&#x27;s yummy! Also, my hair drinks it up like mothers milk. I have dry, curly hair (a blond afro no less!) so finding a conditioner that worked for my needs was very, very important to keep breakage at a minimum. This brand has always worked for me- my colorist/stylist is always remarking on how healthy my hair is and how I must use such expensive products on it. NOPE! My only tricks: I never use shampoo, I don&#x27;t blow dry or flat iron and I don&#x27;t use tons of styling products.</li>
            <li> Great for de-tangling, gives great slip and I love the smell and the thick creamy consistency of it. I prefer this to the Tresemme Natural conditioner, because its thicker thus I don&#x27;t have to use as much. Generally mix it with olive and coconut oil for DCs or more recently for Pre-poos. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have 4C natural hair and I have tried so many conditioner and shampoo over the past 3 years and I must say this have left my hair feeling soft and clean. I did not lose a lot of hair during the detangle process and I am talking about after not shampooing in 2 weeks. I will definitely invest again this product for my conditioner and shampoo. :)º&lt;br /&gt;P.S this product is also available in your local grocery or pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Daughter liked it, but we didn&#x27;t love it, expected it to be more hydrating and make hair softer and silkier</li>
