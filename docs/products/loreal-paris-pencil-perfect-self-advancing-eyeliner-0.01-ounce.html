            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The color is nice, and it goes on nicely, but no my fav.</li>
            <li>Creamy, easily glides on, and does not need sharpening!</li>
            <li>It also glides on very smoothly ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>The eyeliner itself is fine, goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product,  it lasts forever</li>
            <li>Ok-</li>
            <li>It glides on and stays put all day, and it doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water like many others like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;Oreal products before and wasn&#x27;t satisfied with their eyeliners until I got this one.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best eyeliners I&#x27;ve ever used and it shipped pretty fast.</li>
            <li>It looks good when first applied, but within minutes it is gone from the crease on my outer eye.</li>
            <li>You will have a guarantee that it will work, plus you will have it right away instead of waiting a damn week!!</li>
            <li>I am using it and it really is easy, clean, and gives me the result I was hoping to buy it, I recommend it!</li>
            <li>Well, it is a good purchase, but I don&#x27;t think it fit me very well, it always soakage.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s easy to remove.</li>
            <li>and then you can easily take off then</li>
            <li>Easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>It goes on great and is nice and dark.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you get the right color.</li>
            <li>Anyways, the point of the eyeliner was somehow smudged when I gently opened it, and most importantly..</li>
            <li>Somthing about about not being able to readily find this color in stores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not awful, but you can get much better for the same price, and I suggest you do.</li>
            <li>Ran out too quickly.</li>
            <li>My new favorite eyeliner, I&#x27;ve had issues with others making my eyes water.</li>
            <li>Nice deep color</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re not looking for something that&#x27;s long-lasting/all day, this is all right.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner pencil is soft enough to spread easily and for the most part, stays in place.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the eyeliner that didn&#x27;t even work!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just OK since it can&#x27;t be moved back once is moved out!</li>
            <li>Should of known better, have been using almay for years but thought I&#x27;d try something different.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the blackest black I own.</li>
            <li>Fine for just daily use.</li>
            <li>but it actually goes on easy which is more than I can say about other brands.</li>
            <li>Much appreciated.</li>
            <li>I think there&#x27;s not that much in there</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s delivered fast</li>
            <li>I really like how it it is to apply.</li>
            <li>This one is like butter and very intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it on the *inside* of my eye and it wears off an 1 hour 30 mins to 2 hours later, and I have to re-apply and use lotion to clean the smudge underneath and around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Better then any other eye liner or brands !</li>
            <li>I love the harshness of the black color that this eyeliner gives me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of COLOR, it is an incredibly dark black and goes on SO SMOOTHLY, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Finished after 3 application - there was no lead inside at all - just the little that you can see on top.</li>
            <li>the cap is a little cheap</li>
            <li>Which is the whole point, actually spinning it to use.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of the pencils I had when I was young.  </li>
            <li>It comes in many colors although only a few of them are offered on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy dont have to push as hard as with normal pencils</li>
            <li>The color is a true black.</li>
            <li>I also could have shipped it back out for a refund, but yet again, more money wasted shipping it back out.  </li>

            <li> Personally, it doesn&#x27;t stay on as long as I would like, because otherwise it would be a 10/5</li>
            <li> I easily could have went down the street to get this eyeliner, BUT NO, I tried saving a few bucks, when I actually wasted that $7..</li>
            <li> I sometimes have to touch it up after a long day.</li>
            <li> When I look down or close my eyes, there is a straight line missing across the tail I draw.</li>
            <li> Decent staying power, but not amazing.</li>
            <li> Hard and cracks seNing back.</li>
            <li> I should have gotten a medium or dark brown.</li>
            <li> I warn you all, just go to the store and spend the extra few bucks!!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like how it leaves the black smear under my eyes,</li>
            <li> This black seems to be deeper.</li>
            <li> I keep looking for an eye pencil that would not flake after half an hour and cover my face with black spots.</li>
            <li> Makes my eyes pop and also the black is very dark which is a plus</li>
            <li> Bought this for the little woman</li>
            <li> I have to touch up at lunch time everyday</li>
            <li> Would return but don&#x27;t feel like going through the trouble.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t like to go back down once twisted up.</li>
            <li> Down side is the cap was broken beyond use within three days of purchase just from being inside a makeup bag.</li>
            <li> The worst eyeliner I have ever purchased and it was one of the most expensive.</li>
            <li> Other eyeliners are very hard and are difficult to put on and hurt my eyes trying to put it on.</li>
            <li> Product was never dropped or roughly handled, so this was a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> and I hate it!</li>
            <li> The worst liner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
            <li> an awful look.</li>
            <li> The terrible part is that I had one, but I forgot which company I got it from.</li>
            <li> and I also got another one from the Mall, and both of them are terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I absolutely love this product,  it lasts forever and it&#x27;s the blackest black I own.</li>
            <li> I love the harshness of the black color that this eyeliner gives me. But I do have nautrally oily skin and it rubs off onto my eyelid about halfway through my workday and I hate it! I have to touch up at lunch time everyday and it&#x27;s a pain.</li>
            <li> Ok- the cap is a little cheap but it does the trick and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Hey! Thanks for the eyeliner that didn&#x27;t even work! Much appreciated. Not.  I easily could have went down the street to get this eyeliner, BUT NO, I tried saving a few bucks, when I actually wasted that $7..I also could have shipped it back out for a refund, but yet again, more money wasted shipping it back out.  Anyways, the point of the eyeliner was somehow smudged when I gently opened it, and most importantly.. IT WOULDN&#x27;T SPIN UP. Which is the whole point, actually spinning it to use.  I warn you all, just go to the store and spend the extra few bucks!! You will have a guarantee that it will work, plus you will have it right away instead of waiting a damn week!!</li>
            <li> This mascara smears all over immodestly upon application. The worst liner I have ever used. Threw it away after two uses because it was so embarrassing to have smudge marks all over. Terrible product.</li>
            <li> Ehh. Even when set with eyeshadow it tends to run. It doesn&#x27;t like to go back down once twisted up. It&#x27;s not awful, but you can get much better for the same price, and I suggest you do. Try Revlon Colorstay if you want a mechanical pencil, or Prestige if you want a sharpenable one.</li>
            <li> Loved it !!!!! Better then any other eye liner or brands !</li>
            <li> It looks good when first applied, but within minutes it is gone from the crease on my outer eye. When I look down or close my eyes, there is a straight line missing across the tail I draw. If I&#x27;m going anywhere after work, I have to reapply to cover the line or put on a liquid liner over it.</li>
            <li> Ran out too quickly. I think there&#x27;s not that much in there</li>
            <li> I have been using this liner for years and I love it! Creamy, easily glides on, and does not need sharpening!</li>
            <li> It is excellent! I am using it and it really is easy, clean, and gives me the result I was hoping to buy it, I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Perfect eyeliner! Lasts all day.  Great Buy!</li>
            <li> I the product, L&#x27;Oreal pencil and texture but I don&#x27;t like how it leaves the black smear under my eyes, an awful look.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only eyeliners I have found that will actually stay on my lower eyelid.  It doesn&#x27;t stay all day but it actually goes on easy which is more than I can say about other brands.</li>
            <li> Nice deep color and I must have waterproof!</li>
            <li> Its a really good eye pencil.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy dont have to push as hard as with normal pencils</li>
            <li> Hard and cracks seNing back.</li>
            <li> Finished after 3 application - there was no lead inside at all - just the little that you can see on top.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner pencil is soft enough to spread easily and for the most part, stays in place. It comes in many colors although only a few of them are offered on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s delivered fast but it&#x27;s just OK since it can&#x27;t be moved back once is moved out! For this reason I just wasted an entire eyeliner because I moved it out too much</li>
            <li> The eyeliner itself is fine, goes on nicely. Decent staying power, but not amazing. Fine for just daily use. Down side is the cap was broken beyond use within three days of purchase just from being inside a makeup bag. Product was never dropped or roughly handled, so this was a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of the pencils I had when I was young.  I wish they had the mascara in a compact with a brush, it was so much&lt;br /&gt;easier to use.</li>
            <li> Well, it is a good purchase, but I don&#x27;t think it fit me very well, it always soakage. But it&#x27;s easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I really like how it it is to apply. Just make sure you get the right color. I should have gotten a medium or dark brown. This black seems to be deeper.</li>
            <li> Love it! Makes my eyes pop and also the black is very dark which is a plus.. It also glides on very smoothly ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this product in any of my local stores anymore so I get it here. It glides on and stays put all day, and it doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water like many others like it.</li>
            <li> Advertised as smudge proof, not even close.  The worst eyeliner I have ever purchased and it was one of the most expensive.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it, smears to easily, constantly wiping my eyes. Would return but don&#x27;t feel like going through the trouble.  Should of known better, have been using almay for years but thought I&#x27;d try something different.</li>
            <li> It is not smudge-proof and I find it migrates to places where I don&#x27;t want it.  The color is nice, and it goes on nicely, but no my fav.</li>
            <li> My new favorite eyeliner, I&#x27;ve had issues with others making my eyes water. This one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I give it 3 stars SOLELY because it&#x27;s NOT &amp;#34;water/run-proof&amp;#34; and smudges in embarrassing proportions. I use it on the *inside* of my eye and it wears off an 1 hour 30 mins to 2 hours later, and I have to re-apply and use lotion to clean the smudge underneath and around my eyes. Personally, it doesn&#x27;t stay on as long as I would like, because otherwise it would be a 10/5 perfect eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of COLOR, it is an incredibly dark black and goes on SO SMOOTHLY, it&#x27;s great. Other eyeliners are very hard and are difficult to put on and hurt my eyes trying to put it on. This one is like butter and very intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not looking for something that&#x27;s long-lasting/all day, this is all right. If you only want eyeliner for a couple of hours or an interview or something and then you can easily take off then this is the one.</li>
            <li> I have no problem with this product but I probably would go for something cheaper next time.</li>
            <li> I keep looking for an eye pencil that would not flake after half an hour and cover my face with black spots. The terrible part is that I had one, but I forgot which company I got it from. I had it for a while, and I just threw it away and then I got this one and I also got another one from the Mall, and both of them are terrible. I just returned the one from the mall... I will probably return this one also...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to return this item.</li>
            <li> So pigmented, you don&#x27;t have to reapply throughout the day either. This is one of the best eyeliners I&#x27;ve ever used and it shipped pretty fast.</li>
            <li> The colour is great, but I dont understand why it doesn&#x27;t twist??????</li>
            <li> The color is a true black. On me, the eyeliner tends to smudge on lower lid. I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the little woman so I&#x27;m not the actual user. She said she likes it because it goes on and lasts. Somthing about about not being able to readily find this color in stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;Oreal products before and wasn&#x27;t satisfied with their eyeliners until I got this one. It goes on great and is nice and dark. Easy to wash off. I sometimes have to touch it up after a long day.</li>
