            <li> This in no way smells anything close to Invictus. It smells cheap and the package came to me smelling like stale cigarettes. This cologne smells awful, seriously no one should buy this.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last.  Smell Good though.</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how close to the real thing this knock off smells! It is very difficult to distinguish genuine from knock off by smell alone. Now lasting time is another story. But that is to be expected.</li>
