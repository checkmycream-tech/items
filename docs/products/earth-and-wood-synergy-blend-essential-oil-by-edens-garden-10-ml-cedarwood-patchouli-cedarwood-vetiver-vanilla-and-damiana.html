            <li>Smells wonderful and as always shipping is very fast.</li>
            <li>Just lovely!</li>
            <li>I was impressed at the fast shipping!</li>
            <li>My husband and I both love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s concentration adds nicely to a carrier oil for long-lasting uses.</li>
            <li>smells like tree sap or some kind of tree my husband works around trees all day</li>
            <li>you want an honest description of it&#x27;s smell, it smells like sawdust and dirt.  </li>
            <li>Great with about four 1.5 ml droppers full added of this blend of oils.  </li>
            <li>i love this smell.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>This was a lovely earthy scent.</li>
            <li>It would be interesting to use it in an atomizer for an air freshener.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more wasteful as you experiment..</li>
            <li>Eden&#x27;s Garden, I will totally delete this review if you have some awesome suggestions on what to do with this baffling blend!</li>
            <li>Interesting fragrance...</li>
            <li>love it...</li>
            <li>Intend to buy more.</li>
            <li>This one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Very rich.</li>
            <li>Eden&#x27;s Garden makes the most incredible essential oil blends.  </li>
            <li>Great masculine scent!</li>
            <li>could easily add an oil to it though.</li>
            <li>Comforting and strong</li>
            <li>We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>but you can fine tune a scent when you blend it yourself.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
            <li>We use it in an oil warmer and it fills our whole house with a warm, earthy scent.</li>
            <li>Price was cheap so is &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless I really enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li>This has a very earthy patchouli scent that I love.</li>
            <li>That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li>smells like a trombone musical cleaner.the kind to clean brass instruments..</li>
            <li>I love eden&#x27;s garden,this is very masculine and woody, not to my liking</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t exactly what i expected but still a very nice smell.</li>
            <li>In general, with my growing knowledge of oils, making my own blends seems to be the better route... especially when creating a blend for aroma.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong but very masculine.</li>
            <li>Made homemade deodorant with my daughter, works great, wish there was less patchouli though, kind of overpowers the other scents.</li>
            <li>Love most Edens Garden blends however this one just did not seem to work to wear or diffuse, just was not a fit for us.</li>
            <li>but i cant remember what it was but its not very pleasant unless thats what ur going for then yea great oil.</li>
            <li>I love the deep woodsy scent.</li>
            <li>exactly what I thought it would be like.</li>
            <li>but this one isn&#x27;t too hot</li>
            <li>but when looking for a scent to compliment my favorite male... &#x27;needs a shower&#x27;</li>
            <li>and he said it smelled like a certain tree</li>
            <li>Would certainly purchase this item again.</li>
            <li>I would readily flip out over purely for it&#x27;s smell... and that&#x27;s why I bought it... to add scent to my husbands PC products.  </li>
            <li>So really, I can&#x27;t complain that it doesn&#x27;t smell like the label...</li>
            <li>Very sensual aroma.</li>
            <li>and it is very grounding.</li>
            <li>everyone else seems to really like it, too.</li>
            <li>My favorite essential oil so far.</li>
            <li>Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Heavy on the patchouli which is fine with me.</li>
            <li>masculine.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this essential oil.  </li>
            <li>It has a masculine smell</li>
            <li>I use it frequently</li>
            <li>Perfect, used for a natural insect repellent</li>
            <li>I was expecting thing something a little less intense and a little more earthy.</li>

            <li> I use this as a perfume. I love the deep woodsy scent. Just lovely!</li>
            <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
            <li> i love this smell. it is earthy and spa like without the headache. masculine. mixes well with lavender.</li>

            <li> Great blend.  Heavy on the patchouli which is fine with me.</li>
            <li> Smells earthy and wonderful. Like a stroll through the forest after a rain.....LOVE IT</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m contacting EG about this one.  Maybe some further suggestions on its use.

            <li> They should have just called this patchouli. It smells only like patchouli to me... I was expecting thing something a little less intense and a little more earthy.</li>
            <li> The Product has a complex variety of fragrances they all can be notice when you use it. And it lasts for a while I would purchase this again</li>
            <li> Thought I ordered Sandalwood. Does not smell like Sandalwood.... Smells like &amp;#34;Dirt!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Comforting and strong</li>
            <li> My favorite essential oil so far. Very rich. I was impressed at the fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Great to add to neutrogena sesame scented oil. Great with about four 1.5 ml droppers full added of this blend of oils.  Need to wait a day for smell to develop.  Very sensual aroma.</li>
            <li> Awful ! Rubbing alcohol? I learned a valuable lesson. Price was cheap so is &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> good service.  smellsgood</li>
            <li> Wonderful smelling!  So earthy!</li>

            <li> This has a very earthy patchouli scent that I love. Very happy with all of my oils from Edens Garden.</li>
            <li> Not fond of the smell.</li>
            <li> This smells heavenly........subtle woodsy, earthy, hippie vibe....love it...</li>
            <li> This a little different than what I has expected.  Nevertheless I really enjoy this product.  Intend to buy more.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this essential oil.  It has a masculine smell and I use it in homemade pre-shave oil, shaving cream, and after shave.</li>
            <li> great scent! Leaves a wonderful after smell also. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product. Not too strong but very masculine. Receive a lot of compliments. Would certainly purchase this item again.A little goes a long way.</li>

            <li> smells great. isn&#x27;t exactly what i expected but still a very nice smell. everyone else seems to really like it, too. was wanting a touch extra of that deeper scent that was in my mind. could easily add an oil to it though.</li>
