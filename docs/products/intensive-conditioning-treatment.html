            <li>it is really cool!</li>
            <li>I have fine 4a/b hair</li>
            <li>and I found this product to be a huge dissapointment.</li>
            <li>The seller claims free shipping.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m comfortable with that)</li>
            <li>I used this product after the  sulfate free shampoo</li>
            <li>Worth trying!</li>
            <li>Wow amazing</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft, bouncy and moisturized and still smell great.</li>
            <li>so worth it.</li>
            <li>and it left my hair kind of sticky and coated.</li>
            <li>This took every drop of moisture right out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>You can find this conditioner very easily at your local stores.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft and extremely easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>I like this treatment very much.</li>
            <li>The only reason why I didnt give this one star is because I love the way this smells.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using the Argan oil Intensive Conditioning Treatment</li>
            <li>I love just the same get from somewhere else.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying this conditioner</li>
            <li>idea.&lt;br /&gt;I left it in my hair for more than an hour, and while the smell at first didn&#x27;t really bother me, as time passed</li>
            <li>and it was very stringy.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing detangles well.</li>
            <li>It deranged my hair instantly and was so silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>haha)</li>
            <li>I usually apply the conditioner after a fresh wash, cover my head with a shower cap and a towel for a couple of hours, and let body heat work its magic, and voila! - silky, soft tresses!</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny, and has a better look after styling, than prior to using this product.</li>
            <li>I use it as a deep conditioning treatment once or twice a week, and when I rinse it out the tangles in my new growth seem to just melt away and my hair feels incredibly soft and strong, no breakage whatsoever.</li>
            <li>My hair is relaxed, short and it leaves it silky, shiny and looks way better when I blow dry.</li>
            <li>As soon as I rinsed the conditioner out of my locs and the smell went away, my headache largely cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, my hair is pretty soft, that&#x27;s the only reason I&#x27;m giving it three stars.</li>
            <li>However, I feel as though the oil to moisturizer ratio is a bit much (a lot more oil than moisture) if you do not have thick hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is VERY dry and thick and this intensive conditioner penatrates my hair and keeps it moisturized, soft, and easy to manage, when used with a hooded dryer it works even better, this packet lasts up to 3-4 uses I have shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product as a deep conditioner, but my other favorites are:   </li>
            <li>, my advice for someone thinking about trying this product is to cup it open and smell it first.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Firstly, I&#x27;m not too sure about the people who said they only received one packet -</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I ordered; an entire box!</li>
            <li>I gave this a try on my natural hair..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen it advertised for natural hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a deep conditioning treatment that works really well with a heat cap or hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It really improved my ends and it deeply penetrated into the hair shaft.</li>
            <li>I have had alot of compliments as to how soft and SHINY my hair is since using, and the breakage that I had is now gone.</li>
            <li>I can also see my natural curl pattern after using the product.  </li>
            <li>If the scent is a little odd to you (which, it was to me, but I try so many products</li>
            <li>I bought the 12oz bottle and used almost half the bottle the first time.</li>
            <li>I only deep condition my natural hair once a month</li>
            <li>I had more difficulty than usual in detangling and after air drying, it did not feel as soft as usual.</li>

            <li> Highly recommend purchasing this same packet in CVS, WALMART or Sally&#x27;s for less than $2.00!Why</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not willing to gain soft hair at the risk of an allergic, or whatever reaction I had.</li>
            <li> Live my hair when I use this...normally use a half packet per wash for my long hair!!</li>
            <li> my search continues 3year natural and trying to find a good conditioner so hard &gt;:(</li>
            <li> Buy this at your local Walgreens or other drugstores.  </li>
            <li> There are other deep conditioner packs out there.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s one single pack by itself.</li>
            <li> My shoulder - length hair is very dry.</li>
            <li> now i want a big bottle after testing out this little sample</li>
            <li> Once you put it in and leave for at least 15-30 min under the dryer and rinse your hair is SILKY soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural and really really thick.  </li>
            <li> When I rinsed it out my hair felt a little rough</li>
            <li> My hair is softer &amp; the breaker is little to none.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it was just a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s very thick and creamy (almost like yogurt or pudding) and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This seller&#x27;s price is crazy high.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just a disappointment, the next time you sale a product specifically put that it is one pack,i expected a bulk package and received one, i couldv&#x27;e went to the beauty supply store instead of buying it online.</li>
            <li> One thing to keep in mind: the directions say to use this conditioner with heat and that&#x27;s what they mean.</li>
            <li> This is a very small packet...note the weight.  </li>
            <li> Smell it again, and if it still seems a little weird to do, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> I have real thick should legends hair.  </li>
            <li> it was like a automatic dry stringy nasty feeling that i run from alot ...</li>
            <li> But to do a test run go to the stores listed, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I gave this a try on my natural hair..I&#x27;ve seen it advertised for natural hair.  It is not! This took every drop of moisture right out of my hair.  I bought the 12oz bottle and used almost half the bottle the first time. It smells great but I&#x27;ll be sticking with my regular Olive Oil Organic Root Stimulator Replenishing Conditioner from now on.</li>
            <li> Great for relaxed hair. This is a deep conditioning treatment that works really well with a heat cap or hair dryer. I kept it on for 30 minutes  My hair is soft, shiny, and has a better look after styling, than prior to using this product. My hair looks smoother and healthier.  This conditioner only needs to be applied every week or so.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. Their wrapping lotion is good, too.   Don&#x27;t get ripped off. Buy this at your local Walgreens or other drugstores.  This seller&#x27;s price is crazy high. The seller claims free shipping. They have included shipping in the cost of the product.  This is a very small packet...note the weight.  You can find this conditioner very easily at your local stores.  The price at your drug store is 2.50 to 3.00.    You can get a good deal purchasing online, if you decide you like this product and will continue to use.  Some sellers are offering in bulk....a 12 pack for about 26 bucks. That includes shipping.</li>
            <li> I have fine 4a/b hair and I found this product to be a huge dissapointment. In terms of putting it in my hair and combing through, it felt great. I was able to detangle my hair well when the conditioner was in it and it had a nice consistancy. However, I feel as though the oil to moisturizer ratio is a bit much (a lot more oil than moisture) if you do not have thick hair. When I rinsed it out my hair felt a little rough and it was very stringy.  I had more difficulty than usual in detangling and after air drying, it did not feel as soft as usual.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I didnt give this one star is because I love the way this smells. It did not do anything for my hair. This treatment was not moisturizing for my hair, no slip, just stuck on my hair. I will continue to search for the perfect deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is VERY dry and thick and this intensive conditioner penatrates my hair and keeps it moisturized, soft, and easy to manage, when used with a hooded dryer it works even better, this packet lasts up to 3-4 uses I have shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> OMG.....This was my first time using the Argan oil Intensive Conditioning Treatment and I love it. I only deep condition my natural hair once a month and this worked wonders on my hair and it smells very good. It left my hair soft, bouncy and moisturized and still smell great. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like this treatment very much. It deep conditioned my hair. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the advertisement. It said a 24pk instead I got one pack. I love just the same get from somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a big fan of Cream of Nature.  My shoulder - length hair is very dry. I use intensive deep conditioner every two weeks. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  My hair is softer &amp; the breaker is little to none.&lt;br /&gt;I started washing my hair every week myself because the person doing my hair was not doing a great job.  My hair is doing great with the help of Cream of Nature &amp; Eden peppermint products. FYI - it&#x27;s an excellent idea to wash your hair every week;  that cut back on product build-up.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this conditioner and this is one of the best deep conditioner I have ever used! It left my hair shiny and moisturized. It really improved my ends and it deeply penetrated into the hair shaft.</li>
            <li> Love this product as a deep conditioner, but my other favorites are:   * Organix Argan Oil Deep Conditioner (you can buy the Macadamia Nut Oil and add to any deep conditioner)  * Macadamia Nut Oil Deep Conditioner  * Palmer&#x27;s Coconut Oil Formula Protein Pack  * Vidal Sassoon Protein Conditioner</li>
            <li> This is the best product for medium/thick hair. Once you put it in and leave for at least 15-30 min under the dryer and rinse your hair is SILKY soft. It&#x27;s great to use when you need a touch-up but can&#x27;t get to the beauty salon. I have had alot of compliments as to how soft and SHINY my hair is since using, and the breakage that I had is now gone. Highly recommend purchasing this same packet in CVS, WALMART or Sally&#x27;s for less than $2.00!Why this seller is selling for over $5.00 is beyond me, the 12oz bottle costs about $4.79. But to do a test run go to the stores listed, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I just wrote a review about Organic Root Stimulator&#x27;s replenishing conditioning being a staple. Despite that I decided to give this a go.&lt;br /&gt;Bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;I left it in my hair for more than an hour, and while the smell at first didn&#x27;t really bother me, as time passed I got a headache. As soon as I rinsed the conditioner out of my locs and the smell went away, my headache largely cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, my hair is pretty soft, that&#x27;s the only reason I&#x27;m giving it three stars. But I&#x27;m not willing to gain soft hair at the risk of an allergic, or whatever reaction I had. Maybe I&#x27;m allergic to argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;So, my advice for someone thinking about trying this product is to cup it open and smell it first. If the scent is a little odd to you (which, it was to me, but I try so many products so I&#x27;m comfortable with that) put it aside for about an hour or something. Smell it again, and if it still seems a little weird to do, don&#x27;t bother. There are other deep conditioner packs out there.</li>
            <li> I used this product after the  sulfate free shampoo well the shampoo did a really good justice but as soon as a put this God only know what to call it in my head it was like a automatic dry stringy nasty feeling that i run from alot ...i still use the shampoo but not this i gave it to my lil cousin with permed hair hope it turn out better for her...my search continues 3year natural and trying to find a good conditioner so hard &gt;:(</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing detangles well. Great slip for my 4c hair. SMells amazing. I luv this stuff now i want a big bottle after testing out this little sample</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST conditioning treatment I have ever used! Use the conditioning treatment as shampoo.  I also use the leave in conditioner and the oil.  My hair is soft and extremely easy to manage.  I can also see my natural curl pattern after using the product.  I love this product!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this at the BSS and I am so happy that I did.  I have real thick should legends hair.  My hair is natural and really really thick.  I washed my hair and then used this as a conditioner in the shower with no cap.  I put it on and then washed and then rinsed it out.  It deranged my hair instantly and was so silky smooth.  I could not believe it.  I love this product,  so worth it.</li>
            <li> Conditions, thickens, softens, shines and gave my hair a good bounce!! Live my hair when I use this...normally use a half packet per wash for my long hair!! Will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful..i give it 5 starts and beyond but my review is on the seller, when i ordered this product i thought i was getting 12 packs of Argan oil conditioner in a box, i thought i was buying in bulk, it was a great price for 12. but i get my package today and it&#x27;s one single pack by itself. it&#x27;s just a disappointment, the next time you sale a product specifically put that it is one pack,i expected a bulk package and received one, i couldv&#x27;e went to the beauty supply store instead of buying it online. it was just a waste of money and time. But let alone the product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time a couple of months ago and it now sits proudly on my \\&quot;Staple Products\\&quot; shelf (yes, I am a product junkie haha). I have relaxed 4a hair and this conditioner is a lifesaver deep into a relaxer stretch. I use it as a deep conditioning treatment once or twice a week, and when I rinse it out the tangles in my new growth seem to just melt away and my hair feels incredibly soft and strong, no breakage whatsoever. I love the consistency - it&#x27;s very thick and creamy (almost like yogurt or pudding) and a little goes a long way. The smell is heavenly! One thing to keep in mind: the directions say to use this conditioner with heat and that&#x27;s what they mean. I tried using it without heat and it left my hair kind of sticky and coated. With heat, it gives plenty of slip and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. I usually apply the conditioner after a fresh wash, cover my head with a shower cap and a towel for a couple of hours, and let body heat work its magic, and voila! - silky, soft tresses! I would definitely recommend it to all my relaxed ladies out there.</li>
            <li> i really loved it! it is really cool! Very nice! So neat! Wow amazing Wow! Liked it bunches! So neat!</li>
            <li> Firstly, I&#x27;m not too sure about the people who said they only received one packet - I got exactly what I ordered; an entire box! 12 packets! This is the best conditioning treatment I&#x27;ve used in a long time. I actually like the smell! My hair is relaxed, short and it leaves it silky, shiny and looks way better when I blow dry. Worth trying!</li>
