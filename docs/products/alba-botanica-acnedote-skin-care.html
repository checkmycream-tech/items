            <li>I like this scrub - it&#x27;s very effective.</li>
            <li>The best part is paraben free!</li>
            <li>I love that the ingredients are all-natural, and the scrub aspect of it is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I settled for just telling one of my best girl friends :)</li>
            <li>Good amount of scrubbyness.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>I feel good when looking in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So this was a nice win for my face.  </li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>fair warning though</li>
            <li>The ingredients are vegetarian which is preferred and there are microbeads that also give a good exfoliation whilst washing.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>so it is very refreshing.  </li>
            <li>It smells good and has a nice texture to it.  </li>
            <li>I love the texture of this soap and the smell !</li>
            <li>its cheaper than most of the BS brands that have all the chemicals in them to make the price “cheaper”??!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this scrub!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Check your deodorant, makeup, toothpaste, lotion, shampoo - switch to a healthy lifestyle now!</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the way my skin feels after cleansing, so I had to purchase one for myself!</li>
            <li>This is great for traveling, it&#x27;s easy to use and affordable.</li>
            <li>After using this product, I have noticed an amazing improvement in my skin: a reduction in pimples, blackheads, and whiteheads.</li>
            <li>this acne line is amazing.</li>
            <li>The abrasive quality of the walnut shells, as used in this scrub, is amazing.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks amazing since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made up of ground walnut shell which does an amazing job exfoliating</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Cannot even begin to describe how effective it is in getting rid of acne.</li>
            <li>This just smells like peppermint and feels so nice.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how there are so many good reviews...</li>
            <li>Has an interesting (but good) smell to it.</li>
            <li>It was especially good in the shower for the whole body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective but not overly abrasive on the skin.</li>
            <li>I was so impressed that immediately after using I could see much clearer skin.  </li>
            <li>The best part is the pepperminty smell and the tiny microbeads feel great on my skin.</li>
            <li>this help for this kind stuff</li>
            <li>The smell is really nice, but then again, it didnt work.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would work</li>
            <li>you are looking for clearer, more beautiful skin, I strongly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin,and leaves your face feeling really clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super happy to find a face wash that works for me and that doesn&#x27;t get tested on animals.</li>
            <li>So far though, I&#x27;m happy with the results!  </li>
            <li>I just got this in the mail today and so far, I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li>I have never had great success with salicylic acid though.</li>
            <li>I have a good amount of &amp;#34;backne&amp;#34; and so was excited to try this product out.</li>
            <li>It is definitely more suitable for the shower as it does have a lot of exfoliating beads</li>
            <li>Fine grit, if you rub it in your hands a bit you get some foam, and it feels tingly (salicylic acid at work!)  </li>
            <li>I started using this about 5 months ago, and I have noticed a huge difference!</li>
            <li>The Alba Botanica ACNEdote Face &amp; Body Scrub is a phenomenal product.</li>
            <li>The smell is fine--not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I like the scrubs that are a bit more dense.</li>
            <li>But I still love the scrub, it smells like oranges.....</li>
            <li>I also love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>I really LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I love  alba products.</li>
            <li>I started getting more and more ibg breakouts; meaning not sections of breakouts</li>
            <li>Of course, when I switched products my skin was irritated for a bit but after it got use to it, my skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li>It is an actual scrub with a wonderful consistency.</li>
            <li>The product is 100% vegetarian and unlike most acne scrubs, doesn’t have all the parabens and sulfates.</li>
            <li>I love this scrub.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>In all, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s one of my all-time favorite scrubs for face or body.    </li>
            <li>This product checks many boxes for me.  </li>
            <li>However it didn&#x27;t help with my acne; I may need something more aggressive.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love using this.</li>
            <li>Perhaps a combination of all Acnedote products will work better than this product alone.</li>
            <li>I have skin that&#x27;s on the dryer side but get zits from working out and during more hormonal times of the month.</li>
            <li>Quite simply the best face scrub I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, the way it works, and the fact that it prevents acne.</li>
            <li>I use this for my back, and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li>way better than most products I&#x27;ve tried that cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li>Love this product for both face and body.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love Alba for caring about what goes on my body.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>and I LOVE THE SMELL.</li>
            <li>When i used the scrub I fell in love.</li>
            <li>I am so in love.</li>
            <li>I know i have found my favorite skin care line.</li>
            <li>Love this wash.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know, sure).</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>I notice my skin gotten better.</li>
            <li>Glad I found this.</li>
            <li>This has become my daily face wash product now. :D</li>
            <li>I LOVE this face wash.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love Alba products.</li>
            <li>It burns the most close to my eye area.</li>
            <li>After I tried it, I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>It works better than anything else I have used.  </li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to use alot and can save more of your face/body wash over time.</li>
            <li>But I love the minty scent of this wash</li>
            <li>&amp; theres a bit more of the scrub and foamy</li>
            <li>I am now in love with the alba botanical brand.</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;ll be buying more when I run out</li>
            <li>Its also the only acne product that I have seen that doesn&#x27;t test on animals which is great!</li>
            <li>This Alba scrub goes on easy, feels great while &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; it in and washes really clean, squeeky clean.  </li>
            <li>This scrub smells clean and fresh and works great.</li>
            <li>but it gives your face a nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li>just beware that although it goes on smooth and makes your skin feel great, it&#x27;s easy to scrub that skin right off.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very clean, not stripped of all its moisture.  </li>
            <li>my face feels very clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>The whole line of Alba Acnedote products is amazing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li>and i love how it easily spreads</li>
            <li>I loved the organic part of this wash, I also loved the texture of it and it definitely felt like it was scrubbing away all the impurities.</li>
            <li>This scrub has a nice fresh scent that I really love.</li>
            <li>Great for people with oily skin and sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other products including Proactiv, for years, and Alba does a great job, better than most!</li>
            <li>I love the fine grain and pepperminty smell of this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not creamy, so it won&#x27;t moisturize, it gives you a really clean feeling!</li>
            <li>More importantly, it nourishes your skin, which gives clearer skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Alba&#x27;s Acne-dote meets all of these criteria, and most importantly, it works.</li>
            <li>It also smells great and is made up of natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>This product rocks.. great for sensitive skin ..</li>
            <li>I was more excited about the Origins stuff</li>
            <li>If you need a great scrub that actually scrubs, then you are going to love this product as I do.</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell - maybe witch hazel or tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find that they were ground finely about like sand and the wash was full of them.</li>
            <li>- the smell is fine, its not perfume-y but not antiseptic, it does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li>but if you use a moisturizer with it, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>i can tell a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>It seems to work alright and doesn&#x27;t make me break out but does not have a huge effect on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been ecstatic to see a huge improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I think its fantastic.</li>
            <li>This scrub is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>it is still important to cleanse the pores.</li>
            <li>I feel it&#x27;s instrumental in keeping my skin almost acne free.</li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t use this every day because I don&#x27;t want to over-do it with the scrub, but this is a really nice face wash that leaves my skin feeling very refreshed.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my face and shoulders smooth and acne free.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about a month, and my skin is now blemish free.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is quite grainy and it makes my face feel smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>I just bought this product last night at Walmart and have noticed great results.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and no hassles of any kind.</li>
            <li>(so doesn&#x27;t make me look oil free for hours and all day), but it is a moisturizer that is NOT GREASY for us acne-prone people.  </li>
            <li>I have fair, combination, slightly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This product smells so good and leaves your skin feeling so soft and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin is not completely clear but it&#x27;s well on its way to getting there now, thanks to this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s something in there that exfoliates the skin and leaves it feeling very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t stop me from period time break outs, but I&#x27;m pretty sure nothing can.  </li>
            <li>This has significantly improved my breakouts.</li>
            <li>Originally it was purchased as an alternative to St Ives Blemish Control Apricot Scrub-</li>
            <li>It does its job as a scrub, and leaves my face feeling clean.</li>
            <li>even after you shower you feel so clean.</li>
            <li>Very good for a once or twice a week heavy duty scrub.</li>
            <li>For $7, the container is huge and definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>This one leaves your skin feeling fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love the ground walnut shells for exfoliation and i really like the sent of all of it</li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling refreshed and super clean.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, natural smell, too.</li>
            <li>will definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good fac scrub&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Smells lemony and is a nice natural alternative.</li>
            <li>I feel it adds a more natural feel to the overall experience, btw my skin feels and looks great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m interested in trying some of their other products as well since this one has impressed me so much!</li>
            <li>Proactiv on the other hand worked great on my skin.</li>
            <li>After I use it I feel fresh and like my face is really clean.</li>
            <li>this is such a great product, it really reeeeally works.</li>
            <li>The ground walnut particles are nice and smooth exfoliators, and the minty scent is terrific!</li>
            <li>I use it just once a week though for mild acne.</li>
            <li>My cheeks always have a nice, healthy pink glow to them after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>for those super problem spots.. don&#x27;t dilute the tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough to use every day and very effective and smoothing skin and managing acne.</li>
            <li>What struck me at first was how fantastic the scent is.  </li>
            <li>Due to the company&#x27;s cruelty free guarantee and the fact that it got such good reviews, I decided to give this line a shot and am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>Nice subtle scent, lathers while exfoliating, perfect for daily use.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased!  </li>
            <li>Use in moderation at first, get your skin used to this powerful scrub!</li>
            <li>Love alba products because they aware cruelty free and mostly natural.</li>
            <li>My face felt clean and well scrubbed after the first use.</li>
            <li>I was really forward to a nice, all natural product but instead got something that ruined my face!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Handy tip: for spot treatment, at night first wash with this stuff, get a clean q-tip.</li>
            <li>I bought it with the alba green tea and aloe lotion, they make a great combo ...</li>
            <li>Cruelty free, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, and really seems to help the breakouts on my face and shoulders.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday care of oily skin.</li>
            <li>After only having used it for 6 days, I&#x27;d say these are amazing results.  </li>
            <li>And also feels great if you leave it on for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I picked up a tube of Acnedote in a health food store near  my house, and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I had some success with Proactiv as a teenager, but it eventually stopped working for me.</li>
            <li>It smells so fresh, like aromatherapy, and reminds me of being at the spa.  </li>
            <li>so I always leave the shower feeling fresh faced.</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural also.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to go more natural with all of my beauty products</li>
            <li>this by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t perfect, but this does more for  me than any other product has, and without the harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li>Even our most recent male house guest commented on how much he enjoyed it!</li>
            <li>First time using this face wash and my face felt so clean, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Cleared up my breakout quickly and painlessly- the walnut shell bits are definitely exfoliating but not abrasive, and I think my skin looks better after using it for a week.</li>
            <li>Its so hard to find a face wash that has a nice scent and a really great overall</li>
            <li>I have the best results using it once a day, or every other day, and then using some sort of mild cleanser for the other times I wash my face.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my daily basis staying clean and fresh trying to be acne free.</li>
            <li>and I have seen good results in less than 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>but I strongly advise those of you with sensitive, acne prone skin not use this product.</li>
            <li>Natural peeling beads (crushed nutshell) work great.</li>
            <li>, the scrub is gentle and leaves your whole body smooth and refreshed........</li>
            <li>Very soothing for the face/body, you will notice results quickly.</li>
            <li>While most face scrub washes can be more of a paste like product that needs to be firmly squeezed out (</li>
            <li>and I would definitely recommend others to try this if you aren&#x27;t happy with your current acne products!</li>
            <li>and it did great for the big break outs on my back using once a day.</li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of crystals and they are just the right size for you to feel like they are really cleansing your skin.</li>
            <li>The best part is a little bit goes a long way so</li>
            <li>At first I was so excited about something new</li>
            <li>After using it twice a day for only four days I am already noticing a huge difference in my acne!</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft, refreshed, and blemish free...</li>
            <li>but I definitely always buy another :)</li>
            <li>and it works way better; no big break outs.</li>
            <li>It contains a lot of natural ingredients to help the skin heal and smooth.</li>
            <li>Just got my first bunch of ALBA products</li>
            <li>I would like it to have some more moisturizing properties to it, and all these big manufacturers need to stop screwing around with 2% salicylic acid</li>
            <li>Pretty immediately, I was hooked.</li>
            <li>I think you would get a better shot with panoxyl bar soap 10% peroxide, it helps my back acne, i can tell you that.</li>
            <li>All in all i got exactly what i was shopping for</li>
            <li>I am prone to the occasional hormonal breakout, and while I owned many products for my face, I didn&#x27;t have any for the rest of my body.  </li>
            <li>This scrub works wonder at keeping breakouts at bay and leaves skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost at the end of my first bottle</li>
            <li>I had been loyal to them for years, but wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean and and smooth and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>I so far love ALL tge Alba Botanica priducts that I have used so far.</li>
            <li>I am starting to love the whole alba line.</li>
            <li>I love this scrub, really all alba products and the acnedote line works especially well.</li>
            <li>I really like it very much, can you tell?</li>
            <li>I love this product, it is good for your whole body, and you only need a small amount to get the job done.</li>
            <li>Then, I came across Alba&#x27;s Acnedote on Amazon and saw the overwhelmingly positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I think it smells kind of like a whiskey sour</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a good quality exfoliator that is not too harsh.</li>
            <li>I would advise against using this product more than 1X/day because it is 2% salicylic acid and could dry your skin out.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing, I was concerned that the walnut shells would be large and sparse.  </li>
            <li>(I even bought a new line of products from Origins 2 days later since I was sure a product from walmart couldn&#x27;t work all that well on my face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really wish there were more products for people struggling with acne as well as excessively dry skin.</li>
            <li>I suffered from acne, and my skin is very oily.</li>
            <li>It is very runny and ends up all over the shower and not on me.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve ended up wasting so much product because it pours out.</li>
            <li>It would disappear fast though, but it kept happening over and over.</li>
            <li>I use it with a mesh sponge for my body - it&#x27;s been great at preventing or reducing the acne I sometimes get on my back from working out, and I occasionally use it with my Clarisonic face brush when I need extra exfoliation on my face.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>So it really works to exfoliate your skin.</li>
            <li>This is gentle and exfoliating.</li>
            <li>It works very well...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what else to say besides that.</li>
            <li>I actually really like the smell this has</li>
            <li>this product clears acne fast anywhere on your body, and it leathers up well</li>
            <li>I also really like the scent.  </li>
            <li>and it really does work,</li>
            <li>I really like the Alba brand</li>
            <li>Be gentle when using on the face.</li>
            <li>but I would pay twice as much for the results I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li>and he don&#x27;t have to use the strips as much as he used to.</li>
            <li>(I think the peppermint in it really stands out) and it really feels like it&#x27;s scrubbing away the ick.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>It lathers up almost as much as a soap</li>
            <li>My face is normally very oily, where I can see beads of oil on my nose an hour after washing my face.  </li>
            <li>Panoxyl with 10% benzoyl peroxide has recently kept my skin pretty clear, but I did not want to put so many chemicals on my skin, which is why I decided to try something all natural.</li>
            <li>I came across this line initially because I was researching vegan friendly products that do not do animal testing.</li>
            <li>I use this product everyday and i am very satisfied so far.</li>
            <li>My favorite product, use it everyday, all natural and mild but gets the &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; done.</li>
            <li>I like that this scrub has a little more grit to it than most scrubs out there without being too rough.</li>
            <li>I have plenty of acne, and pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Before I found this I was battling adult acne and had a pretty ruddy complexion.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels super soft and clean, without feeling dry or irritated (and I have really sensitive skin)</li>
            <li>I have been using this scrub for over a year and a half, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>this is not runny yet a slight more liquid based with fluidity.</li>
            <li>Tried many different scrubs but keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li>Will keep this as my main scrub.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has mild to severe ache.</li>
            <li>Finely ground enough to not grind away at your skin, but coarse enough to provide comfortable exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone with or without problem skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cleanser and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I have adult acne I can&#x27;t seem to get rid of, but this has REALLY helped.</li>
            <li>i really like this product so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no negative side affects.</li>
            <li>with normal skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; skin before but this gets me pretty close -- to where for the first time I&#x27;m not completely horrified to leave the house without makeup.  </li>
            <li>bought this to my brother wich take proteins everyday because the gym point its those protein make your face brote alot more..</li>
            <li>I use it once a day, before bedtime, and find that it is not too harsh on my skin AND keeps most blemishes away.</li>
            <li>I washed my face with it again about and hour ago and to relieve the burning on my face, I have aloe lotion that I normally reserve for sunburns on my face.</li>
            <li>I currently do not have one pimple on my face and have seen a good deal less oil (which is a major concern of mine over the summer).</li>
            <li>Even the deep blackheads on my nose that have been there for years are getting a little better!</li>
            <li>On top of that, my normally pale skin is redder than an embarrassed tomato.</li>
            <li>not too gritty or harsh-just right.</li>
            <li>and I was really excited about using it, however, after the first use it turned my skin brutally dry and red.</li>
            <li>The smell is strange but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting a lively, citrusy scent from an acne product.  </li>
            <li>2nd Sulfer Soap (can be found cheap on Amazon, 3rd 10% Sulfer ointment (can also be found on Amazon)</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Ives peach scrub yet never really noticed anything special and figured i was just donating money, not the case with this scrub wash.</li>
            <li>So far have just used this and the toner, looking forward to trying it all!</li>
            <li>Natural and works!</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin feeling soft!</li>
            <li>first discovered this on Amazon, but realized my local organic health food story carries it for a lower cost.</li>
            <li>It is a bit harsh on the skin, so I only use it once daily, but it does a good job of rejuvenating my skin and keeping my acne under control.</li>
            <li>Something that I really liked was that it didn&#x27;t hurt like crazy when a little got in my eye, and it was rather easy to clean out.</li>
            <li>, it leaves a strong odor (one i like) and will dry visibly white on your skin</li>
            <li>Full body use is definitely a plus, looking forward to my nightly shower and cant wait to smell minty, especially since it isn&#x27;t an overbearing smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pleasant, faint scent.</li>
            <li>I do put moisturizer on right after using this because it will dry out your skin</li>
            <li>If you have difficult skin or just need good natural skin care, you won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
            <li>This is the best scrub for those little blackheads you get on your shoulders, back, and behind - I&#x27;ve heen using it for over a year.</li>
            <li>I think it may even be helping to clear up my skin</li>
            <li>I used this in hopes to clear my acne without over drying.</li>
            <li>My face has started to clear up after just using this for a week.</li>
            <li>It definitely has made a difference in how clear our skin is (we just use it on our faces, though it is marketed for the whole body).</li>
            <li>and my skin is almost clear.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I used Proactiv once at a friend&#x27;s house and my skin was irritated for a couple of days, so I&#x27;m sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, acne prone and this one works for me.</li>
            <li>All natural.  </li>
            <li>Finally a reasonably priced face wash that doesn&#x27;t add to my recently acquired skin problems.</li>
            <li>It made my skin smooth by peeling off dead skin.</li>
            <li>I also like that it is all natural products, and</li>
            <li>I promise if you are an adult with acne this regiment will clear your skin and reduce the redness from acne scars.</li>
            <li>I like the natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I started using this product line when I was overseas since there wasn&#x27;t much selection at our local PX.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re sensitive to Salicylic Acid, this is not the face wash for you.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin, including eczema, and I can use this scrub on my face and body.  </li>
            <li>It DOES NOT over strip the face and thank Heaven because my face is sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne</li>
            <li>Natural product that smooths your skin.  </li>
            <li>Is also all natural.</li>
            <li>It really gets all the nooks and crannies and I felt like my skin was finally even textured.</li>
            <li>Im 24 years old.</li>
            <li>The scrub is not at all harsh, it leaves my skin smooth without traumatizing it.  </li>
            <li>Mmm Good!&lt;br /&gt;After a quick test wash, i noticed my skin had a tight snap as if it was brand new.</li>
            <li>Once upon a time, I used Proactiv with much success and decided to order it again despite the amount of chemicals in it that I have been avoiding in all other products.  </li>
            <li>I have not noticed if it is clearing up my acne on my face, however it reduces the amount of oil and dead skin on my face significantly.  </li>
            <li>It also comes in a large tube and lasts a long time, as I just use it on my face.</li>
            <li>Proactiv didn&#x27;t work half this good, and Alba is only half the price!</li>
            <li>It took me about two weeks to get my skin back to normal.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I have very dry, very sensitive skin, and pretty moderate acne.</li>
            <li>I bought this because Wal-Mart was out of my usual Clean and Clear blackhead scrub</li>
            <li>It is natural and does not dry you out!</li>
            <li>not much is needed and worth the price ( double even?</li>
            <li>but I was very pleasantly surprised to find that this did not dry my face out, even using it 2 times a day.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it takes a little effort to keep the bottle clean.  </li>
            <li>I switched back to using the aveeno clear complexion bar</li>
            <li>I struggle with keeping my back clear of acne.  </li>
            <li>I actually find this to be almost like a natural version of that scrub.  </li>
            <li>The scrub is not rough and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>But only 3 days in, my skin was completely stripped of any moisture because of this product.</li>
            <li>I am a 35 year old female and have had severe acne since the age of 12</li>
            <li>this product Acnedote completely cleared my back and chest in a matter of days.</li>
            <li>also left my skin feeling soft for over a week after using it once.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My face is not sensitive, it is normal.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, oily T zone with normal skin on my cheeks, so I&#x27;m guessing it dried out the skin on my cheeks too much.</li>
            <li>, I know that sounds weird, but it is the closest thing I could think of to compare the smell to, but its a nice smell</li>
            <li>Normally products with salycic acid really dry my face out</li>
            <li>And the other face wash I have been using doesn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li>The small particles in the scrub make for a very gentle, soothing cleaning!</li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed at how well this scrub has worked with my acne compared to other products.</li>
            <li>and my arms feel really clean and slightly tingly after (like an icy feeling).</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using this body scrub for roughly 2 years when we made the choice to switch to something a little more natural versus the typical chemical type products offered by Dove, Dial, Axe, etc.  </li>
            <li>I stopped washing my face with soaps and scrubs, and I usually use the Oil Cleansing Method, but when I started getting hormonal breakouts, I needed something with a little more power.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and takes away my dry skin patches.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Pro___, and it helped, but certainly didn&#x27;t cure anything, and it is so harsh and bleaches things.  </li>
            <li>Not too much, not too little.</li>
            <li>I used this product 3 times and my face turned bright red, bumpy and is painful to the touch.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s made up of ground walnut shell which does an amazing job exfoliating</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Cannot even begin to describe how effective it is in getting rid of acne.</li>
            <li> This just smells like peppermint and feels so nice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how there are so many good reviews...</li>
            <li> Has an interesting (but good) smell to it.</li>
            <li> It was especially good in the shower for the whole body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective but not overly abrasive on the skin.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed that immediately after using I could see much clearer skin.  </li>
            <li> The best part is the pepperminty smell and the tiny microbeads feel great on my skin.</li>
            <li> this help for this kind stuff</li>
            <li> The smell is really nice, but then again, it didnt work.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would work</li>
            <li> you are looking for clearer, more beautiful skin, I strongly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin,and leaves your face feeling really clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super happy to find a face wash that works for me and that doesn&#x27;t get tested on animals.</li>
            <li> So far though, I&#x27;m happy with the results!  </li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today and so far, I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I have never had great success with salicylic acid though.</li>
            <li> I have a good amount of &amp;#34;backne&amp;#34; and so was excited to try this product out.</li>
            <li> It is definitely more suitable for the shower as it does have a lot of exfoliating beads</li>
            <li> Fine grit, if you rub it in your hands a bit you get some foam, and it feels tingly (salicylic acid at work!)  </li>
            <li> I started using this about 5 months ago, and I have noticed a huge difference!</li>
            <li> The Alba Botanica ACNEdote Face &amp; Body Scrub is a phenomenal product.</li>
            <li> The smell is fine--not my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I like the scrubs that are a bit more dense.</li>
            <li> But I still love the scrub, it smells like oranges.....</li>
            <li> I also love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I really LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I love  alba products.</li>
            <li> I started getting more and more ibg breakouts; meaning not sections of breakouts</li>
            <li> Of course, when I switched products my skin was irritated for a bit but after it got use to it, my skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li> It is an actual scrub with a wonderful consistency.</li>
            <li> The product is 100% vegetarian and unlike most acne scrubs, doesn’t have all the parabens and sulfates.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> In all, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s one of my all-time favorite scrubs for face or body.    </li>
            <li> This product checks many boxes for me.  </li>
            <li> However it didn&#x27;t help with my acne; I may need something more aggressive.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love using this.</li>
            <li> Perhaps a combination of all Acnedote products will work better than this product alone.</li>
            <li> I have skin that&#x27;s on the dryer side but get zits from working out and during more hormonal times of the month.</li>
            <li> Quite simply the best face scrub I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, the way it works, and the fact that it prevents acne.</li>
            <li> I use this for my back, and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> way better than most products I&#x27;ve tried that cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> Love this product for both face and body.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love Alba for caring about what goes on my body.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> and I LOVE THE SMELL.</li>
            <li> When i used the scrub I fell in love.</li>
            <li> I am so in love.</li>
            <li> I know i have found my favorite skin care line.</li>
            <li> Love this wash.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know, sure).</li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> I notice my skin gotten better.</li>
            <li> Glad I found this.</li>
            <li> This has become my daily face wash product now. :D</li>
            <li> I LOVE this face wash.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love Alba products.</li>
            <li> It burns the most close to my eye area.</li>
            <li> After I tried it, I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> It works better than anything else I have used.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to use alot and can save more of your face/body wash over time.</li>
            <li> But I love the minty scent of this wash</li>
            <li> &amp; theres a bit more of the scrub and foamy</li>
            <li> I am now in love with the alba botanical brand.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ll be buying more when I run out</li>
            <li> Its also the only acne product that I have seen that doesn&#x27;t test on animals which is great!</li>
            <li> This Alba scrub goes on easy, feels great while &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; it in and washes really clean, squeeky clean.  </li>
            <li> This scrub smells clean and fresh and works great.</li>
            <li> but it gives your face a nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li> just beware that although it goes on smooth and makes your skin feel great, it&#x27;s easy to scrub that skin right off.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very clean, not stripped of all its moisture.  </li>
            <li> my face feels very clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> The whole line of Alba Acnedote products is amazing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> and i love how it easily spreads</li>
            <li> I loved the organic part of this wash, I also loved the texture of it and it definitely felt like it was scrubbing away all the impurities.</li>
            <li> This scrub has a nice fresh scent that I really love.</li>
            <li> Great for people with oily skin and sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other products including Proactiv, for years, and Alba does a great job, better than most!</li>
            <li> I love the fine grain and pepperminty smell of this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not creamy, so it won&#x27;t moisturize, it gives you a really clean feeling!</li>
            <li> More importantly, it nourishes your skin, which gives clearer skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Alba&#x27;s Acne-dote meets all of these criteria, and most importantly, it works.</li>
            <li> It also smells great and is made up of natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> This product rocks.. great for sensitive skin ..</li>
            <li> I was more excited about the Origins stuff</li>
            <li> If you need a great scrub that actually scrubs, then you are going to love this product as I do.</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell - maybe witch hazel or tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find that they were ground finely about like sand and the wash was full of them.</li>
            <li> - the smell is fine, its not perfume-y but not antiseptic, it does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li> but if you use a moisturizer with it, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> i can tell a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> It seems to work alright and doesn&#x27;t make me break out but does not have a huge effect on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ecstatic to see a huge improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I think its fantastic.</li>
            <li> This scrub is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> it is still important to cleanse the pores.</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s instrumental in keeping my skin almost acne free.</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t use this every day because I don&#x27;t want to over-do it with the scrub, but this is a really nice face wash that leaves my skin feeling very refreshed.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my face and shoulders smooth and acne free.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month, and my skin is now blemish free.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is quite grainy and it makes my face feel smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product last night at Walmart and have noticed great results.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and no hassles of any kind.</li>
            <li> (so doesn&#x27;t make me look oil free for hours and all day), but it is a moisturizer that is NOT GREASY for us acne-prone people.  </li>
            <li> I have fair, combination, slightly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This product smells so good and leaves your skin feeling so soft and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin is not completely clear but it&#x27;s well on its way to getting there now, thanks to this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something in there that exfoliates the skin and leaves it feeling very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t stop me from period time break outs, but I&#x27;m pretty sure nothing can.  </li>
            <li> This has significantly improved my breakouts.</li>
            <li> Originally it was purchased as an alternative to St Ives Blemish Control Apricot Scrub-</li>
            <li> It does its job as a scrub, and leaves my face feeling clean.</li>
            <li> even after you shower you feel so clean.</li>
            <li> Very good for a once or twice a week heavy duty scrub.</li>
            <li> For $7, the container is huge and definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> This one leaves your skin feeling fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love the ground walnut shells for exfoliation and i really like the sent of all of it</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling refreshed and super clean.</li>
            <li> It has a nice, natural smell, too.</li>
            <li> will definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good fac scrub&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Smells lemony and is a nice natural alternative.</li>
            <li> I feel it adds a more natural feel to the overall experience, btw my skin feels and looks great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m interested in trying some of their other products as well since this one has impressed me so much!</li>
            <li> Proactiv on the other hand worked great on my skin.</li>
            <li> After I use it I feel fresh and like my face is really clean.</li>
            <li> this is such a great product, it really reeeeally works.</li>
            <li> The ground walnut particles are nice and smooth exfoliators, and the minty scent is terrific!</li>
            <li> I use it just once a week though for mild acne.</li>
            <li> My cheeks always have a nice, healthy pink glow to them after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> for those super problem spots.. don&#x27;t dilute the tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough to use every day and very effective and smoothing skin and managing acne.</li>
            <li> What struck me at first was how fantastic the scent is.  </li>
            <li> Due to the company&#x27;s cruelty free guarantee and the fact that it got such good reviews, I decided to give this line a shot and am so glad I did!</li>
            <li> Nice subtle scent, lathers while exfoliating, perfect for daily use.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased!  </li>
            <li> Use in moderation at first, get your skin used to this powerful scrub!</li>
            <li> Love alba products because they aware cruelty free and mostly natural.</li>
            <li> My face felt clean and well scrubbed after the first use.</li>
            <li> I was really forward to a nice, all natural product but instead got something that ruined my face!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Handy tip: for spot treatment, at night first wash with this stuff, get a clean q-tip.</li>
            <li> I bought it with the alba green tea and aloe lotion, they make a great combo ...</li>
            <li> Cruelty free, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, and really seems to help the breakouts on my face and shoulders.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday care of oily skin.</li>
            <li> After only having used it for 6 days, I&#x27;d say these are amazing results.  </li>
            <li> And also feels great if you leave it on for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I picked up a tube of Acnedote in a health food store near  my house, and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I had some success with Proactiv as a teenager, but it eventually stopped working for me.</li>
            <li> It smells so fresh, like aromatherapy, and reminds me of being at the spa.  </li>
            <li> so I always leave the shower feeling fresh faced.</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural also.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to go more natural with all of my beauty products</li>
            <li> this by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t perfect, but this does more for  me than any other product has, and without the harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li> Even our most recent male house guest commented on how much he enjoyed it!</li>
            <li> First time using this face wash and my face felt so clean, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my breakout quickly and painlessly- the walnut shell bits are definitely exfoliating but not abrasive, and I think my skin looks better after using it for a week.</li>
            <li> Its so hard to find a face wash that has a nice scent and a really great overall</li>
            <li> I have the best results using it once a day, or every other day, and then using some sort of mild cleanser for the other times I wash my face.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my daily basis staying clean and fresh trying to be acne free.</li>
            <li> and I have seen good results in less than 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> but I strongly advise those of you with sensitive, acne prone skin not use this product.</li>
            <li> Natural peeling beads (crushed nutshell) work great.</li>
            <li> , the scrub is gentle and leaves your whole body smooth and refreshed........</li>
            <li> Very soothing for the face/body, you will notice results quickly.</li>
            <li> While most face scrub washes can be more of a paste like product that needs to be firmly squeezed out (</li>
            <li> and I would definitely recommend others to try this if you aren&#x27;t happy with your current acne products!</li>
            <li> and it did great for the big break outs on my back using once a day.</li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of crystals and they are just the right size for you to feel like they are really cleansing your skin.</li>
            <li> The best part is a little bit goes a long way so</li>
            <li> At first I was so excited about something new</li>
            <li> After using it twice a day for only four days I am already noticing a huge difference in my acne!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft, refreshed, and blemish free...</li>
            <li> but I definitely always buy another :)</li>
            <li> and it works way better; no big break outs.</li>
            <li> It contains a lot of natural ingredients to help the skin heal and smooth.</li>
            <li> Just got my first bunch of ALBA products</li>
            <li> I would like it to have some more moisturizing properties to it, and all these big manufacturers need to stop screwing around with 2% salicylic acid</li>
            <li> Pretty immediately, I was hooked.</li>
            <li> I think you would get a better shot with panoxyl bar soap 10% peroxide, it helps my back acne, i can tell you that.</li>
            <li> All in all i got exactly what i was shopping for</li>
            <li> I am prone to the occasional hormonal breakout, and while I owned many products for my face, I didn&#x27;t have any for the rest of my body.  </li>
            <li> This scrub works wonder at keeping breakouts at bay and leaves skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost at the end of my first bottle</li>
            <li> I had been loyal to them for years, but wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean and and smooth and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> I so far love ALL tge Alba Botanica priducts that I have used so far.</li>
            <li> I am starting to love the whole alba line.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub, really all alba products and the acnedote line works especially well.</li>
            <li> I really like it very much, can you tell?</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is good for your whole body, and you only need a small amount to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Then, I came across Alba&#x27;s Acnedote on Amazon and saw the overwhelmingly positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I think it smells kind of like a whiskey sour</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a good quality exfoliator that is not too harsh.</li>
            <li> I would advise against using this product more than 1X/day because it is 2% salicylic acid and could dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing, I was concerned that the walnut shells would be large and sparse.  </li>
            <li> (I even bought a new line of products from Origins 2 days later since I was sure a product from walmart couldn&#x27;t work all that well on my face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really wish there were more products for people struggling with acne as well as excessively dry skin.</li>
            <li> I suffered from acne, and my skin is very oily.</li>
            <li> It is very runny and ends up all over the shower and not on me.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve ended up wasting so much product because it pours out.</li>
            <li> It would disappear fast though, but it kept happening over and over.</li>
            <li> I use it with a mesh sponge for my body - it&#x27;s been great at preventing or reducing the acne I sometimes get on my back from working out, and I occasionally use it with my Clarisonic face brush when I need extra exfoliation on my face.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> So it really works to exfoliate your skin.</li>
            <li> This is gentle and exfoliating.</li>
            <li> It works very well...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what else to say besides that.</li>
            <li> I actually really like the smell this has</li>
            <li> this product clears acne fast anywhere on your body, and it leathers up well</li>
            <li> I also really like the scent.  </li>
            <li> and it really does work,</li>
            <li> I really like the Alba brand</li>
            <li> Be gentle when using on the face.</li>
            <li> but I would pay twice as much for the results I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li> and he don&#x27;t have to use the strips as much as he used to.</li>
            <li> (I think the peppermint in it really stands out) and it really feels like it&#x27;s scrubbing away the ick.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> It lathers up almost as much as a soap</li>
            <li> My face is normally very oily, where I can see beads of oil on my nose an hour after washing my face.  </li>
            <li> Panoxyl with 10% benzoyl peroxide has recently kept my skin pretty clear, but I did not want to put so many chemicals on my skin, which is why I decided to try something all natural.</li>
            <li> I came across this line initially because I was researching vegan friendly products that do not do animal testing.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and i am very satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> My favorite product, use it everyday, all natural and mild but gets the &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; done.</li>
            <li> I like that this scrub has a little more grit to it than most scrubs out there without being too rough.</li>
            <li> I have plenty of acne, and pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Before I found this I was battling adult acne and had a pretty ruddy complexion.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels super soft and clean, without feeling dry or irritated (and I have really sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> I have been using this scrub for over a year and a half, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> this is not runny yet a slight more liquid based with fluidity.</li>
            <li> Tried many different scrubs but keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> Will keep this as my main scrub.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has mild to severe ache.</li>
            <li> Finely ground enough to not grind away at your skin, but coarse enough to provide comfortable exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone with or without problem skin.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cleanser and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I have adult acne I can&#x27;t seem to get rid of, but this has REALLY helped.</li>
            <li> i really like this product so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no negative side affects.</li>
            <li> with normal skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; skin before but this gets me pretty close -- to where for the first time I&#x27;m not completely horrified to leave the house without makeup.  </li>
            <li> bought this to my brother wich take proteins everyday because the gym point its those protein make your face brote alot more..</li>
            <li> I use it once a day, before bedtime, and find that it is not too harsh on my skin AND keeps most blemishes away.</li>
            <li> I washed my face with it again about and hour ago and to relieve the burning on my face, I have aloe lotion that I normally reserve for sunburns on my face.</li>
            <li> I currently do not have one pimple on my face and have seen a good deal less oil (which is a major concern of mine over the summer).</li>
            <li> Even the deep blackheads on my nose that have been there for years are getting a little better!</li>
            <li> On top of that, my normally pale skin is redder than an embarrassed tomato.</li>
            <li> not too gritty or harsh-just right.</li>
            <li> and I was really excited about using it, however, after the first use it turned my skin brutally dry and red.</li>
            <li> The smell is strange but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting a lively, citrusy scent from an acne product.  </li>
            <li> 2nd Sulfer Soap (can be found cheap on Amazon, 3rd 10% Sulfer ointment (can also be found on Amazon)</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Ives peach scrub yet never really noticed anything special and figured i was just donating money, not the case with this scrub wash.</li>
            <li> So far have just used this and the toner, looking forward to trying it all!</li>
            <li> Natural and works!</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin feeling soft!</li>
            <li> first discovered this on Amazon, but realized my local organic health food story carries it for a lower cost.</li>
            <li> It is a bit harsh on the skin, so I only use it once daily, but it does a good job of rejuvenating my skin and keeping my acne under control.</li>
            <li> Something that I really liked was that it didn&#x27;t hurt like crazy when a little got in my eye, and it was rather easy to clean out.</li>
            <li> , it leaves a strong odor (one i like) and will dry visibly white on your skin</li>
            <li> Full body use is definitely a plus, looking forward to my nightly shower and cant wait to smell minty, especially since it isn&#x27;t an overbearing smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pleasant, faint scent.</li>
            <li> I do put moisturizer on right after using this because it will dry out your skin</li>
            <li> If you have difficult skin or just need good natural skin care, you won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> This is the best scrub for those little blackheads you get on your shoulders, back, and behind - I&#x27;ve heen using it for over a year.</li>
            <li> I think it may even be helping to clear up my skin</li>
            <li> I used this in hopes to clear my acne without over drying.</li>
            <li> My face has started to clear up after just using this for a week.</li>
            <li> It definitely has made a difference in how clear our skin is (we just use it on our faces, though it is marketed for the whole body).</li>
            <li> and my skin is almost clear.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I used Proactiv once at a friend&#x27;s house and my skin was irritated for a couple of days, so I&#x27;m sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, acne prone and this one works for me.</li>
            <li> All natural.  </li>
            <li> Finally a reasonably priced face wash that doesn&#x27;t add to my recently acquired skin problems.</li>
            <li> It made my skin smooth by peeling off dead skin.</li>
            <li> I also like that it is all natural products, and</li>
            <li> I promise if you are an adult with acne this regiment will clear your skin and reduce the redness from acne scars.</li>
            <li> I like the natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I started using this product line when I was overseas since there wasn&#x27;t much selection at our local PX.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sensitive to Salicylic Acid, this is not the face wash for you.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin, including eczema, and I can use this scrub on my face and body.  </li>
            <li> It DOES NOT over strip the face and thank Heaven because my face is sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne</li>
            <li> Natural product that smooths your skin.  </li>
            <li> Is also all natural.</li>
            <li> It really gets all the nooks and crannies and I felt like my skin was finally even textured.</li>
            <li> Im 24 years old.</li>
            <li> The scrub is not at all harsh, it leaves my skin smooth without traumatizing it.  </li>
            <li> Mmm Good!&lt;br /&gt;After a quick test wash, i noticed my skin had a tight snap as if it was brand new.</li>
            <li> Once upon a time, I used Proactiv with much success and decided to order it again despite the amount of chemicals in it that I have been avoiding in all other products.  </li>
            <li> I have not noticed if it is clearing up my acne on my face, however it reduces the amount of oil and dead skin on my face significantly.  </li>
            <li> It also comes in a large tube and lasts a long time, as I just use it on my face.</li>
            <li> Proactiv didn&#x27;t work half this good, and Alba is only half the price!</li>
            <li> It took me about two weeks to get my skin back to normal.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I have very dry, very sensitive skin, and pretty moderate acne.</li>
            <li> I bought this because Wal-Mart was out of my usual Clean and Clear blackhead scrub</li>
            <li> It is natural and does not dry you out!</li>
            <li> not much is needed and worth the price ( double even?</li>
            <li> but I was very pleasantly surprised to find that this did not dry my face out, even using it 2 times a day.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it takes a little effort to keep the bottle clean.  </li>
            <li> I switched back to using the aveeno clear complexion bar</li>
            <li> I struggle with keeping my back clear of acne.  </li>
            <li> I actually find this to be almost like a natural version of that scrub.  </li>
            <li> The scrub is not rough and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> But only 3 days in, my skin was completely stripped of any moisture because of this product.</li>
            <li> I am a 35 year old female and have had severe acne since the age of 12</li>
            <li> this product Acnedote completely cleared my back and chest in a matter of days.</li>
            <li> also left my skin feeling soft for over a week after using it once.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My face is not sensitive, it is normal.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, oily T zone with normal skin on my cheeks, so I&#x27;m guessing it dried out the skin on my cheeks too much.</li>
            <li> , I know that sounds weird, but it is the closest thing I could think of to compare the smell to, but its a nice smell</li>
            <li> Normally products with salycic acid really dry my face out</li>
            <li> And the other face wash I have been using doesn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li> The small particles in the scrub make for a very gentle, soothing cleaning!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed at how well this scrub has worked with my acne compared to other products.</li>
            <li> and my arms feel really clean and slightly tingly after (like an icy feeling).</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this body scrub for roughly 2 years when we made the choice to switch to something a little more natural versus the typical chemical type products offered by Dove, Dial, Axe, etc.  </li>
            <li> I stopped washing my face with soaps and scrubs, and I usually use the Oil Cleansing Method, but when I started getting hormonal breakouts, I needed something with a little more power.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and takes away my dry skin patches.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Pro___, and it helped, but certainly didn&#x27;t cure anything, and it is so harsh and bleaches things.  </li>
            <li> Not too much, not too little.</li>
            <li> I used this product 3 times and my face turned bright red, bumpy and is painful to the touch.</li>
            <li> Unlike other scrubs with large, rough particles that scratch my face.</li>
            <li> I tried it out as soon as it arrived, and was surprised when it didn&#x27;t burn my face like other acne products do.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the shower gets full of the brown grains and they are difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> The use of things like ground walnut shells instead glass micro beads, not only uses a product normally discarded as waste, but protects the environment as well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite long lasting.</li>
            <li> This will last me a long time!</li>
            <li> I think the cold just means it working, and personally I love when you can actually feel a product working.</li>
            <li> My forehead is a complete mess.</li>
            <li> but i was looking for something a little stronger as far as a cleanser.</li>
            <li> use it a couple times a day and it does not dry my face out like other products.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the product comes out of the container a bit too generously - the tube&#x27;s opening is probably a bit too large given the consistency of the product, but I&#x27;ve learned to be careful when squeezing it out.</li>
            <li> Within a few days of using it again, all was clear.</li>
            <li> My acne is mostly low grade (but always present) with a few larger pimples.  </li>
            <li> so it feels stretched.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t like harsh face washes or soaps.</li>
            <li> My skin is &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; and not sensitive whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I found this strange, but I&#x27;m not complaining</li>
            <li> I find it a bit rough for my face, but will use it occasionally to exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a years long search for a working acne scrub, I came across the Alba products.</li>
            <li> I use other products on my face, but not on my chest or back.</li>
            <li> I used only a small amount, which was enough to cover my entire face, and rubbed it in for about a minute, and let it sit for five minutes before rinsing.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s both dry and oily (ARGH).</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with an oily t-zone but dry cheeks.  </li>
            <li> (oily in summer, dry in winter)</li>
            <li> It does dry out my skin a bit</li>
            <li> After trying a dozen different types over a few years she settled on this one and hasn&#x27;t looked back.</li>
            <li> Initially it was a little harsh for my skin since I wasn&#x27;t used to exfoliating like this every wash, but my skin adjusted and has had a complete turn around.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way, so i think this bottle will last for a while.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t dry my skin out anymore than it already is, but made it softer than I can ever remember!</li>
            <li> I also wanted the cleanser to be organic (or as close to it as possible), and, finally, I didn&#x27;t want to have to pay a small fortune for a bottle the size of a shot glass.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have bad skin but a few blemishes and breakouts, and I can already tell my skin is looking clearer and more even!</li>
            <li> it also helps with my dark spots (I have medium dark skin- Caribbean American).</li>
            <li> Previously, I used a Biore product (with the same active ingredient, also 2%), but still had periodic breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Its scrubby enough, but not too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> The wash can be a bit messy if it dies out on the cap but not a total inconvenience just a heads up.</li>
            <li> but it is rough enough to slough off dead skin cells WITHOUT drying your skin.</li>
            <li> After when my face was dry, it didn&#x27;t look oily at all like other scrubs make it!</li>
            <li> I suggest using while over a sink or at least being gentle as you squeeze, aggression is not needed to get this scrub out the bottle and the usual force may cause a spill.</li>
            <li> The giant zits on my cheeks and chin are fading faster than ever, and almost all of the little blackheads on my forehead are gone!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have thought cola without reading other reviews.  </li>
            <li> not minty like other people have said.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and every other day sometimes with no problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different body washes and stuff and one day I saw this at Wal-Mart and decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was due to stopping birth control, from the stress of buying a house, an increased workload at my job, or a combination of those and more, but I have been pretty miserable.  </li>
            <li> Of course, this is partly due to the way I used it,</li>
            <li> and so went to that at this point, and I actually started with my usual breakouts again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also the bottle absolutely sucks because the hole is too big and the product is too runny</li>
            <li> put a few drops of tea tree oil on it, stick it under the running faucet for a sec to dilute it and apply.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine what it is doing when it goes down my drain.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not rating it very high is because now I&#x27;m sitting here with a painful, burning face.</li>
            <li> I get it for significantly less than what Target sells it.</li>
            <li> The scrub is chocolate colored with no smell and turns slightly creamy once rubbed on.</li>
            <li> And my BF he have lots of black head on his nose</li>
            <li> My husband had previously bought this for himself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a little over a week</li>
            <li> I started using this face scrub a little over a year ago, and I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> And it has a little lather also.</li>
            <li> so I save a little $</li>
            <li> i use this with a little brush.</li>
            <li> When I say horrible, I mean worse than I had ever had even as a teenager -- large cystic acne mostly around my mouth and chin.  </li>
            <li> But I do have that crazy skin thing on the back of my arms where I get tiny bumps of ingrown hairs or &amp;#34;excessive skin growth&amp;#34; as the dermatologist calls it.  </li>
            <li> The Salicylic Acid ingredient helps remove oil, dirt, and pore-clogged dead skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this item a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought it a few times now</li>
            <li> I use this everyday in the shower.</li>
            <li> However, it was not effective in reducing the closed comedones and made me break out on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I used to get breakouts on my arms, back and chest, which is not greatly reduced.</li>
            <li> its not too harsh, scrubs and has salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> I have reordered it a few times now and got some of my family using it.</li>
            <li> It only seemed to make things worse though.  </li>
            <li> how well it exfoliates and it does not feel harsh on my face at all.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now.</li>
            <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t waste my money.</li>
            <li> The scrub is dark brown and not too thick, so it tends to leave traces on the bottle that need to be cleaned off every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a cleanser that seemingly impossible to find for a very l o n g time.</li>
            <li> My face looked dull and had a little breakout.</li>
            <li> I usually get then at ulta or target</li>
            <li> just one random really big pimple.</li>
            <li> Small amount needed.</li>
            <li> No more cystic bumps forming, and existing blemishes are disappearing.  </li>
            <li> I usually get break out once a month when it&#x27;s that time of the month.</li>
            <li> , I usually buy St.</li>
            <li> I usually swear by st ives apricot scrub.</li>
            <li> I have used proactive in the past but had an allergic reaction to it after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> The scrubbing particles are relatively small.  </li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical about the 100% vegetarian ingredients, thinking that it wouldn&#x27;t work, but boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was WAY too harsh for my face and caused me to break out like crazy and left me with dry patches all over.</li>
            <li> I am digging the receipt out of the trash and returning this crap first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> I think I will be using this at least a couple of times a week.</li>
            <li> - they need to be putting at least 5%, and in my opinion, offer up to 10%.</li>
            <li> guaranteed to work (at least for me).</li>
            <li> Stop break out and the blemishes slowly fading.</li>
            <li> --I had hardly dared to hope that it would work!</li>
            <li> and my face got ten times worse :(</li>
            <li> I hate the days when it&#x27;s running low</li>
            <li> Much to my 25-year-old misfortune, I for some reason started getting horrible acne in mid-May of this year.  </li>
            <li> it kills the bacteria or whatever is goin on in your poor pores and stops the acne in its tracks.</li>
            <li> When you rinse it off the area in which it was usually turns quite cold.</li>
            <li> I am 24 now and have had troubled skin for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> and he randomly used mine</li>
            <li> and It&#x27;s irritating!!</li>
            <li> It was painful just to make expressions without feeling the effects of this product.</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> I bought this along with the Acnedote astringent and see no difference in my skin :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up returning the expensive Origins line!!!  </li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
            <li> you are as fed up with terrible skin as I was, give this product a try.  </li>
            <li> This stuff made my skin break out horribly on my forehead.</li>
            <li> It might work for some people, but it had horrible effects for me.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The Alba Botanica ACNEdote Face &amp; Body Scrub is a phenomenal product. I suffered from acne, and my skin is very oily. After using this product, I have noticed an amazing improvement in my skin: a reduction in pimples, blackheads, and whiteheads. Moreover, it has helped me manage my oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beauty of this product is that you see results within days--literally. The Salicylic Acid ingredient helps remove oil, dirt, and pore-clogged dead skin. More importantly, it nourishes your skin, which gives clearer skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for clearer, more beautiful skin, I strongly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a chance at it--YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID!!</li>
            <li> I bought this item a few weeks ago. I think its fantastic. My face feels clean and and smooth and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. I bought it with the alba green tea and aloe lotion, they make a great combo ... i will defenately keep buying this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have fair, combination, slightly sensitive skin.  I also have constant acne--jaw, forehead, chin...back...chest...you know the drill.  My acne is mostly low grade (but always present) with a few larger pimples.  I&#x27;ve tried Pro___, and it helped, but certainly didn&#x27;t cure anything, and it is so harsh and bleaches things.  I can&#x27;t imagine what it is doing when it goes down my drain.  :(  I actually find this to be almost like a natural version of that scrub.  Fine grit, if you rub it in your hands a bit you get some foam, and it feels tingly (salicylic acid at work!)  The smell is fine--not my favorite.  I wouldn&#x27;t have thought cola without reading other reviews.  I do put moisturizer on right after using this because it will dry out your skin so it feels stretched.  At first I was so excited about something new so I was using this twice a day, which I think stresses your skin.  I have the best results using it once a day, or every other day, and then using some sort of mild cleanser for the other times I wash my face.  So far though, I&#x27;m happy with the results!  I had a friend (who can make such comments) tell me that my skin was clearing up and she asked what I was doing.  Good sign!  This doesn&#x27;t stop me from period time break outs, but I&#x27;m pretty sure nothing can.  Overall, I&#x27;m pleased!  It also helped immediately with body acne--though, again, moisturize!</li>
            <li> I so far love ALL tge Alba Botanica priducts that I have used so far. This one leaves your skin feeling fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone with or without problem skin.  My skin feels very clean, not stripped of all its moisture.  The scrub is not rough and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> It is very runny and ends up all over the shower and not on me.  I feel like I am wasting product.  I like the scrubs that are a bit more dense.</li>
            <li> Works great for my skin, been using for it for a while. Refreshes the skin but if you have acne marks, it might make skin look red for sometime.</li>
            <li> Started using this two days ago, twice a day. Cannot even begin to describe how effective it is in getting rid of acne. Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and have seen no change in my mild/moderate acne. Oh well. But I still love the scrub, it smells like oranges.....not minty like other people have said. Also the bottle absolutely sucks because the hole is too big and the product is too runny so I&#x27;ve ended up wasting so much product because it pours out. I bought this along with the Acnedote astringent and see no difference in my skin :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a cleanser that seemingly impossible to find for a very l o n g time. I needed the product to exfoliate, and for it to have acne-fighting properties. I also wanted the cleanser to be organic (or as close to it as possible), and, finally, I didn&#x27;t want to have to pay a small fortune for a bottle the size of a shot glass. Alba&#x27;s Acne-dote meets all of these criteria, and most importantly, it works. I highly recommend this cleanser and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and i am very satisfied so far. It leaves my skin soft and supple. I also love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this soap and the smell !</li>
            <li> this is such a great product, it really reeeeally works. Leaves skin soft, refreshed, and blemish free...it also helps with my dark spots (I have medium dark skin- Caribbean American). I hate the days when it&#x27;s running low but I definitely always buy another :)</li>
            <li> I really LOVE this product. Nice subtle scent, lathers while exfoliating, perfect for daily use.</li>
            <li> This product smells and feels great. I think it may even be helping to clear up my skin--I had hardly dared to hope that it would work!</li>
            <li> I love  alba products. I usually get then at ulta or target but i was looking for something a little stronger as far as a cleanser. this acne line is amazing. i can tell a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this between washings with my prescription-based wash. This is great for traveling, it&#x27;s easy to use and affordable.</li>
            <li> I picked up a tube of Acnedote in a health food store near  my house, and fell in love with it. I was delighted to learn that I could order it on Amazon! It is a bit harsh on the skin, so I only use it once daily, but it does a good job of rejuvenating my skin and keeping my acne under control. My skin isn&#x27;t perfect, but this does more for  me than any other product has, and without the harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li> The whole line of Alba Acnedote products is amazing! I purchased the cleanser, the face and body scrub, the astringent, and the oil control lotion and I have seen good results in less than 2 weeks of use. I currently do not have one pimple on my face and have seen a good deal less oil (which is a major concern of mine over the summer). Your skin just feels cleaner after using this and it smells great! I am 24 now and have had troubled skin for over 10 years. I have tried just about every over the counter product you can imagine. I had some success with Proactiv as a teenager, but it eventually stopped working for me. Panoxyl with 10% benzoyl peroxide has recently kept my skin pretty clear, but I did not want to put so many chemicals on my skin, which is why I decided to try something all natural. I came across this line initially because I was researching vegan friendly products that do not do animal testing. Due to the company&#x27;s cruelty free guarantee and the fact that it got such good reviews, I decided to give this line a shot and am so glad I did! If you have difficult skin or just need good natural skin care, you won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> Great scrub. I pair this with St. Ives. The exfoliation beads are a perfect size and the smell is nice too.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ll just add my great review to the rest. I have plenty of acne, and pretty sensitive skin that&#x27;s both dry and oily (ARGH). I used Proactiv once at a friend&#x27;s house and my skin was irritated for a couple of days, so I&#x27;m sensitive. This scrub is FANTASTIC. Cruelty free, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, and really seems to help the breakouts on my face and shoulders. Also no stinky perfume--I am allergic and companies seem to feel it&#x27;s necessary to put perfume in facial care products, ick. This just smells like peppermint and feels so nice. So far have just used this and the toner, looking forward to trying it all!</li>
            <li> When i started using this product, i noticed my skin get clearer automatically, but it lasted only for a couple days. I started getting more and more ibg breakouts; meaning not sections of breakouts just one random really big pimple. It would disappear fast though, but it kept happening over and over. I switched back to using the aveeno clear complexion bar and it works way better; no big break outs.</li>
            <li> My face is not sensitive, it is normal. after about two uses of this product my face was red and puffy. It hurt to the touch. I looked like a lobster! I had to go to work like this and it was quiet embarrassing as it lasted for days! I tried neosporin since it is a chemical burn but nothing seems to help it but time. Horrible product. I don&#x27;t know how there are so many good reviews...</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. Of course, when I switched products my skin was irritated for a bit but after it got use to it, my skin looks so much better. Works well as a body scrub too. Has an interesting (but good) smell to it.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today and so far, I&#x27;m very happy with it! I was worried that it might be one of those scrubbing bead scrubs. You know, the type that doesn&#x27;t actually exfoliate your skin? Well it not! It is an actual scrub with a wonderful consistency. My face felt clean and well scrubbed after the first use. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase! And another thing, 8 ounces is a lot! This will last me a long time!</li>
            <li> The product is 100% vegetarian and unlike most acne scrubs, doesn’t have all the parabens and sulfates. My face felt quite refreshed even after my 27 years it is still important to cleanse the pores. It was especially good in the shower for the whole body. definitely a must have! For the price too?!? its cheaper than most of the BS brands that have all the chemicals in them to make the price “cheaper”??!  It is definitely more suitable for the shower as it does have a lot of exfoliating beads but I am definitely getting this again.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub. I&#x27;ve bought it a few times now and I&#x27;ve always been pleased with the results. Its scrubby enough, but not too harsh on my skin. It also smells great!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use it with a mesh sponge for my body - it&#x27;s been great at preventing or reducing the acne I sometimes get on my back from working out, and I occasionally use it with my Clarisonic face brush when I need extra exfoliation on my face. The ground walnut particles are nice and smooth exfoliators, and the minty scent is terrific! In all, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s one of my all-time favorite scrubs for face or body.    My only complaint is that the product comes out of the container a bit too generously - the tube&#x27;s opening is probably a bit too large given the consistency of the product, but I&#x27;ve learned to be careful when squeezing it out.</li>
            <li> I use it on my daily basis staying clean and fresh trying to be acne free.</li>
            <li> My favorite product, use it everyday, all natural and mild but gets the &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; done. I have sensitive skin, acne prone and this one works for me. Tried many different scrubs but keep coming back to this one.I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday in the shower. I feel it&#x27;s instrumental in keeping my skin almost acne free. It&#x27;s effective but not overly abrasive on the skin.</li>
            <li> This product checks many boxes for me.  No animal testing.  All natural.  100% vegetarian.  The use of things like ground walnut shells instead glass micro beads, not only uses a product normally discarded as waste, but protects the environment as well.  The abrasive quality of the walnut shells, as used in this scrub, is amazing.  I struggle with keeping my back clear of acne.  This Alba scrub goes on easy, feels great while &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; it in and washes really clean, squeeky clean.  I was so impressed that immediately after using I could see much clearer skin.  I think I will be using this at least a couple of times a week.</li>
            <li> It does its job as a scrub, and leaves my face feeling clean. However it didn&#x27;t help with my acne; I may need something more aggressive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a little over a week and I love it. It makes my skin feel soft and takes away my dry skin patches. I use it every day and every other day sometimes with no problems.</li>
            <li> Finally a reasonably priced face wash that doesn&#x27;t add to my recently acquired skin problems. I love the ground walnut shells for exfoliation and i really like the sent of all of it&#x27;s ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> Best exfoliator for face and body, I&#x27;m loving it!!!!</li>
            <li> I stopped washing my face with soaps and scrubs, and I usually use the Oil Cleansing Method, but when I started getting hormonal breakouts, I needed something with a little more power.  I still don&#x27;t use this every day because I don&#x27;t want to over-do it with the scrub, but this is a really nice face wash that leaves my skin feeling very refreshed.  I think it smells kind of like a whiskey sour, I know that sounds weird, but it is the closest thing I could think of to compare the smell to, but its a nice smell I think.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Pleasant, faint scent. Cleared up my breakout quickly and painlessly- the walnut shell bits are definitely exfoliating but not abrasive, and I think my skin looks better after using it for a week. Will keep this as my main scrub.</li>
            <li> I picked this out at target about a month ago and I was really excited about using it, however, after the first use it turned my skin brutally dry and red. It took me about two weeks to get my skin back to normal. I know everyones skin is different but I strongly advise those of you with sensitive, acne prone skin not use this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! I love using this. It is natural and does not dry you out! Feels tingly. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought the face and body scrub. It made my skin smooth by peeling off dead skin. However, it was not effective in reducing the closed comedones and made me break out on my cheeks. I have combination skin, oily T zone with normal skin on my cheeks, so I&#x27;m guessing it dried out the skin on my cheeks too much. Perhaps a combination of all Acnedote products will work better than this product alone. I have never had great success with salicylic acid though. Proactiv on the other hand worked great on my skin. But I switched back to Aveeno Skin Brightening Daily Scrub, which has no salicylic acid. It does have fragrance though, which is why I had switched to this product, but I would rather have fragrance than salicylic acid anyday! Especially when it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I like that this scrub has a little more grit to it than most scrubs out there without being too rough. So it really works to exfoliate your skin. It also comes in a large tube and lasts a long time, as I just use it on my face. I also like that it is all natural products, and great for oily, acne prone skin like mine.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub!  It smells so fresh, like aromatherapy, and reminds me of being at the spa.  My skin looks amazing since I started using this product.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great scent and texture. Very good for a once or twice a week heavy duty scrub.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t like harsh face washes or soaps. This is gentle and exfoliating. I have skin that&#x27;s on the dryer side but get zits from working out and during more hormonal times of the month. This has significantly improved my breakouts. I don&#x27;t have acne issues, but this does a really great job fighting pimples with my skin type. I went from having one or two zits almost all the time (one heals and another pops out) to virtually none.</li>
            <li> I loved the organic part of this wash, I also loved the texture of it and it definitely felt like it was scrubbing away all the impurities. HOWEVER, I have very dry, very sensitive skin, and pretty moderate acne. I used this in hopes to clear my acne without over drying. But only 3 days in, my skin was completely stripped of any moisture because of this product. It was painful just to make expressions without feeling the effects of this product. I really wish there were more products for people struggling with acne as well as excessively dry skin. My journey to find my perfect cleanser shall continue.</li>
            <li> I started using this about 5 months ago, and I have noticed a huge difference! I used to get breakouts on my arms, back and chest, which is not greatly reduced. It also helps reduce breakouts on my face. I also use Albas AcneDote face wipes, which work wonders as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super happy to find a face wash that works for me and that doesn&#x27;t get tested on animals. Thank you Alba!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is notoriously picky about her face wash. After trying a dozen different types over a few years she settled on this one and hasn&#x27;t looked back. I tried it out and now I&#x27;m hooked too. It&#x27;s made up of ground walnut shell which does an amazing job exfoliating so I always leave the shower feeling fresh faced. It never dries out my skin or leaves me feeling oily. Neither of us struggles with severe acne but we have both seen an improvement in our skin since using this face wash. Even our most recent male house guest commented on how much he enjoyed it! The best part is a little bit goes a long way so even though our household uses it 2-3 times a day (between two people) we only have to buy it every two months.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday care of oily skin. Natural peeling beads (crushed nutshell) work great. It contains a lot of natural ingredients to help the skin heal and smooth.</li>
            <li> Quite simply the best face scrub I&#x27;ve ever used. I love the smell, the way it works, and the fact that it prevents acne. As a face scrub addict, this is THE BEST one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Natural and works! My only complaint is the shower gets full of the brown grains and they are difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> I use this for my back, and it&#x27;s wonderful. I workout a lot and whenever I start taking protein I get blackheads on my upper back for some reason. I&#x27;m not sure why, I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different body washes and stuff and one day I saw this at Wal-Mart and decided to give it a shot. It works very well... I don&#x27;t really know what else to say besides that. Lol</li>
            <li> First time using this face wash and my face felt so clean, smooth and soft. Very pleased with this product. I am starting to love the whole alba line.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face and shoulders smooth and acne free. Forgot to bring it with me while traveling for Thanksgiving. Big mistake! My face looked dull and had a little breakout. Within a few days of using it again, all was clear. Gentle enough to use every day and very effective and smoothing skin and managing acne.</li>
            <li> Smells like sunshine. Good amount of scrubbyness. Not too much, not too little. Goldilocks of face scrubs.</li>
            <li> I love the fine grain and pepperminty smell of this product. I use it every morning in the shower for my face, neck, and chest area. It is invigorating and adds to my skin regimen helping to prevent acne.</li>
            <li> I am a 35 year old female and have had severe acne since the age of 12 I have been to dozens of dermatologists and been on everything from Retin-A and ProActive to Accutane twice! But finally I have found the cure to my acne it involves 3 things 1st this product Acnedote completely cleared my back and chest in a matter of days. 2nd Sulfer Soap (can be found cheap on Amazon, 3rd 10% Sulfer ointment (can also be found on Amazon) I promise if you are an adult with acne this regiment will clear your skin and reduce the redness from acne scars.</li>
            <li> This scrub smells clean and fresh and works great. My skin is clear and I love that this product is free of nasty plastic beads and perfume. Excellent.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this body scrub for roughly 2 years when we made the choice to switch to something a little more natural versus the typical chemical type products offered by Dove, Dial, Axe, etc.  One tube will usually last the 2 of us about 1.5 to 2 weeks with daily use.  I have this set up on auto-ship so with the discount I get it for significantly less than what Target sells it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. its not too harsh, scrubs and has salicylic acid. It&#x27;s quite long lasting. I use it just once a week though for mild acne.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub, really all alba products and the acnedote line works especially well. I like the natural ingredients - the smell is fine, its not perfume-y but not antiseptic, it does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li> I started using this product line when I was overseas since there wasn&#x27;t much selection at our local PX. To my luck this stuff is awesome. Leaves your face feeling refreshed and super clean. I have reordered it a few times now and got some of my family using it. It has done what&#x27;s supposed and cleared up some of my acne. If you have&#x27;t used before I would say go for it. way better than most products I&#x27;ve tried that cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> My face has started to clear up after just using this for a week.</li>
            <li> Love this product for both face and body. It is also my go-to bikini area scrub to keep ingrown hairs away. It has a nice, natural smell, too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this on my face and I don&#x27;t have body acne.  But I do have that crazy skin thing on the back of my arms where I get tiny bumps of ingrown hairs or &amp;#34;excessive skin growth&amp;#34; as the dermatologist calls it.  It never 100% goes away, but this definitely helps and there is a noticeable decrease when I am using it regularly.  I actually really like the smell this has and my arms feel really clean and slightly tingly after (like an icy feeling).</li>
            <li> I started using this a couple of days ago and my skin feels great. I have a good amount of &amp;#34;backne&amp;#34; and so was excited to try this product out. My skin already feels smoother! The best part is the pepperminty smell and the tiny microbeads feel great on my skin. Very happy with this scrub!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is good for your whole body, and you only need a small amount to get the job done. this product clears acne fast anywhere on your body, and it leathers up well, the scrub is gentle and leaves your whole body smooth and refreshed........</li>
            <li> I started using this face scrub a little over a year ago, and I will never use anything else. It&#x27;s a great product, doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin,and leaves your face feeling really clean.</li>
            <li> This scrub smells awesome, and feels great...HOWEVER, I started using it and my face got ten times worse :( If you&#x27;re sensitive to Salicylic Acid, this is not the face wash for you.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month, and my skin is now blemish free.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Great for people with oily skin and sensitive skin! Very soothing for the face/body, you will notice results quickly. Leaves the skin feeling soft! I love it!</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin, including eczema, and I can use this scrub on my face and body.  I also really like the scent.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff! If you need a great scrub that actually scrubs, then you are going to love this product as I do. Works great. And it has a little lather also. It DOES NOT over strip the face and thank Heaven because my face is sensitive. I really like it very much, can you tell?</li>
            <li> I only use this for my face, so for the price and size it is an awesome value. It is going to last me quite a while. I like that it is quite grainy and it makes my face feel smooth afterwards. I only use it a couple times a week, so I do not find it to be drying at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product to keep acne away and it really does work, even after you shower you feel so clean. I think it has mint in it so it is very refreshing.  I love that it is all natural also.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and I have tried just about everything and I was fed up with all the creams and washes.  Someone recommended it and I think it&#x27;s great.  It works and it doesn&#x27;t smell. It clears my face up.  I feel good when looking in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it a couple times a day and it does not dry my face out like other products.  I have tried them all!  So this was a nice win for my face.  After I use it I feel fresh and like my face is really clean.</li>
            <li> I really like the Alba brand but I probably won&#x27;t buy this again.  It seems to work alright and doesn&#x27;t make me break out but does not have a huge effect on my skin.  I have combination skin with an oily t-zone but dry cheeks.  It has a strong smell - maybe witch hazel or tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> Natural product that smooths your skin.  No chemical irritation. Small amount needed. Use it every day.  Works for teenage skin through wrinkled skin. This is the best scrub product out there!</li>
            <li> I just bought this product last night at Walmart and have noticed great results. I have been trying to go more natural with all of my beauty products and I saw this one and wanted to give it a try. For $7, the container is huge and definitely worth the money. My skin feels super soft and clean, without feeling dry or irritated (and I have really sensitive skin) It is a great product and i&#x27;ve seen it cheaper on amazon. I recommend it to people with any type of skin. I don&#x27;t have bad skin but a few blemishes and breakouts, and I can already tell my skin is looking clearer and more even! The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the smell.</li>
            <li> This is the best scrub for those little blackheads you get on your shoulders, back, and behind - I&#x27;ve heen using it for over a year. I use it with a longhandled brush, and it&#x27;s perfect to use as an ingrown hair preventer before shaving - anywhere. Be gentle when using on the face. The best part is paraben free! Parabens cause breast cancer! Check your deodorant, makeup, toothpaste, lotion, shampoo - switch to a healthy lifestyle now! I love Alba for caring about what goes on my body. The scrub is chocolate colored with no smell and turns slightly creamy once rubbed on. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, I use it every day. Not only does it get did of acne but it gives your face a nice clean feeling. Is also all natural.</li>
            <li> Much to my 25-year-old misfortune, I for some reason started getting horrible acne in mid-May of this year.  When I say horrible, I mean worse than I had ever had even as a teenager -- large cystic acne mostly around my mouth and chin.  Not sure if it was due to stopping birth control, from the stress of buying a house, an increased workload at my job, or a combination of those and more, but I have been pretty miserable.  Once upon a time, I used Proactiv with much success and decided to order it again despite the amount of chemicals in it that I have been avoiding in all other products.  It only seemed to make things worse though.  Then, I came across Alba&#x27;s Acnedote on Amazon and saw the overwhelmingly positive reviews. I was hesitant though because as we all know, skin care is not one size fits all.  But, I went out on a limb and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received it on the night of Sept. 28th and have been using it twice a day since.  I&#x27;ve been ecstatic to see a huge improvement in my skin.  No more cystic bumps forming, and existing blemishes are disappearing.  After only having used it for 6 days, I&#x27;d say these are amazing results.  I love that the ingredients are all-natural, and the scrub aspect of it is perfect.  Finely ground enough to not grind away at your skin, but coarse enough to provide comfortable exfoliation.  My cheeks always have a nice, healthy pink glow to them after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are as fed up with terrible skin as I was, give this product a try.  It&#x27;s definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> My skin is &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; and not sensitive whatsoever. I used this product 3 times and my face turned bright red, bumpy and is painful to the touch. I was really forward to a nice, all natural product but instead got something that ruined my face! Good luck.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I use it on my face, chest and back. All of these areas are pimple prone. I use other products on my face, but not on my chest or back. And that&#x27;s how I know this works. Because the pimples on my chest and face have been noticeably reduced. The smell is strange but not unpleasant. It has just the right amount of crystals and they are just the right size for you to feel like they are really cleansing your skin. When you rinse it off the area in which it was usually turns quite cold. I found this strange, but I&#x27;m not complaining since it does it&#x27;s job. I&#x27;ve had no negative side affects. I think the cold just means it working, and personally I love when you can actually feel a product working.</li>
            <li> Just got my first bunch of ALBA products and I LOVE THE SMELL. Its so hard to find a face wash that has a nice scent and a really great overall feel to it. When i used the scrub I fell in love. It really gets all the nooks and crannies and I felt like my skin was finally even textured. It refreshed my skin to the point where i wanted to sing from the mountain tops about this product. I settled for just telling one of my best girl friends :) The deep pore wash just layered excellence with excellence. I am so in love. I know i have found my favorite skin care line. Im 24 years old. with normal skin. (oily in summer, dry in winter)</li>
            <li> This stuff feels and smells AWESOME. It works too! The only reason I&#x27;m not rating it very high is because now I&#x27;m sitting here with a painful, burning face. Of course, this is partly due to the way I used it, just beware that although it goes on smooth and makes your skin feel great, it&#x27;s easy to scrub that skin right off. Use in moderation at first, get your skin used to this powerful scrub!</li>
            <li> This is my go-to face wash for the last year.  Before I found this I was battling adult acne and had a pretty ruddy complexion.  Initially it was a little harsh for my skin since I wasn&#x27;t used to exfoliating like this every wash, but my skin adjusted and has had a complete turn around.  I&#x27;ve never had &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; skin before but this gets me pretty close -- to where for the first time I&#x27;m not completely horrified to leave the house without makeup.  I have it on my subscribe and save order so I save a little $ but I would pay twice as much for the results I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li> I like this scrub - it&#x27;s very effective. I would like it to have some more moisturizing properties to it, and all these big manufacturers need to stop screwing around with 2% salicylic acid - they need to be putting at least 5%, and in my opinion, offer up to 10%.</li>
            <li> I have been using this scrub for over a year and a half, and I love it.  It&#x27;s not creamy, so it won&#x27;t moisturize, it gives you a really clean feeling!</li>
            <li> Love this wash. My complexion has drastically improved since using this product. I&#x27;ve tried everything (almost) and this by far my favorite. The wash can be a bit messy if it dies out on the cap but not a total inconvenience just a heads up. not much is needed and worth the price ( double even? i don&#x27;t know, sure). 2 thumbs up in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handy tip: for spot treatment, at night first wash with this stuff, get a clean q-tip. put a few drops of tea tree oil on it, stick it under the running faucet for a sec to dilute it and apply. it kills the bacteria or whatever is goin on in your poor pores and stops the acne in its tracks. guaranteed to work (at least for me). for those super problem spots.. don&#x27;t dilute the tea tree oil. fair warning though, it leaves a strong odor (one i like) and will dry visibly white on your skin so that&#x27;s why i recommend this as a night time treatment. And as always, don&#x27;t stress!</li>
            <li> This product smells so good and leaves your skin feeling so soft and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I love how well it exfoliates and it does not feel harsh on my face at all.&lt;br /&gt;It also left my skin feeling soft for over a week after using it once.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good fac scrub&lt;br /&gt;And brownie points it doesn&#x27;t test on animal!</li>
            <li> Used it for years. Smells lemony and is a nice natural alternative.</li>
            <li> bought this to my brother wich take proteins everyday because the gym point its those protein make your face brote alot more..this help for this kind stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for two months now. I have dry/combination skin. I usually get break out once a month when it&#x27;s that time of the month. But two months ago I started to have break out on my T-zone and It&#x27;s irritating!! I went to Wal-mart look for face cleanser and decided to give this a try. After one week using twice a day. morning and before bed. I also used spot gel for the acne after this for treatment. I notice my skin gotten better. Stop break out and the blemishes slowly fading. Glad I found this. And my BF he have lots of black head on his nose and he randomly used mine and he&#x27;s hooked! He said it makes his pores smaller and he don&#x27;t have to use the strips as much as he used to. This has become my daily face wash product now. :D</li>
            <li> This stuff made my skin break out horribly on my forehead. My forehead is a complete mess. It might work for some people, but it had horrible effects for me.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this face wash. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now. Originally it was purchased as an alternative to St Ives Blemish Control Apricot Scrub- I had been loyal to them for years, but wanted to try something new. Pretty immediately, I was hooked. The smell is great (I think the peppermint in it really stands out) and it really feels like it&#x27;s scrubbing away the ick. I would advise against using this product more than 1X/day because it is 2% salicylic acid and could dry your skin out. I use it once a day, before bedtime, and find that it is not too harsh on my skin AND keeps most blemishes away.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Before purchasing, I was concerned that the walnut shells would be large and sparse.  I was pleased to find that they were ground finely about like sand and the wash was full of them.</li>
            <li> I love Alba products. Work great. Gets the job done. Great for &#x27;backne&#x27; and T zone. I have 3 sitting in my bathroom, so I am locked and loaded.</li>
            <li> Great exfoliator and doesn&#x27;t make my skin breakout!  I highly recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for a good quality exfoliator that is not too harsh.</li>
            <li> I bought this because Wal-Mart was out of my usual Clean and Clear blackhead scrub and I thought that I would give this a try. I had no problems when I bought it yesterday. However, it started to burn when I used it this morning. I washed my face with it again about and hour ago and to relieve the burning on my face, I have aloe lotion that I normally reserve for sunburns on my face. On top of that, my normally pale skin is redder than an embarrassed tomato. i also already have some skin peeling. It burns the most close to my eye area. I am digging the receipt out of the trash and returning this crap first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> My husband had previously bought this for himself. After I tried it, I fell in love with it. I love the smell and the way my skin feels after cleansing, so I had to purchase one for myself!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It works better than anything else I have used.  It smells good and has a nice texture to it.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> The smell is really nice, but then again, it didnt work. I used it for about 2 months. I think you would get a better shot with panoxyl bar soap 10% peroxide, it helps my back acne, i can tell you that. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I Recently bought this face and body scrub and was instantly captivated by the minty aroma ...Mmm Mmm Good!&lt;br /&gt;After a quick test wash, i noticed my skin had a tight snap as if it was brand new. The ingredients are vegetarian which is preferred and there are microbeads that also give a good exfoliation whilst washing. All in all i got exactly what i was shopping for, I usually buy St.Ives peach scrub yet never really noticed anything special and figured i was just donating money, not the case with this scrub wash. Full body use is definitely a plus, looking forward to my nightly shower and cant wait to smell minty, especially since it isn&#x27;t an overbearing smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My only con is actually a Pro as well, hence the five stars. While most face scrub washes can be more of a paste like product that needs to be firmly squeezed out (ie: St.Ives) this is not runny yet a slight more liquid based with fluidity. I suggest using while over a sink or at least being gentle as you squeeze, aggression is not needed to get this scrub out the bottle and the usual force may cause a spill. I feel it adds a more natural feel to the overall experience, btw my skin feels and looks great and i love how it easily spreads so you don&#x27;t have to use alot and can save more of your face/body wash over time. Hope this helps you on your quest. Cheers!</li>
            <li> i bought this cause i read all the reweiws, I thought I give it a try. I wish I didn&#x27;t waste my money.</li>
            <li> I am prone to the occasional hormonal breakout, and while I owned many products for my face, I didn&#x27;t have any for the rest of my body.  This scrub works wonder at keeping breakouts at bay and leaves skin smooth and soft.  I find it a bit rough for my face, but will use it occasionally to exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first discovered this on Amazon, but realized my local organic health food story carries it for a lower cost.</li>
            <li> I usually swear by st ives apricot scrub. But I love the minty scent of this wash &amp; theres a bit more of the scrub and foamy feel with it which I like. I continue to break out on my chin here &amp; there but since Ive started to use this wash, it has curbed the size &amp; duration of the pimples. Definitely feel a difference. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this scrub for a couple years. We keep it in the shower and use it daily. It definitely has made a difference in how clear our skin is (we just use it on our faces, though it is marketed for the whole body). We try to stick to cruelty-free products and there is nothing comparable that comes even close to beating the price. I have to have this!</li>
            <li> I started using the product about a week ago and I really like it. This scrub has a nice fresh scent that I really love. There&#x27;s something in there that exfoliates the skin and leaves it feeling very fresh and clean. I&#x27;m interested in trying some of their other products as well since this one has impressed me so much! I&#x27;ve used many other products including Proactiv, for years, and Alba does a great job, better than most! Shipping was fast and no hassles of any kind.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed if it is clearing up my acne on my face, however it reduces the amount of oil and dead skin on my face significantly.  And also feels great if you leave it on for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It smells perfect and helps my skin. i use this with a little brush. I would definitely but that again!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I have very sensitive and dry skin. I have used proactive in the past but had an allergic reaction to it after a couple uses. And the other face wash I have been using doesn&#x27;t really do anything. I&#x27;m almost at the end of my first bottle and my skin is almost clear. It does dry out my skin a bit but if you use a moisturizer with it, it&#x27;s fine. I use with a moisturizer for the day and with the astringent at night. I have invested a bit in their product line now because of this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim at target because I wanted a facial scrub. It has lasted me a couple months already and I use it twice a day, so it&#x27;s definitely a great deal. I have adult acne I can&#x27;t seem to get rid of, but this has REALLY helped. Normally products with salycic acid really dry my face out but I was very pleasantly surprised to find that this did not dry my face out, even using it 2 times a day. I noticed an improvement in just a couple days. My skin is not completely clear but it&#x27;s well on its way to getting there now, thanks to this wonderful product. I am now in love with the alba botanical brand.</li>
            <li> This has worked great for my daughter&#x27;s acne.  She now is hooked on the AcneDote product line.</li>
            <li> What struck me at first was how fantastic the scent is.  I was not expecting a lively, citrusy scent from an acne product.  The scrub is not at all harsh, it leaves my skin smooth without traumatizing it.  The scrubbing particles are relatively small.  I have used this for two months now and have no blemishes at all.  Previously, I used a Biore product (with the same active ingredient, also 2%), but still had periodic breakouts.  The only downside is that it takes a little effort to keep the bottle clean.  The scrub is dark brown and not too thick, so it tends to leave traces on the bottle that need to be cleaned off every time I use it.</li>
            <li> i really like this product so far. not too gritty or harsh-just right. my face feels very clean afterwards. i have noticed clearer skin, but have only been using for a couple of weeks. a little goes a long way, so i think this bottle will last for a while. will continue to buy if the results stay the same!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has mild to severe ache. It lathers up almost as much as a soap but it is rough enough to slough off dead skin cells WITHOUT drying your skin. I&#x27;ve used this on my face, neck, chest, and even on my legs for exfoliation. It also smells great and is made up of natural ingredients.  I will always have this product in my bathroom!</li>
            <li> After a years long search for a working acne scrub, I came across the Alba products. At first I was a little skeptical about the 100% vegetarian ingredients, thinking that it wouldn&#x27;t work, but boy was I wrong! I tried it out as soon as it arrived, and was surprised when it didn&#x27;t burn my face like other acne products do. The small particles in the scrub make for a very gentle, soothing cleaning! Unlike other scrubs with large, rough particles that scratch my face. I used only a small amount, which was enough to cover my entire face, and rubbed it in for about a minute, and let it sit for five minutes before rinsing. Something that I really liked was that it didn&#x27;t hurt like crazy when a little got in my eye, and it was rather easy to clean out. While I was rinsing it just felt like my face was cleaner, and I could tell that my pores were open. After when my face was dry, it didn&#x27;t look oily at all like other scrubs make it! It also didn&#x27;t dry my skin out anymore than it already is, but made it softer than I can ever remember! After using it twice a day for only four days I am already noticing a huge difference in my acne! The giant zits on my cheeks and chin are fading faster than ever, and almost all of the little blackheads on my forehead are gone! Even the deep blackheads on my nose that have been there for years are getting a little better! I am absolutely amazed at how well this scrub has worked with my acne compared to other products. Proactiv didn&#x27;t work half this good, and Alba is only half the price! I know I&#x27;ll be buying more when I run out and I would definitely recommend others to try this if you aren&#x27;t happy with your current acne products! Its also the only acne product that I have seen that doesn&#x27;t test on animals which is great!</li>
            <li> I ran into this product at Walmart while looking for a matte face moisturizer.  I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would work, thought I would have to return it (I even bought a new line of products from Origins 2 days later since I was sure a product from walmart couldn&#x27;t work all that well on my face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have years and years of resistant acne, tried everything under the sun with the dermatologist (unsuccessfully), and so I wasn&#x27;t planning for this product to be any different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, about 1 week later (I hadn&#x27;t started origins stuff yet, was gonna give this thing 2 wks before switching) I noticed a difference.  I was more excited about the Origins stuff and so went to that at this point, and I actually started with my usual breakouts again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up returning the expensive Origins line!!!  Since then, I&#x27;ve even bought another one.  It is NOT a mattifier (so doesn&#x27;t make me look oil free for hours and all day), but it is a moisturizer that is NOT GREASY for us acne-prone people.  My face is normally very oily, where I can see beads of oil on my nose an hour after washing my face.  The oil-free lotion worked to control my acne!!&lt;br /&gt;(Looking at the reviews on here, I might try the toner from this line as well, but I&#x27;m currently working on my Clinique toner which has 1.5% salicylic acid already)</li>
            <li> This product rocks.. great for sensitive skin .. truly great for face and body.</li>
            <li> Love alba products because they aware cruelty free and mostly natural. Bought this scrub and it did great for the big break outs on my back using once a day. Unfortunately, it was WAY too harsh for my face and caused me to break out like crazy and left me with dry patches all over. Switching to a gentler face scrub but will continue to use on my body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 2 years now and won&#x27;t use anything else. The price is great, it takes care of acne, and exfoliates. Can&#x27;t beat this!</li>
