            <li> Has a strong perfume smell and an ingredient(s) that burned our sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use the product during the summer as a perfune.  It is lightly scented and perfect for summertime.  It has a clean fresh smell, as though you just stepped out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Good transaction. But...this product doesn&#x27;t moisturize anywhere near as well as the sample I got from the authentic Avani web site. Can&#x27;t understand that...</li>
            <li> Dead Sea salt lotions are the only ones that I have ever found that work without being greasy and leaving fingerprints after they soak in. I use this on VERY dry hands, and it is fantastic. Great scent too.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have used. I tried it at Sams Club as a sample and am glad I did. This works great on really dry skin.</li>
            <li> Works nicely. Not greasy, do not prefer this scent though.</li>
            <li> I bought the fragrance Exciting.  The lotion moisturizes well, but what I really enjoy is the soapy, clean fragrance.  It it a strong fragrance, so if you are planning to wear cologne or something, you won&#x27;t be able to.  This lotion IS your fragrance today.</li>
            <li> This product is okay, but the smell is weird.  I think there are better body lotion products out there.  Won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> Love it my sister likes too</li>
            <li> Heck, I&#x27;m old. My skin is not as elastic as it once was. Since I have spent, and still do spend, a lot of time in the sun, my skin is very dry. Avani lotion gives it moisture and a degree of suppleness. Good stuff! A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> as a gift for my sister. She loves here higher end type of beauty products and she told me this falls right into that category. She would recommend to girls and guys.</li>
            <li> This stuff cured my keratosis pilaris. Cured it. In a few days. I had the disorder on the backs of my legs, upper arms, etc. This is KING. I think it must have something in it that stops cells dying too quickly or it helps exfoliate them - because KP occurs when the cell dies but doesn&#x27;t slough off and then clogs the hair follicle, resulting in bumps and lumps and sometimes ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of &amp;#34;Exciting&amp;#34; AND it really works!  I use it on my body and my hands and always get compliments on how soft my hands are.</li>
            <li> A lot of people seem to complain about the smell, but I didn&#x27;t get this for the scent!  If you&#x27;re after scents, go to Bath and Body Works already.  They have like eleventy  But if you want the smoothest, softest, most supple hands, get this stuff!  I got it for my wife but sneak a use or two myself occasionally...  Makes my hands smooth for like DAYS.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to feel a little oily when you first rub it in, but if done before bed it&#x27;s really not a problem.  I don&#x27;t recommend trying to drive immediately after using it unless you have one of those sheepskin steering wheel covers...&lt;br /&gt;But yeah, want a great scent?  Go elsewhere.  Want to drive afterwards?  Not here.  Want the best feeling hands in the world?  Buy this.</li>
            <li> I just love this...love the smell...love the fact it feels good...love that it does it&#x27;s job. I always have an extra on hand.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Leaves a wonderful light fresh scent.  I&#x27;m not a perfume wearer, so this gives just a nice light scent and I always get &amp;#34;you smell wonderful!&amp;#34;.  So I&#x27;ll keep on using it!</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizing lotion I&#x27;ve used without being too heavy or greasy.  I was very excited to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and would say thats its just great. If, you try it, you&#x27;ll never stop purchasing it. Give it to that lady in her socking for x-mas.</li>
            <li> I like Curel better. I have very dry skin and Curel does a wonderful job. I like the subtle fragrance of this Avani lotion. Wish Curel had that.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. The soft feeling I get plus the wonderful soothing fragrance is enough for me. I&#x27;msold on it. No other lotion could meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best smelling lotion, but makes for great skin!!!</li>
            <li> Please see my review of the Avani Dead Sea Nourishing Body Lotion Relaxing formula.  I will update this review once I have tried this version of the product for a while.  One thing I have been able to determine, I like the scent of the Relaxing formula much better.  Everyone has their own opinion about scents, so it could be just the opposite for you.</li>
            <li> This is my first Avani product and am glad I ordered it.  It has a nice fragrance and does a great job of making my skin soft.  Received the body lotion when expected and will be ordering product again when I run out.  Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lotion with dead sea minerals and I really enjoy this one all around. It has a coolness when applied that feels good, the texture is not oily or feels too much like glycerin. It spells really good and nourishes my skin.</li>
