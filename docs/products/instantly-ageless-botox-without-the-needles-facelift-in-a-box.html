            <li>really did not work very good...</li>
            <li>the package arrived very quickly!</li>
            <li>It would probably work better on the forehead</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m able to apply it under my make up, so I tried.</li>
            <li>Although the product seemed to work ok...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many products for my under eye puffiness/bags.</li>
            <li>In fact, it did lift them up, but made them MORE pronounced.  </li>
            <li>I have used quite a bit of the product hoping that I would magically work.</li>
            <li>It seems to make the sunken part puff up and make my eyes look more rested.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic I just wish it had a screw in cap</li>
            <li>Worrying about them only gives you more!!</li>
            <li>great to put on right before going somewhere like a wedding or other special occasion party.</li>
            <li>Live your life healthy and don&#x27;t worry about what you look like.</li>
            <li>I clean the exact area under my eyes that I wish to use the product.</li>
            <li>Great works fast and well, lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Great service, fast shipping to Iceland.</li>
            <li>have had the most amazing experience with this product it literally took 10 years off around my eyes the key to success for applying is apply it and when its still damp put your face emotionless free in front of a small fan to perfected ceiling.</li>
            <li>If you put foundation over the top looks no different than not using product.</li>
            <li>Again, very drying!</li>
            <li>It tighten skin around eyes and looks good for a short time but then skin looks dry after</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice for a quick fix, but it makes me look older than I did before I applied the product after it loses its affect.</li>
            <li>which was very much appreciated.</li>
            <li>So I really don&#x27;t know how to deal with this problem.</li>
            <li>In my honest opinion, it does not work and I feel It was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li>Wrinkles are a sign of aging and unless your not getting older there is NO WAY to avoid them.</li>
            <li>This product was very drying on the skin and actually made me look OLDER underneath my eyes!</li>
            <li>THis works fabulously on wrinkles, pufffy eyes and dark circles under the eyes.</li>
            <li>After a week of use I notice my skin becoming very dry and red.  </li>
            <li>The only positive feedback is from the ones selling and making the money .</li>
            <li>its amazing, but results last only a few hours.</li>
            <li>Instead it was foil packets and the product seems to be old.</li>
            <li>If you want a slight improvement that makes your skin feel taught and like sandpaper, then might be worth trying.</li>
            <li>I am amazed at this product!&lt;br /&gt;After reading the application techniques used by other users, I basically do my entire serum, moisturizer, and full makeup routine, then with a premoistened facial wipe</li>
            <li>I ordered this with high expectations after watching several video reviews and also reading multiple reviews.</li>
            <li>Too much money is spent on superficial stuff!</li>

            <li> Too much money is spent on superficial stuff!</li>
            <li> I also tried it on my forehead and above lips and noticed some reduction in wrinkles but didn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> easy to use, just need to bath in it, so it can become expensive.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t dry out once you open it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really wasting my money - I should be getting at least 2 uses from one sachet.  </li>
            <li> but it left a slight, white residue on the skin.</li>
            <li> Also it was extremely drying and left my skin around my eye looking scaly.</li>
            <li> There is a slight white-ish residue left from this product, but ...</li>
            <li> the puffiness did go away but only for a few hours.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I just did not get the result i expected</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Then I might put on a little DRY foundation under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when I apply my makeup, whether it&#x27;s water or oil base, it seems to change the product and cause it to revert my skin back to it&#x27;s original state.</li>
            <li> I also expected the product to come in little resealable bottles.  </li>
            <li> so I tried thicker and thinner application with no success.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to be what it had been hyped up to be, but unfortunately that&#x27;s not the case for me.</li>
            <li> It instead came in little plastic pouches.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t come on the little vials that it had pictured.</li>
            <li> I wasted, absolutely wasted my money on this.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> My complaint.....</li>
            <li> waste of money!!</li>
            <li> The bags are basically eliminated for approximately 5-6 hours.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this to anyone, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product at all.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I was applying it wrong</li>
            <li> This is disappointing</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the fact that it didn&#x27;t get rid of the darkness under the eye and</li>
            <li> and the residue is annoying.  </li>
            <li> My friend who doesn&#x27;t wear base make up has no problem, I however don&#x27;t know how to solve my problem with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
            <li> Sadly I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worst purchase on Amazon ever.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> no instructions and dries like glue with residue. If you put foundation over the top looks no different than not using product. I also tried it on my forehead and above lips and noticed some reduction in wrinkles but didn&#x27;t last long and the residue is annoying.  If you want a slight improvement that makes your skin feel taught and like sandpaper, then might be worth trying.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the fact that it didn&#x27;t get rid of the darkness under the eye and the puffiness did go away but only for a few hours. Also it was extremely drying and left my skin around my eye looking scaly.</li>
            <li> This product was very drying on the skin and actually made me look OLDER underneath my eyes! It would probably work better on the forehead and/or the lines from the nose to the mouth but it left a slight, white residue on the skin. Again, very drying! I would not recommend this to anyone, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> really did not work very good...</li>
            <li> It was ok. Not the results I was hoping for. Maybe I was hoping for a miracle!</li>
            <li> Does not work!! waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Product did not meet my expectations. It did not come with instructions. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m able to apply it under my make up, so I tried. I did not see a difference. In my honest opinion, it does not work and I feel It was a waste of my money. I wish I could get a refund.  I am not satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> have had the most amazing experience with this product it literally took 10 years off around my eyes the key to success for applying is apply it and when its still damp put your face emotionless free in front of a small fan to perfected ceiling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effects only last a couple of hours and leaves a white film under the eyes. I was not impressed with this product at all.</li>
            <li> THis works fabulously on wrinkles, pufffy eyes and dark circles under the eyes. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is not worth the money it leaves white stuff on your face and makes it look funny also if your face gets wet it makes the product stop working.... It look almost like putting glue on your face.</li>
            <li> Works great on under eye discoloration.</li>
            <li> easy to use, just need to bath in it, so it can become expensive.</li>
            <li> It words however it lasts only a very short time.  The effects are about 2 to 3 hours.  This is disappointing</li>
            <li> Some improvement but nothing drastic. Would not spend the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice for a quick fix, but it makes me look older than I did before I applied the product after it loses its affect. It also irritates my skin.  I also expected the product to come in little resealable bottles.  It instead came in little plastic pouches.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Although the product seemed to work ok... it didn&#x27;t come on the little vials that it had pictured. Instead it was foil packets and the product seems to be old. I could not find an expiration date on packets.</li>
            <li> I saw no results.  A total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many products for my under eye puffiness/bags. I am amazed at this product!&lt;br /&gt;After reading the application techniques used by other users, I basically do my entire serum, moisturizer, and full makeup routine, then with a premoistened facial wipe I clean the exact area under my eyes that I wish to use the product. Then I gently pat on enough product to make moist under my eyes, remain expressionless, and wait for a few minutes. Then I might put on a little DRY foundation under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW! What a transformation! The bags are basically eliminated for approximately 5-6 hours. It gives me hope that they might come out with something that lasts even longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll post before and after pics the next time I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
            <li> Product seems to take away the bags under my eyes</li>
            <li> I just did not get the result i expected</li>
            <li> No way this lasts 8 - 9 hours.  And it did not shrink the wrinkles under my eyes.  In fact, it did lift them up, but made them MORE pronounced.  I wasted, absolutely wasted my money on this.  Worst purchase on Amazon ever.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. The only positive feedback is from the ones selling and making the money . Wrinkles are a sign of aging and unless your not getting older there is NO WAY to avoid them. Worrying about them only gives you more!! Live your life healthy and don&#x27;t worry about what you look like. It&#x27;s what&#x27;s inside that counts!! Too much money is spent on superficial stuff! Take your money and enjoy a nice vacation! That will keep you from stress and wrinkles!!!</li>
            <li> It is fantastic I just wish it had a screw in cap so it doesn&#x27;t dry out once you open it</li>
            <li> It tighten skin around eyes and looks good for a short time but then skin looks dry after</li>
            <li> After a week of use I notice my skin becoming very dry and red.  Then it started burning everytime i put it on so I have discontinued using it.</li>
            <li> I like the product and it does work but once the sachet is opened, the remaining product dries up so I&#x27;m using one sachet per day.  I&#x27;m really wasting my money - I should be getting at least 2 uses from one sachet.  If this is the only means of packaging, then I won&#x27;t purchase Instantly Ageless again. Any suggestions?</li>
            <li> This is just not as good as the trial that I used.</li>
            <li> its amazing, but results last only a few hours. great to put on right before going somewhere like a wedding or other special occasion party. the package arrived very quickly! which was very much appreciated.</li>
            <li> I ordered this with high expectations after watching several video reviews and also reading multiple reviews. Sadly I am very disappointed. I saw no change under my eyes. I have used quite a bit of the product hoping that I would magically work. I thought maybe I was applying it wrong so I tried thicker and thinner application with no success. I really wanted this product to be what it had been hyped up to be, but unfortunately that&#x27;s not the case for me.</li>
            <li> I think this product works quite well. It contains a substrate of Botox which relaxes the skin. I can feel the skin under my eyes relaxing as it works in about 2 minutes time. I have sunken circles under my eyes, not puffy bags. It seems to make the sunken part puff up and make my eyes look more rested. The client that I applied the product to that has puffy eyes  saw even better results! It does not help with purplish discoloration under the eyes. My complaint.....when I apply my makeup, whether it&#x27;s water or oil base, it seems to change the product and cause it to revert my skin back to it&#x27;s original state. That&#x27;s a problem, because I will ALWAYS wear make up no matter what! So I really don&#x27;t know how to deal with this problem. This product DOES work! My friend who doesn&#x27;t wear base make up has no problem, I however don&#x27;t know how to solve my problem with this product. There is a slight white-ish residue left from this product, but ... Hey! I have great results without injections!! Something&#x27;s gotta give!</li>
            <li> Wish it lasted longer! But it works!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for this product because it was like having superglue on my skin</li>
            <li> Great works fast and well, lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Great service, fast shipping to Iceland.</li>
