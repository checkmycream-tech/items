            <li>very good product , recived quckly.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 2 years and my skin is beautiful.</li>
            <li>(Josie Maran&#x27;s bottle and dropper are downright gorgeous!), but the price is great and the product is truly wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>/&gt;It is great for skin and hair health and repair like nothing I have ever used before.</li>
            <li>Also great company that sells this.</li>
            <li>So what you get it&#x27;s great for what you pay.</li>
            <li>I shop on Amazon all the time, have always been happy with products.</li>
            <li>However oil feels great and the service was prompt.</li>
            <li>It was in a craft-store bottle with a home-made printer label (and not that great at that)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not that great on my hair though.</li>
            <li>Still a great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great hair product.  </li>
            <li>great on the skin...and hair, etc.</li>
            <li>This time the bottle came in a very nice box.</li>
            <li>I had been doing a lot of research into argan oil and this seller has a great price and good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brand of argan oil and the best price.</li>
            <li>Great item, I have been using this product in my hair which have become more manageable and have eliminated the frizz!</li>
            <li>Argan oil and emu oil aren&#x27;t the best smelling products but they&#x27;re by far the BEST products.  </li>
            <li>Tried Virgin coconut oil, it work good too</li>
            <li>They have a good product as well, but guess what???</li>
            <li>so if you want to try a 100% argan oil; I assume this is as good as any.  </li>
            <li>A friend is using it for eczema with good results as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>oil feels so good on my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very nice company and good customer service.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love that!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Love the seller!  </li>
            <li>Get it, you will love it!</li>
            <li>This oil is amazing in what it has done to my skin and hair.</li>
            <li>I saw a product containing Argan Oil on a popular shopping network, and I almost bought it.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>Nice product............</li>
            <li>and I like to warm it up with my hands before applying on my face.  </li>
            <li>My face neck and chest are loving the benefits.  </li>
            <li>This absolutely the best product I have tried for my skin.  </li>
            <li>It feels great on your skin and absorbs so quickly.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s very sensitive to a lot of ingredients in skin care products and stays away from chemicals, so this one-ingredient product is perfect for her.  </li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I tried a lot of oils from olive, cacao, coconut and argan, so far this is the best.</li>
            <li>It is completely natural and packaged wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Also, the design of this bottle is not the most suitable.  </li>
            <li>The feel is very smooth and I use it on my neck also.</li>
            <li>Use as instructed, and you will find it&#x27;s very light on your face.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile my cuticles and nailbeds are looking better than they ever have, because after I put it on my face, I rub the excess into my nails.</li>
            <li>I use solar oil on my nails which I love</li>
            <li>I totally love this product.</li>
            <li>I love how the glass looks</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how to apply the oil to my hair and pleased</li>
            <li>There was no frizz, and my hair had a healthy shine.</li>
            <li>I love how it feels.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of it when I apply the oil and when I wash my face at night.</li>
            <li>even my 2 daughters love their product,but there are times they are out of stock  </li>
            <li>I will continue to order more of this product.</li>
            <li>One of those downward facing pumps that better regulate the flow would be better.  </li>
            <li>I guess my review is more about the company than the product.  </li>
            <li>Actually, I was so impressed with the customer service that I must say that I&#x27;ve never seen this level of service before!  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>How can I know for sure?</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than a year now.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m still pleased with the performance of this product.  </li>
            <li>My skin glows and looks so healthy</li>
            <li>I love this argan oil.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with this company and will order from them again as soon as my argan oil runs out.</li>
            <li>and I am thoroughly enjoying the effects.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s doing a wonderful job though reapplication is sometimes necessary.  </li>
            <li>I realized that I was going to have to nourish it a bit to keep it healthy and began researching products.  </li>
            <li>A benefit I had not realized would come along with keeping my hair healthy.  </li>
            <li>I just love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>And much better this than the chemicals that are used to remove</li>
            <li>I love that is so much more affordable that I can put it all over my body if I wanted too.</li>
            <li>I really love this oil.</li>
            <li>His skin looks better than it ever has since I&#x27;ve known him.</li>
            <li>I would love if they offered that as an option.  </li>
            <li>It does make skin more softer and helps with skin problems.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, has a great smell and it is not heavy and oily but more of a concentrated oil that melts into hair or skin.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for your handy way of selling this product!</li>
            <li>The lotion helps the oil spread &amp; absorb more easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be willing to pay a BIT more for a lovely bottle like Josie Maran&#x27;s!)</li>
            <li>It smells good, it does not apply greasy, the bottle is perfectly designed to squeeze out just the right amount without getting all messy.</li>
            <li>It absorbs fully into my skin and very quickly so it does not interfere with my makeup regime.</li>
            <li>This oil absorbs very quickly into the skin...</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean and refreshing experience using this brand.</li>
            <li>When your hands are oily, it&#x27;s easy to drop the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I really liked how it controlled oily areas and reduced look of inflammation.</li>
            <li>This is a good clean product that really helps the skin.</li>
            <li>This Slice of Nature (SON) virgin argan oil was fine</li>
            <li>I have thinning, fine hair</li>
            <li>to minimize the fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I also do notice that it improved my fine lines.  </li>
            <li>It will make your hair silky, smooth and shinny.</li>
            <li>this is a wonder oil..absolutely fantastic..</li>
            <li>really cheap quality with no results.</li>
            <li>I really really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>I use on my hair , feels so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Coconut virgin oil is good too but it solidified during winter (i think, only good in the tropical places and much cheaper too).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn my hair \\&quot;natural\\&quot; for many years, and have always been searching for the right fragrance-free products to use on my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like it a lot!!!</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered from them they sent my a free sample of shea butter too!</li>
            <li>that I have finally convinced my fiance (a man&#x27;s man lol) to use it on his rosacea and he is very pleased with the reduced redness and bettered condition of HIS skin in only a week&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>The spray makes it so easy to administer the right amount of oil...</li>
            <li>She discussed the argan oil thoroughly and informed me about her business and the origins of the product, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite not being able to use the argan oil, I am now trying the shea butter, which seems like a superior product to other shea butters</li>
            <li>the price for pure virgin Argan oil is better than some&lt;br /&gt;products</li>
            <li>The Slice of Nature 100% Pure Argan Oil is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It is pure and potent.  </li>
            <li>This one is an excellent alternative - it does smell somewhat nutty for the first few seconds that it&#x27;s on, but after a while you don&#x27;t smell it anymore.</li>
            <li>plus it&#x27;s super clean, if you appreciate those type of things.</li>
            <li>My skin is so sensitive shea butter breaks me out into a rash, but this oil absorbed quickly, beautifully and has left my skin more youthful and radiant than it&#x27;s ever been before.</li>
            <li>For the price, I want to make sure it is the real deal.</li>
            <li>This is a good price for the pure product in natural state.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel more youthful, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month now, but I can tell you that my skin is much smoother that it was before I started using this great stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>stuff absorbs into skin so quickly..</li>
            <li>I really love how this product feels on my skin, particularly after I take a shower.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t greasy and makes my skin glow...</li>
            <li>and I will remain loyal the Slice of Nature.  </li>
            <li>My face felt clogged and wasn&#x27;t glowly and healthy looking like it normally is--</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable as well!</li>
            <li>This oil works very well, isn&#x27;t greasy, and the smell goes away very quickly.</li>
            <li>Will be back for more!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice to have an all-in-one product where I can take care of everything at the same time</li>
            <li>But the box with ingredients and benefits listed did help the product have a more professional look as well as trust appeal.</li>
            <li>My skin is soooo soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>How i wish the slice of nature would carry more natural product.</li>
            <li>its worth every cent..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>So far I love</li>
            <li>The complimentary sample of rhassoul clay mask was just a bag of sand.</li>
            <li>I feel that my smile lines have improved and my neck is getting tighter.</li>
            <li>this keeps it looking dewey and fresh.  </li>
            <li>The bottle busted and I watched $30 worth of argan oil</li>
            <li>, other said it&#x27;s a seborrheic dermatitis, and many more.</li>
            <li>I have horribly sensitive, dry skin and have tried everything to soothe, hydrate and keep my skin happy.</li>
            <li>I like this argan oil very much.</li>
            <li>Its consistency is not thick and goopy, it pumps out in a thin stream, absorbs quickly, has a slight earthy smell, feels good, is effective at keeping my skin looking fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t agree on specific diagnostic, one said it&#x27;s a kind of eczema but don&#x27;t know what really it is(need more observation), other said it&#x27;s a mild psoriasis</li>
            <li>Yes, the label does look like it came from a personal printer, but I consider that to be no problem considering the product works so well. :)</li>
            <li>at first I was hesitating buying it..</li>
            <li>I love this product,it has brought back the shine to my hair!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I exfoliated my skin on my face and applied exactly as directed.  </li>
            <li>However, I bought the oil for use in my hair moreso than on my skin and, having tried different argan oil formulas that are specifically made for hair - those provide better results than this.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>The bottle is pretty on my dresser, too.</li>
            <li>This is my first try of Argan</li>
            <li>I love it because it gave me back the hair</li>
            <li>Just wish that it could have come in a bigger size so that I could have ordered more.</li>
            <li>am learning to use it on my hair, which is in pretty good condition, but also prone to dryness, so I don&#x27;t have a full report on that yet, but I do see vast improvement in the lack of tangles when combing my wet hair after a shower.</li>
            <li>Slice of Nature was the first brand of pure argan oil I purchased.</li>
            <li>This Slice of Nature Argan oil is far superior and so much less.  </li>
            <li>I found it important to put just enough and not over do it on the face, because there is so much that the skin can &#x27;absorb&#x27;, and the oil just sits there.</li>
            <li>, I really do recomend the product, but maybe pour it into the plastic bottle when you get it, or be carefull.&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t put to much, it will make your hair oily.</li>
            <li>I did experiment with another brand, but for some reason I did not like it as much.</li>
            <li>highly recommend anyone on the fence to buy it!</li>
            <li>I also rub it into the ends of my wet hair after shampooing to keep my ends healthy.</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks of using this oil, it looks so much clearer, fresher, and dewier.  </li>
            <li>I also use this product on my hair, my feet, my neck, my elbows, after getting a brazilian wax or shaving; I find it to be very soothing on irritated/dry skin.</li>
            <li>It feels really go to apply on my face</li>
            <li>so it really made me question the quality of the oil.</li>
            <li>but then goes away fast.</li>
            <li>I really feel this has helped me</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I have been using this for over a week and am in absolute awe of the change in my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping from this seller!&lt;br</li>
            <li>They should really think about using plastic bottles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this oil for moisturizing my face--I rub about 3 drops between my fingers and gently press it into my skin instead of rubbing it around.</li>
            <li>I have stopped using all my other moisturizers and it even balanced out my combination skin and as a result I&#x27;ve been able to stop using as much makeup.</li>
            <li>Much better price than the other brands on market.</li>
            <li>The fine lines on my forehead and the smile lines around my mouth are smoother and less visible.  </li>
            <li>(And I&#x27;ve worked on and off in retail since I was in high school, including for Whole Foods.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin looks clear and luminous for probably the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li>I really love that it comes in a dark glass recyclable bottle</li>
            <li>When it dried, my curls had more body and were very defined.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it on my face and neck areas, and  have seen my wrinkles diminish.</li>
            <li>I had tried every prescription available and even went on a specific antibiotic (Oracea) to clear my skin and nothing worked like this</li>
            <li>Before buying this I researched all the different kinds and found this brand to be the most informative about the different ways Argan oil is processed and offered.  </li>
            <li>about the oil: I was using it only for 3 days, but it works from the very first time.</li>
            <li>Highly recommed it to people that have tried everything else..</li>
            <li>They tried to lead me to believe that their product is just so pure, perhaps my skin was too sensitive for it.</li>
            <li>Natural, absorbing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I have never really found a hair product that I have absolutely love, but this product is not heavy and it leaves my hair soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>It works especially well when my skin is damp right out of the shower.</li>
            <li>With a new hair style, I&#x27;ve been (oh heavens!)ironing my hair with one of those ceramic deals.  </li>
            <li>was actually surprised to learn she was in St. Louis as well, and she even offered to meet with me to discuss any concerns I&#x27;d had!  </li>
            <li>For the first time in my life my hair is actually shiny!  </li>
            <li>I have paid much more in the past for Argan oil, and never will I buy that overpriced oil again.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used Argan oil, but I&#x27;m a big fan of Emu oil and others.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell could be a little strong..</li>
            <li>and it has a little funny smell to it at first</li>
            <li>I really like this product and that it&#x27;s totally natural and helps the local berber women who manufacture this oil by hand.</li>
            <li>I am 43 years old</li>
            <li>I used to work in natural food and body care stores, so this did not bother me.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and not greasy or oily at all.  </li>
            <li>After a week of usage I noticed that red spots on my face disappeared, rough areas (elbows and feet) were smoother and overall, my skin had a much better appearance.  </li>
            <li>My hair is silky, soft, shiny.</li>
            <li>Anyone on the fence about trying a natural oil for hair or skin should give this one a try.</li>
            <li>totally natural</li>
            <li>I have had more compliments on my skin since using this product than I did when I was in my late teens and 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I cant really say if it improved my acne because I started using Target Benzyl Peroxide Gel shortly after.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 43, don&#x27;t have an acne problem or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>no additives, no disguising the natural odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, about that odor.  </li>
            <li>I am 50 years old and you know what that means.</li>
            <li>I have replaced my old brand with this one.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money since it takes only a tiny amount.</li>
            <li>this oil absorbs so quickly it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair weighed down.</li>
            <li>and it has helped my skin significantly regardless of this harsh winter weather</li>
            <li>am thrilled to say that this product has not only vastly softened and smoothed my very dry skin, it does so without need of a regular daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I mixed some along with essential oil of lemon or lavender to cut the smell at first.</li>
            <li>A few more pumps for specific coverage (elbows, feet, hands) provided enough coverage for everything else.  </li>
            <li>I chose it after trying Josie Maran&#x27;s at Sephora; I decided to see if I could find a similar pure, organic argan oil for a much lower price, and I chose this one based on the other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has been doing a wonderful job of clearing up what was a total disaster, my entire face was terribly broken out from that previous product, and now it is almost entirely gone.</li>
            <li>You press the pump down and it squirts out straight-ahead in a powerful way</li>
            <li>I use it on face at night to soften and moisturize, but it is a real saving grace for my hair which is curly and therefore dry.  </li>
            <li>I just bought it last Saturday at a craft fair, and my bottle was sitting on the side of the sink and it was casually knocked it into the sink basin.</li>
            <li>:)very long way, and I bought the small bottle.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is the real thing, but I read the reviews, and it says its pure, raw and unrefined.</li>
            <li>I was mid-horrible breakout caused by an anti-aging product (with the initials OoO lol) which resulted in painful cystic acne.</li>
            <li>It made me wonder if some of the key benefits were taken out with that natural scent.</li>
            <li>You smell it a little bit at first and its not offensive at all.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really compare this to other brands of argan oil, as it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve ever bought.  </li>
            <li>She likes the fact that it&#x27;s raw and organic, and the price of Slice of Nature Virgin Argan Oil is very reasonable, especially compared to the argan oils sold by other companies--but it&#x27;s just as pure.  </li>
            <li>I do have very dry skin, I use it for a moisturizer before make-up and even after make-up is done I put a small drop on my hand, rub my hands together, then lightly pat over my make-up.  </li>
            <li>help for my dry and sensitive skin issues.</li>
            <li>I received the product after 9 days which is fine, but the seal was broken and it had leaked out quite a bit.</li>

            <li> Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> very good product , recived quckly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 years and my skin is beautiful.</li>
            <li> (Josie Maran&#x27;s bottle and dropper are downright gorgeous!), but the price is great and the product is truly wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> LOL</li>
            <li> It is great for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out, which is great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is great for skin and hair health and repair like nothing I have ever used before.</li>
            <li> Also great company that sells this.</li>
            <li> So what you get it&#x27;s great for what you pay.</li>
            <li> I shop on Amazon all the time, have always been happy with products.</li>
            <li> However oil feels great and the service was prompt.</li>
            <li> It was in a craft-store bottle with a home-made printer label (and not that great at that)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not that great on my hair though.</li>
            <li> Still a great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a great hair product.  </li>
            <li> great on the skin...and hair, etc.</li>
            <li> This time the bottle came in a very nice box.</li>
            <li> I had been doing a lot of research into argan oil and this seller has a great price and good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of argan oil and the best price.</li>
            <li> Great item, I have been using this product in my hair which have become more manageable and have eliminated the frizz!</li>
            <li> Argan oil and emu oil aren&#x27;t the best smelling products but they&#x27;re by far the BEST products.  </li>
            <li> Tried Virgin coconut oil, it work good too</li>
            <li> They have a good product as well, but guess what???</li>
            <li> so if you want to try a 100% argan oil; I assume this is as good as any.  </li>
            <li> A friend is using it for eczema with good results as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> oil feels so good on my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very nice company and good customer service.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love that!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Love the seller!  </li>
            <li> Get it, you will love it!</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing in what it has done to my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I saw a product containing Argan Oil on a popular shopping network, and I almost bought it.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> Nice product............</li>
            <li> and I like to warm it up with my hands before applying on my face.  </li>
            <li> My face neck and chest are loving the benefits.  </li>
            <li> This absolutely the best product I have tried for my skin.  </li>
            <li> It feels great on your skin and absorbs so quickly.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s very sensitive to a lot of ingredients in skin care products and stays away from chemicals, so this one-ingredient product is perfect for her.  </li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I tried a lot of oils from olive, cacao, coconut and argan, so far this is the best.</li>
            <li> It is completely natural and packaged wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Also, the design of this bottle is not the most suitable.  </li>
            <li> The feel is very smooth and I use it on my neck also.</li>
            <li> Use as instructed, and you will find it&#x27;s very light on your face.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile my cuticles and nailbeds are looking better than they ever have, because after I put it on my face, I rub the excess into my nails.</li>
            <li> I use solar oil on my nails which I love</li>
            <li> I totally love this product.</li>
            <li> I love how the glass looks</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how to apply the oil to my hair and pleased</li>
            <li> There was no frizz, and my hair had a healthy shine.</li>
            <li> I love how it feels.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of it when I apply the oil and when I wash my face at night.</li>
            <li> even my 2 daughters love their product,but there are times they are out of stock  </li>
            <li> I will continue to order more of this product.</li>
            <li> One of those downward facing pumps that better regulate the flow would be better.  </li>
            <li> I guess my review is more about the company than the product.  </li>
            <li> Actually, I was so impressed with the customer service that I must say that I&#x27;ve never seen this level of service before!  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> How can I know for sure?</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than a year now.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m still pleased with the performance of this product.  </li>
            <li> My skin glows and looks so healthy</li>
            <li> I love this argan oil.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with this company and will order from them again as soon as my argan oil runs out.</li>
            <li> and I am thoroughly enjoying the effects.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s doing a wonderful job though reapplication is sometimes necessary.  </li>
            <li> I realized that I was going to have to nourish it a bit to keep it healthy and began researching products.  </li>
            <li> A benefit I had not realized would come along with keeping my hair healthy.  </li>
            <li> I just love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> And much better this than the chemicals that are used to remove</li>
            <li> I love that is so much more affordable that I can put it all over my body if I wanted too.</li>
            <li> I really love this oil.</li>
            <li> His skin looks better than it ever has since I&#x27;ve known him.</li>
            <li> I would love if they offered that as an option.  </li>
            <li> It does make skin more softer and helps with skin problems.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, has a great smell and it is not heavy and oily but more of a concentrated oil that melts into hair or skin.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for your handy way of selling this product!</li>
            <li> The lotion helps the oil spread &amp; absorb more easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be willing to pay a BIT more for a lovely bottle like Josie Maran&#x27;s!)</li>
            <li> It smells good, it does not apply greasy, the bottle is perfectly designed to squeeze out just the right amount without getting all messy.</li>
            <li> It absorbs fully into my skin and very quickly so it does not interfere with my makeup regime.</li>
            <li> This oil absorbs very quickly into the skin...</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clean and refreshing experience using this brand.</li>
            <li> When your hands are oily, it&#x27;s easy to drop the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I really liked how it controlled oily areas and reduced look of inflammation.</li>
            <li> This is a good clean product that really helps the skin.</li>
            <li> This Slice of Nature (SON) virgin argan oil was fine</li>
            <li> I have thinning, fine hair</li>
            <li> to minimize the fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I also do notice that it improved my fine lines.  </li>
            <li> It will make your hair silky, smooth and shinny.</li>
            <li> this is a wonder oil..absolutely fantastic..</li>
            <li> really cheap quality with no results.</li>
            <li> I really really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> I use on my hair , feels so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Coconut virgin oil is good too but it solidified during winter (i think, only good in the tropical places and much cheaper too).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn my hair \\&quot;natural\\&quot; for many years, and have always been searching for the right fragrance-free products to use on my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like it a lot!!!</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered from them they sent my a free sample of shea butter too!</li>
            <li> that I have finally convinced my fiance (a man&#x27;s man lol) to use it on his rosacea and he is very pleased with the reduced redness and bettered condition of HIS skin in only a week&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> The spray makes it so easy to administer the right amount of oil...</li>
            <li> She discussed the argan oil thoroughly and informed me about her business and the origins of the product, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite not being able to use the argan oil, I am now trying the shea butter, which seems like a superior product to other shea butters</li>
            <li> the price for pure virgin Argan oil is better than some&lt;br /&gt;products</li>
            <li> The Slice of Nature 100% Pure Argan Oil is my favorite.</li>
            <li> It is pure and potent.  </li>
            <li> This one is an excellent alternative - it does smell somewhat nutty for the first few seconds that it&#x27;s on, but after a while you don&#x27;t smell it anymore.</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s super clean, if you appreciate those type of things.</li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive shea butter breaks me out into a rash, but this oil absorbed quickly, beautifully and has left my skin more youthful and radiant than it&#x27;s ever been before.</li>
            <li> For the price, I want to make sure it is the real deal.</li>
            <li> This is a good price for the pure product in natural state.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel more youthful, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month now, but I can tell you that my skin is much smoother that it was before I started using this great stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> stuff absorbs into skin so quickly..</li>
            <li> I really love how this product feels on my skin, particularly after I take a shower.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t greasy and makes my skin glow...</li>
            <li> and I will remain loyal the Slice of Nature.  </li>
            <li> My face felt clogged and wasn&#x27;t glowly and healthy looking like it normally is--</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable as well!</li>
            <li> This oil works very well, isn&#x27;t greasy, and the smell goes away very quickly.</li>
            <li> Will be back for more!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice to have an all-in-one product where I can take care of everything at the same time</li>
            <li> But the box with ingredients and benefits listed did help the product have a more professional look as well as trust appeal.</li>
            <li> My skin is soooo soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> How i wish the slice of nature would carry more natural product.</li>
            <li> its worth every cent..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> So far I love</li>
            <li> The complimentary sample of rhassoul clay mask was just a bag of sand.</li>
            <li> I feel that my smile lines have improved and my neck is getting tighter.</li>
            <li> this keeps it looking dewey and fresh.  </li>
            <li> The bottle busted and I watched $30 worth of argan oil</li>
            <li> , other said it&#x27;s a seborrheic dermatitis, and many more.</li>
            <li> I have horribly sensitive, dry skin and have tried everything to soothe, hydrate and keep my skin happy.</li>
            <li> I like this argan oil very much.</li>
            <li> Its consistency is not thick and goopy, it pumps out in a thin stream, absorbs quickly, has a slight earthy smell, feels good, is effective at keeping my skin looking fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t agree on specific diagnostic, one said it&#x27;s a kind of eczema but don&#x27;t know what really it is(need more observation), other said it&#x27;s a mild psoriasis</li>
            <li> Yes, the label does look like it came from a personal printer, but I consider that to be no problem considering the product works so well. :)</li>
            <li> at first I was hesitating buying it..</li>
            <li> I love this product,it has brought back the shine to my hair!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I exfoliated my skin on my face and applied exactly as directed.  </li>
            <li> However, I bought the oil for use in my hair moreso than on my skin and, having tried different argan oil formulas that are specifically made for hair - those provide better results than this.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> The bottle is pretty on my dresser, too.</li>
            <li> This is my first try of Argan</li>
            <li> I love it because it gave me back the hair</li>
            <li> Just wish that it could have come in a bigger size so that I could have ordered more.</li>
            <li> am learning to use it on my hair, which is in pretty good condition, but also prone to dryness, so I don&#x27;t have a full report on that yet, but I do see vast improvement in the lack of tangles when combing my wet hair after a shower.</li>
            <li> Slice of Nature was the first brand of pure argan oil I purchased.</li>
            <li> This Slice of Nature Argan oil is far superior and so much less.  </li>
            <li> I found it important to put just enough and not over do it on the face, because there is so much that the skin can &#x27;absorb&#x27;, and the oil just sits there.</li>
            <li> , I really do recomend the product, but maybe pour it into the plastic bottle when you get it, or be carefull.&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t put to much, it will make your hair oily.</li>
            <li> I did experiment with another brand, but for some reason I did not like it as much.</li>
            <li> highly recommend anyone on the fence to buy it!</li>
            <li> I also rub it into the ends of my wet hair after shampooing to keep my ends healthy.</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks of using this oil, it looks so much clearer, fresher, and dewier.  </li>
            <li> I also use this product on my hair, my feet, my neck, my elbows, after getting a brazilian wax or shaving; I find it to be very soothing on irritated/dry skin.</li>
            <li> It feels really go to apply on my face</li>
            <li> so it really made me question the quality of the oil.</li>
            <li> but then goes away fast.</li>
            <li> I really feel this has helped me</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a week and am in absolute awe of the change in my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping from this seller!&lt;br</li>
            <li> They should really think about using plastic bottles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for moisturizing my face--I rub about 3 drops between my fingers and gently press it into my skin instead of rubbing it around.</li>
            <li> I have stopped using all my other moisturizers and it even balanced out my combination skin and as a result I&#x27;ve been able to stop using as much makeup.</li>
            <li> Much better price than the other brands on market.</li>
            <li> The fine lines on my forehead and the smile lines around my mouth are smoother and less visible.  </li>
            <li> (And I&#x27;ve worked on and off in retail since I was in high school, including for Whole Foods.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin looks clear and luminous for probably the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li> I really love that it comes in a dark glass recyclable bottle</li>
            <li> When it dried, my curls had more body and were very defined.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it on my face and neck areas, and  have seen my wrinkles diminish.</li>
            <li> I had tried every prescription available and even went on a specific antibiotic (Oracea) to clear my skin and nothing worked like this</li>
            <li> Before buying this I researched all the different kinds and found this brand to be the most informative about the different ways Argan oil is processed and offered.  </li>
            <li> about the oil: I was using it only for 3 days, but it works from the very first time.</li>
            <li> Highly recommed it to people that have tried everything else..</li>
            <li> They tried to lead me to believe that their product is just so pure, perhaps my skin was too sensitive for it.</li>
            <li> Natural, absorbing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have never really found a hair product that I have absolutely love, but this product is not heavy and it leaves my hair soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> It works especially well when my skin is damp right out of the shower.</li>
            <li> With a new hair style, I&#x27;ve been (oh heavens!)ironing my hair with one of those ceramic deals.  </li>
            <li> was actually surprised to learn she was in St. Louis as well, and she even offered to meet with me to discuss any concerns I&#x27;d had!  </li>
            <li> For the first time in my life my hair is actually shiny!  </li>
            <li> I have paid much more in the past for Argan oil, and never will I buy that overpriced oil again.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used Argan oil, but I&#x27;m a big fan of Emu oil and others.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell could be a little strong..</li>
            <li> and it has a little funny smell to it at first</li>
            <li> I really like this product and that it&#x27;s totally natural and helps the local berber women who manufacture this oil by hand.</li>
            <li> I am 43 years old</li>
            <li> I used to work in natural food and body care stores, so this did not bother me.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and not greasy or oily at all.  </li>
            <li> After a week of usage I noticed that red spots on my face disappeared, rough areas (elbows and feet) were smoother and overall, my skin had a much better appearance.  </li>
            <li> My hair is silky, soft, shiny.</li>
            <li> Anyone on the fence about trying a natural oil for hair or skin should give this one a try.</li>
            <li> totally natural</li>
            <li> I have had more compliments on my skin since using this product than I did when I was in my late teens and 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I cant really say if it improved my acne because I started using Target Benzyl Peroxide Gel shortly after.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 43, don&#x27;t have an acne problem or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> no additives, no disguising the natural odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, about that odor.  </li>
            <li> I am 50 years old and you know what that means.</li>
            <li> I have replaced my old brand with this one.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money since it takes only a tiny amount.</li>
            <li> this oil absorbs so quickly it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair weighed down.</li>
            <li> and it has helped my skin significantly regardless of this harsh winter weather</li>
            <li> am thrilled to say that this product has not only vastly softened and smoothed my very dry skin, it does so without need of a regular daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I mixed some along with essential oil of lemon or lavender to cut the smell at first.</li>
            <li> A few more pumps for specific coverage (elbows, feet, hands) provided enough coverage for everything else.  </li>
            <li> I chose it after trying Josie Maran&#x27;s at Sephora; I decided to see if I could find a similar pure, organic argan oil for a much lower price, and I chose this one based on the other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has been doing a wonderful job of clearing up what was a total disaster, my entire face was terribly broken out from that previous product, and now it is almost entirely gone.</li>
            <li> You press the pump down and it squirts out straight-ahead in a powerful way</li>
            <li> I use it on face at night to soften and moisturize, but it is a real saving grace for my hair which is curly and therefore dry.  </li>
            <li> I just bought it last Saturday at a craft fair, and my bottle was sitting on the side of the sink and it was casually knocked it into the sink basin.</li>
            <li> :)very long way, and I bought the small bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is the real thing, but I read the reviews, and it says its pure, raw and unrefined.</li>
            <li> I was mid-horrible breakout caused by an anti-aging product (with the initials OoO lol) which resulted in painful cystic acne.</li>
            <li> It made me wonder if some of the key benefits were taken out with that natural scent.</li>
            <li> You smell it a little bit at first and its not offensive at all.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really compare this to other brands of argan oil, as it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve ever bought.  </li>
            <li> She likes the fact that it&#x27;s raw and organic, and the price of Slice of Nature Virgin Argan Oil is very reasonable, especially compared to the argan oils sold by other companies--but it&#x27;s just as pure.  </li>
            <li> I do have very dry skin, I use it for a moisturizer before make-up and even after make-up is done I put a small drop on my hand, rub my hands together, then lightly pat over my make-up.  </li>
            <li> help for my dry and sensitive skin issues.</li>
            <li> I received the product after 9 days which is fine, but the seal was broken and it had leaked out quite a bit.</li>
            <li> and I realy like how it leaves my skin, incredibly soft and certainly not greasy.</li>
            <li> (it looks very elegant and expensive) but it is very fragile and the fact that the bottle is tall makes it less stable.</li>
            <li> After I wash my hair and it&#x27;s dried, I rub several pumps worth in my hair, ears down and then a bit over the scalp hair.  </li>
            <li> purchased the 50ml bottle and its just lasting a long time, even though I use it daily on my hair and have even begun using it as a face oil.</li>
            <li> I am in my 30&#x27;s and had suddenly been having strange bouts of rashes along my chin/neck with bumpy,acne like break outs.  </li>
            <li> I was prepared for a bad odor but was pleasantly surprised when it smelled ok.  </li>
            <li> I use it as directed,this oil has helped my dry, lifess hair back to life.  </li>
            <li> I have natural hair that is pretty much restored to it&#x27;s natural beauty (after years of brutally straightening my hair all of the time).</li>
            <li> I have long curly/wavy hair (depending on the weather).</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I received the product earlier than expected, also package and presentation surpassed my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Then when my hair was almost dry, I put my gel in.</li>
            <li> we use this oil everywhere afeww drops in the bath  in my hair on dry lips</li>
            <li> I put this on after I both condition in shower and then towel dry.  </li>
            <li> It is basically my hair product of choice and when I blow dry my hair, it is silky like a silicone anti-frizz product but without causing build-up.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for dry winter skin</li>
            <li> With my dry skin</li>
            <li> was the most expensive cosmetic I have ever bought and it breaks my heart that it was wasted</li>
            <li> When styling in the morning I rub just one squirt of this oil into wet hair then dry.</li>
            <li> He has very dry skin and gets flaky.  </li>
            <li> This particular brand is a tad expensive but after researching argan oil, I decided that it was really important to get the cold pressed, 100% natural,</li>
            <li> so I was not thrilled by that and looking for natural repairs for that as well as</li>
            <li> Initially, I had read a negative review about the company but now, it seems to me the negative customer service review isn&#x27;t real.  </li>
            <li> , Then I found out this argan oil from Slice of Nature, it work all year round and it totally control my skin problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the scent from the product is not very noticeable.</li>
            <li> My face is a combination of dry and oily and very sensitive and this argan oil did wonders for smoothing out faint crow&#x27;s feet lines, soothing red spots and brightening my complexion.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the packaging is home-made - not professional</li>
            <li> thats why i order to other company which i never had any problem on delivery, until one time,(april)</li>
            <li> So one or the other or a combination of both did lessen my acne.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> With other moisturizers I look oily in the morning but with this I look matte.  </li>
            <li> Within a short amount of time using this oil 2 times a day, in the morning under makeup and at night alone my facial skin has made a dramatic turn around.</li>
            <li> I started my husband on it,he is a minimalist and it is hard to get him to use moisturizer regularly.</li>
            <li> Also, it was super expensive!</li>
            <li> soaks in well and takes very little to go a long way...</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;ve recently for the first time ever stopped using liquid foundation because I no longer need to hide my bad skin.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops through my hair when it was wet.</li>
            <li> I have african american/mixed hair that is really thick, curly, and frizzy.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a bit hard to catch and results in misdirection and waste if not very careful.  </li>
            <li> go down the drain in 3 seconds.  </li>
            <li> The other brand did not have that \\&quot;argany\\&quot; odor (that does go away after a few minutes).</li>
            <li> I purchased this argan oil based on the reviews but with slight hesitation.  </li>
            <li> This oil has evened my skin tone out, slight wrinkles that were appearing are now smoothed out, any dryness is gone.</li>
            <li> I feel rejuvenated, and I use less foundation.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month and a half</li>
            <li> Im half way done with the bottle)</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have been so disappointed that I reviewed so someone else won&#x27;t make the same mistake</li>
            <li> very little of this product goes a very long way, and I bought the small bottle.</li>
            <li> price, hopefully they make it little bit cheaper.</li>
            <li> You just need to use a very small amount, so a bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Slice Of Nature virgin cold pressed pure Argan oil 25ml]]Helps</li>
            <li> I expected a few breakouts but after two weeks, my face was so broken out that it has taken two months to get it back to normal, it just gradually got worse and worse.</li>
            <li> Just massage few drops into your hair&#x27;s ends after the shower.</li>
            <li> wasted a lot of money paying the co-pay).</li>
            <li> I am dealing now with a big stress and headache because of their poor costumer service....</li>
            <li> I have always had issues with products being too harsh or ineffective on my hair.</li>
            <li> Raw, Cold Pressed, 100% Pure 50ml..</li>
            <li> Have desperately tried everything to get it under control and have had minimal results until starting using this oil.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elbows: usually use baby oil, which works for about 12 hours.</li>
            <li> did not notice a reduction in a small age spot on my hand</li>
            <li> I do not need the label to be overpriced and mass produced, the print on this label says the same be it homemade or expensively produced.  </li>
            <li> and that has never been an option for me in the past.  </li>
            <li> Amazon is one of very few sites I trust to make&lt;br /&gt;purchases from.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s a very green product.</li>
            <li> My one complaint would be that it is not organic.  </li>
            <li> It is not a bit unpleasant and just about the time you realize it has a scent it fades away totally.  </li>
            <li> and we both had the same bad impression of this product.</li>
            <li> I used to buy Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil, but the bottle was poorly designed and each time it would spill all over my stuff when I was traveling.</li>
            <li> Then I follow up with a thin layer of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I accidentally knocked a bottle when I was reaching for it, and it felt into the sink and the glass broke and</li>
            <li> It has a bit of a weird smell that takes getting used to.</li>
            <li> and my skin was looking sallow and a bit haggard after a very tough year, and I had lost a lot of my glow.  </li>
            <li> You will not be sorry!</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can replace my very expensive face lotion with this cheaper and organic product.  </li>
            <li> all my oil got spilled :(</li>
            <li> Horrible had to stop using this product.....</li>
            <li> I used it on a nasty case of athlete&#x27;s foot (I know, yuck)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this product a couple weeks ago from this seller. I was mid-horrible breakout caused by an anti-aging product (with the initials OoO lol) which resulted in painful cystic acne. I am 43 years old so I was not thrilled by that and looking for natural repairs for that as well as help for my dry and sensitive skin issues. I had been doing a lot of research into argan oil and this seller has a great price and good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled to say that this product has not only vastly softened and smoothed my very dry skin, it does so without need of a regular daily moisturizer. I put it on twice a day, just as I used to with my moisturizer. It has been doing a wonderful job of clearing up what was a total disaster, my entire face was terribly broken out from that previous product, and now it is almost entirely gone. It absorbs fully into my skin and very quickly so it does not interfere with my makeup regime. This product is working *so* well for me that I have finally convinced my fiance (a man&#x27;s man lol) to use it on his rosacea and he is very pleased with the reduced redness and bettered condition of HIS skin in only a week&#x27;s use. Meanwhile my cuticles and nailbeds are looking better than they ever have, because after I put it on my face, I rub the excess into my nails. I use solar oil on my nails which I love but I often forget, so it&#x27;s nice to have an all-in-one product where I can take care of everything at the same time LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elbows: usually use baby oil, which works for about 12 hours. Now I use argan oil which lasts from shower to shower and is definitely improving the former ashy-ness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am learning to use it on my hair, which is in pretty good condition, but also prone to dryness, so I don&#x27;t have a full report on that yet, but I do see vast improvement in the lack of tangles when combing my wet hair after a shower. That means even shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip it out because I put it on after the shower, not before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very little of this product goes a very long way, and I bought the small bottle. Next time I will buy the larger size and split it up for me and my fiance. My package arrived in perfect condition, with no leakage. Yes, the label does look like it came from a personal printer, but I consider that to be no problem considering the product works so well. :)very long way, and I bought the small bottle.

            <li> I totally love this product. I was using it on my hair and face for 3 days and I could see a big difference. Unfortunately, I accidentally knocked a bottle when I was reaching for it, and it felt into the sink and the glass broke and all my oil got spilled :(&lt;br /&gt;This was the most expensive cosmetic I have ever bought and it breaks my heart that it was wasted and I lost all that money. Maybe the seller should think about changing the glass bottle to plastic. I love how the glass looks (it looks very elegant and expensive) but it is very fragile and the fact that the bottle is tall makes it less stable. I wrote an email to the seller about it, but I got an automatic email from Amazon, that does not answered my questions...&lt;br /&gt;So, I really do recomend the product, but maybe pour it into the plastic bottle when you get it, or be carefull.&lt;br /&gt;More about the oil: I was using it only for 3 days, but it works from the very first time. It is great for curly hair. Just don&#x27;t put to much, it will make your hair oily. Just massage few drops into your hair&#x27;s ends after the shower.It will make your hair silky, smooth and shinny.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how to apply the oil to my hair and pleased&lt;br /&gt;that Amazon addressed my question satisfactorily and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Also the price for pure virgin Argan oil is better than some&lt;br /&gt;products that are advertised as Argan oil but do have additives.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m especially pleased with the manner in which Amazon addressed&lt;br /&gt;my question.  Amazon is one of very few sites I trust to make&lt;br /&gt;purchases from.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my hair and skin. I really like it a lot!!! I have long curly/wavy hair (depending on the weather). I put a few drops through my hair when it was wet. Then when my hair was almost dry, I put my gel in. When it dried, my curls had more body and were very defined. There was no frizz, and my hair had a healthy shine. I also use Slice of Nature Argan Oil on my face (I am going on 47 yrs). I love how it feels. It makes my skin feel more youthful, soft and smooth. Furthermore, I use the oil on my body. It works especially well when my skin is damp right out of the shower. I like how it absorbs without feeling greasy. Slice of Nature was the first brand of pure argan oil I purchased.The first time I ordered from them they sent my a free sample of shea butter too! I did experiment with another brand, but for some reason I did not like it as much. The other brand did not have that \\&quot;argany\\&quot; odor (that does go away after a few minutes). It made me wonder if some of the key benefits were taken out with that natural scent. So I ordered again recently from Slice of Nature. This time the bottle came in a very nice box. Last time it was just a bottle. I used to work in natural food and body care stores, so this did not bother me. But the box with ingredients and benefits listed did help the product have a more professional look as well as trust appeal.</li>
            <li> After I wash my hair and it&#x27;s dried, I rub several pumps worth in my hair, ears down and then a bit over the scalp hair.  It soaks in and doesn&#x27;t leave my 2C/3A (wavy/curly) hair greasy.  I also use it as a facial moisturizer.  The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I&#x27;ve tried almond, emu, jojoba, apricot and this is the one I repurchase.</li>
            <li> I saw a product containing Argan Oil on a popular shopping network, and I almost bought it. I then went to amazon to look around and I found Slice of Nature! My skin is soooo soft and smooth! I love the feel of it when I apply the oil and when I wash my face at night. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month now, but I can tell you that my skin is much smoother that it was before I started using this great stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend anyone on the fence to buy it! You will not be sorry!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I tried a lot of oils from olive, cacao, coconut and argan, so far this is the best. Coconut virgin oil is good too but it solidified during winter (i think, only good in the tropical places and much cheaper too). I have a skin problem, i went from doctor to doctor but they don&#x27;t agree on specific diagnostic, one said it&#x27;s a kind of eczema but don&#x27;t know what really it is(need more observation), other said it&#x27;s a mild psoriasis, other said it&#x27;s a seborrheic dermatitis, and many more. So I decided to do research myself(I wasted a lot of money paying the co-pay). I found an ointment in Taiwan that work but they don&#x27;t give the ingredients so i used it for 2 years, i&#x27;m out of it and they don&#x27;t give it anymore. Tried Virgin coconut oil, it work good too but I observed that it can&#x27;t prevent the break-out during winter(cold times), Then I found out this argan oil from Slice of Nature, it work all year round and it totally control my skin problem.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The price, hopefully they make it little bit cheaper.</li>
            <li> I am a regular costumer of this company, all my orders are placed on their website. arganoil, shea butter,rhassoul clay and coconut oil...even my 2 daughters love their product,but there are times they are out of stock  thats why i order to other company which i never had any problem on delivery, until one time,(april) one of the company captured my attention bec of the endorsement of hollywood female superstar.They have a good product as well, but guess what??? I am dealing now with a big stress and headache because of their poor costumer service....How i wish the slice of nature would carry more natural product.</li>
            <li> This oil absorbs very quickly into the skin...at first I was hesitating buying it..its worth every cent..now I use it all over my body after showering..on my face before going to bed and in the morning...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell could be a little strong..but it goes away after 10 minutes..Highly recommed it to people that have tried everything else..dont hesitate..this is a wonder oil..absolutely fantastic..I also purchased the african shea butter..and use it all over..I feel like I was wrapped in a blanket of moisture..and it has helped my skin significantly regardless of this harsh winter weather</li>
            <li> The Slice of Nature 100% Pure Argan Oil is my favorite. Its consistency is not thick and goopy, it pumps out in a thin stream, absorbs quickly, has a slight earthy smell, feels good, is effective at keeping my skin looking fresh and healthy. I also rub it into the ends of my wet hair after shampooing to keep my ends healthy. The bottle lasts a long time. I will continue to order more of this product.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. It feels great on your skin and absorbs so quickly. You don&#x27;t have to worry about feeling and looking oily. Also, the scent from the product is not very noticeable. You smell it a little bit at first and its not offensive at all. But then after a minute you don&#x27;t smell it at all. I think it makes my skin glow. I am also prone to breakouts and I have not had any issues with that. I really like this product and that it&#x27;s totally natural and helps the local berber women who manufacture this oil by hand. So it&#x27;s a very green product. I like that it comes in a glass bottle too, as you never know what chemicals can lurk in plastics these days.</li>
            <li> I love this product,it has brought back the shine to my hair! I use it as directed,this oil has helped my dry, lifess hair back to life.  It is very easy to use, has a great smell and it is not heavy and oily but more of a concentrated oil that melts into hair or skin.  I am also very happy with the company.  I received the product earlier than expected, also package and presentation surpassed my expectations.  Overall I will order again same product and from Slice of Nature. Thank you Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I just received this product today and I was so excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I exfoliated my skin on my face and applied exactly as directed.  I was prepared for a bad odor but was pleasantly surprised when it smelled ok.  Any odor dissipated quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff absorbs into skin so quickly.. I was astonished. My skin feels so soft and not greasy or oily at all.  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing my skin in 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big Recommendation from me.</li>
            <li> This Slice of Nature (SON) virgin argan oil was fine and I had no issues with the shipping/seller, etc. so if you want to try a 100% argan oil; I assume this is as good as any.  However, I bought the oil for use in my hair moreso than on my skin and, having tried different argan oil formulas that are specifically made for hair - those provide better results than this.  Also, the design of this bottle is not the most suitable.  You press the pump down and it squirts out straight-ahead in a powerful way so it&#x27;s a bit hard to catch and results in misdirection and waste if not very careful.  One of those downward facing pumps that better regulate the flow would be better.  Bottom line - for my hair it is just \\&quot;okay.\\&quot;  For skin I have not yet tried it.</li>
            <li> My wife uses argan oil as a facial moisturizer and on her hands and cuticles.  She&#x27;s very sensitive to a lot of ingredients in skin care products and stays away from chemicals, so this one-ingredient product is perfect for her.  She likes the fact that it&#x27;s raw and organic, and the price of Slice of Nature Virgin Argan Oil is very reasonable, especially compared to the argan oils sold by other companies--but it&#x27;s just as pure.  You just need to use a very small amount, so a bottle lasts a long time.  Some people are scared of putting oils on their face, but argan oil doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts in her.</li>
            <li> I guess my review is more about the company than the product.  I had a bit of an allergic reaction to the oil and posted on Amazon about my experience.  The owner of the company worked diligently to contact me personally to discuss my reaction.  Initially, I had read a negative review about the company but now, it seems to me the negative customer service review isn&#x27;t real.  Actually, I was so impressed with the customer service that I must say that I&#x27;ve never seen this level of service before!  (And I&#x27;ve worked on and off in retail since I was in high school, including for Whole Foods.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually surprised to learn she was in St. Louis as well, and she even offered to meet with me to discuss any concerns I&#x27;d had!  She discussed the argan oil thoroughly and informed me about her business and the origins of the product, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite not being able to use the argan oil, I am now trying the shea butter, which seems like a superior product to other shea butters I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to take a minute to compliment Slice of Nature.  And I&#x27;ll post later about my opinions on the shea butter!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a while now and I love it.  It makes my skin glow and seems to diminish lines and any imperfections on the face.  Doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out, which is great.  The price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I received the product after 9 days which is fine, but the seal was broken and it had leaked out quite a bit. I am now wondering if it was tampered with. I even wonder if it is Argan oil. It has no nutty smell whatsoever and seems to be just like sunflower or regular oil. How can I know for sure?</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than a year now. I really love how this product feels on my skin, particularly after I take a shower. I mainly use it on my face and neck areas, and  have seen my wrinkles diminish. I found it important to put just enough and not over do it on the face, because there is so much that the skin can &#x27;absorb&#x27;, and the oil just sits there. The spray makes it so easy to administer the right amount of oil...plus it&#x27;s super clean, if you appreciate those type of things. I like the packaging that Slice of Nature has for it&#x27;s Virgin Oil....I think they have also made the label oil proof. Thanks for your handy way of selling this product! I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I purchased this argan oil based on the reviews but with slight hesitation.  After using if for 6 months, I am very happy with the purchase!  I found that it did not fulfill all the promises made in the reviews but it came close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A pump or two provided enough coverage for my entire face.  A few more pumps for specific coverage (elbows, feet, hands) provided enough coverage for everything else.  After a week of usage I noticed that red spots on my face disappeared, rough areas (elbows and feet) were smoother and overall, my skin had a much better appearance.  I did use shea butter on my body as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not notice a reduction in a small age spot on my hand but I didn&#x27;t expect miracles so I&#x27;m still pleased with the performance of this product.  My face is a combination of dry and oily and very sensitive and this argan oil did wonders for smoothing out faint crow&#x27;s feet lines, soothing red spots and brightening my complexion.  Best part?  No irritation no matter where I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can replace my very expensive face lotion with this cheaper and organic product.  Love that!</li>
            <li> I have horribly sensitive, dry skin and have tried everything to soothe, hydrate and keep my skin happy. After reading several reviews and doing some research on Argan oil I found this one and would not be without it again. Within a short amount of time using this oil 2 times a day, in the morning under makeup and at night alone my facial skin has made a dramatic turn around. This oil has evened my skin tone out, slight wrinkles that were appearing are now smoothed out, any dryness is gone. My skin glows and looks so healthy that I&#x27;ve recently for the first time ever stopped using liquid foundation because I no longer need to hide my bad skin. I&#x27;ve used this oil in my hair as a deep treatment overnight either alone or with Ojon restorative treatment and my hair has never been happier. My hair is silky, soft, shiny. I have thinning, fine hair that&#x27;s length is below my shoulders. When styling in the morning I rub just one squirt of this oil into wet hair then dry. this oil absorbs so quickly it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair weighed down. This oil is amazing in what it has done to my skin and hair. Anyone on the fence about trying a natural oil for hair or skin should give this one a try. My skin is so sensitive shea butter breaks me out into a rash, but this oil absorbed quickly, beautifully and has left my skin more youthful and radiant than it&#x27;s ever been before.</li>
            <li> This is a good price for the pure product in natural state.  It seems geared for cosmetic use because is oderless.  I use it for eating as well.  However, the tastier one for cooking is toasted which gives it a redder color and flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great for skin and hair health and repair like nothing I have ever used before.</li>
            <li> we use this oil everywhere afeww drops in the bath  in my hair on dry lips it helps my daughter&#x27;s eczema too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really compare this to other brands of argan oil, as it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve ever bought.  I chose it after trying Josie Maran&#x27;s at Sephora; I decided to see if I could find a similar pure, organic argan oil for a much lower price, and I chose this one based on the other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 27 and my skin was looking sallow and a bit haggard after a very tough year, and I had lost a lot of my glow.  After a couple of weeks of using this oil, it looks so much clearer, fresher, and dewier.  Even my husband commented on it.  I feel rejuvenated, and I use less foundation.  And, best of all, it&#x27;s all from a totally natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the label looks a bit homemade and the dispenser could be nicer (Josie Maran&#x27;s bottle and dropper are downright gorgeous!), but the price is great and the product is truly wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(But *hint hint* I&#x27;d be willing to pay a BIT more for a lovely bottle like Josie Maran&#x27;s!)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product instead of my day and night moisturizers and I find it does wonders for my skin.  It absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t greasy and makes my skin glow...I have had more compliments on my skin since using this product than I did when I was in my late teens and 20&#x27;s (I&#x27;m 32).  The fine lines on my forehead and the smile lines around my mouth are smoother and less visible.  I also use this product on my hair, my feet, my neck, my elbows, after getting a brazilian wax or shaving; I find it to be very soothing on irritated/dry skin. I used to have atopic dermatitis around my nose and mouth and it&#x27;s gone.  I had tried every prescription available and even went on a specific antibiotic (Oracea) to clear my skin and nothing worked like this did.  I don&#x27;t know what I ever did without this product.  It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love this argan oil.  It is pure and potent.  I use it on face at night to soften and moisturize, but it is a real saving grace for my hair which is curly and therefore dry.  I put this on after I both condition in shower and then towel dry.  It is basically my hair product of choice and when I blow dry my hair, it is silky like a silicone anti-frizz product but without causing build-up.  Also great company that sells this.</li>
            <li> I like this argan oil very much. I use to mix it with my lotion and I realy like how it leaves my skin, incredibly soft and certainly not greasy.</li>
            <li> Natural, absorbing and moisturizing. I use it on my face and sometimes on my hair too. Its not sticky at all and adds shine when I use it on my hair.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B005I6DVU2 Slice Of Nature virgin cold pressed pure Argan oil 25ml]]Helps to minimize the fine lines.  Leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Nice product............Slice of Nature© Virgin Argan Oil. Raw, Cold Pressed, 100% Pure 50ml..soaks in well and takes very little to go a long way...I would buy this again or give as gifts!~</li>
            <li> Horrible had to stop using this product.....really cheap quality with no results. Both mom and I used it and we both had the same bad impression of this product. If you are looking for a quality product don&#x27;t order this</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how soon I got my argan oil. It is completely natural and packaged wonderfully. I did have some leakage as the mailman put the package on its side, but not enough to be upset about at all. I am pleased with this company and will order from them again as soon as my argan oil runs out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month and a half and I am thoroughly enjoying the effects.  My face does feel and look a lot smoother in texture.  I also do notice that it improved my fine lines.  I cant really say if it improved my acne because I started using Target Benzyl Peroxide Gel shortly after.  So one or the other or a combination of both did lessen my acne.&lt;br /&gt;I use it all over my face, neck, hair, and occasionally my hands.  It feels really go to apply on my face and I like to warm it up with my hands before applying on my face.  With other moisturizers I look oily in the morning but with this I look matte.  I use to blot my face once/twice throughout the day, but I am finding that I dont need to now.  Will purchase this bigger bottle next time.  One pump is enough for the face as well as the hair after I shower (Im half way done with the bottle)</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying Argan Oil. I don&#x27;t know if this is the real thing, but I read the reviews, and it says its pure, raw and unrefined. So what you get it&#x27;s great for what you pay. So far I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it on my hair, only on my face every night. It absorbs very quickly and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> The company is excellent about providing information and meeting your needs.  I bought this for dry winter skin and it&#x27;s doing a wonderful job though reapplication is sometimes necessary.  I don&#x27;t notice the aroma at all.</li>
            <li> I had never used argan oil before using this product. At first I really liked how it controlled oily areas and reduced look of inflammation. I expected a few breakouts but after two weeks, my face was so broken out that it has taken two months to get it back to normal, it just gradually got worse and worse. I&#x27;m 43, don&#x27;t have an acne problem or sensitive skin. This oil compared to Jose Maran smells like it has linseed oil in it or something similar. I asked for a refund and they gave it to me- three days after the product arrived and I sent an email asking about it. The complimentary sample of rhassoul clay mask was just a bag of sand. They tried to lead me to believe that their product is just so pure, perhaps my skin was too sensitive for it. Don&#x27;t think so. I use Jose Maran now. Well worth the money since it takes only a tiny amount. I shop on Amazon all the time, have always been happy with products. This is the first time I have been so disappointed that I reviewed so someone else won&#x27;t make the same mistake I did purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> With a new hair style, I&#x27;ve been (oh heavens!)ironing my hair with one of those ceramic deals.  I realized that I was going to have to nourish it a bit to keep it healthy and began researching products.  When I discovered argan oil I figured I had found just what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so correct about it!  For the first time in my life my hair is actually shiny!  A benefit I had not realized would come along with keeping my hair healthy.  I just love this stuff.  This particular brand is a tad expensive but after researching argan oil, I decided that it was really important to get the cold pressed, 100% natural, no additives, no disguising the natural odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, about that odor.  It is not a bit unpleasant and just about the time you realize it has a scent it fades away totally.  There is no lingering at all.  And much better this than the chemicals that are used to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also seems that argan oil has some topical medicinal qualities as well.  I used it on a nasty case of athlete&#x27;s foot (I know, yuck) but it cleared it up in about three days and took the itch away immediately.  A friend is using it for eczema with good results as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the 50ml bottle and its just lasting a long time, even though I use it daily on my hair and have even begun using it as a face oil. Love this stuff!  P.S.  The bottle is pretty on my dresser, too.</li>
            <li> This is a good clean product that really helps the skin. I use it sparingly. It leaves no oily residue. I believe it has improved the appearance of my skin in a short time.</li>
            <li> This is my first try of Argan so I have nothing to compare it to. However oil feels great and the service was prompt. My only complaint is the packaging is home-made - not professional so it really made me question the quality of the oil. It was in a craft-store bottle with a home-made printer label (and not that great at that) so it concerned me. For the price, I want to make sure it is the real deal. It was weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice company and good customer service.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 years and my skin is beautiful. Will never stop using it. I would recommend it to women of all ages.</li>
            <li> I have paid much more in the past for Argan oil, and never will I buy that overpriced oil again.  This Slice of Nature Argan oil is far superior and so much less.  I love that is so much more affordable that I can put it all over my body if I wanted too. My face neck and chest are loving the benefits.  I am going to be 59 in a couple days and I look much, much younger.  Thank you for this product and I will remain loyal the Slice of Nature.  I do not need the label to be overpriced and mass produced, the print on this label says the same be it homemade or expensively produced.  Keep it homemade!!</li>
            <li> I really love this oil. I put it on after I shower and it has a little funny smell to it at first but then goes away fast. The feel is very smooth and I use it on my neck also. I feel that my smile lines have improved and my neck is getting tighter. I am 50 years old and you know what that means. I really feel this has helped me and I will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;After I apply it all over my face and neck whatever I have left over on my hands goes on my hair. It is an all around beauty.... Thanks</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a week and am in absolute awe of the change in my skin.  I am in my 30&#x27;s and had suddenly been having strange bouts of rashes along my chin/neck with bumpy,acne like break outs.  Have desperately tried everything to get it under control and have had minimal results until starting using this oil.  My skin looks clear and luminous for probably the first time in my life.  I actually think about not wearing foundation now and that has never been an option for me in the past.  I started my husband on it,he is a minimalist and it is hard to get him to use moisturizer regularly. He has very dry skin and gets flaky.  His skin looks better than it ever has since I&#x27;ve known him. He has been raving about it.  Surprise! I wish we had found this 14 years ago.  I really love that it comes in a dark glass recyclable bottle and I like the pump.  My one complaint would be that it is not organic.  I would love if they offered that as an option.  Before buying this I researched all the different kinds and found this brand to be the most informative about the different ways Argan oil is processed and offered.  This is the only one I found that states their oil is not altered in any way.  I am hooked and will continue to buy from this company exclusively.</li>
            <li> I have stopped using all my other moisturizers and it even balanced out my combination skin and as a result I&#x27;ve been able to stop using as much makeup. It&#x27;s just not that great on my hair though. Still a great product.</li>
            <li> This absolutely the best product I have tried for my skin.  It&#x27;s also a great hair product.  I wish it came in a larger size!!  Love the seller!  Will be back for more!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful. It smells good, it does not apply greasy, the bottle is perfectly designed to squeeze out just the right amount without getting all messy. It&#x27;s a clean and refreshing experience using this brand. I have replaced my old brand with this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn my hair \\&quot;natural\\&quot; for many years, and have always been searching for the right fragrance-free products to use on my hair. This oil works very well, isn&#x27;t greasy, and the smell goes away very quickly. I use it on my skin as well - putting a squirt in my palm along with a squirt of lotion. The lotion helps the oil spread &amp; absorb more easily.</li>
            <li> I really really enjoy this product. I have been using it for about 2 months now. I have never really found a hair product that I have absolutely love, but this product is not heavy and it leaves my hair soft and bouncy. It keeps my hair at its best! I would recommend this to anyone, and I already told my mom that she must buy it over the moroccan oil. I have african american/mixed hair that is really thick, curly, and frizzy. I have always had issues with products being too harsh or ineffective on my hair. I have natural hair that is pretty much restored to it&#x27;s natural beauty (after years of brutally straightening my hair all of the time). I love it because it gave me back the hair I remember before my years of abuse.</li>
            <li> Great item, I have been using this product in my hair which have become more manageable and have eliminated the frizz!</li>
            <li> I used to buy Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil, but the bottle was poorly designed and each time it would spill all over my stuff when I was traveling. Also, it was super expensive! This one is an excellent alternative - it does smell somewhat nutty for the first few seconds that it&#x27;s on, but after a while you don&#x27;t smell it anymore. I think it works just as well as Jose Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used Argan oil, but I&#x27;m a big fan of Emu oil and others.  This oil feels like it&#x27;s blended, although it says it&#x27;s not.  My face felt clogged and wasn&#x27;t glowly and healthy looking like it normally is--felt it diminished quality of my skin rather than enhance it.  I&#x27;m just going to use it for my hair.</li>
            <li> This wonderful oil makes my skin feel like velvet. Use as instructed, and you will find it&#x27;s very light on your face. Get it, you will love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on order #3 of this stuff.  Argan oil and emu oil aren&#x27;t the best smelling products but they&#x27;re by far the BEST products.  I couldn&#x27;t do without either one.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal. It has a bit of a weird smell that takes getting used to. I mixed some along with essential oil of lemon or lavender to cut the smell at first. Now I am used to it..great on the skin...and hair, etc.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of argan oil and the best price. Fast shipping from this seller!&lt;br /&gt;argan oil feels so good on my skin. I do have very dry skin, I use it for a moisturizer before make-up and even after make-up is done I put a small drop on my hand, rub my hands together, then lightly pat over my make-up.  With my dry skin this keeps it looking dewey and fresh.  I would recomend this seller and product.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to warn everyone that the glass bottles are VERY fragile. I just bought it last Saturday at a craft fair, and my bottle was sitting on the side of the sink and it was casually knocked it into the sink basin. The bottle busted and I watched $30 worth of argan oil go down the drain in 3 seconds.  They should really think about using plastic bottles. When your hands are oily, it&#x27;s easy to drop the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price for the product, but I would reconsider buying it again from them because it&#x27;s an accident waiting to happen.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Just wish that it could have come in a bigger size so that I could have ordered more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for moisturizing my face--I rub about 3 drops between my fingers and gently press it into my skin instead of rubbing it around. Then I follow up with a thin layer of moisturizer. I then run whatever&#x27;s left on my fingers through my hair or just rub it onto my nails to strengthen them. Much better price than the other brands on market.</li>
            <li> very good product , recived quckly. I use on my hair , feels so smooth and silky. The only complain, i dont like how its smell.&lt;br /&gt;Would recomend for everyone.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product twice. It does make skin more softer and helps with skin problems. I would recommend this Argon Oil to anyone looking to get the benefits from it. It has versatile uses and does what it says. The price is very reasonable as well!</li>
