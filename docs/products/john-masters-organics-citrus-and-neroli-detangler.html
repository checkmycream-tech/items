            <li>This is the very BEST product I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Awesome product!!</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Great ditangler !</li>
            <li>Works perfect !</li>
            <li>This detangler is the best.</li>
            <li>The smell is also wonderful.</li>
            <li>Smells good too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so so happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using the JMO Scalp line (the shampoo, volumizer, and serum), and the combo has been great for my hair, and seems to be helping with hair growth in a thinning area on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this detangler is a great help to me.  </li>
            <li>great-</li>
            <li>It smells great and is truly weightless which is great for my long/fine hair.  </li>
            <li>So as now I can say this is a great product</li>
            <li>and I am so happy to not be tangling anymore.</li>
            <li>I guess my search continues for a great organic conditioner/detangler.</li>
            <li>And it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good report from the person I sent this to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells good.  </li>
            <li>Good Guide rated this product a 6.0 in the Health category.</li>
            <li>This wouldn&#x27;t be good used as a rinse out conditioner</li>
            <li>This review is for people who care about what they put in/on their body but still want to look good.  </li>
            <li>Great smell, easily detangles and doesn&#x27;t make hair look greasy - best of all it has mostly organic items which matters to me</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had many friends ask me if I dyed my hair or got a cut (neither) as my hair looked great according to them.</li>
            <li>I found John Masters, saw great reviews and am glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li>love this detangler, and hope they never stop making it!</li>
            <li>I think this may just be my first review, but I felt I had to with how awesomely this detangler works.</li>
            <li>OR if I skip conditioner it develops static (like poke your eye out!)</li>
            <li>John master&#x27;s organics are amazing.  </li>
            <li>It detangles my hair, but it isn&#x27;t amazing.</li>
            <li>I have been very happy using this as a leave in conditioner--I don&#x27;t have to use as much.  </li>
            <li>nothing has worked so effectively as this John Masters</li>
            <li>wash my hair just once a week and it stays nice and doesn&#x27;t tangle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great leave in, Awesome smell and instantly softens tangles and makes for easy combing and styling, even works on my daughters tangles and keeps her from screaming at me when I brush her hair.</li>
            <li>Result: shiny, soft, easy-to-comb through hair that smells subtly delicious but not cloying or headache-inducing.</li>
            <li>I have waist-length, very fine, \\&quot;but lots of it\\&quot; hair.  </li>
            <li>I know I have been reading my ingredients since I&#x27;ve been given the heads up about SLS causing mouth sores that I suffered with for many years.  </li>
            <li>So, I hope this helps!  :)</li>
            <li>I know I have been reading my ingredients since I&#x27;ve been given the heads up about SLS causing mouth sores that I suffered with for many years.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and I am glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>As much as I love the John Masters Organics Lavender Rosemary Shampoo, I love this Detangler even more.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Im thinking about buying more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many hair products over the years that I&#x27;ve been growing out my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is at the top of my list.</li>
            <li>WHICH MOST LEAVE IN CONDITIONERS DO.</li>
            <li>and I love that you can use it as a leave in as well.</li>
            <li>of the reasons I ordered this product is that Neroli is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I thought it could use a touch more moisturizing ability.  </li>
            <li>(I also do not apply conditioner to the top of the scalp and the roots of the hair.)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It smells lovely, tames frizzy hair</li>
            <li>Top that with hair color</li>
            <li>I have tried many name brands and some not so famous to no avail.</li>
            <li>and I glad I got that whim.  </li>
            <li>Even if I had to use my medicated shampoo periodically in between using my John Masters items then i think I should still be in pretty good shape.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and it also smells great.</li>
            <li>I have fine, curly hair</li>
            <li>For me this detangler represents the idealized illusion of what we, with fine hair, have always hoped for but never achieved.  </li>
            <li>I have always had fine hair</li>
            <li>tend to rotate conditioners out to continue trying some of the newer ones, as there are more and more becoming available that are more natural with fewer harsher chemicals in them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a light citrus fragrance.</li>
            <li>but it is sufficient for a leave-in and also for light grooming.</li>
            <li>All their products seem to have great essential oil scents.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it will affect my scalp as of yet, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>While the scent of this product is pleasant, Neroli is barely detectable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I very rarely review products online</li>
            <li>There are many brands that cost about the same but do not have the same excellent ingredients list or effects of the Jon Masters Organics.</li>
            <li>Just finished using my first bottle of John Masters Organics Citrus and Neroli Detangler and am ordering more.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful too because John Masters uses pure essential oils so no fake fragrances.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice soft scent; does not overpower anything else.</li>
            <li>also love that it doesn&#x27;t have silicones or sulfates (since I follow the Curly Girl Method), and it&#x27;s light enough that I can even use it as a leave-in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, some sellers here on Amazon are charging more than it&#x27;s suggested cost.</li>
            <li>bought from Amazon.com, I was satisfied with getting items in reasonable.</li>
            <li>This is a very lightly scented product that helps keep my long, fine, straight-ish hair feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>Truely a spa worthy product.</li>
            <li>I then either rinse it out completely or just lightly rinse it out, leaving it mostly in as a leave-in.</li>
            <li>AND it has the mild, understated scent of oranges and chokecherry blossoms.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to make the comb slip through effortlessly, but it will help a great deal without leaving your hair weighed down and coated in product.</li>
            <li>I have super fine (not thin) hair.</li>
            <li>I only get one head of hair, so I better take care of it!  </li>
            <li>I only get one head of hair, so I better take care of it!  </li>
            <li>I now look forward to shampooing for the first time in years!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a keeper for all you natural beauties out there!  :-)</li>
            <li>However, this is one that I keep going back to for quality of product and because it has one of the most delectable aromas I have ever smelled in a conditioner!</li>
            <li>I love the citrus all natural fragrance</li>
            <li>I love the citrus all natural fragrance</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair easy to brush out, soft and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>It is extremely rare that I can find a scented product that I can use liberally without exacerbating my condition.</li>
            <li>This product effectively detangles my baby fine hair without weighing it down or making it feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>By the time I take the comb to it, any tangles that were there just slide right out.</li>
            <li>it was just right.  </li>
            <li>You do have to put out a little more money for better ingredients.</li>
            <li>Traditional drugstore products are cheap because the ingredients are cheap.</li>
            <li>For my own use, I decided these ingredients aren&#x27;t harmful enough to be of much concern to me.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for two years for a natural or close-to-natural product to replace my old conditioner that was reformulated by Nature&#x27;s Gate and was no longer effective.  </li>
            <li>First, I tried Burt&#x27;s Bees and Borage.  </li>
            <li>(The JMO website also offers free shipping on any size order, with no minimum purchase.)</li>
            <li>This is the second JM product I&#x27;ve purchased/used and wanted more.</li>
            <li>This was one of my first experiences with a John Masters Organics product.  </li>
            <li>I present for my favorite artist&#x27;s present.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>My hair breaks very easily since it is so dry thus getting snarles all the time.  </li>
            <li>I looked into what ingredients were included and was quite dismayed when I found out that the argan oil so proudly displayed on the front was one of the last ingredients, not to mention the other ingredients included were found to cause cancer and allergies</li>
            <li>So, I have been experimenting with many conditioners to balance out both dry hair and dermatitis.  </li>
            <li>I scored big with the Leave-in Conditioner, Tea Tree, and Smooth as Silk Shampoo (I think it&#x27;s called?).  </li>
            <li>but this conditioner really changed my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair gets tangled so much after I was it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying it never tangles now, but it&#x27;s just so much</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and need a detangler after shampooing.</li>
            <li>THANKS CK</li>
            <li>I have hair that really mats and tangles after it&#x27;s shampooed and</li>
            <li>I really like how it makes my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li>(FYI, I&#x27;ve also been using Nuture My Body Organic Moisturizing Shampoo, which I also like very much.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bought it at the Whole Foods and must say it saved my hair from being chopped</li>
            <li>I love citrus and Neroli scents but this left me completely underwhelmed.</li>
            <li>If styling right after I do rinse most of it out after leaving it to sit on the hair for a few minutes in the shower.</li>
            <li>At my age (senior citizen), I have some gray hair mixed with my original brunette hair.  </li>
            <li>bottle lasted me one month, washing my hair mostly every other day, and sometimes every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are interested in natural beauty care products, this one is a winner!  </li>
            <li>So being fine and long it is prone to overdrying and split ends</li>
            <li>According to hairdressers (and I go to the eco-friendly salons that use safer products), my hair is long and fine, and I have a lot of it.</li>
            <li>Yes, it detangles, but it also leaves my thick, color-treated hair so much softer and more manageable!</li>
            <li>Less build up and more moisturized hair was the result.  </li>
            <li>The gray hair is more coarse than my brown hair and only intensified the unruliness.  </li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant, subtle citrus scent that does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>One final mention: I am chemically sensitive*, and this product&#x27;s light fragrance doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>I only had a sample of it, but I cherished every ounce and will certainly be buying the large size!  </li>
            <li>:)  If you need more ideas for shampoos/conditioners, I also recommend Giovanni shampoos/conditioners, especially if you suffer with any of the same conditions (especially the dry hair) as I do.  </li>

            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but it is still fine and for some odd reason my hair started tangling.  </li>
            <li>But I still fought my hair a good portion of the time with the comb with big balls of dried-out hair and serious knots if I didn&#x27;t comb it out.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s all natural (no sulfates), and it leaves my hair so soft!  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s all natural (no sulfates), and it leaves my hair so soft!  </li>
            <li>I usually use this brand other items, I loved this brand natural perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I found that sulfate-free toothpaste helped with stopping my mouth sores nearly to non-existent, so I thought maybe sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners would help with my scalp and hair.  </li>
            <li>After using this product my hair looks and feels young again.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I&#x27;ll worry I used too much and expect my hair to be greasy later, but it never is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cannot emphasize how soft and shiny my hair is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I developed build up.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft and super-shiney with no residue.  </li>
            <li>Some nearly a year after my treatment ended my hair</li>
            <li>No matter what I used as far as shampoo or conditioner</li>
            <li>but wow</li>
            <li>(I thought it could only happen after an intense exposure).</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely fine and straight, fairly thin and mid-back length.  </li>
            <li>This product is not too heavy but seems to really condition the ends well and assists in combing your hair out easily without having to leave a ton in and weighing it down.</li>
            <li>Now, my next order of business is my scalp itch, but I&#x27;m just thankful for my soft luxurious hair!  </li>
            <li>Now, my next order of business is my scalp itch, but I&#x27;m just thankful for my soft luxurious hair!  </li>
            <li>I barely use a nickle-sized amount of it and it somehow makes any tangles immediately disappear – my hair feels</li>
            <li>But amazingly enough, it leaves my hair soft and manageable, no stickiness or film.  </li>
            <li>So....I&#x27;m constantly waging a battle to keep my hair all-over shiny, soft, smoothe, and balanced looking.</li>
            <li>I tmay never compeltely resolve due to epigenetic changes that certain chemicals can induce.</li>
            <li>I tmay never compeltely resolve due to epigenetic changes that certain chemicals can induce.</li>
            <li>I have a very, very long, thick, Easter European healthy hair.</li>
            <li>I was seriously getting ready to cut it because everything I&#x27;ve tried either weighs it down into stringy sadness with some bizarre conditioning residue</li>
            <li>Then, I tried Organix Coconut Milk and Shea Butter that helped for a period of time, but the build up came back with a vengence and my hair was barely healthier.  </li>
            <li>I can open the cap and stick my schnoz into the product and still will barely notice the scent.</li>
            <li>I have fine, 2C waves that reach to the top of my waist when stretched, and as I&#x27;ve been growing it out from a pixie cut over the last three years, I&#x27;ve found that it tangles like crazy, especially in dry weather.  </li>
            <li>I wash my hair 2-3 times per week, because if I do it more than that, it looks dull, lifeless, and straw-like from the middle on down.</li>
            <li>This stuff is not too much or too little.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> (I also do not apply conditioner to the top of the scalp and the roots of the hair.)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It smells lovely, tames frizzy hair</li>
            <li> Top that with hair color</li>
            <li> I have tried many name brands and some not so famous to no avail.</li>
            <li> and I glad I got that whim.  </li>
            <li> Even if I had to use my medicated shampoo periodically in between using my John Masters items then i think I should still be in pretty good shape.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and it also smells great.</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly hair</li>
            <li> For me this detangler represents the idealized illusion of what we, with fine hair, have always hoped for but never achieved.  </li>
            <li> I have always had fine hair</li>
            <li> tend to rotate conditioners out to continue trying some of the newer ones, as there are more and more becoming available that are more natural with fewer harsher chemicals in them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a light citrus fragrance.</li>
            <li> but it is sufficient for a leave-in and also for light grooming.</li>
            <li> All their products seem to have great essential oil scents.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it will affect my scalp as of yet, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> While the scent of this product is pleasant, Neroli is barely detectable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I very rarely review products online</li>
            <li> There are many brands that cost about the same but do not have the same excellent ingredients list or effects of the Jon Masters Organics.</li>
            <li> Just finished using my first bottle of John Masters Organics Citrus and Neroli Detangler and am ordering more.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful too because John Masters uses pure essential oils so no fake fragrances.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice soft scent; does not overpower anything else.</li>
            <li> also love that it doesn&#x27;t have silicones or sulfates (since I follow the Curly Girl Method), and it&#x27;s light enough that I can even use it as a leave-in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, some sellers here on Amazon are charging more than it&#x27;s suggested cost.</li>
            <li> bought from Amazon.com, I was satisfied with getting items in reasonable.</li>
            <li> This is a very lightly scented product that helps keep my long, fine, straight-ish hair feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> Truely a spa worthy product.</li>
            <li> I then either rinse it out completely or just lightly rinse it out, leaving it mostly in as a leave-in.</li>
            <li> AND it has the mild, understated scent of oranges and chokecherry blossoms.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to make the comb slip through effortlessly, but it will help a great deal without leaving your hair weighed down and coated in product.</li>
            <li> I have super fine (not thin) hair.</li>
            <li> I only get one head of hair, so I better take care of it!  </li>
            <li> I only get one head of hair, so I better take care of it!  </li>
            <li> I now look forward to shampooing for the first time in years!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a keeper for all you natural beauties out there!  :-)</li>
            <li> However, this is one that I keep going back to for quality of product and because it has one of the most delectable aromas I have ever smelled in a conditioner!</li>
            <li> I love the citrus all natural fragrance</li>
            <li> I love the citrus all natural fragrance</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair easy to brush out, soft and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> It is extremely rare that I can find a scented product that I can use liberally without exacerbating my condition.</li>
            <li> This product effectively detangles my baby fine hair without weighing it down or making it feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> By the time I take the comb to it, any tangles that were there just slide right out.</li>
            <li> it was just right.  </li>
            <li> You do have to put out a little more money for better ingredients.</li>
            <li> Traditional drugstore products are cheap because the ingredients are cheap.</li>
            <li> For my own use, I decided these ingredients aren&#x27;t harmful enough to be of much concern to me.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for two years for a natural or close-to-natural product to replace my old conditioner that was reformulated by Nature&#x27;s Gate and was no longer effective.  </li>
            <li> First, I tried Burt&#x27;s Bees and Borage.  </li>
            <li> (The JMO website also offers free shipping on any size order, with no minimum purchase.)</li>
            <li> This is the second JM product I&#x27;ve purchased/used and wanted more.</li>
            <li> This was one of my first experiences with a John Masters Organics product.  </li>
            <li> I present for my favorite artist&#x27;s present.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> My hair breaks very easily since it is so dry thus getting snarles all the time.  </li>
            <li> I looked into what ingredients were included and was quite dismayed when I found out that the argan oil so proudly displayed on the front was one of the last ingredients, not to mention the other ingredients included were found to cause cancer and allergies</li>
            <li> So, I have been experimenting with many conditioners to balance out both dry hair and dermatitis.  </li>
            <li> I scored big with the Leave-in Conditioner, Tea Tree, and Smooth as Silk Shampoo (I think it&#x27;s called?).  </li>
            <li> but this conditioner really changed my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair gets tangled so much after I was it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it never tangles now, but it&#x27;s just so much</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and need a detangler after shampooing.</li>
            <li> THANKS CK</li>
            <li> I have hair that really mats and tangles after it&#x27;s shampooed and</li>
            <li> I really like how it makes my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li> (FYI, I&#x27;ve also been using Nuture My Body Organic Moisturizing Shampoo, which I also like very much.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bought it at the Whole Foods and must say it saved my hair from being chopped</li>
            <li> I love citrus and Neroli scents but this left me completely underwhelmed.</li>
            <li> If styling right after I do rinse most of it out after leaving it to sit on the hair for a few minutes in the shower.</li>
            <li> At my age (senior citizen), I have some gray hair mixed with my original brunette hair.  </li>
            <li> bottle lasted me one month, washing my hair mostly every other day, and sometimes every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are interested in natural beauty care products, this one is a winner!  </li>
            <li> So being fine and long it is prone to overdrying and split ends</li>
            <li> According to hairdressers (and I go to the eco-friendly salons that use safer products), my hair is long and fine, and I have a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Yes, it detangles, but it also leaves my thick, color-treated hair so much softer and more manageable!</li>
            <li> Less build up and more moisturized hair was the result.  </li>
            <li> The gray hair is more coarse than my brown hair and only intensified the unruliness.  </li>
            <li> It also has a pleasant, subtle citrus scent that does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> One final mention: I am chemically sensitive*, and this product&#x27;s light fragrance doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> I only had a sample of it, but I cherished every ounce and will certainly be buying the large size!  </li>
            <li> :)  If you need more ideas for shampoos/conditioners, I also recommend Giovanni shampoos/conditioners, especially if you suffer with any of the same conditions (especially the dry hair) as I do.  </li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but it is still fine and for some odd reason my hair started tangling.  </li>
            <li> But I still fought my hair a good portion of the time with the comb with big balls of dried-out hair and serious knots if I didn&#x27;t comb it out.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s all natural (no sulfates), and it leaves my hair so soft!  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s all natural (no sulfates), and it leaves my hair so soft!  </li>
            <li> I usually use this brand other items, I loved this brand natural perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I found that sulfate-free toothpaste helped with stopping my mouth sores nearly to non-existent, so I thought maybe sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners would help with my scalp and hair.  </li>
            <li> After using this product my hair looks and feels young again.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;ll worry I used too much and expect my hair to be greasy later, but it never is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cannot emphasize how soft and shiny my hair is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I developed build up.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your hair soft and super-shiney with no residue.  </li>
            <li> Some nearly a year after my treatment ended my hair</li>
            <li> No matter what I used as far as shampoo or conditioner</li>
            <li> but wow</li>
            <li> (I thought it could only happen after an intense exposure).</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely fine and straight, fairly thin and mid-back length.  </li>
            <li> This product is not too heavy but seems to really condition the ends well and assists in combing your hair out easily without having to leave a ton in and weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Now, my next order of business is my scalp itch, but I&#x27;m just thankful for my soft luxurious hair!  </li>

            <li> I barely use a nickle-sized amount of it and it somehow makes any tangles immediately disappear – my hair feels</li>
            <li> But amazingly enough, it leaves my hair soft and manageable, no stickiness or film.  </li>
            <li> So....I&#x27;m constantly waging a battle to keep my hair all-over shiny, soft, smoothe, and balanced looking.</li>
            <li> I tmay never compeltely resolve due to epigenetic changes that certain chemicals can induce.</li>

            <li> I have a very, very long, thick, Easter European healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I was seriously getting ready to cut it because everything I&#x27;ve tried either weighs it down into stringy sadness with some bizarre conditioning residue</li>
            <li> Then, I tried Organix Coconut Milk and Shea Butter that helped for a period of time, but the build up came back with a vengence and my hair was barely healthier.  </li>
            <li> I can open the cap and stick my schnoz into the product and still will barely notice the scent.</li>
            <li> I have fine, 2C waves that reach to the top of my waist when stretched, and as I&#x27;ve been growing it out from a pixie cut over the last three years, I&#x27;ve found that it tangles like crazy, especially in dry weather.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair 2-3 times per week, because if I do it more than that, it looks dull, lifeless, and straw-like from the middle on down.</li>

            <li> The detangler is part of the routine for extremely manageable and soft hair.</li>

            <li> I used to have to cut the knots out but with using this I haven&#x27;t had to do that for a long time.</li>
            <li> And it is long.</li>

            <li> My hair has been extremely dry, tangled, and knotty.  I&#x27;ve tried different products because I also have extreme scalp itch and seborrheic dermatitis.  So, I have been experimenting with many conditioners to balance out both dry hair and dermatitis.

But I still fought my hair a good portion of the time with the comb with big balls of dried-out hair and serious knots if I didn&#x27;t comb it out.  I came across the Tone It Up girls who recommended the John Masters Organics Sea Salt to help with volume (this makes my hair drier and curlier to Shirley Temple curly which I can get naturally anyway), tried another product to help with Sebum (not sure how this is working yet), and tried the detangler.  It was a miracle from the minute I put the detangler in.  The tangles seemed to melt away!  My hair stays moist all day, and less hair comes out when I comb it.  Yea!  I love the citrus all natural fragrance, it&#x27;s all natural (no sulfates), and it leaves my hair so soft!  The only downside is the size of the bottle combined with the price, but if it saves my hair, I will pay for it.  I only get one head of hair, so I better take care of it!

And stay away from sulfates...especially Sodium Lauryl Sulfate!  They are brutal to your hair and mouth!  Do your research!  You can start here:  […] if you want.  I know I have been reading my ingredients since I&#x27;ve been given the heads up about SLS causing mouth sores that I suffered with for many years.

And stay away from sulfates...especially Sodium Lauryl Sulfate!  They are brutal to your hair and mouth!  Do your research!  You can start here:  […] if you want.  I know I have been reading my ingredients since I&#x27;ve been given the heads up about SLS causing mouth sores that I suffered with for many years.  So, I hope this helps!  :)</li>
            <li> I have searched for an organic hair conditioner/detangler that works well for my hair for months. We have a water softener system and nothing worked for my hair, always tangled and very hard to brush after washing. This product works! It leaves my hair easy to brush out, soft and clean feeling. A winner!</li>
            <li> I very rarely review products online but this conditioner really changed my hair. Yes, it detangles, but it also leaves my thick, color-treated hair so much softer and more manageable! I use it about three times a week and imy hair looks and feels completely different than before. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> This is the very BEST product I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With aging my hair is getting finer and drier. Like the other&#x27;s here I have tried just about everything and the results were always disappointing no matter what I spent. After using this product my hair looks and feels young again. The texture and color seem restored. I now look forward to shampooing for the first time in years!</li>
            <li> I switched from the John Masters peppermint and rosemary detangler and I am glad that I did.  This stuff is not too much or too little.  I have been very happy using this as a leave in conditioner--I don&#x27;t have to use as much.  A pea-sized amount for my thick, shoulder length is sufficient. It is unrealistic to expect to get a truly natural, nontoxic product for the same price as cheap drugstore products. Traditional drugstore products are cheap because the ingredients are cheap. You do have to put out a little more money for better ingredients. There are many brands that cost about the same but do not have the same excellent ingredients list or effects of the Jon Masters Organics.</li>
            <li> As much as I love the John Masters Organics Lavender Rosemary Shampoo, I love this Detangler even more.  This is a &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; product - used after shampooing, no rinsing necessary.  Used as intended, it has defeated my slightly curly, mind-of-its-own, impossible-to-deal-with-in-humidity hair.  At my age (senior citizen), I have some gray hair mixed with my original brunette hair.  The gray hair is more coarse than my brown hair and only intensified the unruliness.  This Detangler has been the solution for frustrating, seemingly unavoidable bad hair days in the summer and I love it.  I recommend it without reservation and with the hope that John Masters Organics never, ever ceases to manufacture this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon but it works so well I had to write about it. This is the only product I have found that can detangle my hair. I used to have to cut the knots out but with using this I haven&#x27;t had to do that for a long time. Awesome product!!</li>
            <li> John master&#x27;s organics are amazing.  My hair gets tangled so much after I was it. After using this my detangling process reduced by 1/2. Im thinking about buying more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good report from the person I sent this to. Next time I order, it will be for myself.</li>
            <li> I have waist-length, very fine, \\&quot;but lots of it\\&quot; hair.  It tangles if you look at it cross-eyed.  It mattes up if I leave it in a ponytail.  The ends tend to feel like straw.  It likes to stick together like corn silk.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff cures all of that.  I&#x27;m not saying it never tangles now, but it&#x27;s just so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on when my hair is still wet, before I towel dry.  Sometimes I&#x27;ll worry I used too much and expect my hair to be greasy later, but it never is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells good.  I still don&#x27;t know what neroli is.  It just smells like citrus to me.  Subtle, not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so so happy with this product.  I&#x27;ve tried many hair products over the years that I&#x27;ve been growing out my hair.  This is at the top of my list.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a leave in conditioner for my curly hair and it works really well to tame my frizz. After a co-wash or Wen I apply about a quarter size dollop to the palm of my hand, rub my palms together then distribute it throughout my towel-dried hair and scrunch my curls. It leaves my hair soft and it also smells great. It&#x27;s got a light citrus fragrance. And, it&#x27;s organic so no chemicals in my hair!</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and need a detangler after shampooing. This product is wonderful. Smells good too! I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it never disappoints.</li>
            <li> I switched to John Masters shampoos over a year ago. The detangler is part of the routine for extremely manageable and soft hair. I prefer the citrus and neroli over the peppermint version. It has a nice soft scent; does not overpower anything else.</li>
            <li> I have fine, 2C waves that reach to the top of my waist when stretched, and as I&#x27;ve been growing it out from a pixie cut over the last three years, I&#x27;ve found that it tangles like crazy, especially in dry weather.  I&#x27;ve bought a few detangling sprays and creams (such as [[ASIN:B00128WK4I Kinky-Curly Knot Today Leave In Conditioner/Detangler - 8 oz]]) and also a Tangle Teezer and Wet Brush, but nothing has worked so effectively as this John Masters Detangler!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just need a little bit of this product.  I generally put it through my hair, clip it all up while I wash my body, and then take my hair down and comb it out with a wide-tooth comb. By the time I take the comb to it, any tangles that were there just slide right out. I then either rinse it out completely or just lightly rinse it out, leaving it mostly in as a leave-in. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that it doesn&#x27;t have silicones or sulfates (since I follow the Curly Girl Method), and it&#x27;s light enough that I can even use it as a leave-in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, some sellers here on Amazon are charging more than it&#x27;s suggested cost. (The JMO website also offers free shipping on any size order, with no minimum purchase.) I also noticed on the JMO website that they&#x27;ve just come out with a larger size of this, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using the JMO Scalp line (the shampoo, volumizer, and serum), and the combo has been great for my hair, and seems to be helping with hair growth in a thinning area on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this detangler, and hope they never stop making it!</li>
            <li> I USE THIS AS A LEAVE IN  CONDITIONER IN WINTER WHEN MY HAIR NEED EXTRA CONDITIONING ITS DOES NOT LEAVE THE HAIR STICKY OR FLAKY WHICH MOST LEAVE IN CONDITIONERS DO. THANKS CK</li>
            <li> This product effectively detangles my baby fine hair without weighing it down or making it feel greasy.  It also has a pleasant, subtle citrus scent that does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great ditangler ! Works perfect !</li>
            <li> I think this may just be my first review, but I felt I had to with how awesomely this detangler works. I bought it along with John Masters Lavender Rosemary Shampoo and I&#x27;ve had many friends ask me if I dyed my hair or got a cut (neither) as my hair looked great according to them. I cannot emphasize how soft and shiny my hair is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little history.. A few months ago I had bought Organix Argan oil shampoo and conditioner and had the worst bout of dandruff, which I&#x27;m not prone to. I looked into what ingredients were included and was quite dismayed when I found out that the argan oil so proudly displayed on the front was one of the last ingredients, not to mention the other ingredients included were found to cause cancer and allergies ([...]) Following that I tried the baking soda and apple cider rinse no poo method that worked for about two weeks before my hair decided it was going to remain a greasy mess no matter what I did. I then tried the raw honey shampoo method which never worked with my hair. Still I didn&#x27;t want to go back to using potentially cancer causing shampoos. I found John Masters, saw great reviews and am glad I made the switch. In summary these two products will be a mainstay in my beauty routine from now on.</li>
            <li> This detangler can be used as a conditioner in the shower or as a leave-in conditioner after hair is towel dried - it really helps with the combing out process.  I have hair that really mats and tangles after it&#x27;s shampooed and this detangler is a great help to me.  It smells wonderful too because John Masters uses pure essential oils so no fake fragrances.  I also appreciate the fact that it&#x27;s organic and non-toxic.  I will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> This detangler is the best. I have fine, curly hair and I love that you can use it as a leave in as well. And it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> It smelles great- but gave no lather.</li>
            <li> Just finished using my first bottle of John Masters Organics Citrus and Neroli Detangler and am ordering more. I really like how it makes my hair look and feel. It&#x27;s called Detagler but I use it as Conditioner. With my previous conditioner I&#x27;d been having a lot of dryness and this product seems to have taken care of that. I&#x27;ve actually been getting complements on how my hair looks. (FYI, I&#x27;ve also been using Nuture My Body Organic Moisturizing Shampoo, which I also like very much.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tiny bit is all it takes. My hair is a little longer than shoulder length. I barely use a nickle-sized amount of it and it somehow makes any tangles immediately disappear – my hair feels smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the reasons I ordered this product is that Neroli is my favorite scent. While the scent of this product is pleasant, Neroli is barely detectable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I wish it came in a larger bottle. The 8 oz. bottle lasted me one month, washing my hair mostly every other day, and sometimes every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good Guide rated this product a 6.0 in the Health category. It contains four ingredients they consider to be a &amp;#34;low level&amp;#34; of concern: Lecithin, Sodium Benzoate, Sulfur, and Chamomile Extract. For my own use, I decided these ingredients aren&#x27;t harmful enough to be of much concern to me.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair 3x a week and I need something that will keep my hair detangled in between washings. You have to reapply the detangler every day (which is something I don&#x27;t want to do considering the price). It detangles my hair, but it isn&#x27;t amazing.</li>
            <li> Has very little scent.  Left my hair shiny. I thought it could use a touch more moisturizing ability.  Makes my naturally wavy hair very wavy and my thick hair even bigger which I don&#x27;t care for.  When I used it with the John Masters shampoo for dry hair I developed build up.  When I used it with another brand it was too drying.  When I used it after I colored my hair it was just right.  So I Only Use it for conditioning after coloring my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a very lightly scented product that helps keep my long, fine, straight-ish hair feeling healthy. I sometimes use a little as a leave-in conditioner as well. I have very sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate it, either.</li>
            <li> This wouldn&#x27;t be good used as a rinse out conditioner but it is sufficient for a leave-in and also for light grooming. I love citrus and Neroli scents but this left me completely underwhelmed. I can open the cap and stick my schnoz into the product and still will barely notice the scent. This is the second JM product I&#x27;ve purchased/used and wanted more. I will try a different JM product. Three strikes and I&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li> Did this stuff come from some alternative blissful dimension? I have been searching for two years for a natural or close-to-natural product to replace my old conditioner that was reformulated by Nature&#x27;s Gate and was no longer effective.  My hair is extremely fine and straight, fairly thin and mid-back length.  I was seriously getting ready to cut it because everything I&#x27;ve tried either weighs it down into stringy sadness with some bizarre conditioning residue OR if I skip conditioner it develops static (like poke your eye out!) For me this detangler represents the idealized illusion of what we, with fine hair, have always hoped for but never achieved.  It leaves your hair soft and super-shiney with no residue.  Remember those commercials where they said \\&quot;lifts and separates each strand to create volume\\&quot;?  This stuff actually does that!  AND it has the mild, understated scent of oranges and chokecherry blossoms.  I swear I do not own stock in this company or work for them.  I am so grateful to find this product.  Here is another thing.  I usually have to wash my hair everyday because my scalp becomes oily.  I woke up the second day after using this detangler and was disappointed that I didn&#x27;t need to wash my hair that day.  John Masters, please don&#x27;t change this formulation!  Bravo!</li>
            <li> If you are interested in natural beauty care products, this one is a winner!  I am not going to compare it against all hair products because that is not a fair comparison.  This review is for people who care about what they put in/on their body but still want to look good.  This product delivers on both fronts!  It smells great and is truly weightless which is great for my long/fine hair.  I only had a sample of it, but I cherished every ounce and will certainly be buying the large size!  It&#x27;s a keeper for all you natural beauties out there!  :-)</li>
            <li> This was one of my first experiences with a John Masters Organics product.  I have super fine (not thin) hair. And it is long. So being fine and long it is prone to overdrying and split ends but it is also a challange to get the conditioning treatment and hydration without loosing volume from being weighed down by heavier products. This product is not too heavy but seems to really condition the ends well and assists in combing your hair out easily without having to leave a ton in and weighing it down. I actually only leave a little in if I shower before bed. If styling right after I do rinse most of it out after leaving it to sit on the hair for a few minutes in the shower. (I also do not apply conditioner to the top of the scalp and the roots of the hair.)&lt;br /&gt;I tend to rotate conditioners out to continue trying some of the newer ones, as there are more and more becoming available that are more natural with fewer harsher chemicals in them. However, this is one that I keep going back to for quality of product and because it has one of the most delectable aromas I have ever smelled in a conditioner! Truely a spa worthy product.</li>
            <li> I think the title says it all. I love this product. It smells lovely, tames frizzy hair and you only need a very small amount. I have armpit length wavy/curly hair, and it only takes a pea sized amount run throgh my hair and combing is a breeze!</li>
            <li> I usually use this brand other items, I loved this brand natural perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this item. I present for my favorite artist&#x27;s present.&lt;br /&gt;But this brand items is very expensive in Japanese shop.&lt;br /&gt;I bought from Amazon.com, I was satisfied with getting items in reasonable.</li>
            <li> Great smell, easily detangles and doesn&#x27;t make hair look greasy - best of all it has mostly organic items which matters to me</li>
            <li> Like several others who have done reviews I have been having some hair and scalp problems.  I have always had fine hair but after getting antibiotic treatment for Lyme Disease my hair became horrible.  Plus I do get sebhorreic dermatitis as well.  Top that with hair color and you got a crummy situation.  Some nearly a year after my treatment ended my hair is not longer falling out but it is still fine and for some odd reason my hair started tangling.  No matter what I used as far as shampoo or conditioner I still got tangled.  My hair dresser was becoming frustrated because of the tangling.  I have tried many name brands and some not so famous to no avail. So I ordered this John Masters Detangler.  It was on a whim for the shampoo and detangler but wow and I glad I got that whim.  I have not been using it long, just a few days, but I can tell you the difference has been quite dramatic.  But amazingly enough, it leaves my hair soft and manageable, no stickiness or film.  I don&#x27;t know how it will affect my scalp as of yet, but so far so good.  Even if I had to use my medicated shampoo periodically in between using my John Masters items then i think I should still be in pretty good shape.  So as now I can say this is a great product and I am so happy to not be tangling anymore.</li>
            <li> If you just want HELP detangling your hair a bit and not creating a slick that is going to weigh it down or make if feel like you&#x27;ve coated your hair in silicone, this is the product for you. It&#x27;s not going to make the comb slip through effortlessly, but it will help a great deal without leaving your hair weighed down and coated in product.The smell is also wonderful. All their products seem to have great essential oil scents.</li>
            <li> I have a very, very long, thick, Easter European healthy hair. The only but huge problem I have is that it gets tangled horribly, to the point that I was dreading to wash my hair...&lt;br /&gt;...until I discovered this product!&lt;br /&gt;I bought it at the Whole Foods and must say it saved my hair from being chopped off.&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair just once a week and it stays nice and doesn&#x27;t tangle.&lt;br /&gt;Helpful hint: if your hair is horribly tangled, put some of that conditioner BEFORE you even wash your hair.</li>
            <li> I have been highlighting my hair 4-6 times per year for about 20 years. According to hairdressers (and I go to the eco-friendly salons that use safer products), my hair is long and fine, and I have a lot of it. Recipe for tangles! Beyond the tangles, though, my ends get terribly dry-I&#x27;d say the last 5 to 6 inches can get pretty desperate looking if I don&#x27;t keep on top of them. So....I&#x27;m constantly waging a battle to keep my hair all-over shiny, soft, smoothe, and balanced looking. I wash my hair 2-3 times per week, because if I do it more than that, it looks dull, lifeless, and straw-like from the middle on down. If I&#x27;m not super careful and selective about the products I use, I end up with a greasy looking scalp and a dry bottom. Not a good look. The answer to my hair conundrum: the Neroli Citrus Detangler. I use it like a regular conditioner, and I use a lot of it. One 8oz bottle probably lasts me only 6-7 washes, but my goodness, it works. I apply it to my hair from the base of my skull downward, leave it on for 5-10 minutes and then rinse it out under tepid to cool water (depending on the season and how cold I can stand it). Result: shiny, soft, easy-to-comb through hair that smells subtly delicious but not cloying or headache-inducing. *One final mention: I am chemically sensitive*, and this product&#x27;s light fragrance doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It is extremely rare that I can find a scented product that I can use liberally without exacerbating my condition. I could roll around in this fragrance all day and feel great-probably because it&#x27;s natural and not full of neurotoxic, endocrine-disrupting phthalates and the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*i.e. I can&#x27;t tolerate synthetic fragrances, disinfectant, or pesticide chemicals (the worst). Public service announcement-watch the chemicals you use on your body and in/around your home. I had no idea I could trigger chemical snesitivity in myself by chronic, inadvertent exposure to everyday toxins (I thought it could only happen after an intense exposure). In my case, it was regular, Orkin-style pesticide treatments for cockroaches and rats at my FORMER place of employment that pushed me over the edge. I&#x27;ve had pronounced chemical sensitivity ever since. I tmay never compeltely resolve due to epigenetic changes that certain chemicals can induce. Watch out for yourself, and protect your children from the harsh chemicals. You won&#x27;t know you&#x27;re vulnerable until it&#x27;s too late.an intense exposure).

            <li> This is a great leave in, Awesome smell and instantly softens tangles and makes for easy combing and styling, even works on my daughters tangles and keeps her from screaming at me when I brush her hair.</li>
            <li> This product is just awful. Scent is just \\&quot;blah\\&quot;. Texture is watery and thin. Did not detangle or condition my hair in any way, shape or form! I was really disappointed. I guess my search continues for a great organic conditioner/detangler.</li>
