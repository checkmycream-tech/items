            <li>The best straightening serum.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>I just bought this Superstraight Serum about 2 weeks ago, but I had to write and say it is wonderful!!  </li>
            <li>works great!</li>

            <li>lol</li>
            <li>This product is non-greasy, no build-up, and great at protecting my hair from the damage of heat.</li>
            <li>Boy, am I happy.</li>
            <li>and it looks and feels great all day.</li>
            <li>this works magic on it!!</li>
            <li>This is the most awesome stuff I ever used.</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked this good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before and loved it</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve battled curly and frizzy hair all my life and have tried many products to no avail!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, non-greasy, (VERY important for someone with a tendancy for oily hair) and provides great heat protection as well as smooth hair texture.  </li>
            <li>Hope the prod is safe  </li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>&quot; more than ever before.</li>
            <li>4 pumps at the most will do you.</li>
            <li>many, many times with sporadic replys from them.  </li>
            <li>Youll love it</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Although I love Pureology, I found this particular product to not be successful in achieving what it promised.</li>
            <li>Using it my hair is smooth and incredibly shiny and my drying time is down a good 5-7 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Good product to keep hair straight.</li>
            <li>(my hair has a strong wave)  </li>
            <li>I can get it as straight and very smooth!</li>
            <li>My hair is fine</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but alot of it</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t order my Super Straight through Amazon, but their price is a good one.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I could complain about is that it doesn&#x27;t smell great.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great to add moisture back into the hair as well as shine without alcohol or oil build-up.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it locally so always buy it on line at a great price.</li>
            <li>This product Pureology anti-fade complex super straight serum is a wonderful product for styling and having a super great shine to the hair.  </li>
            <li>After TIGI quit making my favorite styling product, I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a new favorite.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth my money!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I received Pureology Super Smooth Relaxing Serum (in a brown container) which sells on this site for $18.00.  </li>
            <li>But, that is the trade-off for a high quality product with pure ingredients and good technology.  </li>
            <li>Def worth the money.</li>
            <li>Truly worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Takes half the time to style and stays nice fir 2 days, no frizz even in the rain!  </li>
            <li>This product made styling my hair less time-consuming, and it looks SO good.</li>
            <li>It really works, and leaves my hair feeling natural -- not stiff like other leave in products-- and looking wonderful.</li>
            <li>I used to have to blow dry it and then straighten it, and if I was lucky it looked ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Pureology products for several years and love them</li>
            <li>Pureology sold the brand and the formula is most definitely changed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, so I know exactly what it feels, looks and smells like.  </li>
            <li>and I just run my flat iron through the top</li>
            <li>Today is the first day and my hair came out perfectly straight with the dryer alone, NO FRIZZ (major acomplishment).&lt;br /&gt;History of my hair...very fine, but</li>
            <li>It doen&#x27;t make your hair straight.</li>
            <li>I have very wavy/frizzy hair, but I always straighten it.</li>
            <li>Completely straight, and non-frizzy</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I had never tried Pureology products before, but absolutely became a fan after trying this.</li>
            <li>and it calms my coarse hair, makes it shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>it keeps it straight without any frizz during the day.  </li>
            <li>Also...I have natural wavy hair and this serum straightens it right out.</li>
            <li>, it makes it so easy to dry</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve all either been incredibly greasy, too heavy on the hair or just plain didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed a marked difference in how much longer my color lasts.  </li>
            <li>Not sticky or heavy and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>lots of it, everything makes it frizz, it is naturally curly, but for a change I had it relaxed a few weeks ago, there is still a little wave when I blow it out, so I use the flat iron to make it perfect.</li>
            <li>I live near the beach in high humidity.</li>
            <li>I have been told it looks like I got it professionally blown out!</li>
            <li>The latest one I got was DEFINITELY not authentic.</li>
            <li>not use more than a small dot or it will make your hair have a oily appearance.</li>
            <li>I distributed about 2 pumps worth through my damp hair, let it air dry</li>
            <li>if I just got an old bottle or if this is just how it is.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>My hair  still frizzed and it made my hair too soft.</li>
            <li>This product IS NOT THE SAME as the real deal.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair too soft and it still frizzes.</li>
            <li>have naturally curly hair, with some frizz</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this product, I blew dry my hair completely at night.</li>
            <li>I ordered Purology Antifade Complex Super Straight (in a blue pump bottle - a picture was included in the order) at a price of $28.00.  </li>
            <li>I blow out straight every other day.  </li>
            <li>I have color treated hair and this serum keeps the color in much longer than other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>

            <li> and then used the flat iron</li>
            <li> I must add, their products are highly concentrated so you use very little.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely curly and coarse hair</li>
            <li> so I blow dry then flat-iron.</li>
            <li> The stuff that smells the best usually works the worst for me!</li>

            <li> This product is not worth one cent.</li>
            <li> I finally filed a complaint with Amazon in order to be refunded and return the product.  </li>
            <li> and Ive been looking for a product that wouldn&#x27;t feel greasy or weight it down</li>
            <li> I feel like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It makes it hard &amp; rough!</li>
            <li> It is not nearly as good as Pureology&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> like I usually do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t style it as usual</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Reds are notorious for fading horribly and yet using Pureology products, I&#x27;m 5 weeks in and just as red as the day I walked out of the salon last.  </li>
            <li> It took so long , hands would be so tired and it still looked like crap!  </li>
            <li> I hate to say that this product does nothing for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I hated doing my hair.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but the price from the dealer I ordered it from was outrageous.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Dr Oz, lied. My wife bought this because Dr. Oz recommend it but she wan&#x27;t happy with it. When she received the bottle it feels half empty. She tried it and it&#x27;s like a hair gel. It doen&#x27;t make your hair straight. It makes it hard &amp; rough!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I finally found something that works. I hated doing my hair. It took so long , hands would be so tired and it still looked like crap!  Takes half the time to style and stays nice fir 2 days, no frizz even in the rain!  I have been told it looks like I got it professionally blown out! Def worth the money. Hope the prod is safe  whatever is in it works lol</li>
            <li> The best straightening serum. Not sticky or heavy and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of my hairdresser, and I can&#x27;t believe how well it works! I have very wavy/frizzy hair, but I always straighten it. I used to have to blow dry it and then straighten it, and if I was lucky it looked ok. The first time I tried this product, I blew dry my hair completely at night. When I got up in the morning, I ran a comb through it and that was it! Completely straight, and non-frizzy AND I didn&#x27;t have to use my straightening iron!</li>
            <li> I have long, coarse, wavy here and there, thick hair. No product I&#x27;ve ever used has worked like this one. I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference it made. My hair has never looked this good. I distributed about 2 pumps worth through my damp hair, let it air dry and then used the flat iron like I usually do. This product made styling my hair less time-consuming, and it looks SO good. I&#x27;ll be using this, and only this, from now on. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the reviews on this site.  It definitely lived up to my expectations.  It&#x27;s smooth, non-greasy, (VERY important for someone with a tendancy for oily hair) and provides great heat protection as well as smooth hair texture.  The only thing I could complain about is that it doesn&#x27;t smell great.  But, that is the trade-off for a high quality product with pure ingredients and good technology.  The stuff that smells the best usually works the worst for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Pureology products for several years and love them but this smelled almost like it was mildewed on the inside and it did nothing for my hair. I&#x27;m not sure if I just got an old bottle or if this is just how it is. I feel like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I bought this on my stylist&#x27;s recommendation and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  My hair is fine but I have a ton of it and it&#x27;s cut in a chin-length bob.  I blow out straight every other day.  I&#x27;ve tried literally hundreds of different products that claimed to get rid of frizz and help straighten.  (my hair has a strong wave)  They&#x27;ve all either been incredibly greasy, too heavy on the hair or just plain didn&#x27;t work.  But this does everything it claims.  Using it my hair is smooth and incredibly shiny and my drying time is down a good 5-7 minutes.  I&#x27;ve also noticed a marked difference in how much longer my color lasts.  Reds are notorious for fading horribly and yet using Pureology products, I&#x27;m 5 weeks in and just as red as the day I walked out of the salon last.  Truly worth every penny.  I must add, their products are highly concentrated so you use very little.  Definitely worth my money!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have naturally curly hair so I blow dry then flat-iron. This product is non-greasy, no build-up, and great at protecting my hair from the damage of heat. I also use the moroccan hair oil now as well. It&#x27;s not a purelogy  product but it&#x27;s great to add moisture back into the hair as well as shine without alcohol or oil build-up. Try it!!!</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I decided to purchase this product. Boy, am I happy. Today is the first day and my hair came out perfectly straight with the dryer alone, NO FRIZZ (major acomplishment).&lt;br /&gt;History of my hair...very fine, but lots of it, everything makes it frizz, it is naturally curly, but for a change I had it relaxed a few weeks ago, there is still a little wave when I blow it out, so I use the flat iron to make it perfect. Today with this product I did not have to. Plus it feels like silk. I will be purchasing the shampoo and conditioner now.&lt;br /&gt;I admit the price put me off, but the reviews made me buy. I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I had never tried Pureology products before, but absolutely became a fan after trying this. It really works, and leaves my hair feeling natural -- not stiff like other leave in products-- and looking wonderful. I&#x27;ve heard \\&quot;your hair looks so beautiful\\&quot; more than ever before. Thank you Pureology!</li>
            <li> Pureology sold the brand and the formula is most definitely changed. This product is not worth one cent. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly and coarse hair this works magic on it!! I can get it as straight and very smooth! This product is a necessity for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and loved it but the price from the dealer I ordered it from was outrageous.  I thought I was ordering 2 for the price of $63.00 but it was for one!  It was returned immediately.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t order my Super Straight through Amazon, but their price is a good one.  I get it for a deal from my stylist and all I can say is I couldn&#x27;t go another day without this stuff.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and it calms my coarse hair, makes it shiny and smooth.  It&#x27;s worth every penny! Just don&#x27;t use a lot.  4 pumps at the most will do you.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. My hair  still frizzed and it made my hair too soft. I couldn&#x27;t style it as usual</li>
            <li> I ordered Purology Antifade Complex Super Straight (in a blue pump bottle - a picture was included in the order) at a price of $28.00.  I received Pureology Super Smooth Relaxing Serum (in a brown container) which sells on this site for $18.00.  The container was opened and damaged.  I contacted Beauty Pros (who sold me the stuff) many, many times with sporadic replys from them.  I finally filed a complaint with Amazon in order to be refunded and return the product.  This is the first time I have returned a product or filed a complaint.  I would never order from Beauty Pros again!</li>
            <li> Great product! Not sold in local stores!</li>
            <li> I just bought this Superstraight Serum about 2 weeks ago, but I had to write and say it is wonderful!!  I have fine hair, but alot of it and Ive been looking for a product that wouldn&#x27;t feel greasy or weight it down, it makes it so easy to dry and I just run my flat iron through the top and it looks and feels great all day. Pureology has done it again, I&#x27;d recommand any of there products, but warning once you try it nothing else will work again.</li>
            <li> Good product to keep hair straight.</li>
            <li> This product Pureology anti-fade complex super straight serum is a wonderful product for styling and having a super great shine to the hair.  I can&#x27;t find it locally so always buy it on line at a great price.</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair and this serum keeps the color in much longer than other products I&#x27;ve used. Also...I have natural wavy hair and this serum straightens it right out. The straightening stays in until the next washing too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, so I know exactly what it feels, looks and smells like.  The latest one I got was DEFINITELY not authentic.</li>
            <li> This is the most awesome stuff I ever used. My hair gets frizzy and I started using Pureology, I havent had a problem with my hair. I just cant say enough about it. Youll love it</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years until recently when they stopped making it. This product IS NOT THE SAME as the real deal. My hair does not not come out sleek &amp; shiny when I use this on my hair, now it has a frizz to it. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product does not help defrizz or straighten curly hair. It leaves hair too soft and it still frizzes. Don&#x27;t waste your money! It is not nearly as good as Pureology&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have wavy, frizzy hair.  When I use this product, it cuts down time on using flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;Do not use more than a small dot or it will make your hair have a oily appearance.</li>
            <li> Although I love Pureology, I found this particular product to not be successful in achieving what it promised. I&#x27;ve battled curly and frizzy hair all my life and have tried many products to no avail! Living in the humidity of the south, I guess I&#x27;ll keep looking!</li>
            <li> After TIGI quit making my favorite styling product, I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a new favorite. (I haven&#x27;t found one)!&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curly hair, with some frizz, that will grow the size of Texas in humidity.  I hate to say that this product does nothing for my hair.  I live near the beach in high humidity.</li>
            <li> if i&#x27;ve got the time i use this while drying my hair.  it keeps it straight without any frizz during the day.  works great!</li>
