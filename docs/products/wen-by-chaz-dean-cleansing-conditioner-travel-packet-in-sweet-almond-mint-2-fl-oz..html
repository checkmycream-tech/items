            <li>TRYING A SAMPLE WAS GREAT!</li>
            <li>My best advice is TRY IT before you BUY</li>
            <li>My best advice is TRY IT before you BUY</li>
            <li>Perfect to throw in your overnight bag.  </li>
            <li>Great product perfect for every woman</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome and these are great to take with you over night or as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>It felt great afterwards</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great to use for chemically treated or colored hair.</li>
            <li>A good cleanser for those without any hair issues, will be adding it to my hair care regimen.</li>
            <li>The travel packets are the best as they are the right amount for two uses and since they are sealed, there is no worry of opening your luggage and finding the Wen all over your travel clothes!</li>
            <li>The sent was amazing, but the results were..not good.</li>
            <li>Glad I made the change!  </li>
            <li>I love Wen!</li>
            <li>Very strong menthol smell.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Thought there were more than one packet, my fault for not reading the print.</li>
            <li>Love, love this product.</li>
            <li>and it might work better.</li>
            <li>The back of my head (where one would pull on your hair) is perfect like on tv, maybe I just need to use it a few&lt;br</li>
            <li>more times&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also love that this product has no sulfates.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>LOVED this the first time I used it</li>
            <li>I challenge ALL of you to really read the reviews and come up with your own consensus, then, post it!</li>
            <li>It cleans my hair and leaves it soft and smelling great.  </li>
            <li>Soaks on your hair in 3-5 minutes to leave it with a healthy and clean feeling&lt;</li>
            <li>okay, great way to try the different scents.</li>
            <li>so easy to use.</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast and got here safely, but this is the best way to decide if it is worth getting the big bottle or not &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>I write this detailed review for anyone thinking about purchasing this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This particular kind makes my scalp feel minty, which feels great!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smelled good but worked ok on my dry frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>If you can spend that much on yourself to go to a salon, but you cant spend some of that on a hair product that works at home, its your problem, not the problem of the creator of the product, Those people could have just as easily bought one of each kind and bathed their poodles in it (since its sulfate free, I dont see why that would be a problem) Instead of getting on a high horse.</li>

            <li>I found this to be nothing special.</li>
            <li>Wash it out the next day and your hair will be lovely. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I did as the product definitely wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking about trying it buy this size to try it out first!</li>
            <li>I use Wen as my regular shampoo and love it!</li>
            <li>Oh well, guess I saved money just trying the travel size first instead of spending all the money on the full sized one.</li>
            <li>Funny thing, on the complainers site, each person had ONLY tried ONE kind of this product...</li>
            <li>Funny thing, on the complainers site, each person had ONLY tried ONE kind of this product...</li>
            <li>an African American woman this product is great</li>
            <li>So i have tried so many different cleansing conditioners.</li>
            <li>but i never was willing to pay 40$ for a bottle that may or may not work.</li>
            <li>Hot oil treated&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do you wish to know how many reviews I read before I actually purchased this item?</li>
            <li>REALLY!?</li>
            <li>REALLY!?</li>
            <li>Felt a difference after first wash</li>
            <li>Would have liked to see it sealed in some other way than put in an envelope and mailed.</li>
            <li>really think if you want to get wen try it first.</li>
            <li>My hair feels like straw to me in the areas where has always been the most dry, ends and front&lt;br</li>
            <li>(a large portion of) IT.</li>
            <li>(a large portion of) IT.</li>
            <li>It is very appealing to women with dry, frizzy, curly or general untamed hair.</li>
            <li>but i am glad i spent the money to try it out before i forked over a lot</li>
            <li>My hair is much healthier and stopped thinning.  </li>
            <li>She wanted to try out the product but didn&#x27;t want to pay for a whole bottle.</li>
            <li>&quot; but doesnt really do anything for your hair.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>My roots were always greasy and I felt like I wanted to shower multiple times a day because my hair just never felt clean.</li>
            <li>but I used it the next day and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as the day before.</li>
            <li>On this item in particular, I can tell youthat</li>
            <li>when you are trying to glop that much product onto your hair, its suprising how far it will go, I could have used&lt;br</li>
            <li>glad i only spent the $$ on a sample</li>
            <li>Most items I will simply read the reviews that are on the site where I am buying, due to lazyness.</li>
            <li>My hair FEELS clean, which even with other products, having to scrub and scrub, I dont feel this clean&lt;</li>
            <li>I would give this product five stars if it had completely gotten rid of the frizziness and if it were cheaper.</li>
            <li>I would give this product five stars if it had completely gotten rid of the frizziness and if it were cheaper.</li>
            <li>the one that works for me, and I reccomend for anyone on here looking for a working product to do the exact same thing, spend about 30$ figuring out which one works for you before you jump all in for a product simply because it \\&quot;smells pretty\\</li>
            <li>On the bright side, I have a new hair project that will not ruin my hair (As far as I can tell it can only help it) and be time consuming enough and fast enough for me to not get bored.</li>

            <li>O.O</li>
            <li>That is such a turn off for people of modest to moderate means.  </li>
            <li>&gt;  supposed to be enough for one wash (I have over half the packet left after my first wash, and let me tell you,&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It does not dry out your hair like traditional shampoos.  </li>

            <li> After reading all the reviews on here, I was quite skeptical, but I won a gift card for amazon, so I figured I would treat myself and buy items I normally would not have bought, including Wen.</li>
            <li> My hair is a little less frizzy</li>
            <li> so my stylist could use it instead of harsh shampoos and conditions.  </li>

            <li> Save your hard earned money!</li>
            <li> And why it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> My hair looked dirty for the two weeks</li>
            <li> I just tried it &amp; my hair still feels dirty.</li>
            <li> What can I say bad about it?</li>
            <li> I was disappointed</li>

            <li> Works well for me but i don&#x27;t  think its for everyone. Very strong menthol smell.</li>
            <li> I only bought a sample pack because the Wen marketers want you to commit to it forever just to try it!  Now that I have sampled it with a few washings, I am definitely not committing!  That is such a turn off for people of modest to moderate means.  The Wen is expensive, and there are products on the market that provide the same benefits at a fraction of the cost.  It is very appealing to women with dry, frizzy, curly or general untamed hair.</li>
            <li> Glad I made the change!  Great product perfect for every woman no matter what the race.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> This rating is because the product doesn&#x27;t work well for me. If you&#x27;re thinking about trying it buy this size to try it out first! My hairdresser recommended this product as I was looking for something moisturizing for my long, wavy hair and I&#x27;m also a wash n&#x27; go person who doesn&#x27;t use a ton of product.

            <li> TRYING A SAMPLE WAS GREAT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen for about 5 years and decided that I needed a travel size to take with me to the salon so my stylist could use it instead of harsh shampoos and conditions.  She used it on my hair and had the other stylists in the salon come over and see my hair; IT WAS A HIT !!!</li>
            <li> So i have tried so many different cleansing conditioners. I have always wanted to try wen but i never was willing to pay 40$ for a bottle that may or may not work. I finally broke down and got this to try it out. The sent was amazing, but the results were..not good. I know everyone is different with their hair, but i had limp and greasy hair. I was disappointed but i am glad i spent the money to try it out before i forked over a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really think if you want to get wen try it first. The delivery was fast and got here safely, but this is the best way to decide if it is worth getting the big bottle or not &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It cleans my hair and leaves it soft and smelling great.  There is also a slight tingling or cooling sensation, which i like.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the rave is all about. And why it is so expensive. I just tried it &amp; my hair still feels dirty. Will stick with my regular shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li> Thought there were more than one packet, my fault for not reading the print. Would have liked to see it sealed in some other way than put in an envelope and mailed. Could have popped with the USPS equipment.</li>
            <li> Love, love this product. I am in and out of the shower in 5 minutes as it is a one step process.  No extra conditioning.  My hair is much healthier and stopped thinning.  My hairdresser even noticed it. I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> i had to use shampoo and use this as conditioner.  It felt great afterwards but I wish it worked like the commercials say it does.  switched to Moroccan oil shampoo to see if it helps</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend. She wanted to try out the product but didn&#x27;t want to pay for a whole bottle. She loves the product and ended up buying the bottle.</li>
            <li> LOVED this the first time I used it but I used it the next day and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as the day before. Guess I will use it once a week or so and it might work better.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to try this product since I watched the infomercials on TV, and finally decided to give it a shot. After reading all the reviews on here, I was quite skeptical, but I won a gift card for amazon, so I figured I would treat myself and buy items I normally would not have bought, including Wen. So I tried it today, and I wanted to help others choose a product, so I write this detailed review for anyone thinking about purchasing this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE FACTS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is;&lt;br /&gt;  Color treated&lt;br /&gt;  Bleached&lt;br /&gt;  Keratin treated&lt;br /&gt;  Dry&lt;br /&gt;  Frizzy&lt;br /&gt;  Breaking&lt;br /&gt;  Fried&lt;br /&gt;  Hot oil treated&lt;br /&gt;  Thick&lt;br /&gt;  Long (if I tilt my head back, I can touch my butt with my hair)&lt;br /&gt;  Notorious for being heavy (because of how thick it is&lt;br /&gt; (and those are what I can think of!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is/does/has:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Repair (all the above symptoms with my hair plus some) damage in only ONE use&lt;br /&gt; Endorsed by Chaz Dean, the \\&quot;hair guru\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt; Expensive (I got the samples, that way I could try them out first)&lt;br /&gt; Avalible in a sampler/travel package on Amazon&lt;br /&gt; Avaliable on Amazon in; Almond Mint, Pomegranate, Fig, Lavendar, Summer Mango, Cucumber Aloe, Tea Tree, Spring&lt;br /&gt;  Gardenia Green Tree, Fall Ginger Pumpkin, Summer Mango Coconut, (and after 8 pages on Amazon, thats all I am&lt;br /&gt;  going to list lol)&lt;br /&gt; No sulfates&lt;br /&gt; Is a cleansing conditioner&lt;br /&gt; Soaks on your hair in 3-5 minutes to leave it with a healthy and clean feeling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I read the product reviews so I knew I would have to try a few different kinds, so my expectations were not too&lt;br /&gt; high&lt;br /&gt; This particular kind makes my scalp feel minty, which feels great!&lt;br /&gt; My husband thinks my hair is softer (I think he&#x27;s just trying to be nice)&lt;br /&gt; You would think it would smell like bengay, but the almond scent overpowers the \\&quot;bad\\&quot; minty part of the smell&lt;br /&gt; My hair is a little less frizzy&lt;br /&gt; The back of my head (where one would pull on your hair) is perfect like on tv, maybe I just need to use it a few&lt;br /&gt;  more times&lt;br /&gt; My hair FEELS clean, which even with other products, having to scrub and scrub, I dont feel this clean&lt;br /&gt; My head feels lighter, I no longer feel like im carrying a bowling ball on my head&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Obviously this one is not the one for me, as it did not do for me what it did to the women on TV&lt;br /&gt; My hair feels like straw to me in the areas where has always been the most dry, ends and front&lt;br /&gt; This is not a \\&quot;one use and its 100% better\\&quot; product as its advertised as on TV&lt;br /&gt; This product is in general, expensive. Even for the travel packets I purchased, they were about 7$ each, and only&lt;br /&gt;  supposed to be enough for one wash (I have over half the packet left after my first wash, and let me tell you,&lt;br /&gt;  when you are trying to glop that much product onto your hair, its suprising how far it will go, I could have used&lt;br /&gt;  about a quarter sized amount and it still would have saturated my hair!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE CONSENSUS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am rating this product with 4 stars and hoping that the next one I try is \\&quot;the one\\&quot; for my hair! As with what another writer on here said, I am going to continue trying different Wen products until I find (or not) the one that works for me, and I reccomend for anyone on here looking for a working product to do the exact same thing, spend about 30$ figuring out which one works for you before you jump all in for a product simply because it \\&quot;smells pretty\\&quot; but doesnt really do anything for your hair. I challenge ALL of you to really read the reviews and come up with your own consensus, then, post it! Do you wish to know how many reviews I read before I actually purchased this item? Most items I will simply read the reviews that are on the site where I am buying, due to lazyness. (typically if I&#x27;m reading a review, I want to buy it anyways) On this item in particular, I can tell youthat I read reviews on Amazon, Google, Chaz Deans website, and a complainers website. Funny thing, on the complainers site, each person had ONLY tried ONE kind of this product... Then they talked about spending anywhere from 250$ to 500$ a month on their hair! O.O REALLY!? If you can spend that much on yourself to go to a salon, but you cant spend some of that on a hair product that works at home, its your problem, not the problem of the creator of the product, Those people could have just as easily bought one of each kind and bathed their poodles in it (since its sulfate free, I dont see why that would be a problem) Instead of getting on a high horse. My best advice is TRY IT before you BUY (a large portion of) IT. On the bright side, I have a new hair project that will not ruin my hair (As far as I can tell it can only help it) and be time consuming enough and fast enough for me to not get bored. I apologize for the length, but hopefully all the details I am providing will help someoone choose products in the future. I would give this product five stars if it had completely gotten rid of the frizziness and if it were cheaper. On the upside, 4 stars is not too shabby!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope all this helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brittany Roozeboom, Iowathat I read reviews on Amazon, Google, Chaz Deans website, and a complainers website.

            <li> I saw the commercials on tv and wanted to try this out. I thought I&#x27;d get a small size to see if it worked. I did not like this at all! It made my hair look greasy. I had to rewash my hair after using this product. No thanks. I stick to my Pantene.</li>
            <li> I watched the infomercial on it and figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  I didn&#x27;t notice a bit of difference in my hair after using it for two weeks.  Oh well, guess I saved money just trying the travel size first instead of spending all the money on the full sized one.</li>
            <li> Oh Wen! What can I say bad about it? Nothing! I love Wen! It&#x27;s awesome and these are great to take with you over night or as a leave in conditioner. Wash it out the next day and your hair will be lovely. :)</li>
            <li> Smells okay, great way to try the different scents. A good cleanser for those without any hair issues, will be adding it to my hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> Really works. Felt a difference after first wash</li>
            <li> Perfect to throw in your overnight bag.  I use these packets for traveling - so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I use Wen as my regular shampoo and love it! The travel packets are the best as they are the right amount for two uses and since they are sealed, there is no worry of opening your luggage and finding the Wen all over your travel clothes!</li>
            <li> This stuff is so overated its pathetic.  Wanna spend 20 minutes in the shower over your hair??Really! Same results 20 minutes later as any other shampoo. Save your hard earned money!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product in the 2oz size but I do use WEN almond and it&#x27;s great to use for chemically treated or colored hair. It does not dry out your hair like traditional shampoos.  I do find that I need to use a comb to get rid of some of the build up since this product doesn&#x27;t lather like traditional shampoos.  I also love that this product has no sulfates.&lt;br /&gt;As an African American woman this product is great, it may not be what you&#x27;re use to but you need to give it a try.  It really does work.</li>
