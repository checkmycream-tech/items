            <li> Makes hair soft but very oily. I have very long, very thick hair and I use about as much that would fit in a BB and my hair always comes out greasy. Now I put it in about an hour before I shower then I wash it out.</li>
            <li> Ive always liked this product it good for African-American hair I willbe purchase it again in the near future  .great</li>

            <li> Kemi-Oyl is a great hair oil, my hair loves this oil.  A small amount goes a long way.  Very hard to find so I am very happy to be able to order it on Amazon.  This Hair oil works best when applied to the hair in the morning and then again at night before bed.  When going to bed, wrap hair in some type of scarf.  Great for Hot oil treatments and added to your favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil. My whole family uses it. It strengthens your hair and helps it grow. It add shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kemi Oyl for a while now. I&#x27;ve been unable to fine it in stores recently so I had to order it. It has alway worked for my hair type. Not heavy, it give the hair a nice sheen.</li>
            <li> This is a very effective hot oil treatment which left my hair shiny and clearly in better shape than before the application. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I live this product!! I have used on my very coarse hair for years, and it always does the trick as far as taming my hair and adding shine and softness. I have been having trouble finding the 4 oz. bottle locally, so I was overjoyed to find it on Amazon.com and for a great price!!!</li>
            <li> The best oil on my hair. I don&#x27;t need a whole lot it, it smells like candy and I use it as an after shower oil.  It&#x27;s expensive for an oil, but I&#x27;m worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair oil I have ever tested. It requires so little to use, about a dime size. It is excellent to use as a hot oil treatment. I highly recommend it to any hair type.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL. HARD TO FIND THIS SIZE ELSEWHERE</li>
            <li> I was not expecting this product until OCT 22, 2012, yet just yesterday I picked it up. It arrived on the 4th of Sep!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, Amazon shipping or its&#x27; partners are working wonders.  I normally put a dime size, rub it between my hands then apply on my ends and scalp.  It always has myhair shiny; just can&#x27;t get to it in Korea. I don&#x27;t do hot oil treatments, but I will use Kemi Oyl maybe twice a week, and every blue moon break out my INSTAstyler to apply heat that way.</li>
            <li> I first heard of kemi-oyl through a friend. Her hair was always soft and healthy looking. When I asked her what she used, she said kemi-oyl. At first I was a little skeptical because I have very thick course hair so I didn&#x27;t know if it would have the same affect on my hair. However, when I started to use this product I immediately fell in love! My hair was very soft, shiny and moisturized. I use it as a daily moisturizer as well as for hot oil treatments. This is a must have, especially if you have ethnic hair. Also don&#x27;t worry about running out of this stuff fast because a small amount of this stuff goes a long way.</li>
