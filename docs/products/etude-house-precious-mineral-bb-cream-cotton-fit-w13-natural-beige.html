            <li>It lasts all day and gives the perfect amount of coverage.</li>
            <li>which was very good.</li>
            <li>But coverage is great.</li>
            <li>It was great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say this is a great product</li>
            <li>Great coverage and doesn&#x27;t make you break out.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this product and hopefully soon I will be ordering another item from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I apply it with a blender sponge and it does a great job at evening my skin tone.</li>
            <li>BB cream is perfect for me - It brightens my skin and keeps my skin away from becoming oily and gross.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>/&gt;Consistency wise, I was under the impression</li>
            <li>It works for my skin tone and does a good job covering.</li>
            <li>Staying power wise</li>
            <li>the finish isn&#x27;t all shiny, and it has good coverage.  </li>
            <li>I consider this product good</li>
            <li>So, I gave the sample a shot and immediately loved it.</li>
            <li>Loved the package.</li>
            <li>One thing that I did like is that the coverage was good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;very good coverage&lt;</li>
            <li>It makes my face look amazing and bright and has helped with my Acne.</li>
            <li>and this was the right match for my skin tone Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say that it made my skin more even or brighter, but it does it&#x27;s job to even out everything!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very very light fair tone.</li>
            <li>This covers amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>i really like the pigment of this bbcream and it suits my skin perfectly (w13)</li>
            <li>Also the sell included some samples to try a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>It blends beautifully and has hands down flawless coverage.</li>
            <li>In most foundations, I wear &amp;#34;natural/neutral beige&amp;#34;, for example, in Revlon I&#x27;m &amp;#34;fresh beige&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I am hoping to see if the honey beige matches my skin tone a bit more.</li>
            <li>I love this BB cream.</li>
            <li>Love this BB cream.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Etude House BB Cream -</li>
            <li>I love this BB</li>
            <li>but this one does a better job.</li>
            <li>My mother in law loves it, I love it.</li>
            <li>I have ordered multiple bottles and it&#x27;s the best BB cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s an okay BB cream.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and it is just lovely.</li>
            <li>Great coverage and arrived fast.</li>
            <li>I would love for etude house to make mattefying bb creams or makeup products for oily skin people,</li>
            <li>But, it gave me more pimples.</li>
            <li>I bought the W13 shade off a reputable seller on ebay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually found there to be a miniscule shade difference between cotton fit and bright fit, and happily, cotton fit suits me better, skin-tone wise.</li>
            <li>I thought Natural Beige would be a perfect fit based on the color palette they showed, but it&#x27;s noticeably too light for me.</li>
            <li>However, after so many years using etude house, I realized that it&#x27;s bb cream rubs off my face so easily.</li>
            <li>The finish is nice and smooth and it gives light to medium coverage.</li>
            <li>Although the colour is lighter than expected, with my powder it blends perfectly into my skin with no problems.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t ask for more.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely good price &amp; quality...</li>
            <li>have seen positive changes!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Ã©tude house!!!</li>
            <li>not bad!</li>
            <li>It is easy to blend and feels comfortable on the skin throughout the day.</li>
            <li>This product is great for oily skin and has a medium coverage (enough to cover my acne scars)!</li>
            <li>Cotton Fit is amazing for summer, because it goes on feeling dry and nice, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;ll scrape off your face at a touch when you&#x27;re sweaty.</li>
            <li>I use W2 for the original bb cream</li>
            <li>If it were only a bit more yellow it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>What can I say this product is incredible, a dolup of product half the size of a dime covers my face and neck.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a little bit of the cream you put on and it gives very good coverage and is waterproof as well.  </li>
            <li>Smell is more pleasant and less greasiness.</li>
            <li>Make sure that when applying you don&#x27;t rub it into your skin but rather dab it and spread it in a dabbing motion because it tends to be very flaky when you rub it into your skin.</li>
            <li>it last me about 4-5 hours and since I live in Cali, it&#x27;s ok because I always blot out the oil from my face with my handy dandy blotting papers :)</li>
            <li>My new substitute for skin79, I like it even more.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of keeping your skin matte during the day, but if you wear this in an already-dry environment, you&#x27;ll look like you&#x27;re peeling a little bit by day&#x27;s end.</li>
            <li>The pink BB cream was good for me.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite bb cream so far.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m kinda picky about picking the right tone and type of BB</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s light and color works well, looks natural.</li>
            <li>it feels natural and smooth.</li>
            <li>Not terrible, and it doesn&#x27;t stop me from wearing it because once I put blush on it&#x27;s not so obvious.  </li>
            <li>No matter how many times I blot after, it still produces more oil than usual and it comes off on the blotting paper.</li>
            <li>This Etude House BB cream was my first bb</li>
            <li>It gives your face an even, matte finish and held up pretty damn well through sweat and water (I wore it over a day of hiking 7 miles + kayaking).</li>
            <li>I usually use Etude House&#x27;s Bright Fit BB Cream in Natural Beige, but in hot weather,</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bottle was bigger than I expected too, so it&#x27;s not too great for portability, and the cap can come off in your purse, smearing the stuff all over inside...</li>
            <li>matte finish for the first couple of hours, but the oils on my face still eventually broke through eventually.&lt;br /&gt;Smells like sunscreen, which might be a good thing because that means there aren&#x27;t any fragrances, which usually worsens acne.&lt;br /&gt;Not very long-lasting, though; it began to wear off about five hours</li>
            <li>look just turns very gross very quick.</li>
            <li>bb creams are much lighter than foundations.</li>
            <li>Depends on how much you put on</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very lightweight product</li>
            <li>Very neat packaging.</li>
            <li>I am very dissapointed...</li>
            <li>With this bb cream I don&#x27;t have to use as much powder foundation.</li>
            <li>I live in florida and plan on using this as my winter bb cream, because I get pretty sun-kissed in the summer.  </li>
            <li>Way better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried too many BB creams, but the American brands (even the really expensive ones) weren&#x27;t good at all</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see that it covers my problem areas on my face much better than my other BB cream.</li>
            <li>This does seem to keep break outs a little more at bay, but it was much lighter than I hoped (and I know Asian cosmetics tend to come in shades too light for actual Asians).</li>
            <li>Not perfect but great for price</li>
            <li>Just be careful if you&#x27;re a new buyer selecting tones based on photo swatches or other brands of makeup you currently own, you will be very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When i first got the product, I realized it was bigger than I thought which is a plus!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Decent coverage, although only as good as every other BB cream I&#x27;ve tried from other</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of wearing it to work for a couple of days and noticed that by the time I checked out, the cotton fit bb left this really dry, visible texture on my face.</li>
            <li>so if you have dry skin maybe not the right one to pick.</li>
            <li>After one or two hours, it seems to blend with my natural color.</li>
            <li>; which is just about a shade lighter than &amp;#34;170 natural beige&amp;#34;; however, the name or swatch shown in the photo</li>
            <li>just doesn&#x27;t match up at all as a natural beige.</li>
            <li>As far as shine goes, I&#x27;ve been wearing this for 6 hours now.</li>
            <li>that there are more shades or at least improve the tint of the shades.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alright.&lt;br /&gt;Things to know about me: I&#x27;ve got sensitive, oily, acne-prone</li>
            <li>Bb cream is my go-to friend because it is convenient and not heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it if you have a similar skin type as mine.</li>
            <li>I use less than the size of a pea and it gives me medium to full coverage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can be a little heavier than other BB creams and more foundation-like, but after it sets in, you forget it&#x27;s there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keep my facial skin look natural and glowing...</li>
            <li>This bb cream honestly makes me a bit sad.</li>
            <li>Product consitancy is thick,  creamy, smooth</li>
            <li>The reason for the four stars was because of my dry skin, it makes my dry spots stand out a little more even if I moisturize before hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It covers up my dark circles very well.</li>
            <li>The package came very early before the expected date.</li>
            <li>The natural beige color is not a true natural beige.</li>

            <li> I use less than the size of a pea and it gives me medium to full coverage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be a little heavier than other BB creams and more foundation-like, but after it sets in, you forget it&#x27;s there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keep my facial skin look natural and glowing...</li>
            <li> This bb cream honestly makes me a bit sad.</li>
            <li> Product consitancy is thick,  creamy, smooth</li>
            <li> The reason for the four stars was because of my dry skin, it makes my dry spots stand out a little more even if I moisturize before hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It covers up my dark circles very well.</li>
            <li> The package came very early before the expected date.</li>
            <li> The natural beige color is not a true natural beige.</li>
            <li> Alas, the w24 was too dark for me even though that one was more yellow.</li>
            <li> only complaint is it&#x27;s a little light, but does the trick.</li>
            <li> Natural beige seems to have little bit of pinkish tone to it when I have yellow undertone.</li>
            <li> Moderate to heavy coverage for young skin.</li>
            <li> I found Missha&#x27;s BB cream to be too grey</li>
            <li> I have dry acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and this BB cream is too dry for me.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover your dark spot totally.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like how it boasts to &amp;#34;whiten&amp;#34; your skin... Typical Asian whitewashed sentiments...</li>
            <li> The one complaint I have is that the shade descriptions weren&#x27;t very clear.</li>
            <li> It comes in a neutral beige color that is still a bit too pink for my skin, but at least it is less pink than the Skin79 hot pink bb cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be careful about guessing your shade based on the color swatches shown.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a person who has pink undertones</li>
            <li> or uneven skin tone totally.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also arrived sooner than expected</li>
            <li> and I gotta say A LITTLE goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I wish they would give samples like other providers</li>
            <li> A small amount is enough for my face</li>
            <li> so this product works well with giving me a natural look because it gives off a slight pink glow which is subtle.</li>
            <li> I have extremely, EXTREMELY, oily skin.</li>
            <li> Compared to other BB creams I&#x27;ve used, I would say this say medium coverage.</li>
            <li> It is a little dry  to me at spring and winter.</li>
            <li> It is actually darker and has a very orangey (not a word sorry!)</li>
            <li> and I looked very washed out and ill.</li>
            <li> It leaves an odd sheen.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid bb cream user, I&#x27;ve never used foundation before because I am too afraid that it would look cakey on me.</li>
            <li> have a little darker and oily skin</li>
            <li> It does not feel heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne prone skin and this bb cream only made it worse.</li>
            <li> A bit too white for my skin tone, but that&#x27;s my fault for choosing the wrong shade.</li>
            <li> I use this almost everyday!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Broke me out a bit, but only small whiteheads and nothing horrible like cystic acne or large pimples.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> but the consistency is somewhat thick for a bbcream and doesnt blend well on my skin :-/</li>
            <li> It is a bit hard to blend the product on my face.</li>
            <li> I use this along with the Etude House Secret Beam powder and it stays on a little longer.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, nothing terrible.</li>
            <li> It made me breakout so badly that my face is still recovering :/</li>
            <li> you cannot go wrong.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very frustrating.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is great for oily skin and has a medium coverage (enough to cover my acne scars)! It does not feel heavy on my skin. The only downside is the color. Natural beige seems to have little bit of pinkish tone to it when I have yellow undertone. After one or two hours, it seems to blend with my natural color.</li>
            <li> I usually use Etude House&#x27;s Bright Fit BB Cream in Natural Beige, but in hot weather, ~dewy~ look just turns very gross very quick. Cotton Fit is amazing for summer, because it goes on feeling dry and nice, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;ll scrape off your face at a touch when you&#x27;re sweaty. I&#x27;ve actually found there to be a miniscule shade difference between cotton fit and bright fit, and happily, cotton fit suits me better, skin-tone wise. It does a great job of keeping your skin matte during the day, but if you wear this in an already-dry environment, you&#x27;ll look like you&#x27;re peeling a little bit by day&#x27;s end. I made the mistake of wearing it to work for a couple of days and noticed that by the time I checked out, the cotton fit bb left this really dry, visible texture on my face.</li>
            <li> This does seem to keep break outs a little more at bay, but it was much lighter than I hoped (and I know Asian cosmetics tend to come in shades too light for actual Asians). I also don&#x27;t like how it boasts to &amp;#34;whiten&amp;#34; your skin... Typical Asian whitewashed sentiments...&lt;br /&gt;The bottle was bigger than I expected too, so it&#x27;s not too great for portability, and the cap can come off in your purse, smearing the stuff all over inside...</li>
            <li> I like this product. it is matte and my skin can look a bit drier than the non-matte formula so if you have dry skin maybe not the right one to pick. But coverage is great. I&#x27;m a fan of Etude House.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be careful about guessing your shade based on the color swatches shown. The natural beige color is not a true natural beige. It&#x27;s a very very light fair tone. In most foundations, I wear &amp;#34;natural/neutral beige&amp;#34;, for example, in Revlon I&#x27;m &amp;#34;fresh beige&amp;#34; which is just about a shade lighter than &amp;#34;170 natural beige&amp;#34;; however, the name or swatch shown in the photo just doesn&#x27;t match up at all as a natural beige. I am hoping to see if the honey beige matches my skin tone a bit more. Just be careful if you&#x27;re a new buyer selecting tones based on photo swatches or other brands of makeup you currently own, you will be very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistency wise, I was under the impression bb creams are much lighter than foundations. Yes and no. Depends on how much you put on and I gotta say A LITTLE goes a long way. I still feel like I have cake on my face. As far as shine goes, I&#x27;ve been wearing this for 6 hours now. Be prepared to put on a finishing powder to minimize the shine, otherwise you will look oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will do a follow up review once I have have owned the bb cream after a couple of months.</li>
            <li> i really like the pigment of this bbcream and it suits my skin perfectly (w13) but the consistency is somewhat thick for a bbcream and doesnt blend well on my skin :-/</li>
            <li> My new substitute for skin79, I like it even more. Smell is more pleasant and less greasiness. Not perfect but great for price</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream. It works for my skin tone and does a good job covering. To cover your face you just need one pump. I give it 4/5 because it does start to come off towards the end of the day. I use this along with the Etude House Secret Beam powder and it stays on a little longer. The package came very early before the expected date. I wish they would give samples like other providers but I can&#x27;t complain with the product or the shipping. It was great. I will definitely re-order with them in the future.</li>
            <li> Love this BB cream. It leaves a powder finish so it gives you a matte look. Staying power wise it last me about 4-5 hours and since I live in Cali, it&#x27;s ok because I always blot out the oil from my face with my handy dandy blotting papers :)&lt;br /&gt;Wish that there are more shades or at least improve the tint of the shades.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Etude House BB Cream - the finish isn&#x27;t all shiny, and it has good coverage.  Way better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream!&lt;br /&gt;I have a little darker and oily skin so I&#x27;m kinda picky about picking the right tone and type of BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;This BB cream is perfect for me - It brightens my skin and keeps my skin away from becoming oily and gross.&lt;br /&gt;Also it protects my skin from UV rays! I really can&#x27;t ask for more.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely good price &amp; quality... I&#x27;ve used more expensive BB creams but this one does a better job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going on my third bottle of this stuff! My mother in law loves it, I love it. I have ordered multiple bottles and it&#x27;s the best BB cream I have ever used. I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this, it&#x27;s light and color works well, looks natural.</li>
            <li> I consider this product good it feels natural and smooth. and that why give it a five star perfect. I would recommended to friend</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright.&lt;br /&gt;Things to know about me: I&#x27;ve got sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decent coverage, although only as good as every other BB cream I&#x27;ve tried from other brands.&lt;br /&gt;Broke me out a bit, but only small whiteheads and nothing horrible like cystic acne or large pimples.&lt;br /&gt;Nice matte finish for the first couple of hours, but the oils on my face still eventually broke through eventually.&lt;br /&gt;Smells like sunscreen, which might be a good thing because that means there aren&#x27;t any fragrances, which usually worsens acne.&lt;br /&gt;Not very long-lasting, though; it began to wear off about five hours or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an okay BB cream. Nothing special, nothing terrible.</li>
            <li> Keep my facial skin look natural and glowing...a lot of compliments from different people. I love this product. My face is oily and Ã©tude has a line that can suite my facial needs!&lt;br /&gt;I have seen positive changes!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Ã©tude house!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried too many BB creams, but the American brands (even the really expensive ones) weren&#x27;t good at all so I decided to do Korean BB creams. I received a sample of this in W13 in the mail after ordering Missha&#x27;s BB cream. I found Missha&#x27;s BB cream to be too grey and I looked very washed out and ill. So, I gave the sample a shot and immediately loved it. It provided medium coverage, I use a concealer for my bigger imperfections before applying. I also use a primer and I mix it with the nymph aura volumizer #3 and it is just lovely. It makes my face look amazing and bright and has helped with my Acne. I have dry acne prone skin. The reason for the four stars was because of my dry skin, it makes my dry spots stand out a little more even if I moisturize before hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be a little heavier than other BB creams and more foundation-like, but after it sets in, you forget it&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say this is a great product and I will DEFINITELY repurchase.</li>
            <li> Great coverage and arrived fast. Also I don&#x27;t have to use a lot.. A small amount is enough for my face so that&#x27;s a plus for me. Will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and it made my face break out. I got cosmetic allergy for 2 weeks. Its cured now. The pink BB cream was good for me. If you have combination skin or sensitive skin use the PINK Etude BB Cream.</li>
            <li> When i first got the product, I realized it was bigger than I thought which is a plus! A little bit goes a long way. I use less than the size of a pea and it gives me medium to full coverage. It covers up my dark circles very well. Make sure that when applying you don&#x27;t rub it into your skin but rather dab it and spread it in a dabbing motion because it tends to be very flaky when you rub it into your skin. I&#x27;m a person who has pink undertones so this product works well with giving me a natural look because it gives off a slight pink glow which is subtle. It&#x27;s a very lightweight product and I don&#x27;t feel it on my skin.</li>
            <li> I think this BB cream is for oil skin. I have combination skin, and this BB cream is too dry for me.</li>
            <li> i dont know about it , it was a gift to my wife</li>
            <li> Loved the package. Very neat packaging. Will be ordering another one from here when needed. A must try product. Bought one for my sister as well.</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone skin, and it broke me out occasionally. A bit too white for my skin tone, but that&#x27;s my fault for choosing the wrong shade. It is a bit hard to blend the product on my face.</li>
            <li> My skin type is combination. It is a little dry  to me at spring and winter. It doesn&#x27;t cover your dark spot totally. or uneven skin tone totally. I would like to say may cover up 70%.</li>
            <li> This covers amazingly well.  I apply with a beauty blender and don&#x27;t have an issue with it settling into my pores.  The only thing I don&#x27;t necessarily like is the finish.  I think others have described it as dewy.  I would describe it as android like.  It leaves an odd sheen.  Not terrible, and it doesn&#x27;t stop me from wearing it because once I put blush on it&#x27;s not so obvious.  It&#x27;s just different from what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> Great coverage and doesn&#x27;t make you break out. Thicker coverage than Skin79&#x27;s line of BB cream. Closest comparison is Missha BB cream, but this doesn&#x27;t make me break out like Missha. Can&#x27;t say that it made my skin more even or brighter, but it does it&#x27;s job to even out everything! Moderate to heavy coverage for young skin.</li>
            <li> This bb cream honestly makes me a bit sad. I&#x27;m an avid bb cream user, I&#x27;ve never used foundation before because I am too afraid that it would look cakey on me. I&#x27;ve suffered from acne for over 6 years now. Bb cream is my go-to friend because it is convenient and not heavy on the skin. However, after so many years using etude house, I realized that it&#x27;s bb cream rubs off my face so easily. It&#x27;s very frustrating. I have extremely, EXTREMELY, oily skin. Even with finishing powder on the bb cream comes off my face in about 4-6 hours. No matter how many times I blot after, it still produces more oil than usual and it comes off on the blotting paper. I use W2 for the original bb cream so I gave this one a try. It is actually darker and has a very orangey (not a word sorry!) tint to it. It made me look like an orange cake. I am very dissapointed...I would love for etude house to make mattefying bb creams or makeup products for oily skin people,</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne prone skin and this bb cream only made it worse. It made me breakout so badly that my face is still recovering :/ I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it if you have a similar skin type as mine. One thing that I did like is that the coverage was good.</li>
            <li> This Etude House BB cream was my first bb cream.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;very good coverage&lt;br /&gt;good oil control&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;made me break out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for the summer, otherwise moisturize before applying. But, it gave me more pimples. I gave it to my friend, and she did not break out. -_-</li>
            <li> Although the colour is lighter than expected, with my powder it blends perfectly into my skin with no problems. I was surprised to see that it covers my problem areas on my face much better than my other BB cream. It&#x27;s just a little bit of the cream you put on and it gives very good coverage and is waterproof as well.  I am happy with this product and hopefully soon I will be ordering another item from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also arrived sooner than expected which was very good.</li>
            <li> I order the W13, it arrived weeks earlier than the estimated date. I live in florida and plan on using this as my winter bb cream, because I get pretty sun-kissed in the summer.  What can I say this product is incredible, a dolup of product half the size of a dime covers my face and neck. It blends beautifully and has hands down flawless coverage. Product consitancy is thick,  creamy, smooth you cannot go wrong.  Also the sell included some samples to try a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> Compared to other BB creams I&#x27;ve used, I would say this say medium coverage. It gives your face an even, matte finish and held up pretty damn well through sweat and water (I wore it over a day of hiking 7 miles + kayaking). The one complaint I have is that the shade descriptions weren&#x27;t very clear. I&#x27;d recommend going up a shade from whatever you think you are based on the product picture. I thought Natural Beige would be a perfect fit based on the color palette they showed, but it&#x27;s noticeably too light for me. I would get the Honey Beige next time.</li>
            <li> I use this almost everyday! I apply it with a blender sponge and it does a great job at evening my skin tone. With this bb cream I don&#x27;t have to use as much powder foundation. It lasts all day and gives the perfect amount of coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Mac NC 42 and this was the right match for my skin tone Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I bought the W13 shade off a reputable seller on ebay. It comes in a neutral beige color that is still a bit too pink for my skin, but at least it is less pink than the Skin79 hot pink bb cream. I have light-medium East Asian yellow skin tone and combination to oily skin. The finish is nice and smooth and it gives light to medium coverage. It is easy to blend and feels comfortable on the skin throughout the day. You still have to blot after several hours if you have oily skin. This is my favorite bb cream so far. If it were only a bit more yellow it would be perfect. Alas, the w24 was too dark for me even though that one was more yellow.</li>
            <li> not bad! only complaint is it&#x27;s a little light, but does the trick.</li>
