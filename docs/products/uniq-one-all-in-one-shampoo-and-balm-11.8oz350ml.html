            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Have telling all my friends about this amazing product.</li>
            <li>It rinsed out amazingly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing</li>
            <li>had to transfer this to a tubberware container and dilute this with warm water. .</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>and actually I liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While this product does not make a lather--and I love a shampoo with a good lather--it does have a great, mild scent to it, and feels nice going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smell is like a beautiful perfume and the price is right.  </li>
            <li>Great product and ultra fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>It will leave your hair feeling soft and if you are prone to knotting you will be especially pleased.</li>

            <li>great product exactly as ordered thank you</li>
            <li>2.I agree it leaves your hair very smooth</li>
            <li>Love this one buying already</li>
            <li>HOPEFULLY WITH ALOT MORE INFO.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product!</li>
            <li>This has left my hair in the very best condition ever.  </li>
            <li>But my hair looks and feels fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s outstanding.</li>
            <li>Tried Wen, this is a so much better product.</li>
            <li>This makes it softer, more manageable, and has more shine.  </li>
            <li>I love to use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair because it eliminates tangles.  </li>
            <li>It helps with detangling, but the spray is way better.  </li>
            <li>sure what makes a co-shampoo, or whether this is officially a shampoo.</li>
            <li>Most of the gentlest ones don&#x27;t suds up at all, yet they cut through all the makeup and oil with no problems)</li>
            <li>That alone makes me love it</li>
            <li>My husband loves the scent, and can&#x27;t stop touching it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even better.....</li>
            <li>I paid $17.99 at Ulta, this price is much better.</li>
            <li>Love the way it smells and makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I love the Uniq One Leave-in conditioner, but I will not be buying the shampoo again.</li>
            <li>I ordered this shampoo twice by mistake, but I thought I wouldn&#x27;t have an issue since I LOVE their leave-in.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product..</li>
            <li>got a sample in the mail and wasn&#x27;t sure it was a good idea to wash my hair with this right away.</li>
            <li>i must say the shampoo is very rich</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair so soft and smells beautiful.</li>
            <li>I have spent tons of money trying products and this is the best.</li>
            <li>product is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I used twice and it was easy and scentful</li>
            <li>and my hair easily combed through</li>
            <li>I find the scent too strong, its like wearing perfume in your hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, with deposit color.</li>
            <li>Really good product...leaves my hair soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>While rinsing it off, every hair strand felt like it had been moisturized and was bouncy and light feeling.  </li>
            <li>I had heard that this shampoo was fantastic</li>
            <li>When used together, both eliminate frizz and offer many other great features.</li>
            <li>If you use just a small amount as a conditioner it is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>The foam kinda give me the feeling of getting my hair clean, but once you get over the fact it won&#x27;t make any foam you start to appreciate the results.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t over clean your hair either.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is low-sudsing, but don&#x27;t let that fool you into thinking you hair won&#x27;t be clean.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like this;  it doesn&#x27;t really clean your hair -</li>
            <li>After washing, my hair did not feel clean.</li>
            <li>I remember that it took a couple of times to get over the feeling that my hair had to be all sudsy to get clean.</li>
            <li>, however, hair and scalp don&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; really clean when used</li>
            <li>Was really hoping to love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this and highly recommend</li>
            <li>Outstanding shampoo; I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly a year.</li>
            <li>nothing special about it, it is just a little more on the creany side, like more conditioner than it is shampoo</li>
            <li>I had a bit of styling product in my hair and it was due for a good shampooing.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s STRONG and not in a good way - when I was in my twenties back in the 80&#x27;s I started liking the 30&#x27;s era and found an old jar of hair cream called &amp;#34;Vida&amp;#34; in an old drugstore and decided it would be cool to try it - NOT.  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t lather much, but i read somewhere that this is better for the hair as it doesn&#x27;t strip it of its natural oils... but wasn&#x27;t wowwed from the product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great shampoo, comparable to the much more expensive Wen.  </li>
            <li>Cost is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>It seemed to dry fairly quickly, which for me is a huge plus!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it really makes my hair feel thicker, which Wen can&#x27;t seem to manage to do, and would have given it 5 stars except for one major flaw.</li>
            <li>was hoping for more from this product, but it&#x27;s just ok not sure if I will reorder or not at this time.  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t like because I am not used to wash my hair with any foamless product.</li>
            <li>I just love this product and what a buy at the current Amazon price of $7.80.  </li>
            <li>Great for thick bushy hair</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was first taken by the scent.</li>
            <li>Uniq One makes my color last better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I love this product, but cannot use daily.</li>
            <li>Now the American way of thinking is that bubbles clean stuff, which isn&#x27;t necessarily true.</li>
            <li>A rinse, and I have soft, tangle-free, clean hair.</li>
            <li>I am a long time Wen user and was very excited about this product when my hairdresser introduced me to it.</li>
            <li>leave in conditioner which I really like.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t want to use too much if your hair is oily, but I have oily hair and find that this balm still leaves it with plenty of volume.</li>
            <li>I blew it out, and was amazed at how much volume, body and shine I had.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>: 1.I lost so much hair while using it</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if I use too much, but a tube lasts about two months for me.</li>
            <li>Works very well on smoothing hair and keeping frizz at bay.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to give this product a fair shot so started using it right after I left my hair appointment until the very next hair appointment, four weeks later.</li>
            <li>It was still clean and relatively bouncy on day three, so</li>
            <li>had just colored my hair the week before, and probably leaving the color in a bit too long, had a huge amount of hairfall immediately after.</li>
            <li>Ive tried many products, but none like this one - doesnt weight my hair down or anything</li>
            <li>Now my hair has silky curls with no frizz and is easy to comb while wet.  </li>
            <li>and it just makes my hair feel too oily and heavy and found I had to was my hair more often to make it feel somewhat clean vs. A regular clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li>Very surprised that could get my hair clean and condition it at the same time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a little sit with hair wrapped in a towel, I ran a comb through it and it was pretty easy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I just know it works like Wen, but cleans my hair a little better and makes it ROCK!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is more of a heavy balm conditioner than a shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Waste of money, its more like shampoo perfume.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather a lot like other shampoos which I am fine with.</li>
            <li>it never foams or anything, so it&#x27;s hard to tell if it&#x27;s cleaning anything, and you have to use a LOT to feel like it actually is touching all of your hair (I have long, fine hair).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a huge amount of damage, but a bit of dryness due to color:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to see if she could tell I was using something new.</li>
            <li>Also my scalp use to be kind of dry and flaky with other shampoos containing sulfides...</li>
            <li>The leave in treatment spray is great but not necessary, and very little goes a long way..</li>
            <li>Uniq One will foam just a little if you use a lot, but you don&#x27;t need to use that much to get a clean head.</li>
            <li>little too strong smelling</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve replaced at least three products that I normally use with this stuff, and my hair is kind of a big deal now!</li>
            <li>I could not stop smelling my hair and it makes your hair so soft.</li>
            <li>I use this when my hair is heavily dyed as it&#x27;s the only shampoo I can find that really is sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>I am into natural things.</li>
            <li>At the end of my appointment she commented that my hair was much happier than it had been and asked what I had been doing different.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft, shiny and do not need to use a conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiner than ever and so soft but still holds my style.</li>
            <li>Leave your hair so soft without using condictioner.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to stronger hair scents (Like Aveda)</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I use the uniq one leave in spray treatment and the curls are shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>My hair stays shiny and so soft for days..</li>
            <li>Wish I could use this instead of the Wen because I really do like that it gives me that thickness (I have really thin fine hair), but the Wen protects my color to the point that, with the exception of my roots, my hair color is still vibrant when I return for each hair appointment.</li>
            <li>This lasted at least as long as my old shampoo, maybe a bit more!</li>
            <li>real test was how long it would be until I needed to shampoo again.</li>
            <li>It is big because you need put 4x of what you normally use of shampoo since you won&#x27;t use condition.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean out of my hair and hasn&#x27;t left it feeling greasy or weighted down.  </li>
            <li>I have a fairly large amount of grays, but my texture overall is straight, with a slight wave if I airdry.</li>
            <li>Might be better for people with frizzy or thin hair.</li>
            <li>It is quick to apply a small amount, comb through</li>
            <li>Actually I think I know what this smells like - BRUT cologne for men - which I never liked, but sometimes we do strange things in the name of hair love).  </li>
            <li>This products adds a little volume and leaves it feeling soft and natural.</li>

            <li> got a sample in the mail and wasn&#x27;t sure it was a good idea to wash my hair with this right away.</li>
            <li> i must say the shampoo is very rich</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair so soft and smells beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have spent tons of money trying products and this is the best.</li>
            <li> product is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I used twice and it was easy and scentful</li>
            <li> and my hair easily combed through</li>
            <li> I find the scent too strong, its like wearing perfume in your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, with deposit color.</li>
            <li> Really good product...leaves my hair soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> While rinsing it off, every hair strand felt like it had been moisturized and was bouncy and light feeling.  </li>
            <li> I had heard that this shampoo was fantastic</li>
            <li> When used together, both eliminate frizz and offer many other great features.</li>
            <li> If you use just a small amount as a conditioner it is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> The foam kinda give me the feeling of getting my hair clean, but once you get over the fact it won&#x27;t make any foam you start to appreciate the results.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t over clean your hair either.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is low-sudsing, but don&#x27;t let that fool you into thinking you hair won&#x27;t be clean.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this;  it doesn&#x27;t really clean your hair -</li>
            <li> After washing, my hair did not feel clean.</li>
            <li> I remember that it took a couple of times to get over the feeling that my hair had to be all sudsy to get clean.</li>
            <li> , however, hair and scalp don&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; really clean when used</li>
            <li> Was really hoping to love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this and highly recommend</li>
            <li> Outstanding shampoo; I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly a year.</li>
            <li> nothing special about it, it is just a little more on the creany side, like more conditioner than it is shampoo</li>
            <li> I had a bit of styling product in my hair and it was due for a good shampooing.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s STRONG and not in a good way - when I was in my twenties back in the 80&#x27;s I started liking the 30&#x27;s era and found an old jar of hair cream called &amp;#34;Vida&amp;#34; in an old drugstore and decided it would be cool to try it - NOT.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t lather much, but i read somewhere that this is better for the hair as it doesn&#x27;t strip it of its natural oils... but wasn&#x27;t wowwed from the product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great shampoo, comparable to the much more expensive Wen.  </li>
            <li> Cost is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> It seemed to dry fairly quickly, which for me is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it really makes my hair feel thicker, which Wen can&#x27;t seem to manage to do, and would have given it 5 stars except for one major flaw.</li>
            <li> was hoping for more from this product, but it&#x27;s just ok not sure if I will reorder or not at this time.  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like because I am not used to wash my hair with any foamless product.</li>
            <li> I just love this product and what a buy at the current Amazon price of $7.80.  </li>
            <li> Great for thick bushy hair</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was first taken by the scent.</li>
            <li> Uniq One makes my color last better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but cannot use daily.</li>
            <li> Now the American way of thinking is that bubbles clean stuff, which isn&#x27;t necessarily true.</li>
            <li> A rinse, and I have soft, tangle-free, clean hair.</li>
            <li> I am a long time Wen user and was very excited about this product when my hairdresser introduced me to it.</li>
            <li> leave in conditioner which I really like.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want to use too much if your hair is oily, but I have oily hair and find that this balm still leaves it with plenty of volume.</li>
            <li> I blew it out, and was amazed at how much volume, body and shine I had.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> : 1.I lost so much hair while using it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if I use too much, but a tube lasts about two months for me.</li>
            <li> Works very well on smoothing hair and keeping frizz at bay.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to give this product a fair shot so started using it right after I left my hair appointment until the very next hair appointment, four weeks later.</li>
            <li> It was still clean and relatively bouncy on day three, so</li>
            <li> had just colored my hair the week before, and probably leaving the color in a bit too long, had a huge amount of hairfall immediately after.</li>
            <li> Ive tried many products, but none like this one - doesnt weight my hair down or anything</li>
            <li> Now my hair has silky curls with no frizz and is easy to comb while wet.  </li>
            <li> and it just makes my hair feel too oily and heavy and found I had to was my hair more often to make it feel somewhat clean vs. A regular clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> Very surprised that could get my hair clean and condition it at the same time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a little sit with hair wrapped in a towel, I ran a comb through it and it was pretty easy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just know it works like Wen, but cleans my hair a little better and makes it ROCK!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is more of a heavy balm conditioner than a shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money, its more like shampoo perfume.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather a lot like other shampoos which I am fine with.</li>
            <li> it never foams or anything, so it&#x27;s hard to tell if it&#x27;s cleaning anything, and you have to use a LOT to feel like it actually is touching all of your hair (I have long, fine hair).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a huge amount of damage, but a bit of dryness due to color:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to see if she could tell I was using something new.</li>
            <li> Also my scalp use to be kind of dry and flaky with other shampoos containing sulfides...</li>
            <li> The leave in treatment spray is great but not necessary, and very little goes a long way..</li>
            <li> Uniq One will foam just a little if you use a lot, but you don&#x27;t need to use that much to get a clean head.</li>
            <li> little too strong smelling</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve replaced at least three products that I normally use with this stuff, and my hair is kind of a big deal now!</li>
            <li> I could not stop smelling my hair and it makes your hair so soft.</li>
            <li> I use this when my hair is heavily dyed as it&#x27;s the only shampoo I can find that really is sulfate free.  </li>
            <li> I am into natural things.</li>
            <li> At the end of my appointment she commented that my hair was much happier than it had been and asked what I had been doing different.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft, shiny and do not need to use a conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiner than ever and so soft but still holds my style.</li>
            <li> Leave your hair so soft without using condictioner.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to stronger hair scents (Like Aveda)</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I use the uniq one leave in spray treatment and the curls are shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> My hair stays shiny and so soft for days..</li>
            <li> Wish I could use this instead of the Wen because I really do like that it gives me that thickness (I have really thin fine hair), but the Wen protects my color to the point that, with the exception of my roots, my hair color is still vibrant when I return for each hair appointment.</li>
            <li> This lasted at least as long as my old shampoo, maybe a bit more!</li>
            <li> real test was how long it would be until I needed to shampoo again.</li>
            <li> It is big because you need put 4x of what you normally use of shampoo since you won&#x27;t use condition.</li>
            <li> It rinses clean out of my hair and hasn&#x27;t left it feeling greasy or weighted down.  </li>
            <li> I have a fairly large amount of grays, but my texture overall is straight, with a slight wave if I airdry.</li>
            <li> Might be better for people with frizzy or thin hair.</li>
            <li> It is quick to apply a small amount, comb through</li>
            <li> Actually I think I know what this smells like - BRUT cologne for men - which I never liked, but sometimes we do strange things in the name of hair love).  </li>
            <li> This products adds a little volume and leaves it feeling soft and natural.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and a lot if it so I do have to use a lot of this to clean my hair</li>
            <li> My hair color is red, not naturally, and this product doesn&#x27;t protect my hair color like the Wen does.</li>
            <li> it with the flat iron as I sometimes have to do.</li>
            <li> My hair on top of my head feels like greasy dirty stuck-together hair</li>
            <li> This is so strange.  </li>
            <li> I will keep using it as long as I can get it.</li>
            <li> and then I can let my hair dry on</li>
            <li> I can shampoo and blow dry my shoulder length hair, and it looks like I&#x27;ve had it blown out and styled at the salon.  </li>
            <li> I can let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> I have found that my scalp is actually less oily using Uniq One every other day than it was using regular shampoo daily.</li>
            <li> So with that in mind, I squeezed out a dollop and added it to my thoroughly wet hair and rubbed it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  tried other all in one shampoo didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the weird thing - the first time I used Uniq</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shampoo every day, usually every third day.</li>
            <li> In the way of co shampoo, I rubbed it in for about 1-2 minutes giving it a shot of water to disburse it through my hair (my hair is short, I know this was likely unnecessary) and then rinsing thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly long hair and it was tangled, frizzy and dry until I used this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> So thick I&#x27;m barely able to squeeze it out of the tube, need 5x amount I normally use to shampoo, smells horrible in the shower (like chemical treatments!!), and leaves a heavy perfume after rinsed and dried.</li>
            <li> It smells a little metallic as well.  </li>
            <li> My hair is no longer dried out and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I also dried it without the heat protection spray, which saved me time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I feel no residue or heavy conditioner feeling.  </li>
            <li> After my hair dried, it felt greasy.</li>
            <li> Similar with Wen but less expensive.</li>
            <li> Not sure what all the hoopla was about.</li>
            <li> My hair color was dull with just four weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Leaves a film on my hair that&#x27;s sooo hard to remove.</li>
            <li> Lately my hair has had a lot of issues.</li>
            <li> also found this too thick to squeeze from tube.</li>
            <li> I have thick, course hair.</li>
            <li> The experience was like putting a thick lotion in my hair and rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> I have medium length thick hair</li>
            <li> I used it two days later, then two days after that - then a very weird thing happened.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> I am absolutely addicted to this shampoo.</li>
            <li> It smells like expensive perfume, and the scent lingers all day.</li>
            <li> IM NOT GOING TO GIVE BAD RATING</li>
            <li> But let me tell you this is the worst product I have ever used</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best ...hydrates your hair ..</li>
            <li> Love this one buying already I don&#x27;t know home many times and always happy</li>
            <li> was hoping for more from this product, but it&#x27;s just ok not sure if I will reorder or not at this time.  Wish I would have only bought one, but bought 2</li>
            <li> I PREFER THE LEAVE IN CONDITIONER. IM NOT GOING TO GIVE BAD RATING OR COMMENTS I USED THE SHAMPOO ONLY ONCE. I WILL RETURN AT A LATER DATE HOPEFULLY WITH ALOT MORE INFO.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff! It smells like expensive perfume, and the scent lingers all day. Love the way my hair looks, too!</li>
            <li> I could not stop smelling my hair and it makes your hair so soft. LOVE IT.  The leave in treatment spray is great but not necessary, and very little goes a long way..just spray once or twice on your hand and apply to your damp hair.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo/conditioner!!  I use this when my hair is heavily dyed as it&#x27;s the only shampoo I can find that really is sulfate free.  (Read the back of your bottles!).  I have very thick hair and a lot if it so I do have to use a lot of this to clean my hair but I love this anyway!!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel great!  Easy one step shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> Great since two years</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product! If you are looking for an alternative to the &amp;#34;haircare system&amp;#34; that is seen on TV, this would be a good one to try. While I&#x27;ve not tried the &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; haircare system, purchasing Uniq One from Amazon.com eliminates the commitment to having regular shipments sent to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this product does not make a lather--and I love a shampoo with a good lather--it does have a great, mild scent to it, and feels nice going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in conjunction with the Uniq One styling product listed below. When used together, both eliminate frizz and offer many other great features.</li>
            <li> This has left my hair in the very best condition ever.  Use this and a deep conditioner and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> This is more of a heavy balm conditioner than a shampoo.  If you use just a small amount as a conditioner it is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> was wondering how i would feel about the shampoo have used the condtioner before....i must say the shampoo is very rich and i like it will buy this product again.......</li>
            <li> This is great  product to wash your hair with in between shampoos.  Keeps your hair manageable.  Washes out the products without suds.</li>
            <li> Great product and ultra fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> this is very good shampoo with no sulfates.  My wife is very happy that I purchased it for her and the price is great</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a couple of years and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I find the scent too strong, its like wearing perfume in your hair. my hairdresser suggested this to me so I bought it. I am into natural things. also found this too thick to squeeze from tube. had to transfer this to a tubberware container and dilute this with warm water. .</li>
            <li> Great product!!! Have telling all my friends about this amazing product. I will not go back to using sudsy in my hair! Thank you☺</li>
            <li> It is quick to apply a small amount, comb through and then I can let my hair dry on it&#x27;s own.  This products adds a little volume and leaves it feeling soft and natural.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel amazing! So thick I&#x27;m barely able to squeeze it out of the tube, need 5x amount I normally use to shampoo, smells horrible in the shower (like chemical treatments!!), and leaves a heavy perfume after rinsed and dried. But my hair looks and feels fantastic!</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like because I am not used to wash my hair with any foamless product. The foam kinda give me the feeling of getting my hair clean, but once you get over the fact it won&#x27;t make any foam you start to appreciate the results. It also smell delicious! I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Lately my hair has had a lot of issues. My stylist suggested I try Uniq one leave in conditioner which I really like. When I found the All in One shampoo I thought I would try it. I used it for 3 weeks before I saw my stylist. I wanted to see if she could tell I was using something new. At the end of my appointment she commented that my hair was much happier than it had been and asked what I had been doing different. I told her I was using the all in one shampoo. She was really impressed and told me to order some more. The tube is much larger than I was expecting. My hair is between chin and shoulder length and I shampoo 5-7 times a week. A tube lasts me just over 2 months. It doesn&#x27;t lather a lot like other shampoos which I am fine with. It also doesn&#x27;t over clean your hair either.</li>
            <li> I Keep one at all time with my hair dresser. She recommended the shampoo. It keeps my hair soft, shiny and do not need to use a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  tried other all in one shampoo didn&#x27;t like. I am absolutely addicted to this shampoo. My hair is shiner than ever and so soft but still holds my style. I highly recommend it. I use the leave in spray along with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading all of the reviews.  I didn&#x27;t like the scent at all but tried it thinking I could get used to it (it&#x27;s STRONG and not in a good way - when I was in my twenties back in the 80&#x27;s I started liking the 30&#x27;s era and found an old jar of hair cream called &amp;#34;Vida&amp;#34; in an old drugstore and decided it would be cool to try it - NOT.  Smelled like chemicals - just like this stuff.  Actually I think I know what this smells like - BRUT cologne for men - which I never liked, but sometimes we do strange things in the name of hair love).  Here&#x27;s the weird thing - the first time I used Uniq I LOVED the way it made my hair feel - amazing!  While rinsing it off, every hair strand felt like it had been moisturized and was bouncy and light feeling.  Still didn&#x27;t like the smell, which NEVER seems to go away, but thought I could get used to it.  I used it two days later, then two days after that - then a very weird thing happened.  My hair on top of my head feels like greasy dirty stuck-together hair - it&#x27;s the weirdest thing ever.  Like I haven&#x27;t washed my hair in two years.  Seriously.  This is so strange.  This is after using 3 times in one week.  I will NEVER use this product again.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Uniq One hair treatment spray since my stylist introduced me to it last winter.  What a nice surprise to discover that Uniq One also has an All-in-One Shampoo &amp; Balm!  This shampoo is low-sudsing, but don&#x27;t let that fool you into thinking you hair won&#x27;t be clean.  After one use of this shampoo and blow drying without styling (curling iron, etc.), my hair was shinier and had bounce that I had never had before with just shampooing and blow drying.  I can shampoo and blow dry my shoulder length hair, and it looks like I&#x27;ve had it blown out and styled at the salon.  Very impressive!</li>
            <li> I just love this product and what a buy at the current Amazon price of $7.80.  It will leave your hair feeling soft and if you are prone to knotting you will be especially pleased.</li>
            <li> I am a long time Wen user and was very excited about this product when my hairdresser introduced me to it. I love the fact that it really makes my hair feel thicker, which Wen can&#x27;t seem to manage to do, and would have given it 5 stars except for one major flaw. My hair color is red, not naturally, and this product doesn&#x27;t protect my hair color like the Wen does. I wanted to give this product a fair shot so started using it right after I left my hair appointment until the very next hair appointment, four weeks later. My hair color was dull with just four weeks of use. Wish I could use this instead of the Wen because I really do like that it gives me that thickness (I have really thin fine hair), but the Wen protects my color to the point that, with the exception of my roots, my hair color is still vibrant when I return for each hair appointment.</li>
            <li> Great for thick bushy hair&lt;br /&gt;Now I can let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> nothing special about it, it is just a little more on the creany side, like more conditioner than it is shampoo so it doesn&#x27;t lather much, but i read somewhere that this is better for the hair as it doesn&#x27;t strip it of its natural oils... but wasn&#x27;t wowwed from the product</li>
            <li> My hair tends to get a tad bushy and this keeps it in line. I&#x27;m extremely happy with this conditioner &amp; shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love this product it&#x27;s outstanding. product is easy to use. My hair is no longer dried out and frizzy. Tried Wen, this is a so much better product. Has no phosphates.  Cost is very reasonable. I will keep using it as long as I can get it.</li>
            <li> Great price. Happy with purchase. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Conratulations, excellent supplier again for a good business with him, poi everything reported was correct and this is very good</li>
            <li> I have thick, course hair. This makes it softer, more manageable, and has more shine.  I like the smell, and I don&#x27;t think the smell stays.</li>
            <li> little too strong smelling</li>
            <li> Good moisturizing balm.  I love to use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair because it eliminates tangles.  Don&#x27;t want to use too much if your hair is oily, but I have oily hair and find that this balm still leaves it with plenty of volume.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo ever made, it does everything</li>
            <li> Leave your hair so soft without using condictioner.</li>
            <li> I love this and highly recommend</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this;  it doesn&#x27;t really clean your hair - it never foams or anything, so it&#x27;s hard to tell if it&#x27;s cleaning anything, and you have to use a LOT to feel like it actually is touching all of your hair (I have long, fine hair).  It just doesn&#x27;t spread well.  It helps with detangling, but the spray is way better.  It smells a little metallic as well.  Would not buy again.  Definitely get the spray!  That stuff is like a miracle.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, with deposit color. I have a fairly large amount of grays, but my texture overall is straight, with a slight wave if I airdry. I don&#x27;t have a huge amount of damage, but a bit of dryness due to color:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what makes a co-shampoo, or whether this is officially a shampoo. I just know it works like Wen, but cleans my hair a little better and makes it ROCK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a sample in the mail and wasn&#x27;t sure it was a good idea to wash my hair with this right away. I had a bit of styling product in my hair and it was due for a good shampooing. (these are the days I&#x27;d grab my clarifying shampoo for a real deep cleansing) but I thought, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t suds up at all. Now the American way of thinking is that bubbles clean stuff, which isn&#x27;t necessarily true. while soap does bubble, there are a lot of cleaning agents that do not bubble up to work (think about facial cleanser. Most of the gentlest ones don&#x27;t suds up at all, yet they cut through all the makeup and oil with no problems) So with that in mind, I squeezed out a dollop and added it to my thoroughly wet hair and rubbed it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was first taken by the scent. It smells awesome. I am sensitive to stronger hair scents (Like Aveda) but this didn&#x27;t seem to bug me at all and actually I liked it a lot. The experience was like putting a thick lotion in my hair and rubbing it in. In the way of co shampoo, I rubbed it in for about 1-2 minutes giving it a shot of water to disburse it through my hair (my hair is short, I know this was likely unnecessary) and then rinsing thoroughly. It rinsed out amazingly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a little sit with hair wrapped in a towel, I ran a comb through it and it was pretty easy. It seemed to dry fairly quickly, which for me is a huge plus! It means there&#x27;s not a lot of residue in my hair. I blew it out, and was amazed at how much volume, body and shine I had. And so silky! It was great! I didn&#x27;t have to add any shine enhancers orhit it with the flat iron as I sometimes have to do. I also dried it without the heat protection spray, which saved me time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had just colored my hair the week before, and probably leaving the color in a bit too long, had a huge amount of hairfall immediately after. And on subsequent shampoos. With this stuff, the hairfall was nil. That alone makes me love it right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real test was how long it would be until I needed to shampoo again. I don&#x27;t shampoo every day, usually every third day. This lasted at least as long as my old shampoo, maybe a bit more! It was still clean and relatively bouncy on day three, so I used my second sample and the effect was the same. My husband loves the scent, and can&#x27;t stop touching it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this is a must try alternative to Wen. I&#x27;ve replaced at least three products that I normally use with this stuff, and my hair is kind of a big deal now!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and shiny. I love this product!</li>
            <li> I have thick curly long hair and it was tangled, frizzy and dry until I used this shampoo.  Now my hair has silky curls with no frizz and is easy to comb while wet.  Even better.....I use the uniq one leave in spray treatment and the curls are shiny and soft. Also my scalp use to be kind of dry and flaky with other shampoos containing sulfides...now it has no flakes. Smell is like a beautiful perfume and the price is right.  I paid $17.99 at Ulta, this price is much better.</li>
            <li> Leaves a film on my hair that&#x27;s sooo hard to remove. Don&#x27;t like the product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Love the way it smells and makes my hair feel. Very surprised that could get my hair clean and condition it at the same time.</li>
            <li> I used twice and it was easy and scentful and my hair easily combed through and I feel no residue or heavy conditioner feeling.  Get this.</li>
            <li> I had heard that this shampoo was fantastic so I had to have it. Not sure what all the hoopla was about. Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> Was really hoping to love this shampoo. The smell is amazing but I&#x27;ve given it a month of use now and I have to say it&#x27;s not for me. I have medium length thick hair and it just makes my hair feel too oily and heavy and found I had to was my hair more often to make it feel somewhat clean vs. A regular clarifying shampoo. I tried using different amounts to see if that was the issue but it always left my hair feeling the same. Might be better for people with frizzy or thin hair.</li>
            <li> Really good product...leaves my hair soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> This shampoo did not lather. After washing, my hair did not feel clean. After my hair dried, it felt greasy. I tried it twice. I even tried mixing it with another shampoo that lathers well. I love the Uniq One Leave-in conditioner, but I will not be buying the shampoo again.</li>
            <li> I only use this product and order in quantities.  Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> The best stuff ever!! Get it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great shampoo, comparable to the much more expensive Wen.  It rinses clean out of my hair and hasn&#x27;t left it feeling greasy or weighted down.  Great product; I will reorder.</li>
            <li> OMG!!! I ordered this shampoo twice by mistake, but I thought I wouldn&#x27;t have an issue since I LOVE their leave-in. But let me tell you this is the worst product I have ever used: 1.I lost so much hair while using it and I couldn&#x27;t figure that this was it. 2.I agree it leaves your hair very smooth but what is the point since it doesn&#x27;t even feel like you wash it? 3. It is big because you need put 4x of what you normally use of shampoo since you won&#x27;t use condition.</li>
            <li> great product exactly as ordered thank you</li>
            <li> Outstanding shampoo; I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly a year. I remember that it took a couple of times to get over the feeling that my hair had to be all sudsy to get clean. Uniq One will foam just a little if you use a lot, but you don&#x27;t need to use that much to get a clean head. I work it into my scalp, pull it through the length of my hair and let it work while I shower. A rinse, and I have soft, tangle-free, clean hair. Smells great too. My hair is quite curly, and I color regularly. Uniq One makes my color last better than anything I&#x27;ve tried. I use the All-in-One Hair Treatment if I&#x27;m going to blow-dry and iron. I have found that my scalp is actually less oily using Uniq One every other day than it was using regular shampoo daily. Don&#x27;t know if I use too much, but a tube lasts about two months for me.</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo. Similar with Wen but less expensive. Leaves your hair so soft and smells beautiful.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, its more like shampoo perfume.</li>
            <li> This is the best for my hair.  I have dyed hair and it was frizzy.  It isn&#x27;t  any longer!  I have spent tons of money trying products and this is the best.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but cannot use daily.</li>
            <li> Works very well on smoothing hair and keeping frizz at bay.  Happy with that, however, hair and scalp don&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; really clean when used .&lt;br /&gt;I like the results enough that will continue to use, and every 3rd wash use something else.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.. My hair stays shiny and so soft for days.. Ive tried many products, but none like this one - doesnt weight my hair down or anything n smells GREAT!!</li>
