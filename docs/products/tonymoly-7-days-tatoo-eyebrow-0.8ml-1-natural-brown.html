    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The color is WAY off...my eyebrows looked orange!  I really didn&#x27;t think it was worth the money.  For the record, it did stay on my brows through a couple of washings (I don&#x27;t think it stayed on for 7 days, though).</li>
            <li> I like this product very well.  It is easy to put on and stays, maybe not quite seven days but is better than a regular pencil</li>
            <li> there was no ink in the Korean Cosmetic Tonymoly 7days Long Last Liquid Easy Self Eyebrow Pen, it was just a waste of money</li>
            <li> it was alright.  a little too dark.  wish they made lighter browns.  then I would buy it again.  but like I said, it was okay.</li>
            <li> After my initial review and using for a few days I&#x27;d like to update.  this product is fabulous. It looks natural, does not appear artificial or penciled in no matter how nicely airbrushed you can tell it. Just keep those stray brow hairs tame for a groomed appearance and this does the rest. Waking up to natural, contoured,  darkened brows is great. I don&#x27;t have to do them, use a brow brush as a part of my routine, maybe,  and that is not really required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be stocking up.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply. Great colors... I bought both the light and the dark.  Definitely last all day but does not last for seven days.</li>
            <li> Had to return it because the item was completely dried out and unusable.  Would love to try it...if it worked.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting item. It didn&#x27;t have any English instructions so it was a trial and error product. It works fair the color doesn&#x27;t flow continually. With my oily skin it only stays on for one day. I still have to fill in with another pencil.</li>
            <li> After using this on bare skin repeatedly almost no color showed up. I ordered the natural brown and it is all but invisible, though I could feel the moisture from the product. There are eyeliner markers out there for half the price that actually work. I suggest you avoid this product all together.</li>
            <li> I gave this eyebrow pen only three stars only because the color&lt;br /&gt;is too light. A darker shade would have been best for my sparse eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it and the next day the skin under my brows looked orange.&lt;br /&gt;I will use another darker pencil to cover the orange tint, and if I order them in the future&lt;br /&gt;I will order a darker brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will still recommend it to my friends who are having the same problems with their&lt;br /&gt;sparse brows like me. The color stays on for a few days even if you wash your face.&lt;br /&gt;For that I will give them five stars!</li>
            <li> Even in first application the pen had no ink in it to last even for one minute!  I even have shaken it several times before usage but nothing came out of it. totally useless!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected it to be.  Was very dry when trying to apply and color was tooo light for dark brown.</li>
            <li> I ordered the natural brown color and it was a gold color., not brown at all.  The natural brown color would work for someone with blond hair.  My hair is brown, so it did not work for me.  The color did stay on for 3 days so, I re-ordered the dark brown color to try it out.  .</li>
            <li> just as it says. Doesn&#x27;t just smudge or come off. My problem is that the brown is a muddy red color - a bit of a garish red. Nice for redheads or strawberry blondes perhaps.</li>
            <li> Great product and the price is excellent.  I have curly hair and tends to get frizzy, with this product my hair looks and feels great.  I continue to buy this product, in fact I had ben buying this product for the past 3 years.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The eyebrow pen was perfect,the color just right,goes on smooth.It&#x60;s just i did not know that it would take so long to ship .I think that it shipped from Korea.</li>
            <li> I first purchased the lighter brown, which dried a reddish color.  The most recent purchase was the dark brown.  Perfect!  True color, and not too dark..  The little brush works well and overall, is easy to apply, and easy to correct with a damp q-tip if you make a mistake.  It doesn&#x27;t however last seven days, but it will stay in place all day, and into the next day if not scrubbed off.  I have very sparse brows, so I opt to shave the few that I have, and am happy to find a product that I can count on to stay put.  I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this product a big ZERO!  I&#x27;ve purchased many different brow-pens right here on Amazon and although I have my favorites, all of them, even the poorer wearing ones were wearable to some degree, so none were a complete waste of money.  This is by far the worst cosmetic product I have ever purchased, ever!  It&#x27;s not close to being \\&quot;natural\\&quot; brown, it is ORANGE.  Bright orange at that, like clown orange.  I even left it on for a few minutes to see if would darken up and it did but to a brighter orange.  It wiped off easily with water, thank goodness, so I doubt it wears much better, although I can&#x27;t imagine anyone wanting to wear this color.  I did try the dark brown color also and the color is dark brown, a very dark brown, but it didn&#x27;t wear well at all.  It was smearing and wearing off within a few hours.  I would recommend trying any other eyebrow pen with the exception of this one.  Anastasia Brow-Pen is the best I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ll be sticking with that brow-pen for now on. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> I have used the product through 2 weaks. It met my expectations of the long lasting  time and color was perfect</li>
            <li> not worth it people seriously. A marker probably would work better.  if you are buying I suggest you buy the dark brown.</li>
            <li> good color, doesn&#x27;t smudge like pencils do. it only lasts about 2 days for me. not 7. i have oily skin</li>
            <li> Just as described it lasts for days, although it does start to fade toward the 5th day, but then you just reapply again. The thin brush releases the right amount of ink and it allows you to be precise without the ink running. At first the natural brown seemed orange on my skin and it rubbed off, but then I applied a thicker layer on clean, dry skin with no makeup or lotion and washed it off at the end of the day and it had created a nice brown tint on my skin. I will reorder again, but I will order the dark brown to see if maybe the darker tint will last longer than the natural brown.</li>
            <li> I liked it, and I was very pleased, it stay for couple of days I only had to retouch a bit.</li>
            <li> Fine tip brush. The color was too light for me but it does stay for a few days if you don&#x27;t scrub it off. The company offered to send me the darker product at no cost. Excellent customer service. Waiting for the product to arrive from Korea.</li>
            <li> I bought the light brown and dark brown pen.  The light brown is way too light and you can hardly see it.  But I have brown hair and it will probably would work on blonds.  The dark brown pen is perfect and I also mix up the brush strokes with the light brown pen.&lt;br /&gt;The definition of the marker is exact and fine.  You can actually make fine hair strokes on your eyebrows so that it looks like real hair and not colored in eyebrows.  The best I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;They claim that the ink will last for 7 days.  It does not.  But it does stay on all day.  I can work out and I still have my eyebrows intact.  When I wash my face, the liner does come off.  Maybe I need to put it on with no cream on my face.  Just direct on a clean skin surface.&lt;br /&gt;I have been searching for years for the right eyebrow pen, and so far this is the best and most natural I have come across.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t compared ingredients, but the packaging for this eyebrow pen is exactly the same as the Stila Stay All Day Waterproof Brow Color, which costs twice as much as I paid for this pen with shipping.  Color 01 - Natural Brown is extremely light, but I can build it up just barely enough to work with my computer-pale skin and medium brown hair.  Just like the Stila pen, this Tonymoly pen lasts all day under normal oily/sweaty conditions with some thoughtful brow stroking, but wipes away with a damp washcloth...doesn&#x27;t last anywhere near the 7 day claim.</li>
            <li> uum this left me speechless</li>
