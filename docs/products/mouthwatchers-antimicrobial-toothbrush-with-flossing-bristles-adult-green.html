            <li>The bristles are amazing.  </li>
            <li>5 plus STARS to the best feeling soft toothbrush that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Better to use non-toxic products that do not shed toxic cells into our water systems.</li>
            <li>And after I&#x27;ve done some research about what&#x27;s nano silver, I like this product even more because it&#x27;s \\&quot;self cleaning\\&quot;.   </li>
            <li>:)    </li>
            <li>It looked interesting, reduces bacteria..</li>
            <li>Great feel to the handle and brushes very well.  </li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s gone, your gum feels better.</li>
            <li>I just got a cleaning at the dentist every time I use it :)</li>
            <li>I understand it is for better grip, but it&#x27;s overkill.</li>
            <li>They taper to a fine point, so you can get in between the teeth easily.</li>
            <li>I have arthritis in my hands and it&#x27;s important to have a toothbrush that is easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a fine toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>the soft bristles are perfect for my sensitive gums</li>
            <li>Got this one as a free sample and used for over a month now.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it is doing a fantastic job invisibly.</li>
            <li>My teeth are so clean and smooth after using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and I can feel a difference in how clean my teeth and mouth feel already.</li>
            <li>my teeth feel really clean after I&#x27;m done brushing.</li>
            <li>-I guess that&#x27;s the silver at work there too, keeping the toothbrush clean.</li>
            <li>The feathery flossing bristles clean every inch of my orthodontic brackets and archwires and my mouth feels cleaner than when I was still using my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>When I brush I can feel them reaching into the spaces of my teeth and gums and they feel clean.</li>
            <li>The quality of the clean is why I will keep buying them.</li>
            <li>toothbrush is actually good enough to tell people about!</li>
            <li>It just turns in certain ways as I move my hand, but it always feels comfortable and is easy to hold.</li>
            <li>I really like the gentle, yet effective brushhead on this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I have only used it for a couple of weeks, but am hoping that the results are what the company professes about this kind of brush.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite toothbrush.</li>
            <li>If the science proves that out, then I would make this 5 stars.</li>
            <li>My first try of this brush was a quick once over without toothpaste because i had to run out the door</li>
            <li>When I go to the dental office for a cleaning the hygienist tells me I must be doing something right.</li>
            <li>As for less tartar, the toothbrush does a good job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>The bristles are so tiny that they fit between my teeth and make my mouth feel so clean.  </li>
            <li>just be sure to brush elliptically or circles, not back and forth which will induce receding gum line.    </li>
            <li>Will be handing these out at Easter next to all the Chocolate bunnies :)</li>
            <li>And the toothbrush never has a funny taste or smell to it</li>
            <li>When you start using this, your gum may bleed first week.</li>
            <li>My favorite alternate toothbrush.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, I have bought some for friends and family :) I am totally hooked up.</li>
            <li>Wow this is my new favorite tooth brush.</li>
            <li>First bought at Whole Foods, then they were out of stock so came here.  </li>
            <li>Great product that gets my teeth whiter than any other toothbrush I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li>The only caveat is that there is a huge price discrepancy in the market, so caveat emptor.</li>
            <li>The thing is HUGE, especially when compared to the head.</li>
            <li>It flosses underneath my gum line, pushes my gum line up gently, gets between my teeth, went 3 shades lighter (I&#x27;m a coffee drinker), remove plaques</li>
            <li>so you dont need to put that much effort.</li>
            <li>it really go into the gum area a lot easier to get those plague out.  </li>
            <li>I usually use a mechanical toothbrush, but I love this one for quick cleanings.</li>
            <li>For the first couple of days, my teeth was sensitive</li>
            <li>I needed a new toothbrush and was shopping in Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I would highly recommend ( and have) the Mouth Watcher toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I guess I had high hopes that I could see a difference which I did not.</li>
            <li>and I was amazed that a soft bristled brush would actually make my teeth that clean.</li>
            <li>I really like the soft tip of the brush</li>
            <li>I bought my first one at Whole Foods store, but they only had one color.</li>
            <li>I just received my new toothbrush a couple of days ago</li>
            <li>And I think it&#x27;s very reasonably priced, considering the prices of toothbrushes in the store with similar ergonomic designs but no silver in the bristles.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for the past four days since I received it, but so far it&#x27;s my favorite toothbrush, ever!  </li>
            <li>I love the tiny little bristles which  keep my teeth clear of plaque.</li>
            <li>The head, tho soft, does not feel soft.  </li>
            <li>My preference had always been for medium bristles because I never felt the soft ones were getting the job done.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Also, when I travel to my parents and friends house, I will never mix up my tooth brush with other people because Mouthwasher tooth brush has it&#x27;s distinct off-</li>
            <li>However, my wife thought it was rougher than her regular design soft toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I am a customer for life, and with 5 children it&#x27;s no small thing to order brushes for the whole family.&lt;br /&gt;The antibacterial silver infused bristles (neutralizing bacteria in a few hours)</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the handle is too think to fit in my built in toothbrush holder.</li>
            <li>My gums are much healthier, and I have less tartar.</li>

            <li> They feel like there&#x27;s a little abrasion there-</li>

            <li> Nano-silver is toxic.  Silver in its regular form is not.  But substances that kill germs are killing cells.  The silver particles that do not go into your system are washing into lakes, rivers, and streams.  Even whales are showing up with nano-silver in their tissue.  Better to use non-toxic products that do not shed toxic cells into our water systems.</li>
            <li> OMG! This toothbrush is a-mazing! It flosses underneath my gum line, pushes my gum line up gently, gets between my teeth, went 3 shades lighter (I&#x27;m a coffee drinker), remove plaques (yes, my hygienist said she didn&#x27;t see any plaque. if I already wasn&#x27;t lying down on the chair, I&#x27;d fall out of it), don&#x27;t have fuzzy film anytime of day or night. I don&#x27;t even think you need toothpaste, but i use less and less of it since there is so much fluoride already in the water we drink, mouthwash and toothpaste. Anyways, Im a believer and sold it to my hubby, too. His breath is so much more kissable! Yum!     For the first couple of days, my teeth was sensitive b/c the toothbrush worked so good. Used extra fluoride mouthwash to remove the sensitivity. after a few days, everything is normal.    Also, do not push to hard. you dont need to, there is traction, you&#x27;ll feel it working so you dont need to put that much effort. just be sure to brush elliptically or circles, not back and forth which will induce receding gum line.    Learned about this on the [...], but bought it at WF. Will be handing these out at Easter next to all the Chocolate bunnies :)</li>
            <li> Got this one as a free sample and used for over a month now.  I really like the soft tip of the brush it really go into the gum area a lot easier to get those plague out.  And after I&#x27;ve done some research about what&#x27;s nano silver, I like this product even more because it&#x27;s \\&quot;self cleaning\\&quot;.   Also, when I travel to my parents and friends house, I will never mix up my tooth brush with other people because Mouthwasher tooth brush has it&#x27;s distinct off-while color! :)    I am curious to find out what&#x27;s the long term effect of this new tooth brush on my teeth, so will give a follow up review in a few months.</li>
            <li> I just received my new toothbrush a couple of days ago and I can feel a difference in how clean my teeth and mouth feel already.</li>
            <li> My dentist has seen a difference in my mouth since I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush. My gums are much healthier, and I have less tartar. I assume my gums are healthier because the silver in the bristles kills germs. As for less tartar, the toothbrush does a good job of cleaning my teeth. The shape of the handle fits in my hand in a way that as I brush, the toothbrush maintains that 45 degree angle so dear to dentist&#x27;s hearts. It just turns in certain ways as I move my hand, but it always feels comfortable and is easy to hold. I have arthritis in my hands and it&#x27;s important to have a toothbrush that is easy to hold. The bristles are soft, so they don&#x27;t damage the teeth, but they also don&#x27;t feel slick. They feel like there&#x27;s a little abrasion there-my teeth feel really clean after I&#x27;m done brushing. And the toothbrush never has a funny taste or smell to it-I guess that&#x27;s the silver at work there too, keeping the toothbrush clean. It lasts for three months and then the bristles start to break down. You&#x27;re supposed to replace your toothbrush regularly anyway, so that&#x27;s not a hardship. And I think it&#x27;s very reasonably priced, considering the prices of toothbrushes in the store with similar ergonomic designs but no silver in the bristles.</li>
            <li> I have been using a sonic toothbrush and wanted to try this one since it has the silver...wow.my teeth feel smoother with this toothbrush that with the electric one.</li>
            <li> I needed a new toothbrush and was shopping in Whole Foods. It looked interesting, reduces bacteria..etc so I bought it. Wow! Great feel to the handle and brushes very well.  The head, tho soft, does not feel soft.  I&#x27;m going to buy another! Raves!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic toothbrush. The feathery flossing bristles clean every inch of my orthodontic brackets and archwires and my mouth feels cleaner than when I was still using my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a fine toothbrush.  I have only used it for a couple of weeks, but am hoping that the results are what the company professes about this kind of brush.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush ever. First bought at Whole Foods, then they were out of stock so came here.  This has thin bristle that reaches between the gums, and thick bristles that brushes other areas.  When you start using this, your gum may bleed first week. Once it&#x27;s gone, your gum feels better.</li>
            <li> My favorite alternate toothbrush. I usually use a mechanical toothbrush, but I love this one for quick cleanings.</li>
            <li> Wow this is my new favorite tooth brush. I love the tiny little bristles which  keep my teeth clear of plaque.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a toothbrush, so why would anyone write a review about it? I have been brushing my teeth for about 33 years, and in that time I have tried a lot of different brushes. Fancy ones with rubbery bristles and electric spinny ones. My preference had always been for medium bristles because I never felt the soft ones were getting the job done.&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is actually good enough to tell people about! The brisltes are multilayered and tapered. When I brush I can feel them reaching into the spaces of my teeth and gums and they feel clean. My first try of this brush was a quick once over without toothpaste because i had to run out the door and I was amazed that a soft bristled brush would actually make my teeth that clean. I am a customer for life, and with 5 children it&#x27;s no small thing to order brushes for the whole family.&lt;br /&gt;The antibacterial silver infused bristles (neutralizing bacteria in a few hours) was the reason that I bought these. The quality of the clean is why I will keep buying them.</li>
            <li> Great product that gets my teeth whiter than any other toothbrush I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> These work great, not a gimmick.  When I go to the dental office for a cleaning the hygienist tells me I must be doing something right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for the past four days since I received it, but so far it&#x27;s my favorite toothbrush, ever!  The bristles are amazing.  They taper to a fine point, so you can get in between the teeth easily.</li>
            <li> My teeth are so clean and smooth after using this toothbrush. The only downside is it took awhile for my gums to adjust to the less than baby soft bristles.</li>
            <li> I really like the gentle, yet effective brushhead on this toothbrush. However, my wife thought it was rougher than her regular design soft toothbrush. Guess it&#x27;s a case of personal preference. Nonetheless, I would highly recommend ( and have) the Mouth Watcher toothbrush. The only caveat is that there is a huge price discrepancy in the market, so caveat emptor.</li>
            <li> the soft bristles are perfect for my sensitive gums</li>
            <li> I love these!  The bristles are so tiny that they fit between my teeth and make my mouth feel so clean.  I put them in my family&#x27;s stockings for Christmas.  They&#x27;re all adults, so they weren&#x27;t mad.  ;~)</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite toothbrush. I bought my first one at Whole Foods store, but they only had one color. We have 3 people in the house, so I went on Amazon hunt to find other colors of the same toothbrush. So happy I found it here and it is cheaper. Can&#x27;t imagine using any other toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Quick delivery. I would recommend this toothbrush to everybody! As a matter of fact, I have bought some for friends and family :) I am totally hooked up. My mouth never felt that awesome: the bristles are so effective that I have the feeling I just got a cleaning at the dentist every time I use it :)</li>
            <li> Wonderful toothbrush. My teeth shine like never before, even after a cleaning. My only complaint is the handle is too think to fit in my built in toothbrush holder. I figure I can file it down, but this should not be necessary. I understand it is for better grip, but it&#x27;s overkill. The thing is HUGE, especially when compared to the head.</li>
            <li> As others reviewers state, my mouth does feel cleaner after using this, but I do not see any difference in plaque reduction. I like that it is antibacterial resistant which is a good choice. I guess I had high hopes that I could see a difference which I did not. Perhaps it is doing a fantastic job invisibly. If the science proves that out, then I would make this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This The Best toothbrush I have ever had.  I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> 5 plus STARS to the best feeling soft toothbrush that I have ever used. Will buy again from this vendor..</li>
