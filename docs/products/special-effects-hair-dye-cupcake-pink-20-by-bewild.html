    <ol>
            <li>it still looks awesome though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wicked awesome product, this is the brand to buy!!</li>
            <li>she had, and all colors looked so awesome on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is awesome!</li>
            <li>not my cup of tea LOL</li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>and I guess I will say this one was the best, but still, best is relative.</li>
            <li>Best hair dye ever wouldn&#x27;t use anything else if your going for a bold look</li>
            <li>Nice and bright color...</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s happy being a pink-top, and I think she&#x27;s adorable, so I guess that&#x27;s a good review :)</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I bleach my hair first, then apply for the best color.</li>
            <li>They smell really nice.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t cover well either and the results weren&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li>I love Special Effects, great quality</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in my hair as we speak. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I did love the color, but I was aiming for a more hot-pink look.</li>
            <li>and it shows up so much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i did use this over top of bleached hair that was bleached with beyond the zone bleaching kit</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I usually really like special effects, but this color wasn&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more products from special effects i am one satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>It mixes well and makes a fantastic pastel when combined and diluted with conditioner. :-)</li>
            <li>It was the best pink color I&#x27;ve tried until now.</li>
            <li>The color does fade fairly quickly, but I think it looks nice at every stage of fading, and I wasn&#x27;t looking for a huge color commitment anyway.</li>
            <li>I put it on my naturally blonde, un-bleached hair and it looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>It completely covered over my bright orange hair without a problem</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest bleaching your hair first (as light as you can get it) to keep the color true and bright.</li>
            <li>If i ever do another color i will use Special Effects.</li>
            <li>bright hott pink at first, &amp; fades lovely.</li>
            <li>After using this dye I tried atomic pink which I liked much better.</li>
            <li>Not messy, not too bright, shipped really fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really light cotton candy type pink, isn&#x27;t to bright</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very bright and vibrant pink and lasts longer than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>The ones that say they glow in UV light really do</li>
            <li>Nice pastel color that helped even out the pink from another shade of the same product that was a wee-bit too bright.</li>
            <li>Does a good job on bleached hair and lasts longer than expected for this type of product.</li>
            <li>I figured that the problem might have been that it was not used on freshly bleached hair, but when my sister tried this color on her bleached hair (which was bleached to a yellowish color)</li>
            <li>Lasted a verylong time if bleached right, i meen it lasted months in my hair.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, this product is perfect if you&#x27;re looking for a soft, subtle pink, but if you&#x27;re looking for something super bright and permanent, I would go with something else.</li>
            <li>it came out a hot bright pink color!!</li>
            <li>i only wash top of scalp &amp; condition</li>
            <li>This color is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stayed in my hair for more than a month and hasn&#x27;t faded in the slightest even after several washes.</li>
            <li>and I was able to switch from pink to orange and back very easily.</li>
            <li>my hair is pretty light and this color barely showed up.</li>
            <li>pretty well, i left on way longer than it says to, its not a harsh chemical dye so its ok.  </li>
            <li>For staying power and the quality of the color, this is my favorite pink.</li>
            <li>i love mixing the colors (cupcake pink and wildflower), and the color always turns out</li>
            <li>but w a lil hairspray it really stays in until u wash.</li>
            <li>My daughter has had Bright Hot Pink Hair for years now and this product really lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every brand of semi-permanent color, in every shade of pink, and this is both my favorite color and the longest-lasting.</li>
            <li>I used Manic Panic, but it bleached out too fast within two or three weeks.</li>
            <li>and it isn&#x27;t to light for me personally.</li>
            <li>The color lasts for a few months, and it fades to really nice shades.</li>
            <li>i love my pink hair!</li>
            <li>So i mixed it with special effect&#x27;s cherry bomb.</li>
            <li>If you want bright pink hair I would recommend Atomic Pink instead of this.</li>
            <li>And the color stayed vibrant.</li>
            <li>it was a light pink, but in the way that it looked like it just didn&#x27;t take to my hair very well,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about three or four weeks now, and the color is still quite vibrant, but not fluorescent.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY suggest bleaching your hair beforehand</li>
            <li>Cupcake pink was too light for my taste.</li>
            <li>And it really did glow under black light.</li>
            <li>have naturally black hair, bleached it to a yellowy blonde, so it wasn&#x27;t the truest cupcake pink, actually ended up more of a flamingo pink at first, then faded to a very pastel cupcake pink, and it was so beautiful with the Wildflower color from beginning to end, because the Wildflower fades to a lavendar.</li>
            <li>Lasts longer than any other brand I have tried, and the pink fades nicely.</li>
            <li>It starts as a pastel pink (brightest on the natural highlights in my hair and more of a tint on the darker parts), and fades to an almost natural looking strawberry blonde.</li>
            <li>I think this probably only works if you&#x27;ve bleached your hair to an almost white color, but that is very damaging and a lot of other special effects dyes work without having to bleach the hair THAT much.</li>
            <li>I guess ur hair has to be bleached white in order for it to really be noticeable.</li>
            <li>Normally I buy atomic pink for my hubby&#x27;s hair and it stays very well.</li>
            <li>I ended up waiting for it to fade to a very light candy-floss pink and used their Atomic Pink over it, getting what I was actually looking for.</li>
            <li>Usually its easy for me to switch between similar colors at the end of the month, but this color did not cover over my orange hair well</li>
            <li>I bleached my hair to a light, buttery yellow, and then toned it with Manic Panic&#x27;s virgin snow and another professional brand blue toner to get it as white as possible before using SE&#x27;s Cupcake Pink.</li>
            <li>pink came out almost fluorescent, which surprised me, but perhaps only because I couldn&#x27;t find any decent pictures of it in anyone&#x27;s hair online beforehand.</li>
            <li>The color is gentle, lasts longer than other brands and mixes well.</li>
            <li>after a few washes it faded into a light pink color.</li>
            <li>I mean I can&#x27;t complain too much, because no pink dye really lasts very long before fading to a washed-out reddish hue...</li>
            <li>I usually like special effects, but this color seems very weak and doesn&#x27;t cover easily.</li>
            <li>I mixed a little conditioner in it, slathered it on, and put a processing cap to let it really absorb into my hair for a couple hours</li>

            <li> I gave up on dying my blonde hair pink and just dyed my whole head black.</li>
            <li> bottom~ color stays extra long.</li>
            <li> With this one I&#x27;ve been with my hair pink for three months and only had to dye again once recently.</li>
            <li> I usually use this dye every couple of weeks to keep my color vibrant.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t stay in long or show up well if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I got this (cupcake pink) and the blue velvet-which is purple.</li>
            <li> dye doesnt last long in my hair but it keeps a stronger pink than the manic panic did.  </li>
            <li> Most other brands start to fade after a few washes and I usually end up with a washed-out streaky look that I hate, but this stuff stays nice and pink all over for weeks and weeks.</li>
            <li> I put it in my hair and it lasted twice as long as any other brand I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> 18.&lt;br /&gt;i got pastel pink hair chalk</li>
            <li> We like the lighter pink color it fades to so</li>
            <li> So after watching TONS of YouTube tutorials I got this to do a pastel pink in my hair.</li>
            <li> pink-</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of pink dyes</li>
            <li> Definitely should&#x27;ve used this first instead of trying to save a little money with a previous one that made it look like I was poorly attempting to bathroom pink and faded in three days.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that you don&#x27;t get enough in that little bottle--I usually need two bottles to completely saturate my hair.</li>
            <li> which has never been a problem with all kinds of other colors I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It doesnt dry my hair out, and it fades to the prettiest pale pink.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely not worth $</li>
            <li> I think it requires freshly bleached hair because nothing would stay in his hair and now it looks like he has dirty strawberry blond hair.</li>
            <li> and you need to use less for it to work.</li>
            <li> i do the under half of my head &amp; this allows me to follow a reviewer&#x27;s tip of never the washing color with shampoo-</li>
            <li> and it had a little of the manic panic dye in it</li>
            <li> Remember to wear gloves when appling, because it can stain your fingers for a few days.</li>
            <li> I just roll my hair up into the glove i&#x27;m using to dye with and let it sit for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wash my hair in cold water only, though, so that helps to keep it from rinsing out!</li>
            <li> Sick of having to re-dye it pink all the time...</li>
            <li> after my disappointment with manic panic cotton candy, i ordered this.</li>
            <li> Color is outrageous!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> For staying power and the quality of the color, this is my favorite pink. It&#x27;s a very bright and vibrant pink and lasts longer than others I&#x27;ve tried. It doesnt dry my hair out, and it fades to the prettiest pale pink.</li>
            <li> I love it. I put it in my hair and it lasted twice as long as any other brand I&#x27;ve used. And the color stayed vibrant. And it really did glow under black light. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Cupcake pink was too light for my taste. So i mixed it with special effect&#x27;s cherry bomb. it came out a hot bright pink color!! after a few washes it faded into a light pink color. it still looks awesome though. I will be buying more products from special effects i am one satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! i love mixing the colors (cupcake pink and wildflower), and the color always turns out spectacular!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using just 2 bottles of hair dye for about 6 months, and they still haven&#x27;t run out. The color lasts for a few months, and it fades to really nice shades. I HIGHLY suggest bleaching your hair beforehand, it doesn&#x27;t stay in long or show up well if you don&#x27;t. They smell really nice. Remember to wear gloves when appling, because it can stain your fingers for a few days. The ones that say they glow in UV light really do glow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wicked awesome product, this is the brand to buy!!</li>
            <li> Lasts longer than any other brand I have tried, and the pink fades nicely. Nice and bright color...It&#x27;s in my hair as we speak. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I paired this color with Wildflower#24, as well as my friends magenta color she had, and all colors looked so awesome on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally black hair, bleached it to a yellowy blonde, so it wasn&#x27;t the truest cupcake pink, actually ended up more of a flamingo pink at first, then faded to a very pastel cupcake pink, and it was so beautiful with the Wildflower color from beginning to end, because the Wildflower fades to a lavendar.</li>
            <li> Does a good job on bleached hair and lasts longer than expected for this type of product. Nice pastel color that helped even out the pink from another shade of the same product that was a wee-bit too bright.</li>
            <li> Lasted a verylong time if bleached right, i meen it lasted months in my hair. If i ever do another color i will use Special Effects.</li>
            <li> I did love the color, but I was aiming for a more hot-pink look. I ended up waiting for it to fade to a very light candy-floss pink and used their Atomic Pink over it, getting what I was actually looking for.</li>
            <li> I usually like special effects, but this color seems very weak and doesn&#x27;t cover easily. Usually its easy for me to switch between similar colors at the end of the month, but this color did not cover over my orange hair well and I ended up using basically the entire bottle to get it to try to work. I figured that the problem might have been that it was not used on freshly bleached hair, but when my sister tried this color on her bleached hair (which was bleached to a yellowish color) it didn&#x27;t cover well either and the results weren&#x27;t very strong. I think this probably only works if you&#x27;ve bleached your hair to an almost white color, but that is very damaging and a lot of other special effects dyes work without having to bleach the hair THAT much. After using this dye I tried atomic pink which I liked much better. It completely covered over my bright orange hair without a problem and I was able to switch from pink to orange and back very easily. If you want bright pink hair I would recommend Atomic Pink instead of this. Its a stronger color and it lasts longer and you need to use less for it to work.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dye for my 20-year-old artist daughter&#x27;s birthday. She&#x27;s happy being a pink-top, and I think she&#x27;s adorable, so I guess that&#x27;s a good review :)</li>
            <li> my hair is pretty light and this color barely showed up. I guess ur hair has to be bleached white in order for it to really be noticeable. it&#x27;s definitely not worth $18.&lt;br /&gt;i got pastel pink hair chalk and it shows up so much better. yes, it might wash out but w a lil hairspray it really stays in until u wash. i would suggest that instead of this stuff for those who just want lil peek a boo streaks here and there.</li>
            <li> Normally I buy atomic pink for my hubby&#x27;s hair and it stays very well. We like the lighter pink color it fades to so were hoping we could bypass it with this color. I think it requires freshly bleached hair because nothing would stay in his hair and now it looks like he has dirty strawberry blond hair.</li>
            <li> Not messy, not too bright, shipped really fast. Definitely should&#x27;ve used this first instead of trying to save a little money with a previous one that made it look like I was poorly attempting to bathroom pink and faded in three days. Love this product!</li>
            <li> So after watching TONS of YouTube tutorials I got this to do a pastel pink in my hair. It is awesome! The color is gentle, lasts longer than other brands and mixes well. I got this (cupcake pink) and the blue velvet-which is purple. I love Special Effects, great quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest bleaching your hair first (as light as you can get it) to keep the color true and bright. If your hair is not white and still has some yellow tones this color comes out like a salmon pink- not my cup of tea LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding a TINY bit of purple makes this the cutest color for low-lites. It mixes well and makes a fantastic pastel when combined and diluted with conditioner. :-) LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> I purchased this dye after I used manic panic and didnt like it.&lt;br /&gt;This color is SOOO Pretty!&lt;br /&gt;i did use this over top of bleached hair that was bleached with beyond the zone bleaching kit and it had a little of the manic panic dye in it but it was faded from orange to yellow (looked like a gradient i did on purpose) color sticks pretty well, i left on way longer than it says to, its not a harsh chemical dye so its ok.  I just roll my hair up into the glove i&#x27;m using to dye with and let it sit for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this dye doesnt last long in my hair but it keeps a stronger pink than the manic panic did.  I usually use this dye every couple of weeks to keep my color vibrant.</li>
            <li> after my disappointment with manic panic cotton candy, i ordered this. i do the under half of my head &amp; this allows me to follow a reviewer&#x27;s tip of never the washing color with shampoo- i only wash top of scalp &amp; condition bottom~ color stays extra long. i touch up roots &amp; pull some color through length, but some color has lasted through months! bright hott pink at first, &amp; fades lovely. i love my pink hair!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  My daughter has had Bright Hot Pink Hair for years now and this product really lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every brand of semi-permanent color, in every shade of pink, and this is both my favorite color and the longest-lasting. I bleach my hair first, then apply for the best color. Most other brands start to fade after a few washes and I usually end up with a washed-out streaky look that I hate, but this stuff stays nice and pink all over for weeks and weeks. My only complaint is that you don&#x27;t get enough in that little bottle--I usually need two bottles to completely saturate my hair. Buy two if you have medium-to-thick hair!</li>
            <li> I usually really like special effects, but this color wasn&#x27;t very good. it was a light pink, but in the way that it looked like it just didn&#x27;t take to my hair very well, which has never been a problem with all kinds of other colors I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I mean I can&#x27;t complain too much, because no pink dye really lasts very long before fading to a washed-out reddish hue... and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of pink dyes and I guess I will say this one was the best, but still, best is relative. I gave up on dying my blonde hair pink and just dyed my whole head black. Sick of having to re-dye it pink all the time...</li>
            <li> It was the best pink color I&#x27;ve tried until now. I used Manic Panic, but it bleached out too fast within two or three weeks. With this one I&#x27;ve been with my hair pink for three months and only had to dye again once recently.</li>
            <li> This color is exactly what I was looking for. I put it on my naturally blonde, un-bleached hair and it looks beautiful. It starts as a pastel pink (brightest on the natural highlights in my hair and more of a tint on the darker parts), and fades to an almost natural looking strawberry blonde. The color does fade fairly quickly, but I think it looks nice at every stage of fading, and I wasn&#x27;t looking for a huge color commitment anyway. Bottom line, this product is perfect if you&#x27;re looking for a soft, subtle pink, but if you&#x27;re looking for something super bright and permanent, I would go with something else.</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair to a light, buttery yellow, and then toned it with Manic Panic&#x27;s virgin snow and another professional brand blue toner to get it as white as possible before using SE&#x27;s Cupcake Pink. I mixed a little conditioner in it, slathered it on, and put a processing cap to let it really absorb into my hair for a couple hours (remember that only works if you have a cap or something to keep it from drying on your hair).&lt;br /&gt;This pink came out almost fluorescent, which surprised me, but perhaps only because I couldn&#x27;t find any decent pictures of it in anyone&#x27;s hair online beforehand. It&#x27;s been about three or four weeks now, and the color is still quite vibrant, but not fluorescent. I wash my hair in cold water only, though, so that helps to keep it from rinsing out!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really light cotton candy type pink, isn&#x27;t to bright and it isn&#x27;t to light for me personally. It&#x27;s stayed in my hair for more than a month and hasn&#x27;t faded in the slightest even after several washes. The only thing i don&#x27;t like about this dye is the consistency of the dye.</li>
            <li> Best hair dye ever wouldn&#x27;t use anything else if your going for a bold look</li>
            <li> Exactly as described! Color is outrageous! Love it.</li>
