            <li>the iron smoothed my hair very quickly and I love the results.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has the most gorgeous ringlets but of course she hates it and wants to straighten them.</li>
            <li>This allows me not to burn my fine hair.</li>
            <li>It heats up quick and glides through my hair!</li>
            <li>Comes out completely smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>iron smooth -</li>
            <li>This is a great flat iron!</li>
            <li>and I have used a Chi for the past 10 years and thought they were the best thing ever.  </li>
            <li>Completely worth it!</li>
            <li>your hair gets crisp with lots of fly aways (even after trying different products)</li>
            <li>I had been using a cheap Remington iron, but after one of use of this I chucked that right in the garbage.</li>
            <li>I have super curly frizzy hair</li>
            <li>I have had other brands and this one is by far the best one out.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot and glides right through her hair.</li>
            <li>This is a powerful iron.  </li>
            <li>I had a Conair straightener before and had to go over and over my hair trying to get it right</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve bought six of this irons, because i sell them here in my country venezuela, these irons are like the boom now here, every single barber wants one, the product looks as good as it looks in the picz.</li>
            <li>It straightens my hair quickly and I don&#x27;t have to keep going over sections of my hair to get them straight.</li>
            <li>Had to carry the hot iron around in Vegas until it cooled.</li>
            <li>The iron gets hot but just avoid holding it where the plates are and you will not have a problem.</li>
            <li>in the time of delivery very satisfactory.</li>
            <li>and my hair even stays straight on humigd days.  </li>
            <li>It straightens super fast and doesn&#x27;t snag my coarse curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Worked   quickly so didn&#x27;t have to keep going over same section.  </li>
            <li>This Babyliss iron does not catch, makes hair soft, shiny and straight, and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>So far it seems to work really well.</li>
            <li>I received a reply within a few days and was able to exchange the product with no problem.  </li>
            <li>i needed this flat iron because i needed a flat iron that got super hot</li>
            <li>Even though the titanium seems to help it glide right through I still recommend using a flat iron spray to protect your hair from the heat.</li>
            <li>most importantly it&#x27;s not big and poofy like with other straighteners.  </li>
            <li>and with the Babybliss, I usually only have to over it once as long as I don&#x27;t try to get a huge bunch.  </li>
            <li>my bottom line, the Chi was 100x better for regular use with less damage.  </li>
            <li>I straighten my hair probably six days out of the week and so far my hair has not dried out or frizzed.</li>
            <li>The iron is made very durable and solid.  </li>
            <li>I have problem hair, naturally frizzy and wavy....</li>
            <li>My 13 year old daughter loves it too.  </li>
            <li>It also makes soft ringlets.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good hair iron, but not wonderful.</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but worth the investment.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my TIGI Professional flat iron that went out on me.</li>

            <li> This is our third babyliss.  It is the best flat iron we have found.  This company is fast, dependable, and the best price we have found. We are very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful iron.  I worry about it burning my hair so I try not to use it daily.</li>
            <li> Was very happy with this product.  Lives my hair in better condition rather than drying it out.  Worked   quickly so didn&#x27;t have to keep going over same section.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended this straightner and she has had her&#x27;s over a year.  I straighten my hair probably six days out of the week and so far my hair has not dried out or frizzed. Comes out completely smooth and silky. A little pricey, but worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service provided by the seller. in the time of delivery very satisfactory.</li>

            <li> I have super curly frizzy hair and I have used a Chi for the past 10 years and thought they were the best thing ever.  But I like the Bayliss Pro Nano 110% better.  It leaves my hair silkier and shinny.  I will not go back to Chi. LOve Love it&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</li>
            <li> bought it for my wife and 3 daughters. They all use it, they all think it is a great hair straightener.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron after trying a friends - and after my Chi burnt out less then a year after I bought it.  I am not very happy with it though, after several uses it definately is damaging to your hair.  And - it doesnt flat iron smooth - your hair gets crisp with lots of fly aways (even after trying different products) so....my bottom line, the Chi was 100x better for regular use with less damage.  However, since these irons are not cheap - I will be stuck with this one for a while!</li>
            <li> I had been using a cheap Remington iron, but after one of use of this I chucked that right in the garbage. This Babyliss iron does not catch, makes hair soft, shiny and straight, and is reasonably priced. Win-win-win!</li>

My hair is not too dry and most importantly it&#x27;s not big and poofy like with other straighteners.  Comes with a great warranty too, unlike the Chi.</li>
            <li> I did a ton of research on hair straighteners before choosing this one. This was highly recommended and amazon offered it at an incredible price. My daughter has the most gorgeous ringlets but of course she hates it and wants to straighten them. (We always want the opposite of what God gives us.) So far it seems to work really well. It gets very hot and glides right through her hair. Even though the titanium seems to help it glide right through I still recommend using a flat iron spray to protect your hair from the heat. Hope this helps someone else looking for the perfect flat iron!</li>

            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever had or used in a salon!  I love it. Has different temperature settings and that is great!  The iron is made very durable and solid.  It also has a 4 year warranty.  Can&#x27;t beat that!  I have problem hair, naturally frizzy and wavy....the iron smoothed my hair very quickly and I love the results.  My 13 year old daughter loves it too.  I have always used Chi irons and I won&#x27;t buy another Chi.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve bought six of this irons, because i sell them here in my country venezuela, these irons are like the boom now here, every single barber wants one, the product looks as good as it looks in the picz. totally recomended</li>
            <li> I have this flat iron for 3 years. My daughter kept borrowing it from me. I finally decided to buy another one. I have had other brands and this one is by far the best one out. Great buy! Quality Product.</li>
            <li> it is the best flat iron I have ever used. It heats up quick and glides through my hair! I love using it</li>

            <li> I purchased this flat iron approximately a month ago and accidentally ordered the wrong size.  I sent an e-mail inquiring about exchanging the product for a different size.  I received a reply within a few days and was able to exchange the product with no problem.  I love it!  IT straightens my hair perfecctly and my hair even stays straight on humigd days.  The iron gets hot but just avoid holding it where the plates are and you will not have a problem.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It straightens super fast and doesn&#x27;t snag my coarse curly hair.  It also makes soft ringlets.  Great price....Completely worth it!</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron! I bought this to replace my TIGI Professional flat iron that went out on me. This iron is way better than the TIGI.

I have not had any problems with this iron pulling at my hair. All and all, I am completely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
