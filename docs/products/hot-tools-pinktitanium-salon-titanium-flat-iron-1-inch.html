            <li>I liked it so much I had to get it again!</li>
            <li>I thought hot tools was a popular, salon brand product.  </li>

            <li>I love hot tools straightners!</li>

            <li>The LED light turns on but the heat doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>and it was great but after only 3 momths</li>
            <li>The thing that I love about this iron most is that it has a swivel cord, so I can put it down and pick it up and not worry about the cord, which is so nice!</li>
            <li>It worked wonderfully for me the first 1 1/2 years but after that it started shorting out for unknown reasons.</li>
            <li>Even better it heats up in seconds, also to a hot 450 degrees</li>
            <li>It heated up nicely and made my hair pretty straight.</li>
            <li>Even though it was a good deal at the time I do regret the purchase because of the short life.</li>
            <li>and she ONLY uses Hot Tools products, so you KNOW they are good quality products.</li>
            <li>Also, super fast delivery!</li>
            <li>The long cord is nice quality feature as well.</li>
            <li>and it was no longer hot.  </li>
            <li>Once I was able to turn it off, I saw that it was starting to smoke.</li>
            <li>(Although this review says it&#x27;s written by Steve, it&#x27;s actually written by his wife :) )</li>
            <li>at first.  </li>
            <li>I love hot tools products and this one was no different.</li>
            <li>I knew I wanted to have a Hot Tools product because of the quality and the price.  </li>
            <li>I have used the hot tools before.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>looks exactly like picture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m done with hot tools.  </li>
            <li>but it does exactly what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li>i love my flat iron.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this flat iron!</li>
            <li>It worked decently for the first month of use.</li>
            <li>Just ordered a new flat iron and hope we have a better product.</li>

            <li>My first HT flat iron lasted 5 years and this one lasted 2 years.</li>
            <li>it overheated and melted my hair, and then completely stopped working.</li>
            <li>It did exactly the same thing, only this time after just 1 month.</li>
            <li>It worked really well for the first few times.  </li>
            <li>This is my wife&#x27;s second Hot Tools flat iron..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to flat irons, but this flat iron is comparable to the quality of a CHI flat iron.</li>

            <li> you either make the temp go down or turn it off</li>

            <li> Purchased in July from my hair salon. Was working great until I was straightening my hair and it was no longer hot.  I noticed that the LED light was flickering, so I tried to turn it off, but the on/off switch became stuck. Once I was able to turn it off, I saw that it was starting to smoke. I returned it to my salon after only 3 months of owning it. They happened to have a few more in stock, so I thought perhaps I just received a defective one and I&#x27;d try it again. Big mistake! It did exactly the same thing, only this time after just 1 month. Definitely won&#x27;t be purchasing any Hot Tools brand items again.</li>
            <li> (Although this review says it&#x27;s written by Steve, it&#x27;s actually written by his wife :) ) Just got this for Christmas.  Was very pleased with the results-- at first.  My hair is very thick and curly, and it needs a high temp- above 400 to really help my hair.  It worked really well for the first few times.  Then after a while I noticed I had to run it through my hair a few times for it to do anything.  Thought maybe there was just extra humidity in the air. Then, just this last week.  (So...3 months of usage) It just didn&#x27;t turn on anymore.  That&#x27;s it.  Won&#x27;t work now. I thought I was saving money by buying this, and now I have to buy something else.  Waste o&#x27; money! I think I am going to look into getting a Babyliss. This is the kind my hair stylist used on me.</li>
            <li> I love hot tools products and this one was no different. Works great and is easy to use!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this flat iron! I have it now in the 1 inch and the mini for bangs. BOTH in pink! My friend owns a salon and she ONLY uses Hot Tools products, so you KNOW they are good quality products. The thing that I love about this iron most is that it has a swivel cord, so I can put it down and pick it up and not worry about the cord, which is so nice! And my hair looks fabulous everytime I use it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my hair dresser has been using the same tool for 5+ years. It worked wonderfully for me the first 1 1/2 years but after that it started shorting out for unknown reasons. I loved this straightener and once it started shorting out was disappointed. Even though it was a good deal at the time I do regret the purchase because of the short life.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought this exact flat iron for me for nearly $70 at Trade Secret last year. It worked decently for the first month of use. It heated up nicely and made my hair pretty straight. However, things just went downhill from there. The flat iron broke after 3 months of use. I have never had a flat iron that has broken that quick! Very poor quality. Do not buy!</li>
            <li> Even at it&#x27;s highest temp I would have to run this iron through my hair three to four times so it made fixing my hair take longer, second it needs an on off switch that is placed on the inside of the iron on this iron the controls or on the outside where your hands hold the iron and are digital so every time you squeeze the flat iron you either make the temp go down or turn it off it is very frustrating.</li>
            <li> It is perfect...a great fit for the start of my career.  I knew I wanted to have a Hot Tools product because of the quality and the price.  I was so happy to see for myself that the price was fabulous and the quality superceded that.  I am so happy about this product!</li>
            <li> Purchased it in August 2014, stopped working the end of November.. it overheated and melted my hair, and then completely stopped working.</li>
            <li> love this product! It works really good! I would definetly reccomend this product. I love hot tools straightners! Best ever!</li>
            <li> After purchasing this product, I was very pleased with it and it worked great. However, about 3 weeks after using it, it suddendly just stopped working. The LED light turns on but the heat doesn&#x27;t work. I would not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Pink color is cool. Even better it heats up in seconds, also to a hot 450 degrees so your hair is styled faster with less heat time on your hair. I have been using this brand for 7 plus years. My first HT flat iron lasted 5 years and this one lasted 2 years. I am very hard on my tools, constantly dropping. The long cord is nice quality feature as well. The only things I wish this tool had was a longer heat plate which is why I gave only 4 stars, and dropping durability. Overall this product stands up to any expensive model but for me it has lasted much longer which is why my next iron will be a HT.</li>
            <li> I had it before, but over time it broke. I liked it so much I had to get it again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product 1 month as of today. And when I plugged it in this morning it decided not to work. It was working great otherwise &amp; I&#x27;m so dissappointed that it stopped working.  I thought hot tools was a popular, salon brand product.  I would not recommend this product at all. Go with a cheaper brand that&#x27;s actually going to last.</li>
            <li> I have used the hot tools before. It was the actual item that was shown when purchasing it. I ended up getting a different one but it still works the same. The only problem with the iron is while holding the iron it self red stuff remains on your hands.</li>
            <li> Was a good product while it worked. Bought for my daughter for Christmas and now when you turn it on absolutely nothing. Very disappointing and would not recommend this product. Just ordered a new flat iron and hope we have a better product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this straightener only lasted me one year and then crapped the bed. I contacted the seller and they said there was nothing they can do for me because of the return policy..(Just an FYI to anybody buying it- you have up until 30 days to return it) I guess i should of read the fine print but I have had this straightener before and it lasted me MANY years...this one only ONE year. So..would not recommend anymore at this point.</li>
            <li> I still get some product build up with this straightener. It does the job though, works much better than the Walmart bought straighteners.</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered. Nice.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered. I love these. They reach ideal temperatures fast. looks exactly like picture. Highly recommended. Im a happy customer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that&#x27;s great  but it&#x27;s does the works</li>
            <li> Such a good deal for the price, and it works great! I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to flat irons, but this flat iron is comparable to the quality of a CHI flat iron. Also, super fast delivery!</li>
            <li> While it was good while it lasted ... It didn&#x27;t last very long.  (this is the 2nd hot tools that has died within a 2-3 months of purchasing it.  I&#x27;m done with hot tools.  Like others the LED turns on but the device does not heat up.  Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Great straightener!!!</li>
            <li> It is fine.  No different than other straighteners.  I think  I was expecting something really great.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t even the same straightener as the picture. It&#x27;s too much of a hassle to return and wait for a new one. Just disappointed.</li>
            <li> Shorter than I expected but it does exactly what its supposed to do. Its a great straightener, for all hair types.</li>
            <li> Very happy with sellers fast delivery, and the item was as advertised work great....</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s second Hot Tools flat iron.. The last one lasted years so we replaced it with the Titanium model.. Even better than the ceramic!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really great I love that flat iron because it gives you perfect shiny straight hair</li>
            <li> It is the best flat iron for the money.</li>
