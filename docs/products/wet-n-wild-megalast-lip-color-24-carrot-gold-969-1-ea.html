            <li>great for people of color and everyone else!</li>
            <li>I used it to draw circles on my cheeks, and on my lips, and it looked great!</li>
            <li>Beautiful and a perfect color for me.</li>
            <li>Great product, great price!</li>
            <li>But its a great lipstick, stays on me well and is very bright.</li>
            <li>if you like that bright chalk look this is perfect for you</li>
            <li>cake-ee, then it should be a great lipstick, but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li>its a good spring or summer color</li>
            <li>Great pigment, goes on smooth (according to my wife!), stays on.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for :D</li>
            <li>Nice orangey color.  </li>
            <li>Really what it&#x27;s called a carrot color perfect what I wanted !!</li>
            <li>this color is so bright more for light complexion woman.</li>
            <li>Love this colour.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more</li>
            <li>More of a peachy orange-ish gold lipstick, but I still love it.</li>
            <li>Combined with a nude color and it brights up even more.</li>
            <li>Love this color.</li>
            <li>I love this color--I ordered 3 and will order again.</li>
            <li>I read a review where this was one of the top lipsticks</li>
            <li>i love this lipstick</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>If you love orange lipstick and don&#x27;t mind having it feel</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, and it is very bright and vibrant - exactly as I hoped it would be!</li>
            <li>Its a true orange!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about it at first, but after some searching the web, I found swatches!</li>
            <li>AWESOME I&#x27;M DARK SKIN AND THESE ORANGE LIPSTICK IS THE BUM SPECIALLY WHEN I WALK IN THE CLUB</li>
            <li>It is a nice vibrant orange.</li>
            <li>Well worth it and cheap too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long-lasting, but easy to remove with basic make-up remover (or even just soap and warm water.)</li>
            <li>color is vibrant and even though its a matte lipstick it glides on easily.</li>
            <li>#34;blank space.&amp;#34; It was not until i applied a very large amount on myself that my lips looked fully colored.</li>
            <li>I like this lipstick very much.  </li>
            <li>kinda long lasting also, great buy.</li>
            <li>I got this lipstick because i am really into orange lips for Spring</li>
            <li>Well yesterday i found a whole lot of them</li>
            <li>At this point the orange was too much for me.</li>
            <li>But the main thing i enjoy&lt;br /&gt;is</li>
            <li>I do have a very sensitive face, and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, even though I used it on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>this color looks great mixed or worn as is and im carmel complicated</li>
            <li>i would definately repurchase this lipstick, only thing is that it makes the lips looks dry at first but its not noticible.</li>
            <li>So as I applied this lipstick I noticed that it did not conform to my lips, if I would glide  a second layet over the first layer, it would mess up the bottom layer</li>
            <li>She wants other colours!</li>

            <li> Love this colour. It is a nice vibrant orange. Seems moisturising on my lips. Will be buying more</li>
            <li> Great pigment, goes on smooth (according to my wife!), stays on. Simply loves it! She wants other colours! Definitly sa great product!</li>
            <li> I got this lipstick because i am really into orange lips for Spring and i couldnt find it in my town stores. Well yesterday i found a whole lot of them and i hate that i overpaid. But its a great lipstick, stays on me well and is very bright.</li>
            <li> this color is so bright more for light complexion woman. if you like that bright chalk look this is perfect for you</li>
            <li> I like this lipstick very much.  It stays on and lasts for hours.  But the main thing i enjoy&lt;br /&gt;is the color - 969  24 carrot Gold.  Beautiful and a perfect color for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered the lipstick to take a driver&#x27;s license photo. I didn&#x27;t want anything red, so I opted for this shade. I did, however, get some compliments for my &amp;#34;looks.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this color ANYWHERE. I wasn&#x27;t sure about it at first, but after some searching the web, I found swatches! Its a true orange! Exactly what I was looking for :D</li>
            <li> More of a peachy orange-ish gold lipstick, but I still love it. Combined with a nude color and it brights up even more. My fav summer lipstick buy.</li>
            <li> Love this color. Not available in stores so ordered it online. Like its orange shade, but u need to moisturize your lips prior to applying this lipstick</li>
            <li> AWESOME I&#x27;M DARK SKIN AND THESE ORANGE LIPSTICK IS THE BUM SPECIALLY WHEN I WALK IN THE CLUB I&#x27;M LOOKING JUST LIKE WHAT I EXPECTED ON MY LIPS DIAMONDS ITS THE BEST OF THE BEST.</li>
            <li> I love this color--I ordered 3 and will order again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like. It&#x27;s chalky and not smooth</li>
            <li> I read a review where this was one of the top lipsticks so thought I would try it.  To me it&#x27;s very dry on the lips.  It has no moisture base which is probably why it will last longer.  Ill stick with my Revlon lipstick.</li>

            <li> Really what it&#x27;s called a carrot color perfect what I wanted !!</li>
            <li> I needed this for a Halloween costume as a scarecrow. I used it to draw circles on my cheeks, and on my lips, and it looked great! It goes on smooth, and it is very bright and vibrant - exactly as I hoped it would be! It&#x27;s long-lasting, but easy to remove with basic make-up remover (or even just soap and warm water.) I do have a very sensitive face, and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, even though I used it on my cheeks. Great product, great price!</li>
