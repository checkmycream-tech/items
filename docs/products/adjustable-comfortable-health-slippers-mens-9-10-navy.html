            <li>They would  make a nice inexpensive gift</li>
            <li>The velcro comes undone fairly often (which would seem normal considering all the movement of walking etc., but they still work great for me.</li>
            <li>They are very comfortable and have given him a lot of relief.  </li>
            <li>These slippers are  so warm and comfortable.</li>

            <li>They will fit wider feet, not for everybody as they advertise.  </li>
            <li>The company confirmed immediately.  </li>
            <li>He commented they are light weight yet sturdy.  </li>
            <li>its a good deal for something that she can easily put on, especially when her feet swell up.</li>
            <li>Already fairly work out in a very short time.</li>
            <li>Great and comfortable, my husband can actually keep these on his feet and slip outside with them instead of putting on shoes all the time</li>

            <li>I ordered a man size large (10-11)but got a boys 10-11.</li>

            <li>If I was 5 foot tall and lived in Beijing, that slipper might have been a large; as it is, I couldn&#x27;t even close the velcro on my size ten foot ( which is on the lower spectrum of the &amp;#34;Large&amp;#34; spec).</li>
            <li>Yeah, they do look a little/feel a little cheap.</li>
            <li>They work very well for him and the cost is within our means as we are seniors with a low income.</li>
            <li>I thought the whole tongue peeled back with the velcro on each side, but its only on one side</li>

            <li> [[ASIN:B005GRNJ78 Adjustable Comfortable Health Slippers]] When I open the bag I said,\\&quot;yes this is it\\&quot;, then I took a closer look and saw how small they were. I ordered a man size large (10-11)but got a boys 10-11. cannot get my foot in the thing. I like the slipper but I need a man size.</li>
            <li> Poorly constructed for a health slipper. Improper stitching left a very rough edge of the velcro exposed at a pressure area where the instep of the foot would rub and no doubtably leave skin suceptible to tissue breakdown. Plus and addition $6.95 in return shipping.</li>

            <li> Gave these to my honey whose feet swell from time to time and he loves them</li>
            <li> I have neuropathy in my feet and need extra comfort to walk around in at home.

It&#x27;s my fault, and a well learned $16 lesson.</li>

            <li> I ordered these for my Dad who has gout and arthritis in his feet.  The slippers were advertised in a magazine for arthritis sufferers.  They are very comfortable and have given him a lot of relief.  I had noticed that some of the negative remarks about these slippers were related to the sizing.  After placing the order through Amazon, I noticed the size was not listed on my online receipt.  I emailed Dream Products through Amazon to specify the size.  The company confirmed immediately.  I plan on ordering more of these slippers.</li>
