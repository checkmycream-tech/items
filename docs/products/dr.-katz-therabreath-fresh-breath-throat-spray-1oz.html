    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is a great sore throat reliever!!!!</li>
            <li>Dr. Katz TheraBreath Plus Oral Spray is the best!  </li>
            <li>Great stuff, just wish it was cheaper, and the bottles where bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I think its just the mouthwash in a spray bottle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I just wish that it was sold at a cheaper price and contained more solution.</li>
            <li>So I am well pleased.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the product.</li>
            <li>and I can not use it any more.</li>
            <li>Love it, I use it mostly before I have to meet with a client or going to a meeting.</li>
            <li>I really liked the old formula.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re lucky if you don&#x27;t know what they are and don&#x27;t have them.</li>
            <li>Really a great product, I just wish it was a little more affordable, and/or available in my local grocery store.  </li>
            <li>It helps to keep fresh breath by killing bacteria in your mouth.</li>
            <li>I liked the extended part on this spray because it can reach the back of my throat area.</li>
            <li>For best results, I recommend its use with other TheraBreath products, such as the tooth paste and the oral rinse.</li>
            <li>The top portion or the handle lever of bottle is not so strong, it broke when I carried it in the bag along with other items.</li>
            <li>I was aiming at my tonsils all the way and got them on the first shot.  </li>
            <li>I had some trouble with tonsil stones, and it honestly cleared right up after using this.</li>
            <li>The nozzle makes it easy to really spray back towards the throat.</li>
            <li>Too much to do to get it to work for me</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Even after smoking, really helpful for halitosis.</li>
            <li>I have Burning Mouth Syndrome and this combination is just right for my sensitive tissue.</li>
            <li>I say surprisingly, because the spray itself doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming minty or otherwise taste, but it actually does seem to keep my breath fresh for at least a few hours.  </li>
            <li>I love the spray but only received a single.</li>
            <li>It does get right to the back of your throat</li>
            <li>This oral spray goes right to the back of the throat, and you feel immediate relief.  </li>
            <li>I hate chewing gum all the time to make sure my breath is good.</li>
            <li>This little bottle with the spray extender gets the medicine right where you need it, fast!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the flavor of this spray particularly well, but I have used it already on a cough and on a throat tickle, and it stopped them instantly.  </li>
            <li>If I gotta spend so much for this stuff to get minimal results then I shouldn&#x27;t be buying it...</li>
            <li>I use this product daily and this, in addition to squeezing the tonsil stones out of my tonsil area, has completely resolved my halitosis problem.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The spray tastes a little strange, and I sometimes dread using this because it makes me gag, but I would buy this again because nothing has really worked for me until now.</li>
            <li> but effects don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> this is great for sinusitis and bad breath!</li>
            <li> I would like the other two shipped as soon as possible please.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get rid of my bad breath no matter what I do, most likely because of my tonsil stones (tonsilloliths).</li>
            <li> I had a bottle of breath spray previously with Tea Tree Oil in it that would stop a cough or a sore throat instantly in its tracks.  </li>
            <li> but otherwise I&#x27;ll stick to half water, half peroxide to get ride of the stones and sea salt water to soothe the irritation following a stone dislodging.</li>
            <li> The taste is a little strange as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so-so on a lot of the other products</li>
            <li> how little there is of it but the product does seem helpful.</li>
            <li> It tastes a little weird, but it&#x27;s better than any other product because it does not hide, but eliminates bad breath.</li>
            <li> Seems like I had to use it an awful lot, like it didn&#x27;t really freshen up my mouth as well as I would have thought it would based on other reviews and what it actually says it will do.</li>
            <li> My mouth use to smell bad</li>
            <li> (yes, I do all that twice a day; shows you the lengths I&#x27;d go to get rid of bad breath).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy Therabreath for bad breath, I bought it because it has Tea Tree Oil in it.  </li>
            <li> so I used it after brushing and it tastes bad</li>
            <li> I hate coffee breath</li>

            <li> Great stuff, just wish it was cheaper, and the bottles where bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I think its just the mouthwash in a spray bottle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This little bottle with the spray extender gets the medicine right where you need it, fast!  I was aiming at my tonsils all the way and got them on the first shot.  This is a great sore throat reliever!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so-so on a lot of the other products but I do like this. I don&#x27;t like the price or how little there is of it but the product does seem helpful. It doesn&#x27;t seem to actually freshen my breath but it helped in soothing my tonsils after a stone came out and I believe that it also neutralized the odors coming out from my tonsils. That isn&#x27;t to say it made me minty or anything like that. It does seem to help with the stones. I just wish that it was sold at a cheaper price and contained more solution. When I can afford it I&#x27;ll buy this stuff but otherwise I&#x27;ll stick to half water, half peroxide to get ride of the stones and sea salt water to soothe the irritation following a stone dislodging.</li>
            <li> My mouth use to smell bad but when I spray therabreath, it neutralizes it.  The top portion or the handle lever of bottle is not so strong, it broke when I carried it in the bag along with other items.</li>
            <li> It helps to keep fresh breath by killing bacteria in your mouth. It tastes a little weird, but it&#x27;s better than any other product because it does not hide, but eliminates bad breath. For best results, I recommend its use with other TheraBreath products, such as the tooth paste and the oral rinse.</li>
            <li> I just received my package and I started today do I&#x27;ll keep u updated</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get rid of my bad breath no matter what I do, most likely because of my tonsil stones (tonsilloliths). You&#x27;re lucky if you don&#x27;t know what they are and don&#x27;t have them. I liked the extended part on this spray because it can reach the back of my throat area. To test this, I used 2 sprays about 10 minutes after I brushed, flossed, used a tongue cleaner, and gargled with mouthwash (yes, I do all that twice a day; shows you the lengths I&#x27;d go to get rid of bad breath). It kept my breath fresher for a longer period of time than if I hadn&#x27;t used it after brushing.    The spray tastes a little strange, and I sometimes dread using this because it makes me gag, but I would buy this again because nothing has really worked for me until now.</li>
            <li> if you have sinus problems-- try this out now.  this is great for sinusitis and bad breath!</li>
            <li> Works well but effects don&#x27;t last very long. The taste is a little strange as well. I still recommend trying it .</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy Therabreath for bad breath, I bought it because it has Tea Tree Oil in it.  I had a bottle of breath spray previously with Tea Tree Oil in it that would stop a cough or a sore throat instantly in its tracks.  I don&#x27;t like the flavor of this spray particularly well, but I have used it already on a cough and on a throat tickle, and it stopped them instantly.  So I am well pleased.</li>
            <li> Of course it is moth wash so I used it after brushing and it tastes bad and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I USED THIS ORAL TROUTH  ON A DAILY BASIC , IT&#x27;S PERIO-OXYGEN FORMULA NOT ONLY KILL ODOR CAUSING BACTERIA , BUT ALSO HELPS A PERSON WITH PERIODIC OR CRONIC SINUS INFECTIONS .</li>
            <li> I use the throat spray along with the TheraBreath toothpaste and mouthwash.  I have Burning Mouth Syndrome and this combination is just right for my sensitive tissue.</li>
            <li> Just as helpful as ever</li>
            <li> This stuff does work for me... Too much to do to get it to work for me I think... If I gotta spend so much for this stuff to get minimal results then I shouldn&#x27;t be buying it... and I am no longer doing that...</li>
            <li> I love the spray but only received a single. I ordered a three pack and paid the price for it.  I absolutely love the product. Immediate results. Br ut I would like the other two shipped as soon as possible please.  Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Even after smoking, really helpful for halitosis.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily and this, in addition to squeezing the tonsil stones out of my tonsil area, has completely resolved my halitosis problem.  I try to spray this in the back area around the tonsils.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> it works but you still have to brush and floss</li>
            <li> This irritated my throat a bit. Not a big fan. It does get right to the back of your throat so anyone with tonsil stones would do well to have this. May help some of the odor from the stones. Seems like I had to use it an awful lot, like it didn&#x27;t really freshen up my mouth as well as I would have thought it would based on other reviews and what it actually says it will do. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Convenient size. We keep them by the bed, in the bathroom and one for on-the-go. The nozzle makes it easy to really spray back towards the throat. Works well.</li>
            <li> They have changed the formula and now it is totally different and I can not use it any more. I really liked the old formula.</li>
            <li> I say surprisingly, because the spray itself doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming minty or otherwise taste, but it actually does seem to keep my breath fresh for at least a few hours.  I like the nozzle how it reaches the tonsils.  Really a great product, I just wish it was a little more affordable, and/or available in my local grocery store.  I had some trouble with tonsil stones, and it honestly cleared right up after using this.</li>
            <li> BS..didn&#x27;t remove the tonsil stones...go buy some mouth wash</li>
            <li> Dr. Katz TheraBreath Plus Oral Spray is the best!  I hate chewing gum all the time to make sure my breath is good. This oral spray goes right to the back of the throat, and you feel immediate relief.  Love it, I use it mostly before I have to meet with a client or going to a meeting. I hate coffee breath and now I don&#x27;t worry about it.</li>
