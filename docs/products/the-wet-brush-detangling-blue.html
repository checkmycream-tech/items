            <li>IT is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I liked this brush, it was a lot like the brush I purchased about five years ago.</li>
            <li>and I am thrilled with this purchase.</li>
            <li>She can even brush her own hair now-</li>
            <li>My daughter can now brush her own hair</li>
            <li>My daughter is thrilled with this brush.</li>
            <li>My girls and I each have one and it helps that we have our own color brush.</li>
            <li>I love it because it goes through all my knots, and trust me, I have so many knots in my hair but not anymore!</li>
            <li>My daughter has very fine curly hair that is knotted very easily.</li>
            <li>I guess the best review is from my 6 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best brush ever!</li>
            <li>I detangle my hair much more easily with this brush and also notice that the conditioner is distributed more evenly, which leads to softer hair!</li>
            <li>I received it quickly and in good condition.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried many brushes and products to help detangle my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IT DOESN&#x27;T PULL!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brush.  </li>
            <li>I also have Tangle Teezer, and that has held up much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably order another one for ME.  :-)</li>
            <li>We call it the Magic Brush</li>
            <li>Such a great find!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li>better than any comb or brush I have tried.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love when she uses it.</li>
            <li>these are my favorite brushes.</li>
            <li>We call it The Magic Brush at our house now.</li>
            <li>wish now that I had gone to the website and paid more to hopefully get a non-stinky brush.</li>
            <li>i have yet to pull any bristles out either.:)</li>
            <li>This brush is okay.</li>
            <li>Love it and will be getting another one for myself.</li>
            <li>We, and especially my daughter, are very happy we did.  </li>
            <li>Again with the MORE WORDS REQUIRED.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>will not review any more products if you insist on being jerks about it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced there&#x27;s a perfect cure for my daughter&#x27;s long wavy hair that tangles if you look at it, but this brush does work better than any we&#x27;ve tried, and it&#x27;s convinced her not to cut her hair.</li>
            <li>I really, really loved this brush at first.</li>
            <li>but I kept it because the bristles do feel pretty good on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this in the shower for the first time with my conditioner in and my hair was beautiful smooth and knot free.</li>
            <li>but the bristles are real short and don&#x27;t do very good on her hair.</li>
            <li>This brush is just awesome on wet hair.</li>
            <li>The Wet Brush Detangling Shower Brush is great!</li>
            <li>Not just for wet hair, it&#x27;s awesome all the time.</li>
            <li>OK it&#x27;s cheap and not a brand</li>
            <li>They really are that good.  </li>
            <li>I was ordering another bottle of our favorite, [[ASIN:B0007XFB2W Original Sprout Miracle Detangler]]</li>
            <li>THE TEETH BEND EASILY</li>
            <li>With this brush it is so easy</li>
            <li>It easily works through my hair without breakage and without any pain.</li>
            <li>Her hair knots up easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly awesome, Ive had it for a few months now and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely easy for the brush to pull the hair out.)</li>
            <li>This brush easily gets through the tangles without breaking the hair.  </li>
            <li>This brush is makes brushing my hair really easy</li>
            <li>My daughter has fine curly hair, and getting it detangled has always been a chore.</li>
            <li>The bristles are really fine which helps the brush glide through your hair without pulling it.</li>
            <li>This works excellent at detangling your hair when its wet, and it&#x27;s super gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>Great stocking stuffer or birthday present for a girl that you think has everything.</li>
            <li>I also thought the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is almost just like the Phillips Light Touch Brush from France that I paid $20 for .  </li>
            <li>It smelled SO strongly of cheap, burnt rubber.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brush wasn&#x27;t particularly incredible at brushing through wet hair</li>
            <li>The bristles are flexible enough to not get caught and offer some give, but does a great job detangling.</li>
            <li>but they really are amazing.  </li>
            <li>Really does de-tangle better than most any brush I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush because it is the most perfect way I have ever had to get my long wet hair smooth and untangled.  </li>
            <li>My granddaughter has super fine hair and she loves this brush when&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush is great for long hair.</li>
            <li>BUT, when I heard my 7 year old say, &amp;#34; I Love This Brush!&amp;#34; I was sold!</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the higher end brushes, &amp; this brush can do much more! ~xoxo</li>
            <li>There is nothing special about this brush.</li>
            <li>Does what it says--my daughter&#x27;s fine and tangled hair is not an issue when she brushes it right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brush after bath time when her hair is wet and the tears are greatly reduced.</li>
            <li>This brush was good for a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>I may send some to my friends as gifts I love this brush so much</li>
            <li>such a fair price.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull and it actually feels good to brush.</li>
            <li>Excellent brush, even for thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Great product and actually works as promised, I highly recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s hair breaks easily or has a tender head.</li>
            <li>I was always told not to use a brush on wet hair and never have until my new hairdresser introduced me to this wonderful brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a case of my super sensative skin, probably not the products fault.  </li>
            <li>best hair brush for someone that has a lot of think wavy hair that is hard to brush!</li>
            <li>BEST INVENTION EVER, especially if you have girls with long hair.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone that wants a good hair brush to detangle hair or just brush it in general.</li>
            <li>I may go buy more just to be sure that I have enough for her whole childhood.</li>
            <li>Then, when all is smooth I go back for the top of the head.  </li>
            <li>Now she welcomes it and she can actually brush her own hair now.</li>
            <li>I plan to get a couple more for my 10 yr old.</li>
            <li>in less than 5 minutes we had smooth tangle free hair!!</li>
            <li>This brush just slides right through.  </li>
            <li>although fine not particularly thick and have no problems.  </li>
            <li>This brush is fantastic - works very well on my 3-year old&#x27;s fine hair.</li>
            <li>Wet or dry, it is the best brush EVER!</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing for my long hair....</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing for my long hair....</li>
            <li>Anyone who has girls with long hair, I can honestly say this is a must.  </li>
            <li>it was good until the bristles started wearing down.</li>
            <li>I have waist length hair, and I can brush it with this brush more easily than any other brush I have ever used (except my Mason Pearson brush  which has an astronomical price compared with the price of this brush).</li>
            <li>It combs through your hair with easy, removing nearly all tangles and knots.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush based on other reviews saying that it worked well for kids with curly hair, and so far it has worked great for us.</li>
            <li>But it really, really works!  </li>
            <li>The price was higher.</li>
            <li>Hubby has now stolen it from me, but he loves it as much as I love my big one.  </li>
            <li>first thing I noticed when I opened the package was the smell.</li>
            <li>Like a miracle, really!</li>
            <li>(Thanks, Amazon!)  </li>
            <li>BUT IT WORKS!!I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it really does!</li>
            <li>This brush did exactly what it promised.  </li>
            <li>We were even able to stop spraying the detangling spray in after towel drying, as it is not necessary.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I found this brush, it really is working miracles!</li>
            <li>The amount of time brushing out my daughters hair has drastically reduced which is great when your running late for school.  </li>
            <li>They really work!  </li>
            <li>she has beautiful long blond hair that is very fine and tangles easily especially after bath time when hair is wet  </li>
            <li>Get one; it&#x27;s one of very few things in the world that doesn&#x27;t cost much and gives years of great return on investment.</li>
            <li>I also read the reviews which were pretty positive.  </li>
            <li>but my daughter is old enough to have her own</li>
            <li>We tried many different types of brushes but no matter how gentle we were, she cried and whined.  </li>
            <li>At first my husband and I thought it was very flimsy (the bristles &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; a lot)</li>
            <li>It gets out all the tangles in a matter of seconds with minimum tugging and pulling hair out&amp;#62; I love it and use t to blow dry my hair too.</li>
            <li>The brush mainly gets the top layer, so with my girls having thick hair we just divided it into sections, making sure to get underneath by the nape of the neck.</li>
            <li>I use the Spornette&#x27;s Luxury Cushion Large, 6 ounce (</li>
            <li>I am an African American woman who just successfully completed my transition to natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much that I&#x27;m buying one for every one of my friends and family with long hair!</li>
            <li>Works great on wet and dry hair and unless I&#x27;m imagining things, her hair looks shinier after combing with this brush.</li>
            <li>Works great on both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li>This brush makes getting the knots out so much easier.</li>
            <li>Expected better from the reviews.</li>
            <li>The tangles are so much easier to remove from hair.</li>
            <li>ASIN: B004PNPKRQ), purchased from Amazon, and really like it.</li>
            <li>and it really does the trick.  </li>
            <li>Love this brush for wet hair.  </li>
            <li>Which may be why I have so much breakage.</li>
            <li>It really does look like a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>hairbrush but works much much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not something I really want my toddler handling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this miracle brush!</li>
            <li>But it really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>makes it so much easier to get through it.</li>
            <li>She is very tender-headed.  </li>
            <li>My hair is long, about 24 inches and tangles easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying 2 more for my other granddaughters.</li>
            <li>so my hair is always dry and knots easily.  </li>
            <li>This brush worked well the first few times and then the things on top of the bristles started coming off.</li>
            <li>Her hair is wavy, not curly, so I&#x27;m not sure how it would work on curly hair, but on thick, wavy, long, healthy child hair, it is great!</li>
            <li>Overall, nothing special.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, dry, chemically treated and prone to knotting and frizzing all the time.</li>
            <li>the &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; on top started falling off and wearing down after maybe two months of use.</li>
            <li>I was shocked at how easily it went through my hair and more importantly, how gently.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it is supposed to be easy on the hair when it is wet.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I love the big one, but I needed something smaller for my handbag.  </li>
            <li>She has BEAUTIFUL, long, thick hair</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li>Until last week, my hair was about 5-6 inches of natural hair and then another 7ish inches of relaxed ends, which is exactly the kind of mess</li>
            <li>First of all I kept combing my ear, but second of all the comb just seemed to rip apart my tangles rather than gently teasing them apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought two a few months ago, and I have told so many friends about it-</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to help since the bristles bend easier and do not catch on tangles as much as a normal brush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews.</li>
            <li>I will be buying a few more to keep around the house.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Used to take me 10 min to brush my long hair after the shower, now just a few strokes and its good to go.</li>
            <li>and I do not feel worried about ripping my hair out while it is wet because it is super gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li>This brush got us through her hair, dry, after it had been uncombed for a full 24 hours.</li>
            <li>I bought this product not quite believing it would live up to its reviews; well, for me, it surpassed my highest expectations.  </li>
            <li>No more spraying bottles of detangler on my daughter&#x27;s waist length fine hair!  </li>
            <li>Not really sure what the magic is with this brush</li>
            <li>My old brush pulled and tugged my hair all the way to the root!</li>
            <li>I have very long hair and sometimes find that the tangles are just too much to deal with and tend to really hurt to detangle after using hair products like hair spray or mousse.  </li>
            <li>My daughter now loves to brush her hair and brushes it many times a day - wet or dry.</li>
            <li>I have looong thick curly hair, when I used to brushed I use to loose many many hair even with the detangler spray, and it was painful and took for ever in special when I had that kind of nest of hair at my hindhead.  </li>
            <li>Its a great brush don&#x27;t be afraid to buy this one  </li>
            <li>Using the Wet Brush, I am now able to brush out the tangles in my wet hair without it hurting and without any hair loss.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I took a chance on buying this brush because I&#x27;ve never been able to do my hair without it being painful before owing this.</li>
            <li>WHILE PRESERVING AS MUCH HAIR AS POSSIBLE IN YOUR HEAD</li>
            <li>She says the bristles are soft so they don&#x27;t hurt her head.</li>
            <li>I hold the hair near the roots and comb the rest.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t totally understand how it works but its so much easier to brush my hair</li>
            <li>My sensitive headed daughter won&#x27;t let me touch her head with any brush</li>
            <li>So inexpensive and makes my hair extremely soft &amp; removes all of the tangles as well.</li>
            <li>I got this product (in blue) and it came in a reasonable time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the go-to brush for my 3 year old and I.</li>
            <li>Bought this brush for my 4 year old daughter</li>
            <li>It definitely helps, but sometimes with bigger knots it just brushes right over them, and you have to go over it a lot to get all the knots out.</li>
            <li>This brush makes easy work out of untangling hair, wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>I was always told never to use a brush on wet hair or it would tear and break, so I pretty much went along with that advice all my life, using any number of big tooth combs.  </li>
            <li>And it works also in the shower, it is kind hard to handle my long hair in the shower</li>
            <li>(So I wrote names on the back of the brush to keep sanitation levels high.)</li>
            <li>This cute my detangling job in half and pulled less hair out than my normal hair brush does.</li>
            <li>Even though our hair is more manageable when wet, it is also very fragile, so we need to be careful.  </li>
            <li>Really DOES detangle my hair, which is quite long and curly.  </li>
            <li>I ordered 2 because my friend who has relatives with long hair said it really works.  </li>
            <li>My daughters have thick curly hair that tangle easily.  </li>
            <li>I just wish I had gotten one of these sooner, as I have long hair and this is so much easier to use, especially after a shower, rather than a comb.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Today I was using it and two of the bristles fell out, another one is completely bent,  and 4 of the blue tips on the bristles have come off.</li>
            <li>So I ran my old paddle brush through my hair and not one tangle, but the sensation was completely different.</li>
            <li>Her hair is brushed straight and her eyes are dry.  </li>
            <li>It made it a breeze to brush through my super fine, thin hair, which is always a tangled mess after a shower.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, this brush went through the knots, although pulled some hair, but did brush my hair and un-knotted it as none other before it.</li>
            <li>My daughter has thick, long hair that gets big &amp;#34;rat&#x27;s nest&amp;#34; tangles underneath where it hurts the most.</li>
            <li>My 2 year old has an extremely sensitive scalp and this literally solved the problem of brushing her hair when wet.</li>
            <li>THIS IS A SECRET KEY ITEM FROM MOST HAIR SALONS</li>
            <li>The main reason I bought this was because of the claim that you can use it on wet hair,</li>
            <li>The Wet Brush glides through her hair easily and no more tears and fights.  </li>
            <li>The wet brush is easy to use on wet and dry hair and it comes in several colors so overall</li>
            <li>This brush does exactly what it says it does, gets through your hair easily, wet or dry.</li>
            <li>I have long, thick hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>My hair is wavy, fine, and goes about half way down back.</li>
            <li>I used it during bathtime last night and he remarked how it didn&#x27;t hurt, just a little near the back where it is very tangled.</li>
            <li>brush isn&#x27;t like an ordinary paddle brush; it has soft, flexible bristles that gently glide through your hair.  </li>
            <li>This brush glides through hair easily with little discomfort, wet or dry!</li>
            <li>So it didn&#x27;t take long for me to notice some major breakage going in because of it!</li>

            <li> IT is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I liked this brush, it was a lot like the brush I purchased about five years ago.</li>
            <li> and I am thrilled with this purchase.</li>
            <li> She can even brush her own hair now-</li>
            <li> My daughter can now brush her own hair</li>
            <li> My daughter is thrilled with this brush.</li>
            <li> My girls and I each have one and it helps that we have our own color brush.</li>
            <li> I love it because it goes through all my knots, and trust me, I have so many knots in my hair but not anymore!</li>
            <li> My daughter has very fine curly hair that is knotted very easily.</li>
            <li> I guess the best review is from my 6 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best brush ever!</li>
            <li> I detangle my hair much more easily with this brush and also notice that the conditioner is distributed more evenly, which leads to softer hair!</li>
            <li> I received it quickly and in good condition.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried many brushes and products to help detangle my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IT DOESN&#x27;T PULL!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush.  </li>
            <li> I also have Tangle Teezer, and that has held up much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably order another one for ME.  :-)</li>
            <li> We call it the Magic Brush</li>
            <li> Such a great find!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li> better than any comb or brush I have tried.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I love when she uses it.</li>
            <li> these are my favorite brushes.</li>
            <li> We call it The Magic Brush at our house now.</li>
            <li> wish now that I had gone to the website and paid more to hopefully get a non-stinky brush.</li>
            <li> i have yet to pull any bristles out either.:)</li>
            <li> This brush is okay.</li>
            <li> Love it and will be getting another one for myself.</li>
            <li> We, and especially my daughter, are very happy we did.  </li>
            <li> Again with the MORE WORDS REQUIRED.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> will not review any more products if you insist on being jerks about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced there&#x27;s a perfect cure for my daughter&#x27;s long wavy hair that tangles if you look at it, but this brush does work better than any we&#x27;ve tried, and it&#x27;s convinced her not to cut her hair.</li>
            <li> I really, really loved this brush at first.</li>
            <li> but I kept it because the bristles do feel pretty good on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this in the shower for the first time with my conditioner in and my hair was beautiful smooth and knot free.</li>
            <li> but the bristles are real short and don&#x27;t do very good on her hair.</li>
            <li> This brush is just awesome on wet hair.</li>
            <li> The Wet Brush Detangling Shower Brush is great!</li>
            <li> Not just for wet hair, it&#x27;s awesome all the time.</li>
            <li> OK it&#x27;s cheap and not a brand</li>
            <li> They really are that good.  </li>
            <li> I was ordering another bottle of our favorite, [[ASIN:B0007XFB2W Original Sprout Miracle Detangler]]</li>
            <li> THE TEETH BEND EASILY</li>
            <li> With this brush it is so easy</li>
            <li> It easily works through my hair without breakage and without any pain.</li>
            <li> Her hair knots up easily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly awesome, Ive had it for a few months now and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely easy for the brush to pull the hair out.)</li>
            <li> This brush easily gets through the tangles without breaking the hair.  </li>
            <li> This brush is makes brushing my hair really easy</li>
            <li> My daughter has fine curly hair, and getting it detangled has always been a chore.</li>
            <li> The bristles are really fine which helps the brush glide through your hair without pulling it.</li>
            <li> This works excellent at detangling your hair when its wet, and it&#x27;s super gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> Great stocking stuffer or birthday present for a girl that you think has everything.</li>
            <li> I also thought the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is almost just like the Phillips Light Touch Brush from France that I paid $20 for .  </li>
            <li> It smelled SO strongly of cheap, burnt rubber.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush wasn&#x27;t particularly incredible at brushing through wet hair</li>
            <li> The bristles are flexible enough to not get caught and offer some give, but does a great job detangling.</li>
            <li> but they really are amazing.  </li>
            <li> Really does de-tangle better than most any brush I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush because it is the most perfect way I have ever had to get my long wet hair smooth and untangled.  </li>
            <li> My granddaughter has super fine hair and she loves this brush when&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush is great for long hair.</li>
            <li> BUT, when I heard my 7 year old say, &amp;#34; I Love This Brush!&amp;#34; I was sold!</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the higher end brushes, &amp; this brush can do much more! ~xoxo</li>
            <li> There is nothing special about this brush.</li>
            <li> Does what it says--my daughter&#x27;s fine and tangled hair is not an issue when she brushes it right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush after bath time when her hair is wet and the tears are greatly reduced.</li>
            <li> This brush was good for a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I may send some to my friends as gifts I love this brush so much</li>
            <li> such a fair price.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull and it actually feels good to brush.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush, even for thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Great product and actually works as promised, I highly recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s hair breaks easily or has a tender head.</li>
            <li> I was always told not to use a brush on wet hair and never have until my new hairdresser introduced me to this wonderful brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a case of my super sensative skin, probably not the products fault.  </li>
            <li> best hair brush for someone that has a lot of think wavy hair that is hard to brush!</li>
            <li> BEST INVENTION EVER, especially if you have girls with long hair.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone that wants a good hair brush to detangle hair or just brush it in general.</li>
            <li> I may go buy more just to be sure that I have enough for her whole childhood.</li>
            <li> Then, when all is smooth I go back for the top of the head.  </li>
            <li> Now she welcomes it and she can actually brush her own hair now.</li>
            <li> I plan to get a couple more for my 10 yr old.</li>
            <li> in less than 5 minutes we had smooth tangle free hair!!</li>
            <li> This brush just slides right through.  </li>
            <li> although fine not particularly thick and have no problems.  </li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic - works very well on my 3-year old&#x27;s fine hair.</li>
            <li> Wet or dry, it is the best brush EVER!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing for my long hair....</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing for my long hair....</li>
            <li> Anyone who has girls with long hair, I can honestly say this is a must.  </li>
            <li> it was good until the bristles started wearing down.</li>
            <li> I have waist length hair, and I can brush it with this brush more easily than any other brush I have ever used (except my Mason Pearson brush  which has an astronomical price compared with the price of this brush).</li>
            <li> It combs through your hair with easy, removing nearly all tangles and knots.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush based on other reviews saying that it worked well for kids with curly hair, and so far it has worked great for us.</li>
            <li> But it really, really works!  </li>
            <li> The price was higher.</li>
            <li> Hubby has now stolen it from me, but he loves it as much as I love my big one.  </li>
            <li> first thing I noticed when I opened the package was the smell.</li>
            <li> Like a miracle, really!</li>
            <li> (Thanks, Amazon!)  </li>
            <li> BUT IT WORKS!!I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it really does!</li>
            <li> This brush did exactly what it promised.  </li>
            <li> We were even able to stop spraying the detangling spray in after towel drying, as it is not necessary.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I found this brush, it really is working miracles!</li>
            <li> The amount of time brushing out my daughters hair has drastically reduced which is great when your running late for school.  </li>
            <li> They really work!  </li>
            <li> she has beautiful long blond hair that is very fine and tangles easily especially after bath time when hair is wet  </li>
            <li> Get one; it&#x27;s one of very few things in the world that doesn&#x27;t cost much and gives years of great return on investment.</li>
            <li> I also read the reviews which were pretty positive.  </li>
            <li> but my daughter is old enough to have her own</li>
            <li> We tried many different types of brushes but no matter how gentle we were, she cried and whined.  </li>
            <li> At first my husband and I thought it was very flimsy (the bristles &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; a lot)</li>
            <li> It gets out all the tangles in a matter of seconds with minimum tugging and pulling hair out&amp;#62; I love it and use t to blow dry my hair too.</li>
            <li> The brush mainly gets the top layer, so with my girls having thick hair we just divided it into sections, making sure to get underneath by the nape of the neck.</li>
            <li> I use the Spornette&#x27;s Luxury Cushion Large, 6 ounce (</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman who just successfully completed my transition to natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I love it so much that I&#x27;m buying one for every one of my friends and family with long hair!</li>
            <li> Works great on wet and dry hair and unless I&#x27;m imagining things, her hair looks shinier after combing with this brush.</li>
            <li> Works great on both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> This brush makes getting the knots out so much easier.</li>
            <li> Expected better from the reviews.</li>
            <li> The tangles are so much easier to remove from hair.</li>
            <li> ASIN: B004PNPKRQ), purchased from Amazon, and really like it.</li>
            <li> and it really does the trick.  </li>
            <li> Love this brush for wet hair.  </li>
            <li> Which may be why I have so much breakage.</li>
            <li> It really does look like a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> hairbrush but works much much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not something I really want my toddler handling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this miracle brush!</li>
            <li> But it really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> makes it so much easier to get through it.</li>
            <li> She is very tender-headed.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long, about 24 inches and tangles easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying 2 more for my other granddaughters.</li>
            <li> so my hair is always dry and knots easily.  </li>
            <li> This brush worked well the first few times and then the things on top of the bristles started coming off.</li>
            <li> Her hair is wavy, not curly, so I&#x27;m not sure how it would work on curly hair, but on thick, wavy, long, healthy child hair, it is great!</li>
            <li> Overall, nothing special.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, dry, chemically treated and prone to knotting and frizzing all the time.</li>
            <li> the &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; on top started falling off and wearing down after maybe two months of use.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how easily it went through my hair and more importantly, how gently.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it is supposed to be easy on the hair when it is wet.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I love the big one, but I needed something smaller for my handbag.  </li>
            <li> She has BEAUTIFUL, long, thick hair</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> Until last week, my hair was about 5-6 inches of natural hair and then another 7ish inches of relaxed ends, which is exactly the kind of mess</li>
            <li> First of all I kept combing my ear, but second of all the comb just seemed to rip apart my tangles rather than gently teasing them apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought two a few months ago, and I have told so many friends about it-</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to help since the bristles bend easier and do not catch on tangles as much as a normal brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews.</li>
            <li> I will be buying a few more to keep around the house.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Used to take me 10 min to brush my long hair after the shower, now just a few strokes and its good to go.</li>
            <li> and I do not feel worried about ripping my hair out while it is wet because it is super gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li> This brush got us through her hair, dry, after it had been uncombed for a full 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I bought this product not quite believing it would live up to its reviews; well, for me, it surpassed my highest expectations.  </li>
            <li> No more spraying bottles of detangler on my daughter&#x27;s waist length fine hair!  </li>
            <li> Not really sure what the magic is with this brush</li>
            <li> My old brush pulled and tugged my hair all the way to the root!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and sometimes find that the tangles are just too much to deal with and tend to really hurt to detangle after using hair products like hair spray or mousse.  </li>
            <li> My daughter now loves to brush her hair and brushes it many times a day - wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I have looong thick curly hair, when I used to brushed I use to loose many many hair even with the detangler spray, and it was painful and took for ever in special when I had that kind of nest of hair at my hindhead.  </li>
            <li> Its a great brush don&#x27;t be afraid to buy this one  </li>
            <li> Using the Wet Brush, I am now able to brush out the tangles in my wet hair without it hurting and without any hair loss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I took a chance on buying this brush because I&#x27;ve never been able to do my hair without it being painful before owing this.</li>
            <li> WHILE PRESERVING AS MUCH HAIR AS POSSIBLE IN YOUR HEAD</li>
            <li> She says the bristles are soft so they don&#x27;t hurt her head.</li>
            <li> I hold the hair near the roots and comb the rest.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t totally understand how it works but its so much easier to brush my hair</li>
            <li> My sensitive headed daughter won&#x27;t let me touch her head with any brush</li>
            <li> So inexpensive and makes my hair extremely soft &amp; removes all of the tangles as well.</li>
            <li> I got this product (in blue) and it came in a reasonable time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the go-to brush for my 3 year old and I.</li>
            <li> Bought this brush for my 4 year old daughter</li>
            <li> It definitely helps, but sometimes with bigger knots it just brushes right over them, and you have to go over it a lot to get all the knots out.</li>
            <li> This brush makes easy work out of untangling hair, wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> I was always told never to use a brush on wet hair or it would tear and break, so I pretty much went along with that advice all my life, using any number of big tooth combs.  </li>
            <li> And it works also in the shower, it is kind hard to handle my long hair in the shower</li>
            <li> (So I wrote names on the back of the brush to keep sanitation levels high.)</li>
            <li> This cute my detangling job in half and pulled less hair out than my normal hair brush does.</li>
            <li> Even though our hair is more manageable when wet, it is also very fragile, so we need to be careful.  </li>
            <li> Really DOES detangle my hair, which is quite long and curly.  </li>
            <li> I ordered 2 because my friend who has relatives with long hair said it really works.  </li>
            <li> My daughters have thick curly hair that tangle easily.  </li>
            <li> I just wish I had gotten one of these sooner, as I have long hair and this is so much easier to use, especially after a shower, rather than a comb.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Today I was using it and two of the bristles fell out, another one is completely bent,  and 4 of the blue tips on the bristles have come off.</li>
            <li> So I ran my old paddle brush through my hair and not one tangle, but the sensation was completely different.</li>
            <li> Her hair is brushed straight and her eyes are dry.  </li>
            <li> It made it a breeze to brush through my super fine, thin hair, which is always a tangled mess after a shower.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise, this brush went through the knots, although pulled some hair, but did brush my hair and un-knotted it as none other before it.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick, long hair that gets big &amp;#34;rat&#x27;s nest&amp;#34; tangles underneath where it hurts the most.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old has an extremely sensitive scalp and this literally solved the problem of brushing her hair when wet.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A SECRET KEY ITEM FROM MOST HAIR SALONS</li>
            <li> The main reason I bought this was because of the claim that you can use it on wet hair,</li>
            <li> The Wet Brush glides through her hair easily and no more tears and fights.  </li>
            <li> The wet brush is easy to use on wet and dry hair and it comes in several colors so overall</li>
            <li> This brush does exactly what it says it does, gets through your hair easily, wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy, fine, and goes about half way down back.</li>
            <li> I used it during bathtime last night and he remarked how it didn&#x27;t hurt, just a little near the back where it is very tangled.</li>
            <li> brush isn&#x27;t like an ordinary paddle brush; it has soft, flexible bristles that gently glide through your hair.  </li>
            <li> This brush glides through hair easily with little discomfort, wet or dry!</li>
            <li> So it didn&#x27;t take long for me to notice some major breakage going in because of it!</li>
            <li> My hair has been getting very tangled and almost matted in some areas after just going thru half the day, I couldn&#x27;t even use the pic to get it undone!</li>
            <li> My nine year old daughter has long hair with loose curls.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with it; it&#x27;s just a little miracle of engineering that makes a daily chore easy and fast.  </li>
            <li> So it definitely doesn&#x27;t last nearly long enough.</li>
            <li> I have very straight thick hair that is always snarling, so this is the only brush I have ever not dreaded using.</li>
            <li> My hair is long (a few inches below shoulders) and naturally very wavy and curly</li>
            <li> This brush softly detangles my hair when wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I found the plastic nubs on the end of the bristles come off with relative ease leaving the sharp ends of the metal bristles bare.</li>
            <li> I ordered a second one to use on my dogs (a cavalier king charles and a papillion) who both have long tails that tend to tangle.</li>
            <li> I am amazed that we&#x27;ve actually found a brush that detangles her long hair without ripping it out.</li>
            <li> This hairbrush did not last very long.</li>
            <li> I hate how it smells like those cheap fun step shoes from Rite Aid (the smoky smell)</li>
            <li> but this one - it really does work and hardly ever catches her hair in a knot.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a regular wet brush</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd wet brush we purchased.</li>
            <li> Wish this had been around long ago.  </li>
            <li> I have three girls, all with long hair</li>
            <li> I have long hair that I highlight</li>
            <li> If your daughter has long hair, than you know the problems with knots in their hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush hoping my daughter would stop screaming when I brush her long hair.  </li>
            <li> and it takes too long to comb everything out.</li>
            <li> Gets out long hair tangles with fewer tears.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is long and often tangled.</li>
            <li> and it has always taken me a long time to brush it out</li>
            <li> However, the nubs on the ends of the bristles fell off mine not that long into using it, and now it&#x27;s like daggers on my hairbrush.</li>
            <li> does that mean it&#x27;s really getting it detangled?</li>
            <li> I have really think long hair and finding the right brush in impossible.</li>
            <li> She has left swim parties in tears with a giant ratted mess-</li>
            <li> If you have long hair or your child does, get this brush!</li>
            <li> i have a hard time finding decent brushes in drug stores/target.</li>
            <li> It woks well in the shower or on dry hair.</li>
            <li> Works just as well on dry hair, too.  </li>
            <li> Makes &amp;#34;ripping through&amp;#34; the chlorinated dry hair a breeze.</li>
            <li> To brush/style my dry hair</li>
            <li> I was surprised this brush actually detangled my thick, curly, and often matted hair.</li>
            <li> My five year old used to run around the house and cry when it was brushing time, but no more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other detangling brushes before that claimed you could use them on wet hair and they only ripped out my hair or broke.</li>
            <li> I used this morning on dry hair, a couple of sweeps and hair sorted!</li>
            <li> this brush works both for wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> She uses this brush herself on her hair both wet and dry</li>
            <li> It seems to work just as well on wet hair or dry.  </li>
            <li> It works on wet or dry hair and there&#x27;s hardly any hair that&#x27;s been ripped out while brushing unlike my old brushes!</li>
            <li> and I always ended up with snarls at the bottom, but this little brush is so easy and works so well that I was wondering what in the heck must be wrong with it.  </li>
            <li> This brush arrived in just a couple of days and was a little stiff at first but softened up after a few uses  </li>
            <li> She has a sensitive scalp and never liked to brush her hair and puts it off (or won&#x27;t let me) until she has knots.</li>
            <li> bought this wet brush to work on detangling in the shower.  </li>
            <li> This just doesn&#x27;t happen with the wet brush.</li>
            <li> Someone recommended we try the wet brush.  </li>
            <li> We have had 1 wet brush from Amazon that we bought a 2-3 years ago</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair knots up when wet.  </li>
            <li> It arrived yesterday and my daughter said \\&quot;The WET brush\\&quot;??</li>
            <li> I like how this brush untangles my wet hair</li>
            <li> It makes it a breeze to detangle wet hair.</li>
            <li> My husband got me a wet brush for my Christmas stocking.</li>
            <li> hair is wet.</li>
            <li> They really do not pull the hair at all.</li>
            <li> I eventually got rid of the wet brush and just use a wide tooth comb to detangle my wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin, normal hair that is about halfway down my back.</li>
            <li> By that I mean some of it is wavy, curly, straight, and fluffy all at once because I&#x27;m biracial.</li>
            <li> My daughter has hair down to her bum, and it&#x27;s wavy and dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering another one for my sister who has very long and curly (not as tight as mine).</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thrown out all my other brushes and am just going to use this.</li>
            <li> the other day and on the bottom of the page it said people who bought the detanger often bought this brush too</li>
            <li> And because the bristles &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; it doesn&#x27;t break her hair when it&#x27;s wet!</li>
            <li> we have a couple of other detangling brushes one of them is called the b--n  </li>
            <li> Just be aware that it smells weird, but if you&#x27;re looking for the &amp;#34;wet brush&amp;#34; then you&#x27;ve found it.</li>
            <li> Wet Brush has saved us lots of tears!</li>
            <li> Even after using several different types of conditioners and detanglers, her hair is tough to brush through during blow out.  </li>
            <li> My 11 year old granddaughter has THICK, HEAVY hair.</li>
            <li> and she usually hates brushing her hair after her shower because it takes so long and often hurts.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter couldn&#x27;t stand to have her hair brushed because she always complained about the pain of it pulling.  </li>
            <li> the fact that I&#x27;m sitting down to write this should say something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush is no better than any other I have seen or used for detangling wet hair.</li>
            <li> I know that sounds odd</li>
            <li> but with this brush I can brush it in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Almost glides through my long, thick, prone-to-tangling hair.</li>
            <li> I have really long and thick hair</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and this brush</li>
            <li> My daughter &amp; I both have long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I threw it in my cart on a whim and had little expectations.</li>
            <li> and with just few hair falling.  </li>
            <li> but after using it quite a bit the tops of the bristles wear down and start scraping your scalp :-/</li>
            <li> Not gone but a lot less!</li>
            <li> My oldest daughter has very very thick, long hair</li>
            <li> My daughter has very thick, long hair.  </li>
            <li> A friend recommended this brush, no more crying when coming hair after a shower.  </li>
            <li> but once it loses it&#x27;s little plastic bristle bubbles</li>
            <li> This brush glides through my hair with no pulling and very little hair loss.</li>
            <li> I have cottony, coily/kinky type 4 hair (not sure which letter).  </li>
            <li> Not sure how this thing does what it does, but bravo to its inventors.</li>
            <li> No more you&#x27;re hurting me,</li>
            <li> no more Mom have to help, and she can brush her hair by herself now.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how these inexpensive brushes work</li>
            <li> I detangle my hair gently in the shower when it is soaking wet and has tons of conditioner in it, but I hated the wide-toothed comb.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has long, very thin hair.  </li>
            <li> What a hard time with the brushing before AND after washing.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> After using it for a few months now, I have noticed that the little ball ends have all been wearing off the bristles, leaving sharp edges which make it painful to brush my hair.</li>
            <li> was tired of the crying and whining every morning!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair nearly as bad as my last brush.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t lie, I am too lazy to brush my hair everyday, as it&#x27;s a tormenting, painful activity, so I comb my hair 2-3 time a week.</li>
            <li> We both have very thick hair</li>
            <li> (It is bad to brush hair while wet.</li>
            <li> I used to have a lot of difficulty combing through my hair after washing it, and I lost some hair and had broken ends in the process.</li>
            <li> I have never had this issue with any other brush, and I hate to have to buy another one already.</li>
            <li> I must admit, I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m awful at following up purchases with product reviews so</li>
            <li> Terrible quality~ Had to send it back!</li>
            <li> Hmmmmmm, she was skeptical too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately our blue brush smells terrible.</li>
            <li> but seriously, this thing smelled so bad.</li>
            <li> STOP LOOKING FOR ANY OTHER BRUSH, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED IN THIS ONE !</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>

            <li> STOP LOOKING FOR ANY OTHER BRUSH, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED IN THIS ONE ! THIS IS A SECRET KEY ITEM FROM MOST HAIR SALONS AS THIS HELPS REMOVE EVEN THE THICKEST MATS WHILE PRESERVING AS MUCH HAIR AS POSSIBLE IN YOUR HEAD AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IT DOESN&#x27;T PULL! THE TEETH BEND EASILY SO YOU DON&#x27;T EXPERIENCE ANY DISCOMFORT! TRY IT TODAY YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT !!</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s just love this brush! My oldest daughter has very very thick, long hair and she usually hates brushing her hair after her shower because it takes so long and often hurts. With this brush it is so easy I never hear any complaints anymore! My youngest has short, thinner hair and she loves it too. She says the bristles are soft so they don&#x27;t hurt her head. This brush is a winner in our house.</li>
            <li> I bought this product not quite believing it would live up to its reviews; well, for me, it surpassed my highest expectations.  It easily works through my hair without breakage and without any pain. I ordered a second one to use on my dogs (a cavalier king charles and a papillion) who both have long tails that tend to tangle.</li>
            <li> I ordered a regular wet brush and I got a squirt ! I hate it!!!</li>
            <li> This actually works! My hair is wavy, fine, and goes about half way down back. This is the only brush I have that doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m ripping out chunks of hair when I&#x27;m trying to brush out all of my tangles. It woks well in the shower or on dry hair.</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman who just successfully completed my transition to natural hair.  I have cottony, coily/kinky type 4 hair (not sure which letter).  Until last week, my hair was about 5-6 inches of natural hair and then another 7ish inches of relaxed ends, which is exactly the kind of mess it sounds like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this wet brush to work on detangling in the shower.  I detangle my hair gently in the shower when it is soaking wet and has tons of conditioner in it, but I hated the wide-toothed comb.  First of all I kept combing my ear, but second of all the comb just seemed to rip apart my tangles rather than gently teasing them apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush isn&#x27;t like an ordinary paddle brush; it has soft, flexible bristles that gently glide through your hair.  Even though our hair is more manageable when wet, it is also very fragile, so we need to be careful.  I detangle my hair much more easily with this brush and also notice that the conditioner is distributed more evenly, which leads to softer hair!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush.  I have very long hair and sometimes find that the tangles are just too much to deal with and tend to really hurt to detangle after using hair products like hair spray or mousse.  This brush makes getting the knots out so much easier. I wish my mom had used this brush on me when I was a child.</li>
            <li> It works just like a regular hair brush. I have thick hair and I tried to use this brush after showering; it took a while but I did manage to brush it through. Overall, nothing special.</li>
            <li> This brush makes easy work out of untangling hair, wet or dry.  My granddaughter couldn&#x27;t stand to have her hair brushed because she always complained about the pain of it pulling.  This just doesn&#x27;t happen with the wet brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great brush while it lasts. Almost glides through my long, thick, prone-to-tangling hair. Then the tips start to come off of the bristles and it&#x27;s just another brush, only much more expensive than a standard nylon-bristled one. I also have Tangle Teezer, and that has held up much better.</li>
            <li> Best brush ever!! This is the 3rd wet brush we purchased. One in the house, one in the camper and one at grandmas!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing.  My nine year old daughter has long hair with loose curls.  Her hair knots up easily.  Brushing her hair was always a battle, and it would inevitably end up with tears.  Someone recommended we try the wet brush.  I must admit, I was skeptical.  But it really, really works!  I have no idea how it does it, but it goes through the biggest of knots without pain.  My daughter now brushes her hair herself, without me asking.  Works just as well on dry hair, too.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I liked this brush, it was a lot like the brush I purchased about five years ago. The price was higher. I hope it lasts for me.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing for my long hair....I can use it in the shower too! It is great it doesnt rip out my hair and doesnt hurt to get tangles out! I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This brush does exactly what it says it does, gets through your hair easily, wet or dry. I just wish I had gotten one of these sooner, as I have long hair and this is so much easier to use, especially after a shower, rather than a comb.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush ever!!!! I would recommend it to everyone!!! Works great on my daughters hair, and mine too!!!</li>
            <li> I can comb my  daughters hair without any tears or yelling. What a pleasure. Works great on wet and dry hair and unless I&#x27;m imagining things, her hair looks shinier after combing with this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing. It glides through your hair without any pulling. I have very straight thick hair that is always snarling, so this is the only brush I have ever not dreaded using. I actually look forward to brushing my hair now.</li>
            <li> My daughter has fine curly hair, and getting it detangled has always been a chore. This brush got us through her hair, dry, after it had been uncombed for a full 24 hours. I am amazed and impressed. I may go buy more just to be sure that I have enough for her whole childhood.</li>
            <li> best hair brush for someone that has a lot of think wavy hair that is hard to brush! I use it all the time!</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the quality of this brush.  Expected better from the reviews.</li>
            <li> BEST INVENTION EVER, especially if you have girls with long hair. It works great to get those &amp;#34;rats nests &amp;#34; out as my mom called them. The tangles are so much easier to remove from hair. If you have yelling , screaming kids while brushing their hair , this is the brush for you.</li>
            <li> I love this brush because it is the most perfect way I have ever had to get my long wet hair smooth and untangled.  I was always told never to use a brush on wet hair or it would tear and break, so I pretty much went along with that advice all my life, using any number of big tooth combs.  They didn&#x27;t work that well and I always ended up with snarls at the bottom, but this little brush is so easy and works so well that I was wondering what in the heck must be wrong with it.  There is nothing wrong with it; it&#x27;s just a little miracle of engineering that makes a daily chore easy and fast.  My hair is long (a few inches below shoulders) and naturally very wavy and curly although fine not particularly thick and have no problems.  Wish this had been around long ago.  Get one; it&#x27;s one of very few things in the world that doesn&#x27;t cost much and gives years of great return on investment.</li>
            <li> I have looong thick curly hair, when I used to brushed I use to loose many many hair even with the detangler spray, and it was painful and took for ever in special when I had that kind of nest of hair at my hindhead.  With this brush I am actually able to brush my hair every night! and with just few hair falling.  And it works also in the shower, it is kind hard to handle my long hair in the shower but I could brush it! I am so happy with this purchase and grateful with God who helped me find it.</li>
            <li> We have had 1 wet brush from Amazon that we bought a 2-3 years ago but my daughter is old enough to have her own and so I bought another so we don&#x27;t fight over it in the morning. Works great on both wet and dry hair. Great stocking stuffer or birthday present for a girl that you think has everything. Nobody likes tangles!</li>
            <li> This is the only brush we have tried that doesn&#x27;t make my daughter cry.  I hold the hair near the roots and comb the rest.  Then, when all is smooth I go back for the top of the head.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Really does de-tangle better than most any brush I&#x27;ve used.  Can&#x27;t beat the price and works great!  All that coming from a man! :D</li>
            <li> I bought this because I love the big one, but I needed something smaller for my handbag.  Hubby has now stolen it from me, but he loves it as much as I love my big one.  Really DOES detangle my hair, which is quite long and curly.  I&#x27;ll probably order another one for ME.  :-)</li>
            <li> This has answered all my hair problems! I have three girls, all with long hair and I got one for each girl including myself!! We love it!!!</li>
            <li> I really, really loved this brush at first. It made it a breeze to brush through my super fine, thin hair, which is always a tangled mess after a shower. After using it for a few months now, I have noticed that the little ball ends have all been wearing off the bristles, leaving sharp edges which make it painful to brush my hair. I have never had this issue with any other brush, and I hate to have to buy another one already.</li>
            <li> Best brush I have ever used.  I bought 2 one for my daughter and one for myself.  We both have very thick hair and it snarls with the blow of the wind.  We no longer have a screaming daughter who hates to have her hair brushed. Now she welcomes it and she can actually brush her own hair now. I am so thankful.  this brush works both for wet and dry hair. I give it 5 stars but I would give it a million it there were that many to give, you cant go wrong with purchasing this brush.  I also thought the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this brush for my daughter. She has a sensitive scalp and never liked to brush her hair and puts it off (or won&#x27;t let me) until she has knots. Ever since getting this brush that is no longer a problem. My daughter now loves to brush her hair and brushes it many times a day - wet or dry. She says it is an awesome brush and I am thrilled with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This brush is just awesome on wet hair. I have long, thick hair that tangles easily. This brush softly detangles my hair when wet or dry. I love it so much that I&#x27;m buying one for every one of my friends and family with long hair!</li>
            <li> Anyone who has girls with long hair, I can honestly say this is a must.  I was skeptical at first...but one of my daughters has hair that gives Rapunzel some still competition, and well this takes ALL the tears away at &amp;#34;brushing time&amp;#34;.  This is also great for &amp;#34;post-swimming hair&amp;#34; as well.  Makes &amp;#34;ripping through&amp;#34; the chlorinated dry hair a breeze.</li>
            <li> It is almost just like the Phillips Light Touch Brush from France that I paid $20 for .  Now I will order these brushes.</li>
            <li> The Wet Brush Detangling Shower Brush is great! I used to have a lot of difficulty combing through my hair after washing it, and I lost some hair and had broken ends in the process. Using the Wet Brush, I am now able to brush out the tangles in my wet hair without it hurting and without any hair loss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced there&#x27;s a perfect cure for my daughter&#x27;s long wavy hair that tangles if you look at it, but this brush does work better than any we&#x27;ve tried, and it&#x27;s convinced her not to cut her hair. For now, anyway.</li>
            <li> This brush is no better than any other I have seen or used for detangling wet hair. I stopped using it as soon as I purchased the Tangle Teezer.</li>
            <li> This brush was good for a short amount of time. I found the plastic nubs on the end of the bristles come off with relative ease leaving the sharp ends of the metal bristles bare. This would end up hurting my scalp when I brushed. I eventually got rid of the wet brush and just use a wide tooth comb to detangle my wet hair. To brush/style my dry hair I use the Spornette&#x27;s Luxury Cushion Large, 6 ounce (ASIN: B004PNPKRQ), purchased from Amazon, and really like it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t why this brush is so great....but it is SO GREAT!  We call it the Magic Brush and we now own four of them!  One for the car, the shower, the swim bag, and the house.  My daughters won&#x27;t brush their hair with anything else anymore.  My five year old used to run around the house and cry when it was brushing time, but no more.  She waits patiently while I brush through her morning knots.  Not just for wet hair, it&#x27;s awesome all the time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush! My daughter has thick, long hair that gets big &amp;#34;rat&#x27;s nest&amp;#34; tangles underneath where it hurts the most. She also has autism, which has made our hair brushing experiences a total nightmare. This brush has greatly reduced the time it takes to brush out her hair each day, and has greatly reduced the screaming and tantrums. Such a great find!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m awful at following up purchases with product reviews so the fact that I&#x27;m sitting down to write this should say something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was the smell. I know that sounds odd but seriously, this thing smelled so bad. It smelled SO strongly of cheap, burnt rubber. It&#x27;s dissipated a bit over the weeks but it&#x27;s still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush wasn&#x27;t particularly incredible at brushing through wet hair but I kept it because the bristles do feel pretty good on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I was using it and two of the bristles fell out, another one is completely bent,  and 4 of the blue tips on the bristles have come off. This thing is falling apart already. Awful purchase.</li>
            <li> Best brush ever.  My daughters have thick curly hair that tangle easily.  This brush glides through hair easily with little discomfort, wet or dry!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product. Makes brushing hair a breeze! My 2 year old has an extremely sensitive scalp and this literally solved the problem of brushing her hair when wet. Love it!</li>
            <li> This brush is literally a miracle. My daughter has hair down to her bum, and it&#x27;s wavy and dry. She has left swim parties in tears with a giant ratted mess- and we&#x27;ve had to spend hours trying to get her hair combed thru. THIS BRUSH ENDED our nightmare of tangled hair! Wet or dry, it is the best brush EVER! This is a MUST buy for grama&#x27;s house too! She can even brush her own hair now- which seemed like a fairytale dream to me! For 20+ years I worked as in salons and had access to all the best hair products and styling tools including brushes and combs--- NOTHING has ever worked like this brush! My facebook friend told me about it- and now I am their biggest fan! :) I bought two a few months ago, and I have told so many friends about it- I should probably go buy some stock in their company! HA!</li>
            <li> Great Brush!  This brush is amazing for my long hair....I can use it in the shower too! It is great it doesnt rip out my hair and doesnt hurt to get tangles out! I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 because my friend who has relatives with long hair said it really works.  I also read the reviews which were pretty positive.  I ordered 2 brushes, one for my daughter and 1 for my dog.  They worked great for my dog and my daughter.  My dog doesn&#x27;t like me to brush her hair.  With this brush she doesn&#x27;t mind and it removes the tangles.  My daughter&#x27;s hair knots up when wet.  She says it works great and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li> OK it&#x27;s cheap and not a brand I know but this brush is amazing for my hair. My hair is fine, dry, chemically treated and prone to knotting and frizzing all the time. I used this in the shower for the first time with my conditioner in and my hair was beautiful smooth and knot free. Problem solved. I used this morning on dry hair, a couple of sweeps and hair sorted! I&#x27;ve thrown out all my other brushes and am just going to use this. I don&#x27;t do fancy hair drying or up dos, this is perfect for rushing out the door and the hair is sorted! Not really sure what the magic is with this brush but it worked for me!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this brush works, but it does. I have waist length hair, and I can brush it with this brush more easily than any other brush I have ever used (except my Mason Pearson brush  which has an astronomical price compared with the price of this brush). I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Great product and actually works as promised, I highly recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s hair breaks easily or has a tender head.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very thick, long hair.  It has been a constant battle getting her to brush it before school daily, until this year.  She uses this brush herself on her hair both wet and dry and it really does the trick.  Her hair is wavy, not curly, so I&#x27;m not sure how it would work on curly hair, but on thick, wavy, long, healthy child hair, it is great!</li>
            <li> I received it quickly and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to help since the bristles bend easier and do not catch on tangles as much as a normal brush. I guess the best review is from my 6 yr old daughter. She prefers this brush over others we have.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that I highlight so my hair is always dry and knots easily.  Whenever I would shower I HATED brushing my hair.  My hairdresser told me about this brush.  It&#x27;s truly awesome, Ive had it for a few months now and absolutely love it.  The bristles are really fine which helps the brush glide through your hair without pulling it. I don&#x27;t totally understand how it works but its so much easier to brush my hair and it gets the knots out without hurting!! LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Does what it says and that is all I expect. Not sure how this thing does what it does, but bravo to its inventors.</li>
            <li> Daughter loved the product!</li>
            <li> Terrible quality~ Had to send it back!</li>
            <li> Does what it says--my daughter&#x27;s fine and tangled hair is not an issue when she brushes it right out of the shower.  Like a miracle, really!</li>
            <li> My sensitive headed daughter won&#x27;t let me touch her head with any brush but this one - it really does work and hardly ever catches her hair in a knot.  Great brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews. I felt compelled to review this brush because it works so well that I wan&#x27;t this company who makes it to do well and never disappear.&lt;br /&gt;My girls have horribly tangly thick wavy hair. Combing is a nightmare. We fight, they cry, I end up in a bad mood. I was ordering another bottle of our favorite, [[ASIN:B0007XFB2W Original Sprout Miracle Detangler]] the other day and on the bottom of the page it said people who bought the detanger often bought this brush too (Thanks, Amazon!)  I threw it in my cart on a whim and had little expectations. It arrived yesterday and my daughter said \\&quot;The WET brush\\&quot;?? Hmmmmmm, she was skeptical too. Later that day the kids come in from swimming. If any of you moms have had to detangle hair after swimming in a ponytail you know that can be level 5 meltdown time. I&#x27;m out of detangling spray so we went in with the brush alone. This could be bad. BUT IT WORKS!!I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it really does! in less than 5 minutes we had smooth tangle free hair!! The brush mainly gets the top layer, so with my girls having thick hair we just divided it into sections, making sure to get underneath by the nape of the neck. My daughter declared \\&quot;This is may favorite brush\\&quot;!! I&#x27;m ordering more. I need a stockpile.</li>
            <li> If your daughter has long hair, than you know the problems with knots in their hair.  A friend recommended this brush, no more crying when coming hair after a shower.  It was so good, my wife uses it for her hair.</li>
            <li> Love this brush for wet hair.  I bought this brush hoping my daughter would stop screaming when I brush her long hair.  It definitely helps, but sometimes with bigger knots it just brushes right over them, and you have to go over it a lot to get all the knots out. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush based on other reviews saying that it worked well for kids with curly hair, and so far it has worked great for us. My daughter has very fine curly hair that is knotted very easily. I&#x27;ve been using this brush after bath time when her hair is wet and the tears are greatly reduced. Not gone but a lot less!</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST brush for detangling hair. better than any comb or brush I have tried.I plan to get a couple more for my 10 yr old. She loves it too.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair or your child does, get this brush! It truly works, I was amazed. My daughter runs to get it now after a shower and isn&#x27;t afraid to have me brush her hair out. I may send some to my friends as gifts I love this brush so much</li>
            <li> I have thin, normal hair that is about halfway down my back. I absolutely LOVE this brush! So inexpensive and makes my hair extremely soft &amp; removes all of the tangles as well. The main reason I bought this was because of the claim that you can use it on wet hair, (It is bad to brush hair while wet. It is extremely easy for the brush to pull the hair out.) and it takes too long to comb everything out. I would recommend this brush to everyone! Much cheaper than the higher end brushes, &amp; this brush can do much more! ~xoxo</li>
            <li> I have combination hair. By that I mean some of it is wavy, curly, straight, and fluffy all at once because I&#x27;m biracial. My hair is long, about 24 inches and tangles easily. I&#x27;ve used other detangling brushes before that claimed you could use them on wet hair and they only ripped out my hair or broke. This cute my detangling job in half and pulled less hair out than my normal hair brush does. I&#x27;ve already recommended this to my family and friends and would recommend it to strangers. I&#x27;m so glad I took a chance on buying this brush because I&#x27;ve never been able to do my hair without it being painful before owing this.</li>
            <li> The best brush I have ever used. I have really think long hair and finding the right brush in impossible. This brush glides through my hair with no pulling and very little hair loss. IT is AMAZING. I will never use another brush again.</li>
            <li> Best brush we&#x27;ve found.  Gets out long hair tangles with fewer tears.</li>
            <li> This brush is wonderful. No more spraying bottles of detangler on my daughter&#x27;s waist length fine hair!  This brush easily gets through the tangles without breaking the hair.  I love it. My daughter can now brush her own hair and I don&#x27;t have to worry about breakage.</li>
            <li> My Stylist had one of these and I love when she uses it. She told me I could one on Amazon. YEA! It does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> it was good until the bristles started wearing down. the &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; on top started falling off and wearing down after maybe two months of use.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as a recommendation from a friend who&#x27;s daughter has curly hair and fights her when she gets her hair brushed. My son also has curly hair, but his curls are even tighter than my girlfriend&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s hair. I used it during bathtime last night and he remarked how it didn&#x27;t hurt, just a little near the back where it is very tangled. I too have curly hair, even tighter than my son&#x27;s hair and tried it during shower time this morning. I was shocked at how easily it went through my hair and more importantly, how gently. It has this way of combing through, but is so flexible, that it doesn&#x27;t scrape the scalp or pull the hair. So I wondered, does that mean it&#x27;s really getting it detangled? So I ran my old paddle brush through my hair and not one tangle, but the sensation was completely different. My old brush pulled and tugged my hair all the way to the root! Which may be why I have so much breakage. I&#x27;m ordering another one for my sister who has very long and curly (not as tight as mine). I think she&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> these are my favorite brushes. i have 5 of them. good for untangling children&#x27;s hair. such a fair price. i have a hard time finding decent brushes in drug stores/target.</li>
            <li> I was surprised this brush actually detangled my thick, curly, and often matted hair. I won&#x27;t lie, I am too lazy to brush my hair everyday, as it&#x27;s a tormenting, painful activity, so I comb my hair 2-3 time a week. This perpetuates the matting and rat&#x27;s-nest malady. Much to my surprise, this brush went through the knots, although pulled some hair, but did brush my hair and un-knotted it as none other before it. I&#x27;m stunned, grateful, and very impressed.</li>
            <li> I read about this brush as a recommended Christmas present for tween/teen girls. My daughter&#x27;s hair is long and often tangled. At first my husband and I thought it was very flimsy (the bristles &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; a lot) but it WORKS!!!!!!! And because the bristles &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; it doesn&#x27;t break her hair when it&#x27;s wet! Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I like how this brush untangles my wet hair but once it loses it&#x27;s little plastic bristle bubbles it&#x27;s painful to brush through my hair.  This hairbrush did not last very long.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush if your hare is alway in knots after your shower. LOVE THIS BRUSH for that and every day use!!!</li>
            <li> The wet brush is easy to use on wet and dry hair and it comes in several colors so overall this is a great product! I recommend this product to anyone that wants a good hair brush to detangle hair or just brush it in general.</li>
            <li> I got this product (in blue) and it came in a reasonable time. This brush worked well the first few times and then the things on top of the bristles started coming off. Now the bristles scratch my tender head every time I use it, I would probably not buy again</li>
            <li> This brush did exactly what it promised.  Brushing my daughters hair after a bath was no picnic before.  The Wet Brush glides through her hair easily and no more tears and fights.  We were even able to stop spraying the detangling spray in after towel drying, as it is not necessary.  We call it The Magic Brush at our house now.</li>
            <li> We have been using this brush for almost two years and we are very happy with it.  Works wonderfully even though is seems like nothing special.</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic - works very well on my 3-year old&#x27;s fine hair. It really does look like a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; hairbrush but works much much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately our blue brush smells terrible. I have washed it a number of times and am hoping the smell goes away. But it&#x27;s not something I really want my toddler handling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just looked up the company website and read, &amp;#34;will not vouch for the quality of products purchased on Amazon&amp;#34;. Hmmm great.&lt;br /&gt;I wish now that I had gone to the website and paid more to hopefully get a non-stinky brush. I recommend you go that route.</li>
            <li> My daughter is thrilled with this brush. I am amazed that we&#x27;ve actually found a brush that detangles her long hair without ripping it out. I was starting to lose hope that we&#x27;d find one.</li>
            <li> This brush works wonders. It makes it a breeze to detangle wet hair. My girls and I each have one and it helps that we have our own color brush. The bristles are flexible and don&#x27;t hurt the scalp.</li>
            <li> Item is as described very happy with it would buy again</li>
            <li> after the shower this is the best time to use this. Great for detangling my rats nest lol. It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair nearly as bad as my last brush. i have yet to pull any bristles out either.:)</li>
            <li> I am a fan! My husband got me a wet brush for my Christmas stocking. It&#x27;s the go-to brush for my 3 year old and I. I will be buying a few more to keep around the house. I have recently bought a couple as birthday gifts and everyone agree that this brush is great. It doesn&#x27;t pull and it actually feels good to brush. ;)</li>
            <li> My granddaughter has super fine hair and she loves this brush when&lt;br /&gt;Her hair is wet. It takes care of her tangles wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I read all the great reviews for this brush and decided to buy it even though I still had my reservations. My hair has been getting very tangled and almost matted in some areas after just going thru half the day, I couldn&#x27;t even use the pic to get it undone! So it didn&#x27;t take long for me to notice some major breakage going in because of it! I&#x27;m sooo happy I found this brush, it really is working miracles! It works on wet or dry hair and there&#x27;s hardly any hair that&#x27;s been ripped out while brushing unlike my old brushes! I highly recommend this miracle brush!</li>
            <li> Excellent brush, even for thick curly hair.  Take out tangles without pain.  Great for kids and adults. would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> You think how different can this brush be? But it really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used to take me 10 min to brush my long hair after the shower, now just a few strokes and its good to go. This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush I have ever owned. I recommend it to everyone! I have relatively curly and tangle prone hair and I can brush my hair easily with this great brush. It combs through your hair with easy, removing nearly all tangles and knots. Before I got this brush I felt like I dreaded the pain the brushing my hair always brought, but now that I have the brush I look forward to brushing my hair after every shower!</li>
            <li> Bought this brush for my 4 year old daughter she has beautiful long blond hair that is very fine and tangles easily especially after bath time when hair is wet  we have a couple of other detangling brushes one of them is called the b--n  but the bristles are real short and don&#x27;t do very good on her hair. This brush arrived in just a couple of days and was a little stiff at first but softened up after a few uses  Its a great brush don&#x27;t be afraid to buy this one  it&#x27;s a great brush</li>
            <li> This brush is makes brushing my hair really easy and I do not feel worried about ripping my hair out while it is wet because it is super gentle on my hair. I have really long and thick hair and it has always taken me a long time to brush it out but with this brush I can brush it in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> This brush is okay. I hate how it smells like those cheap fun step shoes from Rite Aid (the smoky smell) however, it gets the job done so I can&#x27;t give it a bad review. Just be aware that it smells weird, but if you&#x27;re looking for the &amp;#34;wet brush&amp;#34; then you&#x27;ve found it. (:</li>
            <li> My daughter hates her hair brushed.  I bought this because it is supposed to be easy on the hair when it is wet.  This works like a charm.  Love it and will be getting another one for myself.</li>
            <li> I love it because it goes through all my knots, and trust me, I have so many knots in my hair but not anymore! with this brush I can brush my hair without having any hair falling out</li>
            <li> My daughter has long, very thin hair.  It snags and snarls and it is very difficult to brush through.  We tried many different types of brushes but no matter how gentle we were, she cried and whined.  After reading the reviews for this brush, we decided to give it a try.  We, and especially my daughter, are very happy we did.  It seems to work just as well on wet hair or dry.  The amount of time brushing out my daughters hair has drastically reduced which is great when your running late for school.  Her hair is brushed straight and her eyes are dry.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> They really work!  They glide through the tangles and there are fewer complaints with brushing their hair.  I would recommend them to everybody!</li>
            <li> This brush starts off great... but after using it quite a bit the tops of the bristles wear down and start scraping your scalp :-/</li>
            <li> Works on my long, average thickness hair really well.  The bristles are flexible enough to not get caught and offer some give, but does a great job detangling.</li>
            <li> I would not believe it if I didnt try it for myself! I have three of these brushes and love them! They really do not pull the hair at all.</li>
            <li> Cannot believe how this works. My 11 year old granddaughter has THICK, HEAVY hair. What a hard time with the brushing before AND after washing. No more you&#x27;re hurting me, no more Mom have to help, and she can brush her hair by herself now. The brush goes through her hair with NO pulling or knotting up. I&#x27;m buying 2 more for my other granddaughters.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best brush ever! I have long, thick hair and this brush makes it so much easier to get through it. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how these inexpensive brushes work so well but they really are amazing.  This is my second one.  My daughter &amp; I both have long, thick hair.  She is very tender-headed.  Even after using several different types of conditioners and detanglers, her hair is tough to brush through during blow out.  This brush just slides right through.  It never pulls.  We both have fewer split ends.  I even take ours to beauty shop for hair dresser to use when on us now.  They really are that good.  Definitely recommend for anyone with tender scalp or longer hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a case of my super sensative skin, probably not the products fault.  Again with the MORE WORDS REQUIRED.&lt;br /&gt;I will not review any more products if you insist on being jerks about it. I have one nerve left and you are getting on it.</li>
            <li> This works excellent at detangling your hair when its wet, and it&#x27;s super gentle and effective. However, the nubs on the ends of the bristles fell off mine not that long into using it, and now it&#x27;s like daggers on my hairbrush. So it definitely doesn&#x27;t last nearly long enough.</li>
            <li> There is nothing special about this brush. The bristles seemed a bit flimsy and it doesn&#x27;t go through all of the hair. BUT, when I heard my 7 year old say, &amp;#34; I Love This Brush!&amp;#34; I was sold! She has BEAUTIFUL, long, thick hair but it was always tangled even after using conditioner, detangling spray and serum!.&lt;br /&gt;I was tired of the crying and whining every morning! And I realized she was too when she called me in to her room to see a commercial for a no tangle brush. Well that brush was $30!&lt;br /&gt;The Wet Brush has saved us lots of tears! I will be ordering more of them!!!!</li>
            <li> This brush is great for long hair. I would have preferred different colors, but only blue was offered. (So I wrote names on the back of the brush to keep sanitation levels high.)</li>
            <li> I was always told not to use a brush on wet hair and never have until my new hairdresser introduced me to this wonderful brush. It gets out all the tangles in a matter of seconds with minimum tugging and pulling hair out&amp;#62; I love it and use t to blow dry my hair too. I even bought a second one for my daughter</li>
