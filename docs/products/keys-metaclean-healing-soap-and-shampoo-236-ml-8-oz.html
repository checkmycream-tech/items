            <li>Because of the positive reviews (even though there aren&#x27;t many).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First time I used it I put waaaaay too much on my dog</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really work and makes your hair feel sticky</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ll use something cheaper when it&#x27;s finished but will buy it again in the future!&lt;br /&gt;I was unable to use the hair rinse from the same company as the first try left my hair very gummy, but the shampoo is great.</li>

            <li>after having seen a few dentists for some dental work (that was emptying my pockets and not really helping me feel better)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s helped clear the rashes and itching immensely.</li>
            <li>And apparently the manufacturer has discontinued the 16 ounce bottle that I could get for just under $30, also</li>
            <li>This shampoo does something, we don&#x27;t know what, and he scratches a lot less than when he&#x27;s washed with more ordinary shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is not really a sudsing shampoo, but it did feel calming on my scalp and helped soothe the irritation I was experiencing, which appears to be back to normal now.</li>
            <li>MetaClean does something most other products don&#x27;t, so I&#x27;m still buying it despite the ridiculous price.</li>

            <li> The dermatologist recommend that she use \\&quot;Dove Shampoo\\&quot; and gave her a script every so often--which did help a little, but it didn&#x27;t completely take care of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shampoo itself has a strange odor to it- probably from the neem oil-</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this as a regular daily shampoo because it leaves my hair with an odd texture, but I can use it once a week for a rest from discomfort.</li>
            <li> Well, here we are 4 weeks later, and the skin problem has completely gone away, and she is no longer losing hair, but it is actually growing back-and the areas that were thin, are now back to normal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thin liquid, not the usual thick gel of a shampoo, and it&#x27;s easy to pour too much onto the fur.  </li>
            <li> it made my hair so unbelievably dry that I couldn&#x27;t brush it after I was out of the shower even with loads of detangle spray.</li>
            <li> It also did wonders on dry and cracked elbows and feet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice not having to see my mom disappointed, and always having to schedule appointments with the dermatologist.tologist.</li>
            <li> It goes bad quicker than most preservative-laden shampoos, so use it up within a month or store it in the fridge.</li>
            <li> Within a few hours of bathing, he was back to itching.  </li>
            <li> I am not very keen on the scent, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> Too expensive but have to have it for the dog, she is very sensitive and this is the only shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make her itch.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount goes a long ways!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s dried out my eczema (but also helped stop the itching!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s part of the process.</li>
            <li> I USE IT EVERYDAY FOR MY HAIR AND BODY!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because of the eczema on my scalp hoping it would work for me and it was the absolute worst shampoo I have ever used</li>
            <li> It is expensive, though.</li>
            <li> Does anyone have any experience with this stuff going bad?  </li>
            <li> Because I knew that my mom was frustrated and disappointed that she was doing as the dermatologist instructed, just to keep losing hair, 2)</li>
            <li> Thank you Keys MetaClean, you were outrageously priced, but you also work outrageously well!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work and makes your hair feel sticky</li>
            <li> MetaClean does something most other products don&#x27;t, so I&#x27;m still buying it despite the ridiculous price. It makes my itchy scalp stop itching. It has neem oil in it. Being skin sensitive to many shampoos (resulting in mildly itchy scalp), I&#x27;m always on the lookout for products that help. I can&#x27;t use this as a regular daily shampoo because it leaves my hair with an odd texture, but I can use it once a week for a rest from discomfort. It&#x27;s great as cleanser on a sponge in the shower. It smells excellent. It goes bad quicker than most preservative-laden shampoos, so use it up within a month or store it in the fridge. Neem oil, by the way, is an ingredient in some garden pest control products. It kills the creepy-crawlies but not the fungus on your roses. Just sayin.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Too expensive but have to have it for the dog, she is very sensitive and this is the only shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make her itch.</li>
            <li> I bought this as as a &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; method. It made my hair sticky and gross and would not rinse out. I will be using this on my dog since that&#x27;s what everyone else seems to be using it for.</li>
            <li> I have had itchy scalp for several years and tried different shampoos but none really worked for me. This product, however, is the best. I could feel the difference after I used it two or three times. I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful for bathing my dogs. It is natural, which is very important to me. My dogs don&#x27;t love being in the bathtub, so I appreciate having a soap that lathers easily and rinses quickly. It has helped my dogs&#x27; skin conditions, though it hasn&#x27;t been a complete cure. It is expensive, though.</li>
            <li> love this cleanser. I&#x27;ve ben an esthetician for over 10 years and this will always be at the top of my list.</li>
            <li> My mom has had a skin problem on her scalp for the last couple of years, she was even losing hair in one spot and her hair was thinning in the surrounding areas. The dermatologist recommend that she use \\&quot;Dove Shampoo\\&quot; and gave her a script every so often--which did help a little, but it didn&#x27;t completely take care of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently become very interested in natural oils, herbs, etc. after having seen a few dentists for some dental work (that was emptying my pockets and not really helping me feel better) so I decided to purchase this for her to try for several reasons. 1) Because I knew that my mom was frustrated and disappointed that she was doing as the dermatologist instructed, just to keep losing hair, 2) Because of the ingredients, 3) Because of the positive reviews (even though there aren&#x27;t many).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to this shampoo, I also purchased her some Tea Tree Oil ([[ASIN:B007GOHNYO B007GOHNYO]] and I told her to mix a couple of drops in with the MetaClean shampoo each time that she shampooed her hair. After the first time that she shampooed her hair, she called me very excited and told me that it felt great and that she was going to keep using it to see if she could get the results that we had hoped. Well, here we are 4 weeks later, and the skin problem has completely gone away, and she is no longer losing hair, but it is actually growing back-and the areas that were thin, are now back to normal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to add my opinion about the consistency, the smell, or what it feels like since I am not the one that uses it---but what I do know is that it works for the skin condition that my mom had on her scalp that the dermatologist couldn&#x27;t quite figure out after two years. Thank you Keys MetaClean, you were outrageously priced, but you also work outrageously well! It&#x27;s nice not having to see my mom disappointed, and always having to schedule appointments with the dermatologist.tologist.</li>
            <li> Returned. Bought for my dog who has an itch problem despite having no fleas, a healthy coat and clear skin.  This did not help curtail the itchies.  Within a few hours of bathing, he was back to itching.  Their spray is much more effective.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve got a Labrador Retriever who is allergic to a variety of environmental triggers, and each Autumn he seems the most sensitive. This shampoo does something, we don&#x27;t know what, and he scratches a lot less than when he&#x27;s washed with more ordinary shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I laughed at the other comment about how this liquid really suds up and her dog looked like a cartoon of how to wash your dog. Same here!  It&#x27;s a thin liquid, not the usual thick gel of a shampoo, and it&#x27;s easy to pour too much onto the fur.  By the time you add some water and start massaging it around it really makes some lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s with the fixed price?  Everywhere it&#x27;s about $20, which makes me suspicious.  And apparently the manufacturer has discontinued the 16 ounce bottle that I could get for just under $30, also suspicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a suggested &amp;#34;use by&amp;#34; date on the bottle. Does anyone have any experience with this stuff going bad?  And how could you tell?</li>
            <li> This is not really a sudsing shampoo, but it did feel calming on my scalp and helped soothe the irritation I was experiencing, which appears to be back to normal now. Yay!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because of the eczema on my scalp hoping it would work for me and it was the absolute worst shampoo I have ever used it made my hair so unbelievably dry that I couldn&#x27;t brush it after I was out of the shower even with loads of detangle spray. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Bought it for psoriasis/eczema on my scalp as well as a similar rash elsewhere. After using the shampoo both began to get regularily itchier, redder and flakier, so I thought that this may be a temporary thing before they begin to improve, but they only continued to worsen. I had to discontinue use and go to my doctor to get prescribed ointment to bring down the huge inflammation. Probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> A life saver for anyone with sensitive skin.  I would recommend this to anyone with scalp problems and skin problems.</li>
            <li> Works great for pets with allergies........</li>
            <li> Lathered well and rinsed very well. However, did nothing for our dogs skin problems. Our dog has a severe skin problem that requires something from the vet.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this shampoo because of the cost, however I am glad I purchased it. I have had eczema all my life and my itchy scalp was becoming a problem. After a few weeks of using this product, I noticed a great difference on my scalp and my skin. I am not very keen on the scent, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo last year when I had a problem with bumps on my scalp. It smells wonderful. I have kept it in the bathroom for a year and it is still fresh. I never considered refrigerating it like another reviewer did.&lt;br /&gt;My bumps gradually healed. I&#x27;ve used only this shampoo since last February. I shampoo twice a week. There is still 1/4 left in the bottle. I&#x27;ll use something cheaper when it&#x27;s finished but will buy it again in the future!&lt;br /&gt;I was unable to use the hair rinse from the same company as the first try left my hair very gummy, but the shampoo is great. I have fine, slightly curly hair and it leaves it fluffy and feeling good.</li>
            <li> Just a dime size dollop gives you a great amount of lather and helps dry scalp conditions. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself and a second for my mother.  It clears up a dry itchy scalp very quickly and reduces the itching of psoriasis. It smells great and rinses out almost instantly. It also did wonders on dry and cracked elbows and feet.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> Definitely worked.  I just couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
            <li> YES IT IS GREAT!!! :) I LOVE IT!!! :)  I USE IT EVERYDAY FOR MY HAIR AND BODY!!! I WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT DAILY!!! :)</li>
            <li> The only thing that helped my toddler with eczema! Thank you, thank you!!</li>
            <li> This is the greatest shampoo/cleaner that I have ever purchased . it is a great product for the whole family including the cats and dog.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way. First time I used it I put waaaaay too much on my dog and he looked like a cartoon of how to wash your dog. But it does the job and he smells nice and fresh after. The shampoo itself has a strange odor to it- probably from the neem oil- but it doesn&#x27;t stick around for long and my dog is nice and shiny and crazy after his bath.</li>
            <li> Keys Meta Clean Healing Soap &amp; Shampoo is excellent. No fragrances, everything in the prpduct designed to clean not harm the user. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Good for pets as well as humans. Just a small amount goes a long ways!</li>
            <li> It is the only product I have found my scalp problems,rinses easily,and smells good.&lt;br /&gt;It is also good for stings.</li>
            <li> I use this to bathe my dog who has severe skin allergies/ sensitivities.</li>
            <li> It smells funny but it works!</li>
            <li> Upon receiving my shipment I&#x27;ve used this shampoo twice so far this week and it&#x27;s dried out my eczema (but also helped stop the itching!). I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s part of the process. Could anyone tell me if I should buy their lotion as well? Or is there a conditioner? I don&#x27;t like the way this makes my hair feel after I shampoo but after I condition it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giving this shampoo four stars regardless because I began to have an allergic reaction to chemicals on some new clothes I recently bought and used this as a body wash and it&#x27;s helped clear the rashes and itching immensely. Worth the money in my opinion!</li>
