            <li>I would say this is probably better at styling my hair than my other brush and feels good on my scalp.</li>

            <li>EXACTLY how I want them too.  </li>
            <li>The first I tried was a SH&amp;SH</li>
            <li>Thanks Much Quality Item!</li>

            <li>Brush is as expected, fine for styling and well-made.</li>
            <li>This brush has both bristles and tips which she really likes because it&#x27;s not harsh on her scalp.</li>

            <li> It is light weight and easy to handle. It works well with my hair which is short and fine. With a little practice,the short length actually makes it easier to use.</li>
            <li> At first I loved this little brush - the handle is big enough for a good grip, it brushed my hair just fine UNTIL the little red plastic balls started falling off and then it scratches your scalp.  Usually the nylon bristles and ball tips are all one.  On this brush, they are separate so they start falling off after awhile.  Back to the drawing board China.</li>
            <li> great feeling on the scalp....very light weight and easy to handle....nice size</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great brush, but wish it was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> This is an ok brush.  It is on the small side.  It&#x27;s about 7.5 inches long and about 2 inches wide across the bristles.  So it&#x27;s perfect for travel or keeping in your purse, car, desk. etc.  It works well for me when my hair is wet.  Brushes through my hair easily and works out tangles.  It&#x27;s not great on my hair when it&#x27;s dry though.  I have wavy hair.  Running this brush through my hair when it is dry makes it frizzy and full of static.  I was able to purchase this item at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion in a review.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the hairbrush.  It rivals my favorite that I have used for years and years</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised. Brush is as expected, fine for styling and well-made. A good purchase.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a brush that I liked this well for several years.  I plan to buy another one in the near future.</li>
            <li> I bought this bush because I was fed up with my last one not getting my hair the way I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is different than others  I have used in the past, it has these small little bristles around the hard plastic tips which seem to work very well with laying your hair properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cant really explain it properly through words, but I recommend you try it and you&#x27;ll see for yourself.  I have something that sort of resembles a comb over (I am not bald, just like the style) and this brush lays the hairs EXACTLY how I want them too.  This is an exceptional comb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Made out of quality materials&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy tips, don&#x27;t bend&lt;br /&gt;Has brushes around the tips that work well&lt;br /&gt;Great if you have somewhat of a comb over&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The brush is a little smaller than I would like&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to personally thank Brigittes Brushes for allowing me to try this brush at a discounted price!</li>
            <li> Nice brush! Prior to a few weeks ago, the only brushes I had ever tried was the Goody brand. It was time to get a new brush and I thought I&#x27;d try something different. The first I tried was a SH&amp;SH - it&#x27;s a round shape with different-colored bristles. It has a mirror on the back and I think it looks neat. All my friends think I&#x27;m a weirdo because I&#x27;ve been going around, &amp;#34;Hey, look at my new brush!&amp;#34; Then I saw this one and thought, &amp;#34;I can have two cool brushes!&amp;#34; As I mentioned, love the red body of it, the 7-row styling with red tips (that match the handle) and also the cursive &amp;#34;Brigitte&#x27;s Brushes&amp;#34; written signature on the handle. I would say this is probably better at styling my hair than my other brush and feels good on my scalp. The handle fits my hand perfectly and it is lightweight yet sturdy. I would recommend this to anyone that has hair! I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased product review. All opinions expressed are truly my own.</li>
            <li> Like the feel and size of brush</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  It was smaller than I expected but that turned out to be a wonderful advantage.  It fits and feels good in my hand and is good for styling with a blow dryer, detangling and plain old brushing.  I like it a lot more than the round styling brush I had been using.  I just bought a second one to leave in my car.</li>
            <li> Eh - Nice brush but smaller than I expected especially for the money. I could have done better at Target or Walmart. I gave it to my teenage son. Oh well, live and learn.</li>
            <li> I got this Styling Hairbrush for my niece since she has thinner hair and she loves styling her hair differently a lot. This brush has both bristles and tips which she really likes because it&#x27;s not harsh on her scalp. She loves how the brush glides through her hair without ripping any out. The handle is very comfortable as well and has a nice grip. She really loves styling her hair with this brush because it works how she wants it to which is to help with giving her some curls. She said that this is her new favorite brush! I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> My hair is long and very thick. It tangles easily and is a pain to brush out especially, when waking up in the morning. I found the Styling Hairbrush, the Classic 7-row with Tips and Bristles (Red) from Brigitte&#x27;s Brushes, and decided to see what all the fuss was about. It arrived very quickly, and I had to try it out. I ran it through my hair for about 20 minutes. It did not yank and pull at my hair like most other brushes have done in the past. After I was done, I was shocked to realize my hair was silky smooth with no knots or tangles left. I used it again that night after getting out of the shower. It was just as perfect!  The handle is the perfect size to fit comfortably in my hands. This is an amazing brush, and I would highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review</li>
            <li> Smooths and untangles easily!  Perfect for little girls hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice enough but causes so much static in my hair that I&#x27;m unable to use it.</li>
            <li> These are the best Hair Brushes I have ever found.</li>
