            <li>It seems quieter and does a good job.  </li>

            <li>Sensational close shaves.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>I own the Sanyo SVM 730 version of this shaver.</li>
            <li>I don;t like electric shavers at all, but this one is actually nice and does not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>Great to have in your car / briefcase / backpack for a quick touch up.  </li>
            <li>I think this shaver is OK.  </li>
            <li>Works great for fast touch up.</li>
            <li>Will buy more just in case they stop making them.</li>
            <li>and I love them all.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li>Shaves OK.</li>
            <li>It also has better looks.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty good...</li>
            <li>Good shaver, comfortable, close and fast.</li>
            <li>Impressive little razor.</li>
            <li>Fantastic portable product.</li>
            <li>It works smoothly and does its job well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I think this is OK - its not as quick as a full sized electric, but for a 5-o-clock shadow it&#x27;d be perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Does not have a carry case like the original Sanyo version.</li>
            <li>Not so good at removing several days worth of whiskers tho !  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so good that I just use it daily.</li>
            <li>Love it so much I purchased another Sanyo for $34 from Japan.</li>
            <li>It arrived really quick to my surprise.</li>
            <li>It works well for quick shave on the road.</li>
            <li>It does shave very smooth and there is no irritation, and it is tiny and easy to pack for travel.  </li>
            <li>Great little travel companion.  </li>
            <li>So far, am pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li>Have only used it once, but am happy so far.  </li>
            <li>I already feel like I have received my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I have not used the Sanyo model, however I saw a photo of the Sanyo SV-M730 shaver with the carrying case and think it is far better than this shaver because of the carrying case.</li>

            <li>Great shave from small unit.</li>
            <li>Most of the time I can shave with it only.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li>Apparently, according to others the carrying case made the Sanyo more bulky, because this is a very compact shaver and doesn&#x27;t take up much room, so perhaps the carrying case would not have been as useful as I first thought.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic version has the exact same body but the shave head looks more modern.</li>
            <li>Nice little razor.  </li>
            <li>It is lightweight and comfortable to use -- definitely not a toy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very compact, so should travel well.  </li>
            <li>Does the job well unless you want a really close shave.</li>
            <li>Panasonic now owns Sanyo and a shame that the Sanyo model (similar product) comes with mirror case no longer available.</li>
            <li>but very portable and convenient.  </li>
            <li>Good for late day.</li>
            <li>The battery seems to last a long time, and it was nice they included some with the device when I got</li>
            <li>It would have been nice to include a case as it is optional to use, although I&#x27;m not sure how the new Panasonic cleaning brush (not the same as the Sanyo) that I really like would have fit into the case.</li>
            <li>Less is more.  </li>
            <li>Good shaver, enough small for travel, made in Japan</li>
            <li>Every easy to carry for travel and batter last for a long time.  </li>
            <li>There is not much difference between the two shavers except that the ES-RS10-S is thinner and smaller and comes with a superior cleaning brush and is for dry use only.</li>
            <li>And was I surprised that this Panasonic worked so well for $20.  </li>
            <li>It seems to shave closely, and is quiet compared to an older travel shaver this one replaced.  </li>
            <li>I have a very heavy beard and this little battery powered shaver does a great job for the 5 out of 7 days that I don&#x27;t want to bother with a wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even it is small but it is powerful enough to do its job.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> works just like the sony</li>
            <li> My dad had the Sanyo version of this for the longest time (I&#x27;d say 10+ years, maybe longer) and it finally gave out but it looks like the Sanyo has been discontinued; I&#x27;ve looked everywhere. This Panasonic was the closest thing to it so I decided to get it for him. It arrived really quick to my surprise. And he loves it! Small and portable and hopefully it will last just as long as the Sanyo.</li>
            <li> Less is more.  Does the job!</li>
            <li> Sensational close shaves.This little guy is a winner! Very pleased!</li>
            <li> It works well. I like it.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good... Not so good at removing several days worth of whiskers tho !  Doesn&#x27;t catch longer hair.</li>
            <li> No travel/storage case, shaving is great</li>
            <li> I was just going to use it for travel but it&#x27;s so good that I just use it daily.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver. It shaves almost as close as a blade. Most of the time I can shave with it only. I don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting myself.</li>
            <li> Fantastic portable product. Made in Japan.</li>
            <li> This travel shaver seems to give a close shave It is lightweight and comfortable to use -- definitely not a toy!</li>
            <li> I like it. It works well for quick shave on the road. Very small to carry around to use as needed. Well made. Recommended</li>
            <li> So far, am pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li> It works but your face has to adjust. Good for late day. Touch ups. No carrying. Case. No battery with razor.</li>
            <li> Great shave from small unit.</li>
            <li> I think this shaver is OK.  I have very thick facial hair, and this performs about as well as a full sized shaver.

            <li> It is compact and quiet,that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> Have only used it once, but am happy so far.  It arrived faster than expected.  It&#x27;s very compact, so should travel well.  It seems to shave closely, and is quiet compared to an older travel shaver this one replaced.  Drawbacks: grill cover doesn&#x27;t hold too well, so will likely fall off while in my shaving bag; no pop-up trimmer or cleaning brush storage (though a separate cleaning brush is provided), but I guess that&#x27;s the price you pay for something so compact. Assuming it holds up, it&#x27;s a good shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> Does the job well unless you want a really close shave. Compact size good for travelling. Panasonic now owns Sanyo and a shame that the Sanyo model (similar product) comes with mirror case no longer available.</li>
            <li> Works great for fast touch up.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as promised.  Not as close as a razor (what electric is?) but very portable and convenient.  Great value.  Works best for touch ups, and addressing 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  Great to have in your car / briefcase / backpack for a quick touch up.  For a truly close shave on a daily basis get Art of Shaving products.</li>
            <li> I own the Sanyo SVM 730 version of this shaver. Bought it while I was in Japan, that one comes with a quality protective plastic case. Love it so much I purchased another Sanyo for $34 from Japan. This Panasonic version has the exact same body but the shave head looks more modern. These are the best shaver ever. I think I will use this shaver the rest of my life. Will buy more just in case they stop making them.</li>
            <li> This shaver is awesome. Close shave and a sleek design. I already feel like I have received my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Good shaver, comfortable, close and fast. Slightly hard to hold due to size.</li>
            <li> I have a very heavy beard and this little battery powered shaver does a great job for the 5 out of 7 days that I don&#x27;t want to bother with a wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased three of these: One called a Sanyo SVM 730 and two called Panasonic ES-RS10-S.&lt;br /&gt;I think they are identical and I love them all.</li>
            <li> Good shaver, enough small for travel, made in Japan</li>
            <li> Smallest shaver I ever purchase.  It works smoothly and does its job well.  Even it is small but it is powerful enough to do its job.  Every easy to carry for travel and batter last for a long time.  Great little travel companion.  I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Compact and does the job when your on the road.</li>
            <li> I have not used an electric shaver in years because they never did the job for me.  I needed to get my brother one so I decided to get one myself.  And was I surprised that this Panasonic worked so well for $20.  Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I don;t like electric shavers at all, but this one is actually nice and does not irritate my skin.  Great bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel!  Prompt service!</li>
            <li> A little larger than the sanyo shaver that I owned, so it did not fit in the case.  It seems quieter and does a good job.  Glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Impressive little razor.</li>
            <li> Nice little razor.  I keep it in my locker at a golf club.</li>
            <li> Great for the money....nota bad shave but could be closer.</li>
            <li> Does not have a carry case like the original Sanyo version. Makes it difficult for travel. Shaves OK.</li>
            <li> This is a successor model to a shaver made by Sanyo when Panasonic bought Sanyo.  I have not used the Sanyo model, however I saw a photo of the Sanyo SV-M730 shaver with the carrying case and think it is far better than this shaver because of the carrying case. I tend to think that Panasonic has messed with the products from Sanyo and made them inferior.  However there are no complaints with the quality of this shaver. This shaver shaves well and comparably to the [[ASIN:B001CS8BJ6 Panasonic ES3831K]]. There is not much difference between the two shavers except that the ES-RS10-S is thinner and smaller and comes with a superior cleaning brush and is for dry use only. It also has better looks.  UPDATE: After some time of use, I think this is better than the ES3831K and is one of Panasonic&#x27;s best battery operated shavers, possibly because of the &amp;#34;Made in Japan&amp;#34; quality, even if it is only a dry shaver. If you get the version from Hong Kong rather than Japan (which is the same shaver and still Japanese made) it has English writing rather than Japanese on the back of the shaver. Apparently, according to others the carrying case made the Sanyo more bulky, because this is a very compact shaver and doesn&#x27;t take up much room, so perhaps the carrying case would not have been as useful as I first thought. It would have been nice to include a case as it is optional to use, although I&#x27;m not sure how the new Panasonic cleaning brush (not the same as the Sanyo) that I really like would have fit into the case. I have read in some places that it has an aluminium body, however it feels like plastic, so it may be incorrect information. A good idea is to periodically oil the shaver once you have cleaned all of the hair out, by applying three or so drops of baby oil made from mineral oil AKA liquid paraffin or pariffinum liquidum (check the ingredients, don&#x27;t use other types of lubricating oil because it is not good for the skin and will leave a scent) onto the foil while it isoperating. Don&#x27;t oil the motor or inside the shaver as it will cause damage to the shaver and will gum up the motor. In the instruction manual (from memory, I don&#x27;t have it with me) I think it mentions using a small bottle of oil obtained from Panasonic to oil the shaver, but this is not available outside Japan and is only liquid paraffin (baby oil.)</li>
            <li> This is the best travel shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It is simple, compact and reliable. I actually have this same design shaver that I bought in 1989 and it still works... Amazing product.</li>
