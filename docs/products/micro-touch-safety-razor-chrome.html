            <li>so this was a perfect torture test for this thing.</li>
            <li>Again, this is just a matter of how the razor pairs with my beard; it might be perfect for someone with lighter hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perhaps because the Microtouch is the perfect weight with the perfect length handle and perfect razor edge angling?  </li>
            <li>This allowed for the greatest degree of dexterity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not saying microtouch is the best out there, for all</li>

            <li>Very good shave.</li>
            <li>The blades aren&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li>And it just doesn&#x27;t give you a very good quality shave.</li>
            <li>This is a very good razor for noobs to start with</li>
            <li>Very good razor for either beginners or novice shavers.</li>

            <li>The are a very good looking antique one that my dad taught me to shave with 50 years ago</li>
            <li>Very Good Razor.  </li>
            <li>Husband did not feel it was a very good razor</li>
            <li>For the money, this is a very good razor.</li>
            <li>And a brand that&#x27;s best in one razor may not be best (or even good) in another, so the exploration must be done for each razor.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cost savings are incredible.</li>
            <li>This was.a brilliant gift ideal for my husband who use to use a dingle blade razor yeats ago.</li>
            <li>This takes practice to use well, but once you get the hang of it, you will get an incredibly close shave.</li>
            <li>There are some great sample packs so you can find out which razor blade works best for you.</li>

            <li>Gives a really good shave if you know how to shave like a boss!</li>
            <li>So I did some research and found that if I bought a aloe plant and cut the leaves, use it as my shaving cream and buy a good safety razor I prob wont break out, let alone get any cuts or irritation!</li>
            <li>(That&#x27;s good!)  </li>
            <li>Not as good as advertised !</li>
            <li>LIFE IS GOOD!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a good choice!</li>
            <li>It works great, and doesn&#x27;t get plugged up with hair.</li>

            <li>A very nice product.</li>
            <li>Take your time and you will learn to get a very nice shave at a fraction of the cost of the multi-blades.edge exposed on both sides then tighten the rest of the way.</li>
            <li>Take your time and you will learn to get a very nice shave at a fraction of the cost of the multi-blades.</li>
            <li>The weight is very nice</li>
            <li>I will say that the stand is very nice</li>
            <li>Very nice razor never thought I would prefer one blade compared to 5</li>
            <li>Very nice.  </li>
            <li>With a good amount of aloe it slided beautifully.</li>
            <li>the included ones are rather good but its nice to buy a sampler to see what works best with your hair/skin.</li>
            <li>Harrison is real smooth!</li>
            <li>I love the stand that shows it off very nicely, I am very happy.</li>
            <li>This works great for me, purchased in December and use this 3-4 times a week with a good shaving soap.</li>
            <li>Rick, two stars is the best I can do with it.. : )</li>
            <li>But, I am glad to say this is a excellent razor!</li>
            <li>love it works awesome</li>
            <li>Great Product, my husband loved it.</li>
            <li>:P</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li>nice finish and the razor stand are very handy and beautiful.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t able to get a very good shave with it.  </li>
            <li>Very good razor love lt WORKING GRATE</li>
            <li>Good shaver, inexpensive replacement blades.  </li>
            <li>I am used to shaving against the grain, however, and I&#x27;ll need to get used to using the blade before getting good use from it in that fashion.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how good this razor is for the money, someone bought for me as a gift.</li>
            <li>It does the job, but multi-blade razors are superior.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap to use, and that&#x27;s the best thing I can say about it.</li>
            <li>Its a good razor and you get a good shave, but the opening got stuck and broke when trying to replace razor.</li>
            <li>Not as good as my Gillette</li>
            <li>Received in good shape and time.</li>
            <li>The razor came damaged so I don&#x27;t know if shaves good or not.....</li>
            <li>, just does not do what it is suppose to do, and that is give a good shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M GOOD</li>
            <li>Good Quality for the price.  </li>
            <li>good for getting started.</li>
            <li>Hope all the money made goes to a good cause.</li>
            <li>My husband says it was a good shave</li>
            <li>The blades included are surprisingly good.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m just too used to HARRY&#x27;s, which I think is the best deal available  </li>
            <li>Spend your money on a good safety razor like merkur, gillette etc.</li>
            <li>he said it did a really good job on his bald head.</li>
            <li>Forgot how good these were.  </li>
            <li>My husband loved it.</li>
            <li>Not as good a product as</li>
            <li>Good DE blades can be had on Amazon for $12 to $18 per hundred.  </li>
            <li>This razor gives me as good of a shave as any multi-blade I have ever used</li>
            <li>Sometimes its good to go retro.</li>
            <li>Note you also need a good cream.</li>
            <li>As good as anything else.</li>
            <li>And check out the Nick Shaves videos on youtube for all lot of good information.</li>
            <li>Like the ads say, a person doesn&#x27;t need a six bladed razor to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>THIS RAZAR DO NOT SHAVE ME GOOD</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good safety razor for years, and this one fits the bill.</li>
            <li>This razor is advertised as if it the most incredible thing ever, but it&#x27;s identical to the one my Grandfather used...</li>
            <li>and you will get a good shave and probably won&#x27;t mangle your face.</li>
            <li>This is a good quality razor with good feel and balance.</li>
            <li>He loved the way it shaved his beard.  </li>
            <li>Feels good in my hand.  </li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re looking for a good starter Safety Razor to practice with to get a handle on how to use one, this \\&quot;As</li>
            <li>&quot; one is a good one to start with.  </li>
            <li>Exellent product at a fair price.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend a good quality shaving soap.</li>
            <li>The razor has a good feel and weight to it.</li>
            <li>Boyfriend absolutely loved it</li>
            <li>Quality of shave is good.</li>
            <li>Fairly good razor, inexpensive to use as replacement blades are a fraction of what you pay for those 3 or 4 bladed razors at walmart.</li>
            <li>Good:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good razor, have not used one of these since I was 16.</li>
            <li>It was good then and just as good now.</li>
            <li>Excellent smooth shave</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d have to admit it gave me a good shave that I was looking for how ever I went to wal-mart to try and find blades for it when that time comes and couldn&#x27;t find any there.</li>
            <li>You shouldn&#x27;t make the razor do all the work and expect good results.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job for removing hair fix the handle length</li>
            <li>and it would be a really good product.</li>
            <li>I know the Mekur is a superior unit.</li>
            <li>After getting a good shave with it, I was thinking about it and wondering, &amp;#34;Why</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my husband and he absolutely LOVED it.  </li>
            <li>Good shave with this blade</li>
            <li>Reasonably good value with the included blades.  </li>
            <li>For the money you get a fair shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>good handle</li>
            <li>to me, not as good as advertisement.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a good YouTube video called &amp;#34;Micro Touch One Razor&amp;#34; that describes how to use</li>
            <li>Good razor.  </li>
            <li>Good product to use with care.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>An extremely good value for the price.</li>
            <li>Loved this razor .</li>
            <li>my husband loved it, had no complaints</li>
            <li>good shaving soaps have moisturizers), I then let it set for a moment and</li>
            <li>and if you learn to use it, will give you a good shave.</li>
            <li>Works Good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Originally loved this product.  </li>
            <li>Good size handle and seems well constructed.</li>
            <li>Could not get good angle on my head and ended up with lots of cuts</li>
            <li>A good buy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was truly hoping this would do a good job,</li>
            <li>He said it pulled at hi skin and didn&#x27;t give a good shave.</li>
            <li>I found it to be good product with one drawback.</li>
            <li>Again, I wanted to give this razor three stars, but just couldn&#x27;t and can&#x27;t in good conscience recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>good buy</li>
            <li>have since ordered a Merkur 34C, which I&#x27;m hoping will yield good results.</li>
            <li>not as good as advertised</li>
            <li>Works good on both.</li>
            <li>Good shave.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be fairly well made, but as I inspect closely, I see some variations in the thickness of the blade bed arms.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a good product that is inexpensive and works.</li>
            <li>it aren&#x27;t good</li>
            <li>you can buy on Amazon for a good price.</li>
            <li>Good quality razor.</li>
            <li>It does a good job and gives a shave as good as the Fusion I was using.</li>
            <li>It does not work to good.</li>
            <li>good luck</li>
            <li>Boyfriend loved it.</li>
            <li>It provides a nice lather that did a great job in softening my beard.</li>
            <li>Good old-fashioned razor.</li>
            <li>I gave this razor a good 2 months trial, but between the razor scraping and burns along with the use of a styptic pencil I could no longer stand the pain.  </li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll look into another safety razor as the shave, as I said, was quite good.</li>
            <li>Blade is really good too.</li>
            <li>I recommend buying some nice blades if your an experienced shaver.</li>
            <li>This shaves as good as anything ive used before.</li>
            <li>... gave me a good shave.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give a good shave</li>
            <li>I feel like I could give George Clooney a run for his money in the good looks department (I was going to say Clark Gable</li>
            <li>But man, what a nice shave!!&amp;#34; Seriously,  Great product</li>
            <li>this razor is awesome very useful</li>
            <li>and it ,very easy to use,,,,give a great shave</li>
            <li>Very good quality and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The Razor in nicely built, has nice balance and works great.</li>
            <li>Anyway, great razor at a great price and the refills (gotta order them online) are dirt cheap compared to store-bought blades.  </li>
            <li>When you use it for the 1st time, it seems like it is not cutting well, however, after you finish, you&#x27;ll see that it cuts great!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the performance of this piece and plan to keep it until it is no longer usable</li>
            <li>Very cheap!</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the quality of the razor &amp; the stand</li>
            <li>and my husband was very pleased.</li>
            <li>I was Very glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li>The blades that come with it work great for me, though you can take the time to find others that work better for you</li>
            <li>He is very satisfied with this razor.</li>
            <li>very happy worth the cost product</li>
            <li>Great shave better than the leading multi-blade razors at a fraction go the price.</li>
            <li>and i am very pleased with it..</li>
            <li>I assure you, if you make shaving a fun event, your Microtouch will be the best investment you ever made.  </li>
            <li>and he is very pleased with the quality and price.</li>
            <li>Great razor, Weishi for sure.</li>
            <li>It was more than I thought it would be works great</li>
            <li>I bought this razor for $20, including 12 blades and a chrome stand, and I must say that I am very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>Great way to save money and have a better shave.</li>
            <li>He is very satisfied with this razor.  </li>
            <li>like I said once i heal up my face is very smooth!</li>
            <li>but for the savings of the blades I am very pleased with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>Blades that came with it are good and the razor stand is a nice plus.</li>
            <li>Learn how to do it right for the best shave ever!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a very good razor and a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Great product and much more cost effective over 3 and 5 blade razors.  </li>
            <li>do your self a huge favor to your self and your walet and get one !!</li>
            <li>Works for me...bought it yesterday at Walmart, used it before work, and was pretty impressed with the shave.  </li>
            <li>cheap piece of junk!!</li>
            <li>Also, shaving with the grain of the hair growth first, then against it produces the best, smoothest result for me.  </li>
            <li>I got an excellent shave the first time I used it, despite having forgotten how to use the gadget in 45 years.</li>
            <li>I dont care how many blades, you wont get a closer shave!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>but I love it!  </li>
            <li>I could give many reasons why this is not the razor for me but suffice it to say, this is a great idea on absolutely the best way to shave but the razor is cheeeeply made.  </li>
            <li>This one he&#x27;s satisfied with and he&#x27;s keeping!</li>
            <li>The first use, I was greatly impressed.  </li>
            <li>100% satisfied!</li>
            <li>do yourself a favor buy a razor made in Germany you will love it!</li>
            <li>After 36 years of marriage to this wonderful woman this statement was a first for her.  </li>
            <li>and i love this razor!</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t impressed after the first couple passes</li>
            <li>By the bye, if you use this razor, you have better keep styptic pencil nearby!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this razor!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>My husband and son love it!</li>
            <li>Way better than paying $17 for 3 razors!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I own it!</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say I love it!</li>
            <li>Once you learn to use it lightly it works great and saves money.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>So happy this type of razor is available again.</li>
            <li>It provides a smooth shave that anyone would be proud of.</li>
            <li>Blades were real cheaply made razor</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy, well-built, well-crafted, works great, and the shave is close and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Works great but the blades it comes worh are cheap</li>
            <li>The razor blades themselves were still of good quality, but I can&#x27;t recommend buying this without being able to pick up the box.  </li>
            <li>If you can pick it up, you can make sure you buy the good one.</li>
            <li>Spend alittle more and get a good razor.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to this method of shaving, get a nice mug soap brush with badger bristles and go all the way with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, he is contemplating getting another safety razor, so he liked the shave while it lasted...</li>
            <li>my husband and I both use this (each have our own).</li>
            <li>and it did a nice job.</li>
            <li>I am loving this razor.</li>
            <li>IF you do good prep (shaving lather made with a brush from shaving soap or shaving cream, and not canned foam) and try a variety of brands of blades to see which one(s) work for you---and this razor works best with a sharper blade, like a Feather, Astra Superior Platinum, Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock SharpEdge, Voskhod, Personna Lab Blue, or the like.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this kind of razor for awhile just never did.</li>
            <li>The razor seems to have nice weight and length.</li>
            <li>was nice.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine gave me a nice shaving kit made by The Art of Shaving</li>
            <li>Nice close shave.</li>
            <li>My granddad used this kind of razor and he nicked himself a lot -</li>
            <li>A multi blade razor, (with a nice longer handle on it)</li>
            <li>If I liked it I planned to buy an antique quality one and keep this as a back-up.  </li>
            <li>Nice item, well built.</li>
            <li>I liked the razor for about a month after which it started to fall apart.  </li>
            <li>Very practical and a great gift!</li>
            <li>the cost is everything but not with how they work, the cost is weight, quality and build which this one is nice for its price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone wanting a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I put the Dorco blade in a Vanderhagen safety razor I own, and had NO problems.  </li>
            <li>Kind of defeats the purpose.  </li>
            <li>recommend to anyone who wants that wonderful close shave.</li>
            <li>Nice Razor.  </li>
            <li>Item not as nice as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>mom, being the kind hearted person she is, ordered this razor for me after I mentioned wanting to try it.  </li>
            <li>would have liked the handle to be a bit longer, but after shaving with it 3 times It felt nice, so  </li>
            <li>Handle is nice but the blades are what make a razor.</li>
            <li>To each his own, I guess.  </li>
            <li>cut the skin nicely.  </li>
            <li>That was all user error to be honest.</li>
            <li>can get the smoothest, best shaves you ever had from a DE straight razor.</li>
            <li>One video recommended going over your face three times which is kind of a pain in the ass</li>
            <li>Order this product and use it at your own risk.  </li>
            <li>He was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>Nice razor.</li>
            <li>Rick must be making a boatload on the product endorsements, but it actually is a nice DE razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy, well-built, has a nice finish, and provides a reliable shave.&lt;br /&gt;Tried ordering a couple of these from a popular online auction site, and got bit</li>
            <li>Nice it has the stand too.</li>
            <li>It looks nice sitting on the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>I tried it and although using it effectively took some finesse</li>
            <li>Nicely made.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to spend money on fancy handles and more blades just to get a good shave</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice to have a razor that the refill blades are affordable.</li>
            <li>Place your razor in the warm water to heat the blade.</li>
            <li>nice tips on shaving techniques providing in brochure</li>
            <li>and I wish they had been honest with me while I still had the packaging.</li>
            <li>The stand that comes with this is also nice to keep the razor on beside the sink.</li>
            <li>I use to own one years ago and then everybody went to plastic razors.</li>
            <li>This type is much more superior</li>
            <li>......has a nice stand with it....</li>
            <li>Cleaning was fast and that is the best part of all.</li>
            <li>Honestly speaking.</li>
            <li>Its a nice looking razor</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as nice as the advertised pitch</li>
            <li>Boy, is this nice.  </li>
            <li>this razor was awesome and very affordable to use</li>
            <li>Good quality build, and extremely cheap!</li>
            <li>Safety Razors are the Best Way to get a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li>it worked great - he loved it - due to cheap manufacturing it broke after 6 months!!!!  </li>
            <li>I have been wanting to try a classic razor and this one works great!</li>
            <li>Used one years ago they are easier to clean then multi blade razors great to get a close shave again.</li>
            <li>has a decent weight to it.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy I decided to try it out.</li>
            <li>I get a great, clean shave from this system.</li>
            <li>However, the included Dorcos may not have the best rep, but i used them and received a decent shave.</li>
            <li>Best shave that I had in many years, still using my first blade.</li>
            <li>This is a decent razor at best.</li>
            <li>Very good saved me 40.00 the first month.  </li>
            <li>first time i used it i took  my time and got very good shave, i see people saying they got cut its not a safety razor</li>
            <li>This a great razor, for those who complain about it don&#x27;t know the true art of shaving.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a close smooth shave that he&#x27;s thrilled with!</li>
            <li>It is a great gift for $20, comes in a cool gift box.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am very satisfied with this razor and would recommend it to anyone looking for a better shave experience.  </li>
            <li>the face with warm water, make sure your face is feeling warm.</li>
            <li>Although some reviews said it was easier to cut yourself, he was careful and had no issues - happy husband, happy wife!</li>
            <li>this saved me lots of money on shaving, way better then those 14 dollar blade razors, i downsized and love the savings, and yes it shaves really good</li>
            <li>My husband has been looking for a good straight razor and this one is great.  </li>
            <li>but many more shaves for the price!</li>
            <li>I was excited to get what I believed would be the instrument for a very good, close, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Looks nice but very cheap.</li>
            <li>Very Good, Thanks....</li>
            <li>It good, i use it and leaves my face smooth, very easy to change blades.</li>
            <li>Personally I absolutely loved it the very first time using it!</li>
            <li>Be sure to warm the area with water and shaving foam or soap before use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure how to use it effectively.</li>
            <li>I use Derby Blades in mine with good results for cheap.</li>
            <li>The product is amazzzzing by far the best cleanest shave I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Junk at best do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>So every couple days I can have a fresh blade that and great shave!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good buy for cheap alternative.</li>
            <li>The price Amazon is charging for these is good, and they are the genuine article.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>It is the best razor by far.  </li>
            <li>Good razor leaves skin smooth used mine for 7 months before it fell apart</li>
            <li>This razor will pay for it&#x27;s self in a couple months with how cheap the blades are and the shave is just as good.</li>
            <li>the old fashion razor is one of the best and most economical razors out there from the best shave to the easiest to clean.</li>
            <li>Great shave right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>Not quite as good as the Gillette Proglide, but value wise, it does a pretty good job of getting a close smooth shave at a much more affordable cost.</li>
            <li>I love this razor, works well, easy to clean, and best of all, cheap to use.</li>
            <li>razor-- and good is always better than fine.</li>
            <li>wish it worked out better as it sure would have been cost effective.</li>
            <li>They may offer close shaves, but when trimming around beards they can&#x27;t get a good clean edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 40 years old and have always used the latest and greatest razor.  </li>
            <li>good:&lt;br /&gt;It gives a good clean shave.  </li>
            <li>it took a few times to not cut myself up, but once you get used to it, it&#x27;s a great deal and a great razor !</li>
            <li>Great razor easy to clean</li>
            <li>Love it, works well, is light weight and does a good job.</li>
            <li>He says it is a good clean shave.</li>
            <li>I am somewhat surprised, because I have always been  perfectly well satisfied with your merchandise.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t ready to invest a significant portion of time buying the blades online or shopping around for the best price</li>
            <li>Great gateway razor to the Merkur- much higher quality.  </li>
            <li>Great deal and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Worked great at first.</li>
            <li>because let&#x27;s face it, if it&#x27;s too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
            <li>$15 seemed to good to be true</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad shave, just not as good as the disposable ones.</li>
            <li>I knew the price is too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Great shave, clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll do fine!</li>
            <li>Razor VERY cheap.</li>
            <li>Very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Very cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li>Hubby was happy that I was able to find this shaver at Amazon at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Razor seems very cheaply made .</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made, but</li>
            <li>It is VERY cheaply built.</li>
            <li>He gets a very smooth shave and says it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; when his hair is a bit longer like the multi-blade razors did.</li>
            <li>It is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>The shave was very smooth compared to the multi-blade razors I had been using.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t order this unless you have a very very light beard.</li>
            <li>I tried this updated classic razor and I have to say it provides the best and most comfortable shave of all my razors</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been interested in making the switch to a safety razor like this for a while, and this was a great way to give it a shot without investing a lot of money (many safety razors like this style start out at fifty bucks and go up from there).</li>
            <li>, i even ordered the brush and soap, for hot lather shave, im happy :)</li>
            <li>This razor is nicely balanced and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The razor was adequate, good buy for the price of razor blades.</li>
            <li>I loved safety razors for years and have missed them on super market shelves.</li>
            <li>Good unit Classic look!!!</li>
            <li>Quality of the razor is fine; reminds my husband of his own father&#x27;s razor.</li>
            <li>it works but its very light, which isn&#x27;t the greatest thing in a double edge.</li>
            <li>great product razor is very high quality shipping was faster than another site I sometimes use.</li>
            <li>this is ok shave really&lt;</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>in all I consider this much better than the supermarket razors.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m still impressed with the build.  </li>
            <li>Great price, fast delivery</li>
            <li>Satisfied with razor after using a couple of times.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li>Sincerely Michael Pisano</li>
            <li>Go with the van de hagan, better quality</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li>The razor is okay.</li>
            <li>So the &amp;#34;supplied&amp;#34; blades may seem flimsy, but they work better for me.</li>
            <li>I do not think he will use it more than once.  </li>
            <li>He shaved against the grain without adding more shaving cream.</li>
            <li>If you think your getting a top dollar razor here think again.</li>
            <li>the more blades the more you pay.</li>
            <li>This razor is the best I bought this Asa present</li>
            <li>I thought this razor would be like buying a better mouse trap.  </li>
            <li>Did not work as stated, I&#x27;m using a three blade disposable and it works way better.</li>
            <li>So glad I found this razor.</li>
            <li>So much better than throw away razors.</li>
            <li>love it....</li>
            <li>and it just seems more sanitary than the junk that gets stuck in multiblade razors.</li>
            <li>That is what I started shaving with many years ago.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, there are MUCH better razors for the novice.</li>
            <li>Would purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li>It is either a piece of junk, or maybe I could try better blades.</li>
            <li>I just tried again to make sure.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a fancy one then spend more</li>
            <li>The safety ravor is a lot better.</li>
            <li>Thought the shaver would be a better quality metal.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Smooth shave!</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>While I used to love this razor, it has now stopped opening and closing with ease.</li>
            <li>till you die or see if grandpa has one you can steal and send out to a reputable refinisher .</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed this razor.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to the savings and enjoyably close shaves.</li>
            <li>fast shipping great razor</li>
            <li>It shaves ok once you get use to it.</li>
            <li>Now I am dismayed because I think he is fleecing too many people.</li>
            <li>the famous person on the package led me to believe.</li>
            <li>Excellent Service Will Be Back Again.</li>
            <li>it went away for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This does not work as well as my mach 3 razor, I have been shaving for twenty five years and this razor works but does require more effort and time to work, I also get a closer shave with my mach3 razor.</li>
            <li>Why would they be any better today.</li>
            <li>Outstanding razor.</li>
            <li>It seemed the more blades they added, the faster the razor clogged up.</li>
            <li>Can any one explain why a razor requires more than one blade?.</li>
            <li>It started out awesome but after a month the handle broke, not allowing me to open our close the head fully to change the blades or shave.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving for more than 40 years.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s come out fantastic every time!  </li>
            <li>There are many options for shave soap &amp; brushes, I recommend experimenting and trying out various options to see what works best for you.</li>
            <li>product is ok , just not for me.</li>
            <li>Have to say I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Most of us learned how to shave with razors with pivoting heads/blades.  </li>
            <li>You do not need more than one blade to shave with.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off buying disposables</li>
            <li>not does it get the job done any better on the curves of your face, like around ones chin.  </li>
            <li>Probably has more to do with my R.A.D.  </li>
            <li>hope it is better.</li>
            <li>I have one &amp; love it.  </li>
            <li>YOU MAY HAVE BETTER</li>
            <li>It words OK</li>
            <li>Never will I miss my mach 3 and glad I set my son on path to much better shaving experience than I had.</li>
            <li>If you look for an instructional video then you&#x27;ll understand and you will love the razor.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I took the leap to try it.  </li>
            <li>They are much better quality construction.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My cheapness turned out to cost me more in the end.</li>
            <li>It does not compare to shaving with the Gillette Pro Fusion that I had come to love.</li>
            <li>I got so many cuts on my face after 3 stokes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I bought this razor.</li>
            <li>look for better quality.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have had the razor for about a month and love it.</li>
            <li>Spend a couple dollars more get a Parker.</li>
            <li>Better shave then multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li>It would be easier to manipulate around the face, making for a better experience.</li>
            <li>LOVE it :)</li>
            <li>Okay for a starter razor, but I&#x27;ve had it six months and the butterfly hinge has rusted shut.</li>
            <li>DE safety razors seem to be more of a luxury in today&#x27;s standars.  </li>
            <li>I love the shave this razor provides</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to get.  </li>
            <li>thanks to micro touch razor , rick harrison and alway&#x27;s great amazon</li>
            <li>I know that binding arbitration has an overwhelming preference for the company NOT the &#x27;injured&#x27; consumer</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this thinking you no longer need the more tech type shavers.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I watch my father shave with type of razor for most his of life.</li>
            <li>I love the Safety Razor, but the &#x27;supplied with it</li>
            <li>Would be better for men</li>
            <li>I have, like many guys out there, become feed up with the price of razor blades ($30 or more for 5 cartridges? -</li>
            <li>I have used mostly Gillette, Attra, etc.most of my life</li>
            <li>and I even purchased the better blades</li>
            <li>I used to always get ingrown hairs and razor bumps and now since i&#x27;ve started using this shaving method my skin on my face is much better.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s because of a shaved hair getting caught under the skin because you&#x27;re shaving more than hair off.  </li>
            <li>I replaced it with a Merkur which didn&#x27;t cost that much more</li>
            <li>, I came to Amazon and found one :)</li>
            <li>However, the blades did cost more.  </li>
            <li>You will love this razor.</li>
            <li>Fells cheap!</li>
            <li>I LOVE MINE.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>It may be acceptable to some men, but others will not be satisfied with the closeness of the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its ok</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for a one day but not for more than two days.</li>
            <li>I think this was the best idea to come back into marketing</li>
            <li>you will get better item</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy again,  great product!</li>
            <li>absolutely love the product.  </li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>Even Parkers are better than this.</li>
            <li>my girl wants one now for her legs lol.</li>
            <li>Had one many years ago, did not know that they were still around.</li>
            <li>More on that point in a moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I should have known better than to trust something a cheezy Pawn Shop guy claims.</li>
            <li>Safety razors are the best shave possible.</li>
            <li>Sure, its not a $35 EJ or a $40 Merkur.</li>
            <li>suggest getting better blades; my preference is Feather or Merkur.</li>
            <li>Way better shave than the Lords, Concords, Astras, and Sharks I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>So my journey towards a better shaving experience began.  </li>
            <li>So many razor cuts had my head looking a crime scene.</li>
            <li>Take my advise and buy the more expense blades.</li>
            <li>Definitely not the best shave</li>
            <li>This type of razor requires a different style of shaving, I found some excellent tutorials on google, and when done correctly is the closest shave I have</li>
            <li>his favorite gift</li>
            <li>I just got this razor as a gift works better then</li>
            <li>It delivers an excellent shave when used with the proper touch.  </li>
            <li>but the blades need to be sharper,going with Wilkinson blades when i need more</li>
            <li>I think the stand is cute.</li>
            <li>This Razor is top of the line.</li>
            <li>I am going to purchase a better one now on Amazon.</li>
            <li>great buy and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure, and that might affect the quality of the shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure with more practice</li>
            <li>I will have a better quality shave, and my time frame will shorten also.</li>
            <li>The Lord Premium Safety Razor Model LP1822L was better than this razor.</li>
            <li>My wife also enjoyed it since i was shaving almost every morning because of how well I thought it worked.</li>
            <li>I have used a Gillette Mach 3 for about 10 years and love it.  </li>
            <li>Take your time and learn proper techniques and you will achieve the best shave of your life.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this.  </li>
            <li>I will try some better blades when these run out</li>
            <li>Much better.</li>
            <li>This one blade is better than any shave I ever gotten from the Gillette Fusion blades I used for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this razor....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 20 years with cartridge razors and like most men</li>
            <li>After using for approx 15-20 shaves I love it.</li>
            <li>Also get yourself a variety pack of blades here on Amazon, not all blades are created equal and you&#x27;ll end up finding the brand that works best for you.</li>
            <li>Since they have no swiveling or tilting head you will need to learn to hold the razor at the proper angle that is best for your type of beard thru out the stroke.</li>
            <li>Razor was ok but the blades that came with it did not do the job, according to my husband.</li>
            <li>Love this razor.</li>
            <li>Just like the one I learned on many years ago.</li>
            <li>Hubby loves this, says one of his favorite gifts ever.</li>
            <li>I tried several times shaving with the razor and found that it does not produce a close shave without irritation, even though I used the best shaving soaps that were recommended.</li>
            <li>Many cheaper alternatives on amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>packaged razors performed underwhelmingly, I had better luck with others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I bought a MERKUR Bakelite which I love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
            <li>but I got used to it and its my favorite blade ever...</li>
            <li>it is okay</li>
            <li>I think I get a better shave with the multi blade and my electric.  </li>
            <li>Causes razor burn, better to get a multi blade</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>And best of all, the blades last and are a lot cheaper than multi blade</li>
            <li>twisting the handle stem opens top for razor replacement.</li>
            <li>but it was a breeze to use and does a fantastic job!</li>
            <li>and I think most of criticisms Ive seen are from people who are not used to using this type of a razor.</li>
            <li>Then the companies started telling me the more blades the better.  </li>
            <li>I also have more money to  spend on things besides razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;Bought</li>
            <li>I am sure that mineral oil would work just as well for preventing oxidation of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You will be glad you did.</li>
            <li>Never got a shave I was satisfied with and it felt clunky.</li>
            <li>Way better then crappy multiblades...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 99% sure he does not shave his head with this product.</li>
            <li>Face shaves ok.</li>
            <li>This ok.</li>
            <li>WOULD make a lot better.</li>
            <li>so many years wasting money on razors</li>
            <li>Looks appealing, but doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; it.</li>
            <li>To get a closer shave you may have to apply more pressure to the blade, risking a cut.</li>
            <li>Be prepared t buy better blades, I prefer Wilkinson</li>
            <li>The razor is ok, needs a better blade for better satisfaction</li>
            <li>I will look for some better blades--</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Learned real quick, now I love it.</li>
            <li>Nothing more.  </li>
            <li>My husband and son love this product.  </li>
            <li>TALKING ABOUT A SMOOTH SHAVE!</li>
            <li>How anyone could give this more than two stars, I do not know.</li>
            <li>could have gotten a better shave with my pocket knife.</li>
            <li>I will buy better blades and keep the razor.  </li>
            <li>5 blades is better.</li>
            <li>I will look for a better quality one.</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t listen to the nay sayers.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>It has saved me hundreds of dollars on blades, and provides a nice, smooth, close shave.</li>
            <li>One blade is definitely better than 3.</li>
            <li>but glad I tried it</li>
            <li>Having the blade warm is a huge part of getting a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received it as a gift and wanted it as an inexpensive way to try shaving with a safety razor before spending a lot of money on a more upscale model.</li>
            <li>Grandson&#x27;s love the razors.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I needed more practice.</li>
            <li>I picked it up on a clearance and love it.  </li>
            <li>this is night and day better.</li>
            <li>no turning back after realizing this is the best shaving method ive ever found.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>and it did a much better job.</li>
            <li>but I could shave better with a butter knife.</li>
            <li>On top of that, the shave takes triple the amount of time.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find a better deal and no you don&#x27;t need a razor with 4 or 5 blades.</li>
            <li>Great product, and work very well</li>
            <li>The razor is a lower end for safety razors but still better than cartridges.</li>
            <li>Every man should be able to shave without a mirror.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Mach 3 for many years now</li>
            <li>You can get there in Microtouch, eventually, and with a lot more fussing around and discomfort; if you&#x27;re into that, then the Microtouch is the razor for you.</li>
            <li>My legs look and feel healthy.  </li>
            <li>Great shave fast shipping</li>
            <li>3 blades, 4 blade, 5 blades, this one shaves better than anyone of those.</li>
            <li>Bought for my dad and he really like it, says it works great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, today, I tried it again, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>It might get better as my face gets used to it.  </li>
            <li>I have never been happy with the throw away razors both the shave and having so much material to throw out.</li>
            <li>Get the better blades.</li>
            <li>If you want a better shave with it go out and get some Feather blades to go alone with it.</li>
            <li>But the most dissatisfying issue with this product is the &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; factor.</li>
            <li>the more sevre the cut.</li>
            <li>And I had hoped I&#x27;d get a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I love the close shave.</li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Will surely take some getting used to.4th shave and still workin at it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>So glad I grabbed this for a Father&#x27;s Day gift....</li>
            <li>It is everything and more than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I then when to Dollar Shave club and got their top of the line for $9 shipped to my door.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You would be better off trying to shave with a plastic spoon than with the one razor.</li>
            <li>its okay.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>I have used disposables that work much better.</li>
            <li>I like it, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s more of a involved process he uses it at home and a disposable at work.</li>
            <li>got the Microtouch today from their website, so I was able to get the case with mirror.</li>
            <li>The razor works better</li>
            <li>So smooth!</li>
            <li>I bought some Feathers and like them a lot more.  </li>
            <li>I also bought the Edwin Jagger DE89 for like 13 dollars more than I paid for this one</li>
            <li>I like the 3 piece way better than the butterfly.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied with product quality and delivery.</li>
            <li>Worked ok while it did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m opting to go with a better made safety razor.</li>
            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>More, you CANNOT return it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>ok if you want to shave twice in the morning.</li>
            <li>then the many challenges I had at the beginning disappeared.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get  a close and confortable shave without nicks or scrapes moving forward.  </li>
            <li>My dad is in love with this thing.  </li>
            <li>I learned to shave with a razor like this many years ago.</li>
            <li>Best Christmas present ever!  </li>
            <li>Better than the disposables I&#x27;ve been using.  </li>
            <li>, found it at a much better price and bought it.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>I have never had a better shave with any razor.  </li>
            <li>Get the Feather Safety Razor; it is outstanding</li>
            <li>He said this razor gives a better result them any razor he has bought to date</li>
            <li>We both love the fact that it is a hell of a lot cheaper to get the blades</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>like it, don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>The blades can easily be swapped out with a very easy twist design for the top.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not easily giving up, I pursued my quest for a perfect shave and found it in purchasing the Merkur 34C which is quality built with a good weight and has a slight 30 degree angle and feels like a feather crossing your face and gives the closest shave that I have ever experienced.  </li>
            <li>Get a good safety razor and your in right.  </li>
            <li>Right out of the box it shaves good.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get an excellent shave that is as good or better than what I have been getting the past 5 years.</li>
            <li>Tried it out today and was very excited.</li>
            <li>Nice to return to the original again.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>They are far superior!</li>
            <li>Nice clean cut.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While this is a decent entry level DE razor, I would not recommend it for an experienced DE shaver.</li>
            <li>Good product and in the long run a great value.</li>
            <li>So great, I was nervous about getting him something like this because men are so particular about these types of things...</li>
            <li>The design is makes it very easy to use and to change and secure blades.  </li>
            <li>Good solid construction, smooth opening and closing, a handy storage stand and a good, close shave.</li>
            <li>If these razors were so great, then they wouldn&#x27;t have invented something new, and subsequently BETTER.</li>
            <li>old school Razor work super great!!</li>
            <li>It does give a very clean shave, after my cuts heal up I have to get used to using it,but</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is a great buy, however read up on how to shave and the other products needed to successfully shave with the micro touch.  </li>
            <li>I was speculative at first, but after a couple weeks, it shaves just as good as my 5 blade</li>
            <li>I would say the Parker 24C is slightly more comfortable and more efficient than the Edwin Jagger, but both are MUCH better than this razor.</li>
            <li>For $20 this is a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>I loved the razor at first.  </li>
            <li>Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li>The best shave I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li>and it sliced up my face pretty good,</li>
            <li>Best buy in a long time!</li>
            <li>The finish of the micro touch is of course brand new, and it&#x27;s an attractive unit.</li>
            <li>Looks ok but easy to use.</li>
            <li>: It gives a VERY mild shave and you will not experience the type of closeness that a more aggressive DE razor can deliver.</li>
            <li>Easy to use safely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it is is economical and effective.</li>
            <li>Good solid razor but does not give a good shave.  </li>
            <li>Take it from an old hand with these type of razors, get yourself a good badger hair brush and a nicely scented cake soap.</li>
            <li>Love it, gives a better shave than a 4blade disposable,  refill blades are cheap .</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Great razor for the price perfect for any one that wants an entry level safety razor but the blades could be a little better getting</li>
            <li>it came with extra blades which is so nice for this package,,and ,,i am very happy with what i got and how fast it arrived here to me,,very pleased..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely a fine razor, and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Yes, there is a certain old-timey romance in using an all-steel razor, but it doesn&#x27;t translate into a superior shave in my experience.</li>
            <li>nice looking product, highly polished chrome with a nice soild weight to it.  </li>
            <li>Love it, works fantastic and is way cheeper than store bought blades</li>
            <li>really glad I did give it a shot, this safety razor is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Whether you approach &amp;#34;DE&amp;#34; shaving to save money, or become a true devotee that spends many times the cost of the Micro Touch a year, it can and does (for me) bring many moments of enjoyment.</li>
            <li>(the multi-blades seem to move more smoothly over the face).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>On my first shave, I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>I have tried all the razors out there and this one by far does the job every time at a great price.  </li>
            <li>So far really happy with it.</li>
            <li>and I am happy with it so far..</li>
            <li>Ever looking for the safest and most comfortable way to shave, I ordered a Microtouch One razor when I saw it advertised on TV.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it does a great job for me.</li>
            <li>A great investment over the old disposable.</li>
            <li>I was able to get a free sample of the 5 blade razor called Hydro  when I bought Edge shaving  </li>
            <li>Great to shave with just like old times</li>
            <li>what I wanted works good, thanks</li>
            <li>The handle is very durable and the razors provide a good close shave.</li>
            <li>Fair, but you really shouldn&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li>I had forgotten what a good shave really is.</li>
            <li>seems like a good shave when a person gets used to how much pressure one puts on the blade when closing the handle.</li>
            <li>I loved this package so much</li>
            <li>I was able to shave much more quickly and &amp;#34;carelessly&amp;#34; with this razor.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;it&#x27;s very important to have a clean shaver at all times.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this razor because it is the right size and the “heft” is nice.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a safety razor and read around for shaving suggestions, a lot of being successful in not cutting yourself must come from proper preparation and use of good shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>Overall good product!</li>
            <li>This is not like other \\&quot;celebrity\\&quot; endorsed products, this one really is as awesome as it&#x27;s claimed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He did buy other blades to test out what he likes best</li>
            <li>All in all, not a bad deal for around $20!</li>
            <li>Not a bad razor!</li>
            <li>Honestly not bad!  </li>
            <li>The cleanup is so easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and all as promised.</li>
            <li>It also, always makes me happy when I can get a better price, than at the local Wal....</li>
            <li>Easily nicks your fave.  </li>
            <li>Definitely more economical than cartridge razors, and a better shave I my opinion.</li>
            <li>The stand is a simple but elegant design and works great.</li>
            <li>Device is heavier than I am used to, but I will easily adapt.</li>
            <li>REALLY EASY TO USE AND MAINTAIN.</li>
            <li>However the unit does work as advertised, it shaves close and is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The razor provides an easy way to remove the grubby unshaven look that surfaced in the fashion magazines.</li>
            <li>The double edge razor is a great way to shave but spend the money on a top of the line</li>
            <li>only is it a great shave, it is somehow much more pleasing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very mild cut.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to grab a sampler of different blades from Amazon just to see if there are any that work better for me, but the Dorcos that came with mine already work great.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor for my husband, who has a stubborn beard that easily clogs multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li>I also love how easy it is to clean.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>weighted well, the blades are easy to replace and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Product works well, easy to use and keep clean and for the money I love it.</li>
            <li>It rinses easily.</li>
            <li>Blades are inexpensive and easy to find.  </li>
            <li>I love a clean razor shave.  </li>
            <li>Easy to nick  your skin.</li>
            <li>and it still going strong (shaving 1 to 2 times a day, depending).</li>
            <li>But, the ones I used worked and they were strong and sturdy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fourth, the razor grip is good, and the handle mechanism twists open nicely for cleaning and replacing blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>please do not buy this product, I strongly recommend against it.</li>
            <li>It was described as a good beginner safety razor, with decent weight and quality to it.</li>
            <li>Nice shave, I like that you can change the blades very fast</li>
            <li>The angle is not right for the best shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a different shaving experience, so don&#x27;t expect your best shave right away, you need to get used to the feel of it.</li>
            <li>Impressive is the only word I can use to describe the performance of this entry-level, budget razor once I found the right angle of attack for the blade.</li>
            <li>Find the right Blade for your skin type and learn the proper method for the best shave ever!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice gift for someone who might be willing to make the switch over from cartridges)</li>
            <li>This was my first DE razor and I do kind of regret the purchase.  </li>
            <li>Not bad I think most of the problems people are having is the blades that came with</li>
            <li>I purchased this razor to replace those 4 blade junk razors and it works like a charm, I wanted a small one to travel with and this is a nice one, the weight is nice and the handle is pleasant to hold on to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now however, the new razors have a pivoting head and does not require you to adjust the blade to get good shave.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the new razors</li>
            <li>I can live with that because I plan on sticking with this type of shaving now that I know that it is superior to the cartridge razors.</li>
            <li>Hi the product is fine.</li>
            <li>Mine works fine and has for a year now.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t throw it around or use it to pound nails into the wall and it will work fine.</li>
            <li>Worked fine for a couple months</li>
            <li>Let the weight of the razor pull and you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li>The razor in itself is fine.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>The shave with the Dorco blades were fine.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine for about a week</li>
            <li>Works just fine.</li>
            <li>IF you know how to use a safety razor then you should be fine.</li>
            <li>Worked fine for one month.</li>
            <li>and you will be fine.</li>
            <li>I did just fine.  </li>
            <li>My brother says the shaver itself is fine</li>
            <li>I guess its fine but to me it takes longer and shave is not as close as multi blade razors</li>
            <li>ago)&lt;br /&gt;But once you learn  or relearn it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fine DE safety razor.</li>
            <li>the razor works fine and the addition of the stand was an additional bonus....</li>
            <li>The razor is fine, but the blades need improving.  </li>
            <li>seems work fine</li>
            <li>Once I figured that out I was fine with it.</li>
            <li>Will like it fine once I get use to it.</li>
            <li>It gave me a super close shave, better than multi blade razors.</li>
            <li>If you are in a hurry, I suggest your favorite disposable (I use them when I must shave quickly).  </li>
            <li>It must work better on bold heads.</li>
            <li>I love this Classic shaver!!!  </li>
            <li>The one is light weight which makes it ideal for anyone interested in DE shaving but are intimidated by old school shaving.</li>
            <li>Anyone that says this old single-blade &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; razor will give you a shave as good as a multi-blade razor is full of baloney!</li>
            <li>Awesome if you want a new age old school razor</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, easy to replace blades.  </li>
            <li>I do plan to eventually upgrade to a more aggressive safety razor, but I feel this was an excellent starting point while I learned the new techniques.  </li>
            <li>Maybe for guys (and dolls) that have light &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; hairs/beard, it may work fine.</li>
            <li>The four or five blade cartridges are just fine and cheap.</li>
            <li>Love the old razor, Shaving made easy nice close shaves</li>
            <li>If you really want to be kind to your face and if you are finished with razor bumps and ingrown hairs then try this razor, you&#x27;ll have the desired shave and the smooth skin you want.  </li>
            <li>Cheap cheap cheap.</li>
            <li>I got a huge divot in my lip to remember this</li>
            <li>So I bought FOUR MICRO TOUCH ONE razors because their was a huge sale going on</li>
            <li>, I personally enjoy something with a longer shaft on it.  </li>
            <li>Cheap quality.</li>
            <li>It is very well built and holds up nicely.</li>
            <li>fast shipping nice gift</li>
            <li>Smooth shave</li>
            <li>Yep it is cheap and it works.</li>
            <li>This is a Weishi and it won&#x27;t be as pain free as a EJ or Merkur starter line.</li>
            <li>However, I found I liked it very much, so much, that I bought my wife one for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>This is a cheap razor.</li>
            <li>I like how easy it is to clean</li>
            <li>that was easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t get through the free blades before this thing rusts shut.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>buy the smooth sales pitch from Mr. Harrison.</li>
            <li>The wife says my face is as smooth as baby&#x27;s butt..</li>
            <li>They were cheap, dependable, and required no maintenance.  </li>
            <li>Easy to keep clean</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of cheap pot metal.</li>
            <li>I enjoy shaving</li>
            <li>Even if it didn&#x27;t work the joy he receive from the memories it brought up would be reason enough to buy again.</li>
            <li>It shaves smoothly, but that&#x27;s nothing to brag about.</li>
            <li>His face is so smooth after his shave no razor bumps,</li>
            <li>It gave me a smooth, close shave with no bumps.  </li>
            <li>I figured it is cheap</li>
            <li>/&gt;Learn from my mistake, don&#x27;t cheap out.</li>
            <li>The gillette opens and shuts like a well oiled machine and blades fit like a glove.</li>
            <li>But I did enjoy the way it shaved.  </li>
            <li>It does what is supposed to do and is a huge improvement over the cheap inefficient plastic razors men have been brainwashed to buy since the 70&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>razor is all metal, and feels comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>the price Husband was tried of cheap razors and some were pricy .He</li>
            <li>It worked well for about 2 months, then the razor stopped opening smoothly and I ended up breaking the actuating pin inside the razor.</li>
            <li>I applied light machine oil to all moving parts hoping to cure the problem.</li>
            <li>This is a great shaver as the double edge versions go</li>
            <li>the wife was so amazed how well it work and easy to clean</li>
            <li>product itself is all metal and weighty but feels like a cheap mass produced item from China (which it is) but expectable at this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Metal was cheap.</li>
            <li>It gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Should have known from the cheap paper razors they send it with.</li>
            <li>Shaver functions smoothly.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Hay, guys, buy this for a great shave &amp; yes only 1 blade.</li>
            <li>If you want a light and semi-decent razor then this is the one.</li>
            <li>There is a reason the micro touch razor is cheap.</li>
            <li>No razor burn and glides smooth with a close shave.</li>
            <li>If the only option I had was to not shave, or shave with these, I would be happy to shave with these.</li>
            <li>My face is smooth with no nicks or cuts.  </li>
            <li>It works great and will probably last another lifetime or two.</li>
            <li>I enjoy shaving with it</li>
            <li>If you currently use the multi-blade razors and are happy with those, this may not appeal to you.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have bought this from Amazon then it would be a hassle free return.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to clean and feels like a quality product.</li>
            <li>Cheap made in china...</li>
            <li>CHEAP CHEAP</li>
            <li>Only used once but seems to be a great razor.</li>
            <li>Use the BIC cheap razors instead.</li>
            <li>Go with bic cheap razors instead folks..</li>
            <li>but I really enjoy shaving now.</li>
            <li>And for a product that should be  readily available, it took all 6 weeks stated for mine to be delivered.  </li>
            <li>It gives a smooth shave and unless you&#x27;re Michael J. Fox, you shouldn&#x27;t suffer any nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>My face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s keister.  </li>
            <li>but I enjoy shaving now.</li>
            <li>Some reviews make it sound like you have to learn how to shave all over again</li>
            <li>This razor is too light weight and</li>
            <li>how easy it is to clean.</li>
            <li>While everyone&#x27;s face and beard growth/density is different, this works great for me.  </li>
            <li>Appears to be cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>He seems to really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I had forgot how great shaving with a double edge safety razor was.</li>
            <li>Then I heard about the Microtouch One and bought it as soon as it was available at Showcase.  </li>
            <li>Cheap blades lasted two shaves.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable handling.</li>
            <li>but today&#x27;s razors are safer and &amp;#34;blood&amp;#34; free....</li>
            <li>Really fit in with today&#x27;s situation of saving money.</li>
            <li>Love it worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I light andgives a smooth shave</li>
            <li>Great starting razor.  </li>
            <li>Nice safety razor but does not give a very close shave.</li>
            <li>The razor is cheaply made, scratches your face, and has a tendency to cut you.</li>
            <li>What you see today are Chinese-made with cheap materials.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this razor to my friends if they want a close, smooth, and scar free shave.</li>
            <li>The construction is cheap.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>One recomendation, don&#x27;t skimp and buy the cheap blades.</li>
            <li>Gets the job done and has your face feeling smooth as a fishes belly with in minutes.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone wanting a smooth close shave.</li>
            <li>Face is smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li>It is cheaply made and the opening-closing mechanism arrived non-operative.</li>
            <li>Precise, close shave.  </li>
            <li>it works and is gonna save us some cash since the refills are cheap as heck.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s what a smooth shave is suppose to be&amp;#34</li>
            <li>it is a scrapper and with this razor being so light the blade drags against the skin and will cause nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a great product</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s actually very well built and looks nice in its stand.</li>
            <li>but this is built well and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>So nice to get a really close shave.</li>
            <li>He is a traditionalist so he liked the idea of using a retro razor and really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li>I am still looking for that good old fashion razor.</li>
            <li>So far so good for me.</li>
            <li>A multi blade system is far superior in that sense.</li>
            <li>A multi blade system is far superior in that sense.</li>
            <li>I myself tried it because a good friend had been on a search for a better shave and he is a freakin hairy beast of a human being,  </li>
            <li>Complete Junk, Its made in China, Good Luck.</li>
            <li>This razor is a good gift idea and is a well put together complete kit.</li>
            <li>good old school razor</li>
            <li>good old fashioned razor handle needs to be longer</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the purchase of this item, very good quality, really easy to handle, good presentation and accessory to save is very good, the only thing I&#x27;m not contemto is size, as it is a bit small, and should in be a little longer, but you adapt, I recommend it 100%.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, the kit came with 24 blades and a case, which this particular package being sold on Amazon doesn&#x27;t have, but this one here does come with a nice stand, which is something I didn&#x27;t think about - a nice extra I would have liked to let the razor air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Take your time shaving and make sure you are doing so at the right angle if you&#x27;re having issues.  </li>
            <li>Like many of the other 1 star reviews it worked great for a while</li>
            <li>the whole package including 100 blades was cheaper than buying the replacement blades (5) for the razor I was using..........should have thought of this sooner....!!!</li>
            <li>IT SHAVES CLEAN AND EASY TO CLEAN THE BLADES</li>
            <li>The stand is fine if working at the sink, it would not work in the shower unless you have a special or built in shelf to support it.</li>
            <li>I like a clean smooth shave that won&#x27;t leave me with a five o&#x27;clock shadow at noon...</li>
            <li>Used like it said to and could not get a clean, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Build quality seemed decent, but weight was kind of lacking in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, this got me interested in DE shaving, and I ended up getting a Edwin Jagger DE89bl&#x3D;much more precise.</li>
            <li>My Husband says its a pretty good razor, he has been using it for about a month and really likes it.</li>
            <li>is well made, opens very easily and closes very well;</li>
            <li>So basically if you&#x27;re new then go for it but don&#x27;t expect to have it your entire life like some of the merkur razors out there, but it&#x27;s a perfect starter.</li>
            <li>Those new to this kind of shaving should be patient - it does take time to become comfortable with a &amp;#</li>
            <li>These razors just work and are super easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>My husband has such sensitive skin so buying him a very good razor is important!  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t cut my throat, success!</li>
            <li>OK for a first time safety razor.  </li>
            <li>I have been on the original blade now for 2 weeks</li>
            <li>worth it in the end!</li>
            <li>I use mine for the first time today and i love it..</li>
            <li>This razor is based off of the original Glilette patent.  </li>
            <li>The original S&amp;H fee was $4.99.</li>
            <li>My husband was excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li>The significant issue is the cost.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need to get familiar using the shorter handle and let the weight of the razor do the work.</li>
            <li>My first safety razor, i love it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as my original razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start by saying I have bought many items off amazon and this the first review I&#x27;ve given.</li>
            <li>This is the first review I&#x27;ve written and hopefully won&#x27;t have to do many more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My original razor I purchased fell apart.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this and was sorta excited about shaving with this style razor again.</li>
            <li>works great and hopefully saves me money in the long run.</li>
            <li>I needed to re-apply the lather after a first pass, much better with the lotion.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure that this razor is not representative of all safety razors, but this one did not do the job advertised.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to compromise quality when you purchase this wallet friendly Razor.</li>
            <li>and I was excited.</li>
            <li>Go buy a original vintage one for $20 on eBay.</li>
            <li>I originally gave this a 5 STAR review, but now after 5 months I need to change it to 1 STAR.  </li>
            <li>Certainly works better than the light multiblace disposable razors.</li>
            <li>The advantage here is a nice new razor.&lt;br /&gt;The razor would be classified as medium aggressive, meaning that it is neither aggressive or nonaggressive.</li>
            <li>I prefer my Excel for clean shave.</li>
            <li>liked the shave, but can&#x27;t open the razor any more</li>
            <li>Once you do, after 2 or 3 shaves, you&#x27;ll notice a totally clean shave.</li>
            <li>After use, I carefully clean it and put it on the stand that came with it.</li>
            <li>my job requires me to keep a totally clean shave.</li>
            <li>He uses it whenever he shaves and reports that he has a clean shaven feeling.</li>
            <li>but well made, clean, and it works.</li>
            <li>so I could clean it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and economical.</li>
            <li>Blades are super cheap, just get them from the dollar stores..</li>
            <li>that give smooth shaves but wear out quickly, and are getting way too pricey.</li>
            <li>Clean shave</li>
            <li>Especially with shark blades, they&#x27;re cheap gorgeous blades.</li>
            <li>Whenever I see someone who does that I always think, &amp;#34;Grow a beard or shave your face clean but make up your friggin&#x27; mind!&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Clean, close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li>The most important thing is not to apply much pressure and let the blade do the work.</li>
            <li>Good shave, will not be going back to cheap plastic ones in store.</li>
            <li>close and clean shave.</li>
            <li>when,i shave my neck,i have too go over,and over,and i still don&#x27;t get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>was looking forward to having a razor that would give me a clean shave.i</li>
            <li>So, save your money and buy gillette and clean the razor, or buy into the dollar shave club or use dorco&#x27;s website to buy razors.</li>
            <li>I kept the razor clean and up to that point</li>
            <li>You try and try to go over spot and doesn&#x27;t shave clean.</li>
            <li>I soaked the whole thing in wd-40 for a couple days, then was able to free it up with pliers.</li>
            <li>The blades are cheap and rust quickly.</li>
            <li>My razor centers the blades well, and rinses cleanly.</li>
            <li>Very impressed with the first shave seems closer than the overpriced 5 blade razor I previously used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still glad to own this razor, but you can purchase a vastly superior DE safety razor for mere dollars more.</li>
            <li>I loved the first one, that my wife bought for me at Wal-Mart, the razor was heavy and as good as razors costing more than twice as much.  </li>
            <li>: )t certainly  </li>
            <li>special deal.</li>
            <li>They had a special going on where you got the razor and 24 blades for $19.99.  </li>
            <li>Wanted to try an old-school safety razor and this one looked decent compared to some of the cheap ones without spending a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Well made and works much better than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>Great razor - my husband loves it so much better than the multi blade razors that cost a small forture to buy blades for it.</li>
            <li>The boar brush and wet shave is great.</li>
            <li>I finally got a genuine Micro Touch One and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I love the thought of using antiques and have used a true straight razor before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shaves pretty close, very cost effective.</li>
            <li>My hair is very coarse so waxing isn&#x27;t a good option for me either.  </li>
            <li>Frankly, with the use of this razor, I no longer get &#x27;stressed&#x27; at the thought of someone touching my face...which makes me very</li>
            <li>I think its got a cool retro vibe also</li>
            <li>it looks good but just don&#x27;t work for me,so will have to look for a larger razor</li>
            <li>Feels like it should last for a good while.</li>
            <li>When you really think about it who the heck even needs more than one blade.</li>
            <li>Which is much more cheaper then the modern multi-blade cartridge razors.</li>
            <li>The end result is once you try a good saftey razor you won&#x27;t go back to cartridges.  </li>
            <li>Overall good shaving tool.  </li>
            <li>5 stars are not enough, this razor is better then I expected, and everybody should buy one, and one for your best friend</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a full beard for 30 years, and since I&#x27;m not on Duck Dynasty</li>
            <li>After using this for almost a year I&#x27;m ready to upgrade to something better.</li>
            <li>or so it provided a closer shave than more modern razors.  </li>
            <li>It really does do a better job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a different style of shaving that yields a superior result.</li>
            <li>Many thanks to Amazon and to this company.</li>
            <li>I saw it advertised by the guy from Pawn Stars, and thought it was a cool looking throwback safety razor like dad</li>
            <li>For the price I thought it would be a good starting point to try one out.</li>
            <li>and it is much heavier built and works a lot better.</li>
            <li>This is a good double edge razor.</li>
            <li>pleased with it all-around for the cost</li>
            <li>Almost everything I read about it told me the same thing, that once people made the switch, almost everyone found it a much better, more comfortable way to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You need to marry this razor with proper face hydration and a good shavingsoap.  </li>
            <li>I think I made a good choice overall.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea however and found an old model Gillette made in the USA with one of those cups and brushes.</li>
            <li>The micro touch cut smooth and let your skin fresh and feeling.</li>
            <li>Have to make several passes to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>Well it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>So if you are looking for a better shave, at a much lower cost, try a safety razor.</li>
            <li>It is true &amp;#34;they don&#x27;t make&#x27;em like they used too&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>People need to understand that it take more finesse to use a DE or straight razor.</li>
            <li>and I thought it would be cool.  </li>
            <li>I shaved with the Microtouch three times (twice more than I really wanted to but wanted to give it a fair try) and finally conceded that I had been duped (ripped off).</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use the razor in an upwards motion after the initial downward motion, then you miss a good portion of your beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but no a big deal their lot of good blades</li>
            <li>Good as an introductory product, but not made to last.</li>
            <li>Have only used it 3-4 days - still haven&#x27;t found it all as good as advertised.</li>
            <li>Came early which was nice.</li>
            <li>I found this razor not only gave me a clean shave, it was nice and easy on my face.  </li>
            <li>It is not really a bad deal.</li>
            <li>the weight is not bad you get use to it he says also bought of</li>
            <li>But, its actually not bad comparatively, at that price point.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product at all.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice well made razor that is near identical in all respects to the classic Gillette superspeeds, of which millions were produced.</li>
            <li>Once you have that down, you&#x27;ll be rewarded with a great, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>The main thing with these razors is learning not to expect a one swipe clean pass like many men are used to through using multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li>and the stand that comes with it is super cool.</li>
            <li>Be sure to swish the razor in the sinks warm water to clean the blade.</li>
            <li>I was about to try a second discount brand of multi-blade cartridges, but in my quest of finding a better, more cost effective way to shave, I learned about the old school method of using a double-edge safety razor.  </li>
            <li>The best thing to come from the purchase is the little stand that comes in handy to use with my 6 blade razor, keeping it high and dry off the counter which is very important.  </li>
            <li>Not only am I happy with the shave I get, but I am happy to report no more cactus legs when I sleep with my wife.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still sharp and works great.</li>
            <li>sure you shave after a hot shower to soften your whiskers, Use pre shave oil, then a badger hair brush, some Cremo shave cream, and enjoy a real shave.</li>
            <li>and it made quick work of it.  </li>
            <li>just a good old fashion straight razor.</li>
            <li>If you are lucky and bought it on Amazon you might get your money back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quick</li>
            <li>Yes, it takes a minute or two longer, but it&#x27;s worth the extra time for a good shave at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>good razor, not a great razor, but exceptionally good for what i paid for it.  </li>
            <li>Too many passes to acquire a decent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my opinion this is an ok razor and if you like the quality of the shave you will likely purchase a much better one elsewhere</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;a lucky find.</li>
            <li>I bought this, luckily discounted.</li>
            <li>My razor of comparison is a &#x27;58 Gillette Super Speed.</li>
            <li>The razor arrived quickly and is well made.</li>
            <li>I have been using double edge razors since the 50&#x27;s, and the best one is the adjustable double edge razor.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll want to upgrade really quick.</li>
            <li>The razor seems well made, with the construction seeming quite adequate.</li>
            <li>I have more nicks and cute than with my traditional heavier razor.</li>
            <li>If you need to shave quickly this razor may not be for you.</li>
            <li>If it is tightened all the way, then backed off even a TINY amount, it will set the blade at a more aggressive angle for shaving (but use caution and make sure you still see it bowed from the side).  </li>
            <li>It shaves too aggressively in some areas and too mild in others...</li>
            <li>However, for a few dollars more you can get a good safety</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor and so far i&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
            <li>word of advice, although the razor does come with 12 replacement blades (a quick rinse after use is all you need.</li>
            <li>The disposables clog so quickly.</li>
            <li>Husband was able to get it back together; it does shave okay, but it pulls a lot.  </li>
            <li>Cheap but not as good as I would have expected from Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is a good shaver and a great alternative to expensive disposables.</li>
            <li>A little light and fair quality, but cuts just fine.</li>
            <li>Enjoy it very much.  </li>
            <li>but if you pay a little more you can get a much better razor and a much better shave.</li>
            <li>But honestly if you&#x27;re in the market for a double edged safety razor and do not want to spend an arm and a leg for a good one, watch eBay or your local antique shops and get a vintage gillette super speed or fat boy.  </li>
            <li>just right in order to get the clean shave.</li>
            <li>It is more economic (thinking about how many blades come with it, and how long do they last) and the shaving quality is great.</li>
            <li>Works great, better than the more expensive Mercur razors, which have a screw on/off head.  </li>
            <li>When you use a DE you have to use a good quality Shaving Soap and brush, a sharp blade and a light touch.</li>
            <li>and I really do get much closer and more comfortable shaves from my disposables.</li>
            <li>Hinge broke very first time</li>
            <li>I am on my third and very satisfied with them.     </li>
            <li>I tried it out, and managed to get some good shaves, but not for long.</li>
            <li>A litte bit small in my large hands, but it provides a great shave!</li>
            <li>Better off with the galette 4 blade much more comfortable and smooth, this product is not smooth</li>
            <li>It is very sharp and does a great job.</li>
            <li>great shave, very sharp blades</li>
            <li>Works well but just doesn&#x27;t have the weight and build quality of my other safety razors but it is an excellent choice for my shaving kit when traveling, I don&#x27;t mind loosing a $20 razor as much as I would once costing 5-6 times as much.  </li>
            <li>My son loves this...much more economical and effective than the other fancy, shmancy razors out there.</li>
            <li>This model is nice, easy to load &amp; clean, &amp; the blades are really sharp.</li>
            <li>That said, it is a better shave than any of the new razors offer.</li>
            <li>I decided to give it a try anyway, because the experience I had with my previous razor had not been great.</li>
            <li>good overall first impression.</li>
            <li>Aside from a barber&#x27;s straight razor,  the micro touch will give you a way closer shave vs the easy mode multi blade razors.  </li>
            <li>Shave is smooth, and I like being able to open and clean blade.</li>
            <li>(These are places that a modern disposable easily navigates.)</li>
            <li>This particular one is a cheaply made knock off of the original, and I do not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we&#x27;ve been looking for!  </li>
            <li>The razor was not as cheaply made as I expected &amp; it had pretty good heft to it.  </li>
            <li>I having owned other safety razors can honestly say that this razor is a piece of junk!  </li>
            <li>really close....!!</li>
            <li>and I went to change the blades, not one, but BOTH of the razors twist handles to open the top part of the razor, were stuck!</li>
            <li>They are inexpensive and work very well!!</li>
            <li>,it was my first time with a safety razor and didn&#x27;t cut myself, !</li>
            <li>I kept trying to get my boyfriend to shave on a consistent basis and it was this razor that did the trick!</li>
            <li>I liked the product so much that I reordered a new one for myself in February.  </li>
            <li>Hubby did not like the lack of straight edge for fine shaping.</li>
            <li>At first I opened after each use to clean blade.</li>
            <li>The razor is fine, but the blades could stand much improvement.</li>
            <li>This is a great little Razor.</li>
            <li>The razor is great but the blades that come with it are a little flimsy.  </li>
            <li>Looks nice, chrome top and handle and comes with a little stand to suspend it upright on the counter.  </li>
            <li>nice razor just wish the handle was a little bit longer put happy with it.the razor last longer than fusion</li>
            <li>I got a very nice, close shave off of this one razor versus the three and four blade setups from other companies that way overcharge for blades (which is why I was drawn to safety razor shaving in the first place).</li>
            <li>Very tinny and cheap.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;UPDATE\\&quot; Been using this for a few weeks; works great.</li>
            <li>It works great per my husband and he has always had a heavy beard.</li>
            <li>This is a pain free, close shave but, be ready for the after shave splash</li>
            <li>Got a very close comfortable shave, I would recommend it for anyone that needs to shave.</li>
            <li>I had about two days worth of growth</li>
            <li>Within a week one side of razor top sprung, wouldn&#x27;t close completely.</li>
            <li>So for the price I picked one up, and it was worth it.</li>
            <li>this is the closest shave and with no cuts, also brings back those memories of his dad using this kind of razor.</li>
            <li>#34;Yes, It truly is worth it&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li>Good idea, made with cure platedbmaterial versus actual stainless steel.</li>
            <li>It would be such a nice travel razor with the nice kit and short handle.</li>
            <li>I rarely write a product review but this item has eliminated my cost of shaving for life.  </li>
            <li>The head is HUGE, and you have trouble getting a good shave around the edge of your lips and under your nose.</li>
            <li>If you have never used a safety razor, it is worth it to read the instructions and not get in a hurry.</li>
            <li>The Dorco blades aren&#x27;t worth the surplus scrap they were made from.  </li>
            <li>and I rarely get cut,</li>
            <li>this item may throw you for a curve, but I have to say it is worth the purchase and time to learn to use it.  </li>
            <li>razor is worth it.  </li>
            <li>you only get 12 blades with this, not the 24 like on the TV deal, also a case did not come with mine, but a nice chrome stand.</li>
            <li>But once you get a hang of it, its pretty cool to use.  </li>
            <li>but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I saw Rick (from Pawn Stars) advertise this on TV several times before I paid attention.</li>
            <li>Liked it enough ordered my son set from amazon.</li>
            <li>worth</li>
            <li>The handle is way too short for a grown man to use effectively.  </li>
            <li>the old Gellate had a lot more feel in your hand, but would cut you.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li>The razor is nice and solid.</li>
            <li>This razor shaves better than the old safety razor and the blades cost $0.10 each.  </li>
            <li>,,worth</li>
            <li>It has succeeded beyond my wildest imagination and is a distinct value at its price point.</li>
            <li>Worth the money if it holds up over time.</li>
            <li>I have been using mine for hundreds of shaves, and I rarely if ever get cut.</li>
            <li>Had to shave the same spot over and over to get my skin smooth my 3 blade disposables work better</li>
            <li>To top that off I have extremely sensitive skin and am prone to bumps and irritation.</li>
            <li>compact double edge razor ........... nice shave .........</li>
            <li>Outstanding seller who ships immediately without waiting for funds to clear unlike some sellers</li>
            <li>That alone makes it worth it.</li>
            <li>Far better than multi blade razors.</li>
            <li>well worth it.</li>
            <li>The quality is nice and he loves just rinsing it clean and letting it dry.  </li>
            <li>Its worth getting compared to the multi blade rip off.</li>
            <li>This one is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Got mine for $10 and worth every cent.  </li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Blades at $0.08 cents apiece rather than $4.00 makes this a smoking deal and worth the time to re-learn the process.  </li>
            <li>The Microtouch One took three times longer than a cheap disposable razor to get a close shave and the multiple passes created much more razor burn.</li>
            <li>I would like to start by saying that I rarely write reviews on products unless I have a reason to.</li>
            <li>Buy a good double edge razor for 10 or 20 dollars more, and definitely don&#x27;t judge a de razor based off of this one.</li>
            <li>I returned it and CVS was nice enough to accept the return.  </li>
            <li>The top flap came off completely and it nicked and scarred my face.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that was a rare fluke, but I guess not.</li>
            <li>They just don&#x27;t work,i should have asked around to see if anyone else has had the same results as,i have.&amp;#34; Have a nice shave &amp;#34; dh</li>
            <li>I hope this is useful for some and that it does take take</li>
            <li>It is fun to shave again.</li>
            <li>My wife bought this one for me as a gift, I had mentioned that I had a razor like this when I was younger and really liked that one.</li>
            <li>It will take some getting used to, but it is worth it, trust me.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to cut yourself with this classic razor and the sharper the blade</li>
            <li>but it seems to be ok so far.</li>
            <li>I found I get a far better shave using the Wilkinson blades.</li>
            <li>My old Gillette adjustable was better, but they are now collectables.</li>
            <li>Gets a good close shave but just has to be careful he doesn&#x27;t cut himself.</li>
            <li>I have had a traditional shave done by a barber and those kind of shaves</li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>Lots of fun lathering up each morning with the boar bristle brush and cup of shaving soap.</li>
            <li>They say things were better in the old days.</li>
            <li>Not as good as expected.</li>
            <li>well worth the change from Mach razors.</li>
            <li>This razor isn&#x27;t worth your money or your time.</li>
            <li>This is a good starter safety razor for beginners to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>Time will tell, but so far, I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li>it’s time to put this thing on the sink and get a useful mach type razor out of the cabinet.</li>
            <li>My dalliances with this razor confirmed I’m not one of them, nor am I willing to allocate the time required to use this one as compared to zipping along with the higher priced cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would just buy the bic single blade razors... 2 stars is because it is packaged nice, and looks cool in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>particular brand razor worked just great for me straight out of the box with the standard blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Takes a few shaves to get used to using these classic razors, but once your comfortable, they provide a great shave at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>The one isn&#x27;t so mild that seasoned DE shavers will be turned away by it.</li>
            <li>This, combined with a good shaving soap and a bottle of Old Spice, will bring you back to the days of yesteryear and leave you clean shaved and refreshed.</li>
            <li>He has only had to change blade once in more than a month because this one he can take apart and clean.</li>
            <li>Takes a little getting used to at first but works great after that.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t have a full beard because the sides are soft and too sparse, yet many passes are needed, and the blades wear out fast.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the system works greats and comes with a good amount of blades.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The other factor  that is involved with how good of a shave</li>
            <li>Shaves 1/2 as good as a twin blade disposable but extremely heavier.</li>
            <li>Other than that, good investment.</li>
            <li>$20 bucks for a razor which will seemingly last a decade seems like a good value to me, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>If your one to rush through your morning, this might not be the best razor for you, but if you can slow down and allow yourself some man time in the morning, this razor will give you an amazing shave.</li>
            <li>I can shave with this thing right out of the shower, no cream, and I go upwards against the grain, no problems and no cuts.</li>
            <li>Right out of the box, it worked like a dream.</li>
            <li>The right  creme/brush/blades ..</li>
            <li>and this was not the right product.</li>
            <li>Even shaving at a 30 degree angle it still took the skin right off.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li>your time with it and it will treat you right.</li>
            <li>Mine was bent right at the safty bar.</li>
            <li>Once you learn and have the right equipment it puts all the multi razors to shame.</li>
            <li>and yes I was turning it the right way.</li>
            <li>For the average person the might be thinking this is cool and a good way to get into wet shaving but honestly for $15 you&#x27;d be better off just throwing it directly into the trash can.</li>
            <li>Not the right choice for shaving ones head...</li>
            <li>comes with 12 razors if i counted right.  </li>
            <li>This works well if used right.</li>
            <li>If you look through the side of the razor as you tighten a blade in, you can see how it &amp;#34;bows&amp;#34; the blade up into a curve right as it starts to max out, setting up the angle at which this razor was meant to shave at.  </li>
            <li>And they have every right to be, since they have to use it every day... on their face</li>
            <li>and I think that helped because I could feel it done right.</li>
            <li>right out of the box</li>
            <li>right  </li>
            <li>Right up to my expatiations of the product.</li>
            <li>With the right razor and blades, plus some learning time, the results are everything people claim.</li>
            <li>This is neither the right razor nor blades.</li>
            <li>The covers on top were loose and did not want to close easily after I had cleaned the blade.</li>
            <li>I got this for my dad for fathers day he had been looking for a straight razor for a long time he absolutely loved this</li>
            <li>if a lawsuit for normal nicks and cuts wasn&#x27;t dismissed immediately the company, and society as a whole has a lot more to worry about.  </li>
            <li>Bought a local grocery store brand of razors and got a better shave and didn&#x27;t have to use a ton of shaving lotion and after shave to cool my burning skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely much easier to clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, I don&#x27;t think thinks provides a closer or more comfortable shave, but if you figure out how to use it correctly, you&#x27;ll save money in the long run.  </li>
            <li>First I thought it was just a commercial thing, but then I tried and to be honest</li>
            <li>It saves so much money monthly and it does a clean shave.</li>
            <li>My husband is really happy with it, although he reports it takes a little practice to get the knack!</li>
            <li>After retiring I figured I&#x27;d go back to the great way of shaving and decided I&#x27;d try something cheap to see if I was really going to get back into it</li>
            <li>Thought it would give me as good a shave as back in the day (the 60&#x27;s) when this was one of a few style of razors available, but that was when I had more &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; than beard.</li>
            <li>He says you do have to pay more attention and be more careful because cuts and nicks are easier with this razor, but at the same time, this razor provides a much better shave and lasts longer than the disposables on the market now...</li>
            <li>If you are new to real shaving this is an okay try out.</li>
            <li>A very smart add</li>
            <li>It gives a very mild shave and even a beginner is not likely to have problems if he takes his time and uses light pressure.</li>
            <li>I was allured by how cheap it would be to get a single blade razor versus buying more blades for my Gillette Pro Fusion.</li>
            <li>It is an ok product, actually works well, just surprised that it as most things was made in China...</li>
            <li>four was great now not sure if it was the blade on not</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s OK if your the type of person who barely grows hair.</li>
            <li>My legs are usually full of scars and very itchy.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say, I am getting a better shave from this razor than the newer, more expensive models.</li>
            <li>Not worth a penny if you can&#x27;t get a good shave.</li>
            <li>Appears to be good quality and blades are sharp!</li>
            <li>I can honestly I will never go back, I am highly impressed with this single blade razor, I would recommend it for anyone wanting to back to the old school razors.</li>
            <li>so it took a little getting used to, but overall I was very happy with the job it did.  </li>
            <li>There are better razors out there for a little more money</li>
            <li>This razor is good looking and the blades are very sharp.  </li>
            <li>The razor itself is very comfortable to hold, easy to load blades into, and in general is very forgiving if you&#x27;re new to DE shaving, as I was.  </li>
            <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t qualify as a \\&quot;safety razor.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible!</li>
            <li>and I think I made the right choice for my first one.</li>
            <li>and they give this razor a new meaning to fresh clean shave</li>
            <li>Overall good quality, handle is short, needs to be an adjustable setting for a closer clean shave</li>
            <li>That way, only one thing has changed and you get a better determination of if it worth your time and money.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t close completely and cuts my face too easily.</li>
            <li>I thought this was initially a great Razor only to discover that the Razor rusted shut which means that I cannot replace the actual blade.</li>
            <li>Gave good shave but head broke off in less than 2 months</li>
            <li>Minor cuts the first shave, now that I&#x27;ve used it a month I am loving the close shave.</li>
            <li>The microtouch provides a neat trim line to my beard, is easy to clean, and the blades last through a number of shaves.</li>
            <li>I have an old style straight razor that does a better job than this.</li>
            <li>Believe me, it does not take much getting used to and the shave is much closer and smooth.</li>
            <li>reason why I only gave it 4 stars, ironically, is the same reason why it&#x27;s great for beginners.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, simple to clean</li>
            <li>but, shave is faster, easy to rinse and clear the blade.</li>
            <li>Do your homework, spend a few more dollars and buy a better razor.</li>
            <li>looking forward to use this razor, shave ok but to many nicks, waste my money, don&#x27;t buy, unless u want to cut yourself every shave</li>
            <li>I can really whip around and do a quick shave with the Mach 3, but not so with this razor.  </li>
            <li>good too get back old school shaving</li>
            <li>It was light, flimsy and just felt cheap all around, not like described on video by different reviewers.</li>
            <li>Also a light second shaving lightly against the grain was needed for a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I bought it because of how simple and easy it is to clean</li>
            <li>Works like brand new again!!!</li>
            <li>Comes in handy if you shave once per week, since the single edge of the blade does not clog up like a multi-blade razor</li>
            <li>Nice single blade shaver but not for me.</li>
            <li>You can buy a nice sturdy single blade razors from any beauty store like sallys etc.</li>
            <li>tried Dorco&#x27;s equivalent razor, not bad at all considering how much cheaper it was, but I still wasn&#x27;t totally satisfied for the same reasons I was unsatisfied with Fusions.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest adding some better blades to your order right away since you will be needing them in the future anyway.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised quick delivery thanks.</li>
            <li>have to be very gentle with it</li>
            <li>The trick with this razor is to take your time and don&#x27;t use very much pressure.  </li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d try something with more weight and just one sharp and precise blade.</li>
            <li>This razor is satisfactory, but I expected more insofar as the clean shave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and has no &#x27;down side&#x27; that comes to mind.</li>
            <li>This thing reminded me that the old classic designs were so much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe Rick Harrison has developed a methodology for shaving his head but as far as I’m concerned once I get to the area where I kind of remember having a widow’s peak (when I didn’t get a nice sharp line)</li>
            <li>lasted a year of hard use then rusted but for the price great.</li>
            <li>The blades are very reasonable &amp; last for many shaves.  </li>
            <li>I love the quick release action so I can empty clumps easily and often.</li>
            <li>razor gets right up to your beard line and offers a precise razor clean edge and with a simple stroke allows you go have clean neck and cheek</li>
            <li>To much pressure it doesn&#x27;t shave close enough, to little it strips your skin off like skinning a salmon wish it had a stop for the perfect tension on the blade.</li>
            <li>If you get this, I highly recommend you go for the full &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; shaving setup with a shaving brush and traditional shaving cream or soap in order to get the most out of this</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my husband and he likes it much better than the traditional razor.  </li>
            <li>They never last more than a week or so.</li>
            <li>Thanks to MicroTouch 3!</li>
            <li>The top 2 plates were out of line and the razor doesn&#x27;t close properly.  </li>
            <li>First time using a safety razor</li>
            <li>Years ago when I first started shaving, this is what you used.  </li>
            <li>first time opened</li>
            <li>A bit to get used to, more so than a commercial disposable blade type.</li>
            <li>Whichever comes first.  </li>
            <li>To my amazement I continued to get excellent results with the same blade, shaving daily for an entire month.</li>
            <li>so I tried it two more times with the same results.</li>
            <li>My face is worth whatever Gillette wants to charge for their multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li>Grate razor, has sam weight and feel of my first razor 45 years ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s back to the good old world of straight razors for me.</li>
            <li>Overall the product is ok, I would probably give it a 3 or 4.</li>
            <li>They are my first double edge experience but seems like there could be better blades out there.</li>
            <li>I just used this for the first time having never used a safety razor before.</li>
            <li>, I really wanted to, but as I labor through my shaves, this has not been a fun experience.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to be like my Dad, filling the sink with hot water, lathering my face all up and coming away with what I thought would be a close shave.  </li>
            <li>I butchered my face with the first pack, thinking my skin would &amp;</li>
            <li>Find yourself a decent Gillette adjustable or even a Gillette Super Speed or Flair Tip.  </li>
            <li>He will be returning to his old cheap razors.  </li>
            <li>but these were far from cheap.  </li>
            <li>Prices soon climbed to more than $20 for a pack of 4 blades at local retailers.  </li>
            <li>So I bought the Microtouch One; and tried it for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li>you get what you pay for im sure a more expensive safety razor would be even better</li>
            <li>Kind of a rough shave ..</li>
            <li>In fact the blades fit an old Gillette i had.  </li>
            <li>Merkur is one that ive read about but did not experience first hand.  </li>
            <li>Being my first time using a DE</li>
            <li>This razor meets all my expectations except one; the handle is too short and a longer handle is needed in order to get a better grasp on,</li>
            <li>no biggie&lt;br /&gt;Fully able to open and rinse our hair</li>
            <li>I first gave this razor a 5 star.</li>
            <li>My first shave was not as close as I get with my Merkur razor and Persona blades.</li>
            <li>Cut up my face first couple of shaves.</li>
            <li>first time user......love the way it works,&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Magical unicorns will not appear and tickle your man bits while cherubs dance above you.  </li>
            <li>I never got to use it,it broke the first time I was putting the blade in I</li>
            <li>This product fell apart the first month</li>
            <li>Our stepson used the Microtouch One Razor for the first time and had never used one before.  </li>
            <li>Shaves pretty well.</li>
            <li>Two cuts on the first shave.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>I would advise anyone interested in a DE safety razor to start off with something affordable, but do it cautiously.  </li>
            <li>my husband got his razor today and used it for the first time</li>
            <li>There is a risk, through use exactly as designed and intended that the user will suffer injury,</li>
            <li>I bit trick at the first time</li>
            <li>First use of a safety razor</li>
            <li>OK, My review will be similar to another that I read before buying this...</li>
            <li>I was pretty skeptic, but now I am sitting at my computer after shaving and I haven&#x27;t even put my pants on yet.</li>
            <li>First, I would like to thank John Harrison.</li>
            <li>I am 57 years old and now for the first time in my life, I enjoy shaving.</li>
            <li>Really!)</li>
            <li>Fast delivery to boot!</li>
            <li>I never even cut myself on the first try.</li>
            <li>will give it to him for his Birthday next month! :)</li>
            <li>Razor is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Just keep your face covered in hot water and soap with every pass</li>
            <li>The stand is sadly the best part of the eintire kit.</li>
            <li>Was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>It sounds surreal</li>
            <li>Installing the first blade was easier than I thought.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the acquisition of this item</li>
            <li>Keep them in the back of your drawer in-case you run out of your favorite blades.</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor</li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve used Gillette and many Gillette knockoffs as well as various style</li>
            <li>After that I began my search for a higher quality razor, and I realised my mistake.</li>
            <li>I followed instructions the first time, hot shower,</li>
            <li>, I thought it wasn&#x27;t working at first because I couldn&#x27;t feel a thing, and I was scruffy as hell.</li>
            <li>wanted to write a review after the first shave, but to avoid comformation bias I waited two weeks and shaved</li>
            <li>No nicks first time out, so I&#x27;m sold on this one.</li>
            <li>Grew up with this type of razor, first shaving with one as a 19 year-old Marine.  </li>
            <li>Worked well at first them broke.</li>
            <li>It seems that I am constantly trying to find a better grip to shave my face.</li>
            <li>He was skeptical at first,  but says it&#x27;s the best razor/shave he&#x27;s ever had.</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor.</li>
            <li>Although I cut myself the first time using it</li>
            <li>If this is your first de razor please try anything else.</li>
            <li>I love it, it takes regular blades</li>
            <li>Thats a simple aproach to shaving, and it washes better than a multiblade</li>
            <li>I was a scared of shaving the  first time</li>
            <li>Have been using safety razors for many years and I have to say that this razor gives me a shave equal to my Merkur and Jagger razors.</li>
            <li>Shave in the direction of the hair growth first, rinse and re-lather, then shave again against the grain.</li>
            <li>it did a number on my head first</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but I would not trade in my double blades for it.</li>
            <li>but for men with simple beards it will do ok</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay what they wanted.  </li>
            <li>I started shaving many decades ago using a razor very similar to this.  </li>
            <li>it worked for my Grand Dad and my Dad why not me.&lt;br /&gt;Some traditions should be left to die.</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t think he would after becoming used to what&#x27;s on the market in general.  </li>
            <li>and they last a month or more.</li>
            <li>My first shave with no cuts and no razor burns.</li>
            <li>The first time.</li>
            <li>First time ever used a razor like this.</li>
            <li>We used them exactly two blades and</li>
            <li>so you have some hot water in the sink.</li>
            <li>If you want to get into shaving with a traditional safety razor, I doubt you&#x27;d get much better for the price.</li>
            <li>I almost gave this product three stars, but just before writing this review, I decided to inspect my razor closer and noticed I could no longer open the top anymore</li>
            <li>I had to use a pair of pliers to twist the top lids open (and cut myself twice doing it).</li>
            <li>I will probably be looking for a slightly higher priced razor soon.</li>
            <li>The TV commercial had me convinced I would get a better shave and save money</li>
            <li>i think its kinda short 4 most guys</li>
            <li>I love it and would totally recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am not getting cuts &amp; scrapes like I was when I first started using it.</li>
            <li>First of all the stand won&#x27;t hold the razor.</li>
            <li>I used one of these years ago when I first started shaving</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably buy another one but a different brand as I wouldn&#x27;t feel confident in the quality or craftsmanship.</li>
            <li>The price of everything is getting higher.</li>
            <li>After trying this item I&#x27;m 100% satisfied and with the extra 50 blades</li>
            <li>Microtouch One&#x27;s marketing makes a big deal about not needing more than one blade</li>
            <li>about 30 shaves out of each blade, shaving after I shower and using Pacific Shave Oil instead of cream/gel, bringing my grand total for blades per year to a whopping $24.00.  </li>
            <li>first shaving experience did not go so well.  </li>
            <li>I should have done some research first because it turned out to be a mistake.</li>
            <li>My first observation has to do with quality.</li>
            <li>First, I thought I would get a closer shave</li>
            <li>;-)  </li>
            <li>This is my first attempt at using these types of razor.</li>
            <li>it is a better shave though compared to traditional razors</li>
            <li>Overall the experience with this razor is enjoyable.</li>
            <li>Go with the grain first then go against the grain.</li>
            <li>After the first week, I tossed the junk &#x27;5 blade&#x27; disposable razors.</li>
            <li>Again this was my first time shaving with this razor</li>
            <li>Love the razor, I have bought others similar to it, just not at all the quality</li>
            <li>, that was the first thing I looked at.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not difficult to learn to use.</li>
            <li>Well if you prefer the 1938 Willys over the present day cars, you&#x27;ll love this razor.</li>
            <li>The ergonomics of the modern day razor, in my hands, is so far superior to this razor that it outweighs&lt;br /&gt;the benefit of low cost.  </li>
            <li>needs to be more precision,each side cuts differently</li>
            <li>This razor is not an exact precision instrument.  </li>
            <li>but once I learned about shaving  while holding the blade in a 45 degree angle and to heat the blade just by running hot water on it</li>
            <li>It is exactly what my husband has been looking for.</li>
            <li>My husband really loves this razor and we are saving money not buying disposable razors!</li>
            <li>although I find I have to make several more passes than I ever have to with the cartridge type razor.</li>
            <li>There are a few good videos on  how-to shave with safety razor on youtube.  </li>
            <li>The new stainless steel blades are great and should last longer than the old</li>
            <li>,it is latter bit short but it very nice product.i can recommend this product to anyone who want to get very close shave.</li>
            <li>when it arrived, he was very excited to open it and try it.</li>
            <li>He is right though; all he wants is your money.</li>
            <li>The handle of this model is also much shorter than I would prefer, obligating me to hold it just under the head to get both the amount of pressure and angle right.</li>
            <li>I kind of expected a little better quality of razor, but it works and that&#x27;s the important thing.  </li>
            <li>The blades are only good if you shave everyday, If you don&#x27;t shave for a few days the blades don&#x27;t cut the hair very good.</li>
            <li>so far just make sure you clean it properly and no problems.</li>
            <li>I guess for the chineese thing this is its fine but do yourself a favor and spend a few more dollars on a much higher quality product.  </li>
            <li>The razor cut very close, was gentle against the grain after the initial pass with the grain, and was extremely easy to clean.</li>
            <li>(my youngest boy had more toilet paper corners on his face after using product for the first time).</li>
            <li>Got this for my father in law it was something he was asking for he was all excited when he got it reminded him of the old time razors.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still super shinny and my favorite part is that when he shaves it lasts longer than the other store razors.</li>
            <li>I bought one for my son a couple months after I bought mine because I really liked the whole wet shave thing.</li>
            <li>In fact I think any of the Classic Safety Razors is worth a try if you are as fed up with blade prices as I am.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely coarse facial hair and unless I can rinse through the cartridge they get clogged easily and shave more like duct tape than a razor.</li>
            <li>Shave was good - it didn&#x27;t last a year - the razor would not open to replace the blades</li>
            <li>smooth close shave, leaves face soft and with out whiskers would recommend to everyone who is looking for a very close shave</li>
            <li>I was always left with short stubble no matter how good I got at using this dang thing.</li>
            <li>With modern technology Double edge razors and blades have been perfected over the years and are vastly better than years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>My favorite way to shave was the Adjustable Injector with a six pack of blades ran almost a $1 per blade that gave me about 3 to 4 shaves per blade if I showered first, no matter how long my beard was.</li>
            <li>Just have to get used to it, it&#x27;s heavier than a more modern style and if you run low on shaving cream</li>
            <li>I have finally returned to a safety razor and it works just as good as a razor with multiple blades.  </li>
            <li>Side by side they are similar in the head, but the handle is a slightly more modern version on this.</li>
            <li>nice to go back to the old style razor.</li>
            <li>razor is a great buy, and most of the reviews I have seen that are negative sound like people who did not use proper technique and punished themselves with cuts!&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say anything but positive remarks about this razor and hope to see a come back of DE razors!</li>
            <li>Once you get the angles right, take it very slow you will see how great this is.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money, there are better quality razors out there and if used daily you need to spend more!</li>
            <li>Using the twist to open on the Micro touch, it sounds cheap, squeaky, and at times the butterflies need assistance to shut right.</li>
            <li>Woefully underwhelming shave - to put about as much of a positive spin on it as I can.</li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t care for the Dorco blades it came with, I&#x27;m having great results with other blades in the same razor.  </li>
            <li>First bought a Straight Razor.</li>
            <li>I love  double edge razor shaving, it&#x27;s simple, practical and comfortable.</li>
            <li>yes it has worked very well and still using my first blade</li>
            <li>Being my first safety razor, I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.</li>
            <li>After getting the razor and using it a few times I was very pleased with how well it worked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually very efficient and shaves pretty close</li>
            <li>Cause even on light fuzz it barely does the job.</li>
            <li>All though, he was very nervous when he first tried it -</li>
            <li>Wish this was made with higher quality stainless instead of plastic.</li>
            <li>So you&#x27;d be better off with the real deal or a low cost modern razor.</li>
            <li>I get as good a shave, if not better.</li>
            <li>I wish it was a little longer, but it works great, it is also a much faster and enjoyable shave,  minute to lather up the shave soap and apply, then the shave itself only takes about 20 to 30 seconds, rinse, wipe, Alum, after shave, and done, but even though its faster, its more relaxing, no more fighting trying to get the hair to rinse out from between the multi blades, no more shave cream all over my hands, this method is a lot cleaner, plus using the brush on your face just feels good.</li>
            <li>It is much gentler on the skin (my reason for adopting the method in the first place) and slows life down just a bit in a nice way....</li>
            <li>and I knew it was a mild razor, but I was unprepared for how mild it actually was.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read and been told that the blades are extremely sharp, therefore we want to make sure we do it right.</li>
            <li>The shave from this razor is not even as good as the cheap generic 2-blade disposable (the blue ones that you&#x27;ve all seen).Even with proper moisturizing, lathering and DE techniques I learned from watching Youtube videos, my face is still scraped, nicked and razor burned.</li>
            <li>The husband is  getting  a better shave than he has in a very long time.</li>
            <li>Blades can be changed easily with a twist of the handle to open the head.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and comes with plenty of extra razors.</li>
            <li>When the razor is installed you can shave from either end of the head allowing you to easily shave with and against the various grains of your face without having to turn the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Classic razors like this as far back as I can remember have always had nice solid handles that were 5 inches or more long and made it easy to wield around ones face for that very reason.  </li>
            <li>It brought back the old sensation that shaving should be somewhat of a pleasure, and it is suitable.  </li>
            <li>My approach was with light pressure at first and it simply would not move.  </li>
            <li>While you have the warm water running close the drain slightly</li>
            <li>So, gentle readers, I ask you this:  How in hell did this $20.00 Microtouch razor shave me as good (if not better)</li>
            <li>They are well made &amp; good quality steel that will last a long time.</li>
            <li>More of the blade is exposed in a single system like this</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s enjoying the single blade again.</li>
            <li>Over time your skin will become more accustomed to the single blade.</li>
            <li>I tried a single razor, I love it</li>
            <li>I still feel stubble in certain places after using this.  </li>
            <li>I have large hands</li>
            <li>Certainly a disposal problem.</li>
            <li>I am certain</li>
            <li>I quickly came to realize that pivoting in a razor is very important as in order to use the Micro Touch One to shave as close as my Gillette Mach 3 that I would have to have the flexibility of a Cirque de Soleil gymnast to maintain an effective cutting angle.</li>
            <li>Maybe your results may be different, but all I can say to you good reader is that the Micro Touch One single bladed safety razor</li>
            <li>Maybe your results may be different, but all I can say to you good reader is that the Micro Touch One single bladed safety razor</li>
            <li>Held the blades fine and did a decent shave but even with consistent cleaning the internal screw rusted through in about 2 months.</li>
            <li>but it does a slightly better job than a more traditional multi blade for less money.</li>
            <li>Seems fine to me,appreciate them bringing it back.</li>
            <li>one point my father-in-law suggested this product (not specifically, but a classic razor with disposable blades like how &amp;#34;he used to shave&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>This razor design has a convenient twist open butterfly top which makes changing blades very simple and quick.</li>
            <li>Cleaning the razor is very important to get a good shave and throwing it away just because it&#x27;s dirty</li>
            <li>So, my advice to anyone who doesn&#x27;t need a shaver with fourteen blades, it&#x27;s own shaving cream squirter, or neon lights attached to the handle, is to buy this nifty little razor.</li>
            <li>but I liked it aside from a little razor burn.</li>
            <li>Only those who are married to the idea of using a classic design, despite the discomfort and safety concerns, could enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>My hubby loved this surprise - a little old school</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good razor go ahead and spend a little more money on a german or english brand.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and with a little guidance he was able to get a good close shave without cutting his face.  </li>
            <li>I realized the blades are extremely cheap and left me very irritated after a shave.</li>
            <li>I was a bit concerned that there was some tugging as I shaved, but when i switched from a shaving gel to an actual foam (a cheap Barbasol foam worked very well in fact)</li>
            <li>My wife told me this morning she really is please with results; my face is no longer red and irritated and incredibility smooth.</li>
            <li>I got this because I pitched a fit last time I had to buy modern razor blades.</li>
            <li>Works OK, have to be careful how much blade one cranks into it.</li>
            <li>I will no longer be wasting my money on cheap razors that cost so much and just don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>The makers claim that the razor is made of chrome plated solid brass, and the handle may very well be, but the rest of the razor seems to be made of cheap chrome plated diecast or pot metal.</li>
            <li>product is a piece of JUNK and the whole promotion is a scam.</li>
            <li>It does shave very close.</li>
            <li>The blades were absolutely garbage.</li>
            <li>It gives me very close shaves</li>
            <li>Also, yesterday the razor screw somehow broke - it is responsible to lock the blade in the razor.</li>
            <li>I find that I prefer Wilkinson blades available locally.</li>
            <li>my whole face</li>
            <li>This is straight razor shaving without a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my husband who saw it on TV and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>He would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Very well made razor, just like the safety razors that everybody used before the disposables came out.</li>
            <li>Was a gift but he like it real well.</li>
            <li>but it works very well.</li>
            <li>It still does not open and close smoothly.</li>
            <li>It will work reasonably well</li>
            <li>That combo has treated me well and has been very</li>
            <li>Otherwise it is an absolute pleasure to shave with.  </li>
            <li>works well, can really give you some gashes</li>
            <li>I gets a real close</li>
            <li>Better and easier than I expected.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Ended up having to use pliers to change blades then the whole thing fell apart.</li>
            <li>Make sure the razor blade is seated correctly and the razor is tightly closed.  </li>
            <li>However, much to my surprise, this is the closest shave I have had in years.</li>
            <li>He really likes it.</li>
            <li>Seems like quality product, very shiny metal.</li>
            <li>this one gets the job done very well.</li>
            <li>Much to my delight</li>
            <li>And a whole lot cheaper than to keep buying the gilette fusion blades all of the time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to cut yourself with them.  </li>
            <li>Shaves very well.  </li>
            <li>Cheap Chinese RIP OFF.</li>
            <li>If the extra blades are free, why did they charge me $10 for them.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>This is not like modern razors.</li>
            <li>You will be bleeding if you go fast.</li>
            <li>Now he can really save money on blades.</li>
            <li>This is the type of razor I shaved with when I had to shave my whole face.</li>
            <li>are really a hit or miss.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a bit of an exageration, but not by much.  </li>
            <li>I really should have returned it.</li>
            <li>It really is garbage.</li>
            <li>works very well</li>
            <li>Each blade is wrapped and when you unwrap the blade it states stainless blade..</li>
            <li>doubt Rick Harrison really uses this, but it is all I use now.</li>
            <li>It was awsome using a real razor again, one time over</li>
            <li>Thank you Microtouch, Thank you so very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just bought Dorco st301 Stainless Steel Razor Blades, 100-Count Dispenser Pack for $7.52.  </li>
            <li>&#x27; razor blades - not so much.  </li>
            <li>I used to much longer handles.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a flimsy cheap metal stand that looks like it was welded together as a last minute add-on.</li>
            <li>My husband had said to me a while ago that he really wanted a razor like this</li>
            <li>works well, takes some practice if you are accustom to modern razors</li>
            <li>Too much pressure and you will cut yourself.</li>
            <li>Dont you need that to be straight?</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I have been a very satisfied DE blade shaver for the past 4 plus years using some well regarded equipment (Mergress and Fat Boy razors, quality badger brush, etc.).</li>
            <li>doesnt shave very well</li>
            <li>Micro touch gives a real close shave</li>
            <li>The very bottom of the razor handle is flimsy and seems like it was placed loosly on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Thanks for nothing Rick</li>
            <li>I had considered a straight razor and a safety razor for some time and done my research.</li>
            <li>Actually better than expected.</li>
            <li>The weight and mechanics of this feel better than expected.</li>
            <li>No nics/cuts no irritating skin.</li>
            <li>After the constant barrage of advertisements I decided to give it a try.at $20 it was a cheap investment and the results showed just that.</li>
            <li>Does not give me a close shave regardless of how I hold the razor, how much pressure I apply or going with or against the grain.</li>
            <li>He really likes this razor.  </li>
            <li>bought for boyfriend,  absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I still prefer my gillette mach 3, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; as much on your whiskers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Schick hydro triple blade shaves much closer.</li>
            <li>Try one, you&#x27;ll like the results and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Real talk.</li>
            <li>my husband has one and really likes it</li>
            <li>I was not expecting much from the blades that came with it and was correct.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there is much of a difference between the quality of shave between the two products, BUT you can feel the difference while you&#x27;re shaving</li>
            <li>I have skin that&#x27;s susceptible to ingrown hair so a close shave is absolutely required.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than 5 blade systems.</li>
            <li>Did&#x27;nt care much for the blades it came with</li>
            <li>And a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Like a straight edge shave.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I really don&#x27;t like having to spend fifteen to twenty minutes every morning trying to get a close shave.</li>
            <li>A dependable sturdy razor with high quality performance!</li>
            <li>Double edge blades are still available</li>
            <li>dropped one in and got straight edge quality shave.  </li>
            <li>My barber uses a Straight razor but this isnt that.</li>
            <li>They dont even give a real close shave.</li>
            <li>it also works out to be much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Cleanup is SO much easier with this style of razor.  </li>
            <li>He absolutely LOVES it.  </li>
            <li>He really likes the stand it came with.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I have this razor and it is very...</li>
            <li>Been using it for 2 weeks straight.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Microtouch One.  </li>
            <li>The razor blade sides stick out too much making it a very aggressive shave.  </li>
            <li>Item as described Fast Shipping  A+++++</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shaved with everything from a straight blade to a safety razors to gas station twins to vibrating 5 blades.  </li>
            <li>haha.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much.</li>
            <li>You get a really close shave.</li>
            <li>Expected better from Rick</li>
            <li>Husband really likes this razor and got van der Hagen shave kit to go with it.</li>
            <li>With more pressure my sons razor dial knob just crushed to pieces… In my frustration I discarded his in the trash.  </li>
            <li>Work the oil in and be ready to shave.</li>
            <li>I can get the same shave using a cheap plastic disposable.</li>
            <li>I figured I could get over the short handle and light weight but the closeness if the shave just wasn&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li>I really like the razor.  </li>
            <li>I like it, but don&#x27;t like it as much</li>
            <li>blades seem to much cheaper than what i was using</li>
            <li>So I just didn&#x27;t shave very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are much sharper than the blades I have been using.</li>
            <li>Modern razors are here for a reason - they work well.  </li>
            <li>The delta between this and what I&#x27;d save with the Microtouch One is negligible, and the Mach 3 shaves closer, faster, and cleans easier, and is MUCH easier to dispose of the used bade assemblies than the Microtouch One.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>Also, very well made.</li>
            <li>He really likes Pawn Stars</li>
            <li>He said it did not give him as smooth a shave as a regular multi-bladed razor.  </li>
            <li>the weight of the real one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Originally, I was going to try a straight razor, but after realizing the maintanence (sharpening, stroping, etc.)</li>
            <li>The quality of this razor is  much more than I expected.</li>
            <li>In short, there was nothing comfortable to using a Microtouch</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Shave Club razor this morning and got a much easier, and quicker, shave than this anachronism of a thing.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I get a very close shave with this razor; but you must take your time.</li>
            <li>Since I was use to using modern razors shaving my face and head.  </li>
            <li>I also thought that I could get a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>That said, the seller was very responsive in immediately refunding my money.  </li>
            <li>blade is all you really need.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the blades that come with it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Micro Touch.</li>
            <li>Also included are a dozen Dorco stainless steel blades.</li>
            <li>cuts real well</li>
            <li>You need to adjust to a learning curve as you need not apply as much pressure as with multi blade razors.</li>
            <li>it was really inexpensive</li>
            <li>Bought this for my dad for Father&#x27;s Day because he really wanted it.</li>
            <li>It takes some time to learn how to use it but works really well</li>
            <li>Husband loves it - he says it doesn&#x27;t pull when shaving and left his face baby bottom smooth.  </li>
            <li>I was only able to get a few shaves out of one blade, and when I did I would nick myself more often than not.</li>
            <li>cause we really expected more.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know much about razors.</li>
            <li>However now that I&#x27;ve had some practice, I can now shave almost as fast as with the Mach.</li>
            <li>Overall,  I am completely 100% satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Nice and heavy.</li>
            <li>At work today, I looked in the mirror, absolutely no nicks or irritation, and my face feels good actually.</li>
            <li>I wanted to shave more traditional because around a year ago I changed to the brush and bowel set up, and also use natural Dr Bronner&#x27;s soap instead of shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Microtouch with my platinum coated Derby Extra blades and so far I love them both.</li>
            <li>As advertised, theshaver uses old school double edge blades, Most of us have gotten used to disposable or cartridge type razors.</li>
            <li>, the instructions want clear enough, but some advice from my 92-year-old  grandpa helps me take the most from this product.</li>
            <li>All three types of disposable razors in our household (under magnification) clearly have only a single-bevel edge (from the top).  </li>
            <li>Far better than anything that I have tried with multiple blades.</li>
            <li>Disposable razors, such as Bics or Gillette Good News weren&#x27;t an option for me, as they always were rough on my face and caused a lot of irritation, afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I have brought this product a few weeks ago and I am thrilled by the quality of the shave that I have received.  </li>
            <li>I tried this model for several days and think that it’s very good in relation to weight and size of the razor, but the razor blades didn&#x27;t last long , so I had to change those very frequently.</li>
            <li>All those years of paying $40 or more for a pack of &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; razors that last a month or two at best make my sick.  </li>
            <li>But certainly  not does it get the job done any better on the curves of your face, like around ones chin.  </li>
            <li>no matter how long is my beard it shaves real good without taking half an hour with the regular one.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Works just like my old one!!!  </li>
            <li>He only cut himself once, and got the hang of it pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>Pretty fair shave, reasonably smooth but impossible to get the area right under your nose.</li>
            <li>The shaves were great initially, but I started having issues opening and closing the head to clean and replace the blades after approximately 9 months.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend had wanted a safety razor for a long time but while the blades are easy to find in stores</li>
            <li>key to a good shave is using fresh quality blades every time and working the shaving cream/gel firmly for a full minute into your face and neck before starting to shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to give myself better shaves with a straight razor in the first few tries.....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a heavy feel to it and is easy to open a close, holding the blade very securely.  </li>
            <li>This razor irratates my way more than any other razor.</li>
            <li>Gives a closer and smoother shave than the other razers that have more blades.</li>
            <li>One side of the razor had more exposure than the other.  </li>
            <li>This is a version of the original, prd-bic double edge shaver.</li>
            <li>Forgot that razors originally had only one blade!</li>
            <li>I ordered it thinking it will be better than the other store brands, but is does not cut at is says.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using the original blade weeks later.</li>
            <li>Way better then expected, received on time!</li>
            <li>I originally bought this razor at a local department store for my husband to use.  </li>
            <li>I have seen these sell for twice or more at other stores, websites.</li>
            <li>- sure glad I didn&#x27;t order any extra blades as they might have been a waste of addition dollars!</li>
            <li>He already had purchased a Edwin Jagger safety razor about 6 months earlier and has for quite some time been familiar with the technique.</li>
            <li>Since I am of the proper age to have used both the original Gillette double edged razor and am able to compare the old to the new, I really feel no difference between the two.  </li>
            <li>The razor is simple to use and clean plus it will not slip in your hand while shaving.</li>
            <li>definitely a lot easier to clean, and gives a close close shave...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t experience any irritation, but I noticed after my first couple shaves that I had a few nicks, mostly on my neck.  </li>
            <li>Shave not as clean as with multiple blade razor.</li>
            <li>WHO WANTS A CLASSIC,CLEAN SHAVE IN THE CLASSIC STYLE.</li>
            <li>The only downside I noticed was when I went to clean the razor.</li>
            <li>This is one of the few things I liked the commercials for and thought it would be better than my previous razor.</li>
            <li>Works great just had to learn how to get back to the basics of shaving with a single blade, I don&#x27;t think I would ever go back to a specialty razor again. !</li>
            <li>/&gt;Either way, I recommend this razor to anyone looking to make the switch, super smooth shave but with a little bit of a learning curve.</li>
            <li>These types of razors were probably dubbed &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; razors when compared to a barber&#x27;s super sharp open switch blade, but they are not all that safe compared to today&#x27;s modern disposables or not so disposables.</li>
            <li>High quality and stainless steel.  </li>
            <li>unlike the 4 blade razors the safety razors take a special technique or you will open your face to a work of pain.</li>
            <li>You can find a very high quality German or English made razor for about $10 more here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Decent enough, the action could be smoother but in all not bad!</li>
            <li>I have a short-cropped full beard, so the only place I shave is the neck underneath.</li>
            <li>I have a full glorious beard, but I still need to shave my neck and cheeks to shape and edge my beard properly.</li>
            <li>Really, the only thing I would say is different is the top rattles when opened/loose.  </li>
            <li>Blade is much easier to clean and dry than for modern multiblade shavers.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend $100 on a kit to find out the horror stories of slicing my face open was true.</li>
            <li>I first used my Fathers when I was young.</li>
            <li>Just barely got my money’s worth . . .</li>
            <li>Not bad at all compared to the big name safety</li>
            <li>You will have to put in the time to learn how the razor works and you may need to change the way you shave or what other products you might use when shaving, but its a small price to pay to be clean shaven and a bit wealthier.s me as good of a shave as any multi-blade I have ever used</li>
            <li>Once  I  got the technique down now i love it.</li>
            <li>, so i put a couple drops down the top of the barrel.</li>
            <li>you self the effort and spend a little extra for a good one.</li>
            <li>It will take you a little longer to shave, but overall the cost savings outweigh the additional time needed to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will take a little more practice on my neck, but the shave was very close.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handle was a little too short to give you really good stability and angle control during shaving.</li>
            <li>Was great for the first 3 months but became harder and harder to open.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find good options for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>With the modern razors I had to go through about 2 every month and then to buy a new package</li>
            <li>This razor worked OK at first, but it is cheaply made and you have to be very careful because the angle of the blade is not quite correct and it will bloody you up pretty good.</li>
            <li>This is an OK entry level razor, but it has some good and some bad points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;First impression : if you are accustomed to wet shaving, this is an easy switch.</li>
            <li>In this case less is truly more for your money.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use canned shave cream with these razors, they will dry out your skin and will not give you a comfortable experience.</li>
            <li>then I rinse lightly then towel dry.</li>
            <li>Had it for less than 2 weeks and the top would not close.  </li>
            <li>I love these razors and saved a TON of money since I no longer have to buy those expensive Gillette blades any more.  </li>
            <li>Did not seem like classic safety razor I used to shave with decades ago.</li>
            <li>If I had a heavy beard, or even had to shave my whole face, I&#x27;m sure I would be giving 1 star.</li>
            <li>but it is a decent quality product.</li>
            <li>Most of the complaints are likely from people who are used to shaving with overpriced, multiple blades(which get clogged), plastic pieces of junk.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to buy the latest most expensive offering from any of the shaving companies, just don&#x27;t buy the BS that Harrison is laying on you.</li>
            <li>I had just watched the episode of How It&#x27;s Made that featured the classic safety razor &amp; became intrigued.  </li>
            <li>But the blazer only give 3 stars because they&#x27;re only better than nothing.</li>
            <li>Decent razor.</li>
            <li>For the $8-20 you will find this for it is a decent price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the Razor itself a decent razor for its cost, Just like everything else</li>
            <li>I am also an older guy</li>
            <li>The low cost drew me back in, but now I&#x27;m even more sold on the quality of shave</li>
            <li>This is a decent product.</li>
            <li>All in all, a decent product.</li>
            <li>So, I thought, why not give the classic safety razor like my dad used to use, a shot.</li>
            <li>If I had only known that someday I would pay $2 (or more) for a cartridge, I would never have left the safety razor.  </li>
            <li>but that is not a serious problem.</li>
            <li>I would not reccomend the Microtouch One Razor Classic Safty Razor to anyone.</li>
            <li>To everyone&#x27;s post that reads &amp;#34;this will cut your face&amp;#34; I used this style shaver for the first time today and after properly prepping my face with hot water and a lather cream this razor glided effortlessly over my face and gave me a barber shop shave.</li>
            <li>There is definitely a learning curve, and the first few shaves are typically not the best, however the real payoff comes from sticking with it and taking the extra time needed to learn proper technique and blade angle when shaving.  </li>
            <li>In all fairness, this was the standard for most of the 20th century.</li>
            <li>A lot of reviewers mention the proper shave method (vital if you are going to enjoy this razor), build quality of the razor, sharpness of the blades, etc.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t particularly like the blades that are supplied with the razor.  </li>
            <li>Its so short handled that it makes me feel like I should be 6 years old to fit in my hand.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money, spend the extra and buy a good one.</li>
            <li>Just use a multi-blade razor or a gillette alta II and clean and dry the razors really well.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a mild DE razor</li>
            <li>This seems like a decently made DE razor.</li>
            <li>Overall I love the solid weight and ease of blade change with this razor.</li>
            <li>Does a decent job.</li>
            <li>The length of the handle didn&#x27;t bother me, and the razor itself is steady and sturdy.</li>
            <li>I would particularly recommend the EJ that I got or a Merkur HD.</li>
            <li>With the platinum double edged blades I get a super close shave.</li>
            <li>I almost forgot what a decent razor is supposed to perform like.</li>
            <li>The first time I saw his commercial I almost choked, because I laughed so hard.</li>
            <li>With this single blade setup, taking your time produces an effortless, comfortable, and close shave.</li>
            <li>Switching to a single blade safety razor has been fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Also for men that have sharp edges or prefer clean crisp lines on their beards this product will not do that</li>
            <li>I should also add that many have complained about the short handle, but I like the shorter handle because I was able to quickly switch the angle of the razor and move it around within my hand without a long handle getting in my way.</li>
            <li>My husband was excited to try this, after they had disappeared from the market for so long.  </li>
            <li>the normal disposable razors I&#x27;ve always typically used give me a bit of a better shave than this.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>the name brand blade refills are sky high, and im no longer used to using the plastic ones from BIC etc.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>High quality for a razor.</li>
            <li>high make</li>
            <li>Highly recommended buy if you want to save money.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>It is highly recommended for any man who wishes to avoid the &amp;#34;drunk-tank&amp;#34; graduate appearance.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Highly recomend this razor.</li>
            <li>It may not be for every man, but my two men would recommend this highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a cheap foreign made feel, but holds the blade very well.</li>
            <li>That would keep the blade &#x27;flat&#x27; against the inner side of the top.</li>
            <li>The blades that come with it are not high quality, but I just bought a package of new blades for five bucks and it works fine.</li>
            <li>The best thing i can say for my broken razor, is it got me to appreciate the old style, single blade razor.</li>
            <li>Bought for husband and while it provided a good cut at first, it was impossible to get the top open to change the blade after 10 months.  </li>
            <li>Takes a little more work than the multi-blade disposables, but the cost of blades is a fraction of their price.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this or even a $30 one with a little more weight to it</li>
            <li>and I get a little better at it each time I use it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t rush as a little nervous about nicks but made it out ok.</li>
            <li>A little more weight, and heavyier.</li>
            <li>Also, I love the little stand it comes with.  </li>
            <li>I still like DE razors, so after spending a little more time researching I decided to buy the Merkur 34C (just ordered today so no review).</li>
            <li>, it did the job just as well as those insipidly overpriced multi-blade razor cartridges that dull easily and don&#x27;t last long, like a 4-pack of multi-blade cartridges will only last a month at best.  </li>
            <li>but my family have tough beards good luck</li>
            <li>Id really appreciate it if u could refind my money for shipping i live on a very fixed income and money counts every penny of it.  </li>
            <li>Very good shave; alittle slower because I&#x27;m not used to it, and maybe alittle afraid of it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try it just because it&#x27;s old fashion looking, but like the model T nice to see and mess around with but for the long haul technology wins mach 3 for me.</li>
            <li>There are actually openings all underneath the blade to allow for easy cleaning, and I have noticed that a fast pumping up and down in hot water cleans the blade very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sharp, doesn&#x27;t get clogged up, rinses easily.</li>
            <li>I had never used a safety razor before, other than playing with my dad&#x27;s safety razor when I was a boy, but I got the hang of it very quickly.</li>
            <li>But close inspection of the item reveals a cheap rehash of an old classic, probably manufactured in China at bargain rates to the distributor (who no doubt is making a killing in the spread).</li>
            <li>You have to tug hard to get any kind of shave.</li>
            <li>Great razor, takes little practice but once you have the style of shaving down...</li>
            <li>this is the best part of my shave, knowing I have a bad a$$ razor but didn&#x27;t break the bank for it.</li>
            <li>I see all these bad reviews and can&#x27;t imagine their troubles because this is a great razor!!</li>
            <li>... run far and fast...</li>
            <li>The mechanical action which opens and closes the razor in order to load a blade has too much play and does not close fully allowing the blade to shift....</li>
            <li>Of course you have to be careful and thoughtful of how you are shaving</li>
            <li>My old razor (the &amp;#34;expensive, four blade model that doesn&#x27;t shave any closer than the Micro Touch One&amp;#34; according to ads) pivots on the contours of my very non-flat head.</li>
            <li>You still have to be careful until you are comfortable shaving with the saftey razor .</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, not very well made just cheap junk in my opinion .</li>
            <li>razor allows me to be detailed while using really minimal pressure</li>
            <li>difference is like driving a 100 year old car versus a modern car.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how much my hubby loves this razor.  </li>
            <li>Kept it clean and dry.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical but it works great</li>
            <li>I now feel I know the reason the industry went away from shavers like this, they are old technology and really don&#x27;t work all that well.</li>
            <li>There are 11 more to go, which will last a long time at this rate.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using a safety razor, some of the reviews bashing this apparently dont know how to read directions or</li>
            <li>Worth the extra money</li>
            <li>cuts you more than shaves wasted 20 dollars never again</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>Aside from the mediocrity of the build (being made in china aside, this razor is lighter than most others)</li>
            <li>Ok Shaver, takes some getting use to, Lather up heavy.</li>
            <li>The extra money is worth it.</li>
            <li>Requires a slightly different technique, but really worth the adjustment.</li>
            <li>He is now looking for an antique one but will keep using this one for his normal touch-ups.  </li>
            <li>So it was worth $20.00 bucks to me to reintroduce me to Double Edged shaving again.  </li>
            <li>Very simple and economical.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to purchase this razor, but Rick Harrison&#x27;s endorsement and the low price made it worth the gamble.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through all of the normal razors: electric shavers, disposables, the Gillette cartridge razors, and this is the winner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, you might think you save money, but you waste more time.</li>
            <li>Shave with the grain, first, and then if you have to shave against the grain, re-lather and use short, gentle, upstrokes.  </li>
            <li>He has had trouble with so many of the disposable razors.  </li>
            <li>Your first few shaves may not be as smooth as you are used to with multiblade razors.</li>
            <li>It simply doesn&#x27;t work worth a darn.  </li>
            <li>Once you break the bracket by opening it to replace the blade , consider it broken for good.</li>
            <li>And being that its a single blade its easier to clean.</li>
            <li>My SS is 56 years old and it has a vintage cool look, but definitely not all shiny and new.</li>
            <li>Only down fall so far is a bit hard to shape sideburns and get in near my lip but with more practice I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>was a bit scared at first, but took it slow and easy, and was very surprised.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These new razors require you to shave every day to be effective but don&#x27;t do so well with a longer, thick growth.  </li>
            <li>This is a simple easy to use razor, I should have never stopped using this type way back when.</li>
            <li>Touch One is just a cheap imitation of a classic DE razor.</li>
            <li>Some users might prefer the cost savings associated with using double edge blades in lieu of the purchase of extremely over- priced multi-blade cartridges required by most modern razors.</li>
            <li>I debated whether to give this three or four stars, and I ended going with four because the product is exactly what is advertised - a decent and economical shave when compared to more expensive razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It had been many years since I used a single blade razor and it all came flooding back to me as to why I switched to the multiblade razors.</li>
            <li>And the price is right for something that will last forever...except for blades...</li>
            <li>Rick Harrison is right; you only need one blade to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>sometimes a couple times a day when I first got it, (new shiny toy and all) , not a single cut</li>
            <li>, they work very well, I can get about 2 weeks of good shaving from them.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: flip the blade over and you can get a few extra shaves, try that with a mega-blade that last about 3 shaves a week.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I tried slow and easy, and whatever else I could think of to make it work right.  </li>
            <li>That was because it took a long time to clean the old one.</li>
            <li>And clearly you can get a good shave with a Double Edge razor for a whole lot less ongoing expense than with the stuff being sold by the big boys now.    </li>
            <li>As a shaver who grew up in the era when multi-bladed razors gained dominance I used disposable single/double bladed razors for a significant time while I was in the military.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t shave with anything other than the Micro Touch now because the blades for it are dirt cheap.</li>
            <li>I love the classy little stand too.  </li>
            <li>if you are used to the supermarket shaves, you will get some cuts while you will get used to this new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re new to using this method, go online, study up.</li>
            <li>hubby loves his new razor</li>
            <li>With this razor, just twist the handle stick under the sink and presto a new blade.  </li>
            <li>He did not want those new fangled triple bladed razors.  </li>
            <li>As with any new, tricky endeavor, it takes practice to shave with this style razor.  </li>
            <li>After I got my new one,</li>
            <li>but if you order something brand new it should look brand new.</li>
            <li>I get cut all the time, even when I put in a new razor blade.  </li>
            <li>My Husband loves his new razor.</li>
            <li>had switched to this from disposable blades to try and save a dime not to buy a new razor every 6 months.  </li>
            <li>thought there might be a new twist</li>
            <li>I pay $9 a month for four new blades shipped</li>
            <li>I would buy new ones</li>
            <li>This is my new &#x27;at home&#x27; shaver.</li>
            <li>I opened the box with the new razor</li>
            <li>If your new to wet shaving this might be a good choice to see if you like it then spend some money on a nicer one for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I also tried all the upper quality shave creams( Cremo) and soaps ( which may have been why the irritation was higher in the beginning), and nothing works better for me than the plain Ole $1.50 Barbersol Beard bust.  </li>
            <li>As i looked around the Amazon site i saw several of the same items with free shipping.</li>
            <li>Back to the old day&#x27;s type shaving - simple and easy.  </li>
            <li>He shaves his head and beard everyday because his hair grows so fast and thick, and this has been the only way he&#x27;s gotten a good, clean shave with a blade that&#x27;s lasted a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>Clearly I expected this to last more than 6 months though.</li>
            <li>Razor blades dont fit in razor, wont shave correctly, not enough razor sticks out to properly shave with.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess ok for those that shave everyday, but nowhere near what billed as.</li>
            <li>Blades are not very sharp, so the shave is not close like what one is used to at a much higher cost, which leads me to believe the old adage, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34</li>
            <li>That said, I am very surprised at this razor&#x27;s quality, esthetics and ease of use.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Very old school</li>
            <li>This is cuts a little better than  the double and triple blade razors that I have always used, and it is much cheaper too,</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve decided to cut back in all areas including researching new car insurance and many other areas.</li>
            <li>Use a fresh new blade every shave, such as Derby Extra platinum coated blades, they&#x27;re very affordable at 10 cents a piece</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even strong enough to close them tight enough to not be able to open them again!</li>
            <li>The lack of the 5th star is solely due to the fact that I would love to see a version strictly for the female user with a longer handle.def by another.  </li>
            <li>The lack of the 5th star is solely due to the fact that I would love to see a version strictly for the female user with a longer handle.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ever used a razor such as this....</li>
            <li>If this is your first razor, consider some different blades.</li>
            <li>I am not entirely sure it wasn&#x27;t anything more than a bubble of plating that wasn&#x27;t supposed to be there</li>
            <li>The first thing you will struggle with is trying to get the ziplock off the Razor, next trying to get the blades out of the plastic holders.</li>
            <li>Blades are crazy cheap compared to cartridges and have the ability buy stainless that is much better than disposable razors that degrade fast.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I just got replacement heads for from Amazon and ordered it and wanted the first shave to be a growth, it was only five days but another three days it would have been a beard to trim.</li>
            <li>I will be looking at merker for the higher quality and probably one that doesn&#x27;t twist open.</li>
            <li>Blast from the past - but better.  </li>
            <li>it take me back to my first shave</li>
            <li>Actually shaves better than any of my other $10-$20 razors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll tell ya what I didn&#x27;t like first, the handle is a bit short.</li>
            <li>Your first shave will totally suck, but hang in there</li>
            <li>When I first began shaving 53 years ago, my dad taught me to shave using a double edged safety razor.</li>
            <li>A good safety razor should last 50 years, this one barely made it past 50 days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the mechanism broke during first shaving session and now wont open at all</li>
            <li>I understand that learning the proper technique can take time, however, after my first go around</li>
            <li>Get the long handle one here on Amazon its worth it.</li>
            <li>I have not purchased this exact product, but I have owned the same razor.</li>
            <li>The modern razor is economical enough, especially given the performance and convenience.  </li>
            <li>It does shave pretty well, and it will take several shaves for my face and my hands to adapt to a safety razor again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>He said it works better than any other razor he has tried, and would never go back.  </li>
            <li>but wow it gives a close shave!</li>
            <li>The blades are sharp and even though i hold it at a 45 degree angle, It still pulls and gets stuck on the hairs, I think it actually plucks more hairs than it</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a traditional razor.</li>
            <li>so I had to reeducate myself in my shaving techniques such as softening the bearded area by using soap and hot water.  </li>
            <li>My first razor ~50 years ago was the same type/style as the Microtouch.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll find a consistent pattern if you read the 1-star reviews first - which is, starts out great but then turns to crap.</li>
            <li>it was a present for my husband, he wanted one since the first time he had seen it advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After years of trying Braun, Norelco, Remington and Panasonic electric razors, I have used disposable twin blade razors for the last few years, anything without a lubricating strip (that irritates my skin and takes away the traction that I personally need to get a good, close shave).  </li>
            <li>and the little handle makes it easy for me NOT to misplace it.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a little piece of paper in the package, easy to miss</li>
            <li>Then I realized it comes down to anything being sold:  M-O-N-E-Y (yours that you spend and the company&#x27;s that use a huge mark-up on anything with steel in it).  </li>
            <li>I will add that he is notoriously prone to screwing things down too tightly:  light bulbs, jar tops, etc.</li>
            <li>Also shaving lightly with the grain letting the weight of the razor to glide down and capture all the bearded areas.  </li>
            <li>The handle is a little to small for me, but it works great anyway.</li>
            <li>The one I got must of been an imitation because it didn&#x27;t come with the case the original Microtouch One is suppose to come with.</li>
            <li>the money, not a bad deal, and I&#x27;d recommend it to most guys, except if you have big, thick hands or stubby fingers - could get tricky!</li>
            <li>I also was nervous at first, but by the time I finished the first side, I was fairly comfortable using it and shaved a little faster on the other side.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mechanism is poorly crafted, the knob that you turn to open and close the compartment gets rusty and there is no way to detach or clean device that controls the top part which opens and closes.</li>
            <li>First up and most frustrating with it?  </li>
            <li>The first time that I tried to change the blade I could not open the clam shell to get the old blade out.</li>
            <li>I prefer to use Shave Secret shaving oil (or sometimes even just hot water), rather than the soap, brush, and mug that most DE shavers use.  </li>
            <li>When I reported this razor fell apart after my very first shave (when I opened it to clean the blade after the shave) it would not close properly and in fact one of the four connecting nubs that fit into the doors that open had broken.</li>
            <li>it comes down to it, the only reason Gillette is making its razors fancier is so that they can charge you more money.  </li>
            <li>Glad I finally broke down and tried it.</li>
            <li>Shaves as well as any other razor and it doesn&#x27;t cost as much as a full tank of gas every month.</li>
            <li>I had one blade that right away wasn&#x27;t very good, not sure if it was in wrong or something</li>
            <li>Also, the blades are less expensive &amp; do an excellent job.</li>
            <li>This razor will most likely cut you if you are not super cautious and ssslooowww when shaving.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong its easy and cheap because you don&#x27;t throw them away.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re after a smooth and tight shave, you may want to consider something else.</li>
            <li>I did get a VERY smooth shave on my legs with this, but I had to be very cautious and go very slow.</li>
            <li>Have always been curious about old straight razors and safety razors, having always seen old ones in &#x27;showcases&#x27; at flea markets and wondering what was so special about them when I was younger, then into my early 20&#x27;s almost considering one but never taking the plunge.</li>
            <li>Oh one last thing, make sure you keep the blade in tight.</li>
            <li>I was smart enough to buy a sampler pack.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect the quality of the ones from &#x27;back in the day&#x27;, but this one is certainly passable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little bit cheaply made but it works.</li>
            <li>It glided nicely through my tough whiskers with no pressure required.</li>
            <li>I (female) have to be extra careful around knees and ankles, but it is a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>After six weeks even when switching to a brush and using Nivea Sensitive Skin formula and using Personna blades, I&#x27;m still got  a lot of nicks and cuts, still got a lot of irritation and razor burn, and still missed large patches of stubble even after multiple passes.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical about buying something advertised by the pawn shop guy, but have to say I am impressed with the product.  </li>
            <li>Pay a little extra a get the better quality.</li>
            <li>Overall, pretty decent for a starting safety razor.</li>
            <li>for areas you may have missed but be sure to press hard with the shaver or it will cut you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I did a little research on the interwebz &amp; was surprised by how many people recommended using a DE over the 5 blade monstrosities that I was currently using.  </li>
            <li>You just have to be a little more gentle and careful.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and unlike the multi blade razors that feel like they are pulling your hair instead of shaving it and little hairs that get stuck in between the blades and poke your face then becomes hard to clean.</li>
            <li>we have tried many of the blades and they are all bad and one top of it</li>
            <li>But let&#x27;s be clear:</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t shave very closely, I had to go back to my old store razor</li>
            <li>Now I want to be clear on this....</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS CHEAP RAZOR OLD SCHOOL SUCKED.</li>
            <li>This razor gives me a close clean shave with less irritation than a multi blade.  </li>
            <li>He used it one time and it took the skin clear off his head in spots.  </li>
            <li>The Dorcos are better, at least for me.</li>
            <li>It will also take a few shaves for your face to adjust to it as it is not quite as comfortable as these fancy multi blade razors, but you&#x27;ll adjust.</li>
            <li>Some old things don&#x27;t need to be revived.</li>
            <li>It finally completely seized up</li>
            <li>This thing shaves so no worries there, the only problem I got is that I underestimated the instructions warnings and out of habit pressed the razor against my face as I would do with a modern razor</li>
            <li>Now if I can only master shaving with a straight edge...</li>
            <li>the handle eventually gummed up until it was completely unusable.</li>
            <li>I was watching Skyfall, and there&#x27;s a part where James Bond is shaving with an old style barber&#x27;s razor, and he says to Miss Moneypenny &amp;#34;Sometimes</li>
            <li>the old ways are still the best&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll recognize this from the old World War II movies.</li>
            <li>You really do need only one blade to shave.</li>
            <li>This is delicate instrument compared to the more brutish disposables.  </li>
            <li>Keep far away from this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this three times so far</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this blade to anyone looking to try something different.</li>
            <li>Traditionally DE (double edge) safety razors are hefty so you don&#x27;t have to apply any pressure this can lead to nicks or cuts if you apply pressure as you would with a multi-blade modern razor cartridge.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s completely bogus.</li>
            <li>(old school)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was concerned about nicks and cuts like my old safety razor years ago</li>
            <li>I wasted the money on this only to have to purchase more tips for my old razor anyways.</li>
            <li>Now that I bought it, I realize that there was a reason everyone stopped shaving with this old junk.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;my old, &amp;#34;duel blade&amp;#34</li>
            <li>#34;There&#x27;s my old razor!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I can use this razor (including blades, etc) for ten years rather than use modern razors for a month.  </li>
            <li>Cartridge razor blades are for boys, double edge blades are for men, straight razor is reserved for the hero and the brute.</li>
            <li>I am traveling on a work trip and was sitting around the hotel room with the TV on and saw the Pawn Star guy with an old fashioned razor.</li>
            <li>loves how it works so far</li>
            <li>and I like using my old soap mug and brush.  </li>
            <li>blade razors...cause the old singles....cut the he_l out of my face.........</li>
            <li>Just like the old days.  </li>
            <li>Any who, I have sensitive skin on my neck, and I am skinny</li>
            <li>So, if you have smallish hands or, if you travel a lot, this razor will work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions: I like the old school shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going to take a few passes to get that baby smooth feeling</li>
            <li>Handle is too short, you cannot get a real feel.</li>
            <li>No where near as close a shave.</li>
            <li>hard.save your money look for a old one at a swap meet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m into nostalgia as much as the next person</li>
            <li>STAY FAR AWAY.  </li>
            <li>Nearly cut my dick off while shaving pubes.</li>
            <li>I also picked up an inexpensive Tweezerman shaving brush, and some old fashioned shaving cream in a tub.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take long, as I was a convert after the first couple of shaves.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at the quality for the price.</li>
            <li>This product totally surprised me.</li>
            <li>when I first used it I had to remember to hold the business end at a 45 degree angle, since it&#x27;d been so long since I used one.  </li>
            <li>I have two safety razors- an old style one piece head and a butterfly opening ( this one).</li>
            <li>This is old school and</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the size of the handle.</li>
            <li>like old dad taught me to shave with.</li>
            <li>it is not as quality as the old razors used to be does the job</li>
            <li>Old school baby.</li>
            <li>I am a prime member and order frequently from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>A lot of folks are surprised that an old-fashioned DE razor can shave as close (or closer) than a multi-blade disposable razor (or cartridge).  </li>
            <li>Used for two weeks and then went back to a modern razor.</li>
            <li>Just keep the blades cleaned with an old tooth brush.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, it was a real step back.</li>
            <li>when i tried to get it to open to change the blade the whole thing came apart.</li>
            <li>This is a razor for a man, who realized the importance of that quiet time of reflection every morning while he exercises the manly art of shaving with a real razor.</li>
            <li>Nearly scalped my head.  </li>
            <li>I think part of it is the fact that we are so used to using those throw away razors that we forget how to use this old school one.  </li>
            <li>Then the side bracket, which opens and closes the butterfly doors, completely came apart.</li>
            <li>My granddad had an old school razor “like” this that probably lasted his lifetime. . .</li>
            <li>DE shaving is a skill that must be learned and it took me about a week to match my old 6 blade cartridge razors.</li>
            <li>, I now feel that all the extra blades on Razors really do make a difference.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews over the durability, it seems okay to me</li>
            <li>Razor blades are so much cheaper with these models &amp; last a lot longer.</li>
            <li>It is an old Gillette patented design, but these days they are not made by Gillette.  </li>
            <li>Blade is not adjustable, and the blade is fixed at an aggressive angle.</li>
            <li>and so far no probs.</li>
            <li>some know how to shave regardless if you are 20 or 65 yrs old.</li>
            <li>The Microtouch One is 100 year old technology</li>
            <li>You see, as a child, I had an accident with my mother&#x27;s &amp;#34;safety razor.&amp;#34;  I nearly cut off one of my toes in an attempt to emulate my mother shaving.  </li>
            <li>Complete garbage.</li>
            <li>Not like the safety razors of old.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyone who has had a professional shave can appreciate this razor.</li>
            <li>Ended up having to try and use some pliers to gently open it, that didnt work well, whole thing is busted.</li>
            <li>I am 71 years old.</li>
            <li>My my twin razor blows this old tech.</li>
            <li>Complete junk don&#x27;t wast your money</li>
            <li>His completely fell apart.</li>
            <li>In closing I&#x27;d like to quote a line from a song by Neil Young: &amp;#34;Saw</li>
            <li>So far he says it works well.</li>
            <li>I was surprised because, well, look at it.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t as much blade exposure as I&#x27;d like, but this definitely gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I wanted the old version of razors like my dad used to use.  </li>
            <li>It did not nick the skin like the old version used to do on my face.</li>
            <li>One side should be marked.</li>
            <li>Throw away&#x27;s were then used, but I was desirous of another early style safety razor.</li>
            <li>just like old fashion ones.</li>
            <li>far as the bearded surface areas are concerned, this system works</li>
            <li>Spend a few extra dollars and get something worthwhile.</li>
            <li>part of the head could use more definition, not just a few low grooves.</li>
            <li>For a few dollars more with German precision.</li>
            <li>my razor shave me every bit as good as the expensive Merkur blades.  </li>
            <li>Go slow and careful and you may need to shave twice but defiantly a good buy and the blades have been made forever.</li>
            <li>The trick is to shave slowly and carefully and use good shaving cream/gel.</li>
            <li>but the only downfall is that he had to disassemble the head to clean the blades as compared to the single edge razors.</li>
            <li>Like other folks stated you need to be a bit more careful</li>
            <li>Well with all due respect to Rick and Pawn Stars, I think he should stick to minding his shop and making fun of his old mans age.  </li>
            <li>After learning to reduce the stubble through multiple light passes with this razor, those other razors feel like a hack and go option.</li>
            <li>so it is small and easy to pack</li>
            <li>It is advertised as a single edged razor and that is exactly what it is.  </li>
            <li>the only way to cute yourself is to either not have the butterfly closed all the way, or slide it from side to side, if you pull straight down</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s price, I&#x27;ve used other micro-touch products with success before, and because Rick Harrison is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my Gillette fusion which is 2 weeks old left me with much less second day shadow,also tried to shave my head with this razor,forget it too many nicks</li>
            <li>The weight is very much the same and overall quality is what you would get for $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this razor, I was so tired of paying the high prices for replacement blades for what ever multiblade razor I had.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to any budget conscious individual!</li>
            <li>The feels loose and the first time I used it</li>
            <li>You only want to use that side if you have more facial hair to cut down.</li>
            <li>He has a heavy beard and the disposable ones get clogged up and no way to clean, and he goes thru a ton of them.  </li>
            <li>At first it would open or close properly.</li>
            <li>After years of not getting a decent shave, I finally returned to the safety razor</li>
            <li>There is a slight learning curve but nothing that doesn&#x27;t take a quick video and one shave to figure out.  </li>
            <li>I properly hydrate my face (hot water, towels) and use a quality shave mug and brush to whop up a proper lather.  </li>
            <li>I used two double edge plastic razors to one blade in this Microtouch One Razor Classic Safety Razor.</li>
            <li>It actually seems like the rebuilt a classic Gillette butterfly razor.</li>
            <li>Even disposable razors have no less than 2 blades each these days.  </li>
            <li>And the first thing I notice when I open it was how it open</li>
            <li>I will admit, I cut my head a few times (minor nicks), but after about 3 times shaving with this it got a lot better.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical from the low price, but these actually work very well and are extremely easy to clean out in the sink.  </li>
            <li>It will not hold the product very well unless you leave it on at a certain angle and pray that nothing makes any slight vibration your way.</li>
            <li>I have major allerigies to gluten and corn and its prob why my skin is so sensitive to the &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; razors.</li>
            <li>However due to the cheapness of this product several problems emerged to prevent a close, clean and bloodless shave.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>The price is right and the blades are sharp.  </li>
            <li>Back in High School and the US Army</li>
            <li>I switched back to my high price razor so I wouldn&#x27;t bleed to death.  </li>
            <li>;  ! :) Love the handle, blades are not sharp :(</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and spend a little more for one of the German models before you give up on the idea of double edged shaving.</li>
            <li>The razor dulls very quickly and it is not a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>Simple, two blades, long lasting, just all around better than the single blade setup.</li>
            <li>Even using great care in a steamy shower I sustained multiple facial lacerations for a mediocre shave result.</li>
            <li>The handle is to small, light in weight and</li>
            <li>I can usually get baby smooth on my cheeks, but the neck area still leaves something to be desired.  </li>
            <li>Well I was in the shower on the morning of our anniversary, cleaning up when she thought I was taking to long in the shower (which I was as i was shaving a very un-shaved area).</li>
            <li>It keeps falling out.i&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the blades that came with the razor,but i have not gotten a smooth shave yet.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made - too small.</li>
            <li>I found the handle short, the razor was not comfortable to use even after a hot shower or placing hot towels on my face.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t shaved with it before, take your time, don&#x27;t press hard, you will be fine young grasshopper, trust me.  </li>
            <li>Funny thing is I read the reviews and was careful with it</li>
            <li>So I went and bought normal size razor blades only to find that the Microtouch razor is smaller and will not take normal sized blades.  </li>
            <li>I tried every normal way to get the dial or knob to turn to open the razor.  </li>
            <li>After a little practice and your skin gets used to this razor, you&#x27;ll obtain super close shaves every time.</li>
            <li>I only have one word of caution - and this is about safety razors in general, not this one in particular.  </li>
            <li>This is one area where progress wins hands down.</li>
            <li>What razors cost today the money you&#x27;ll save down road is well worth it</li>
            <li>Nothing special wasted money too much work send it back and ask for money back</li>
            <li>I guess I could use an electric razor and set it so that it only cuts to a certain depth like a lot of younger guys do nowadays.  </li>
            <li>My husband likes the razor but finds the razors handle to be a little to short for comfortable use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking my skin simply needs to get used to the new razor, then it will calm down.</li>
            <li>But after a month of use, not even every day, the top became hard to open.</li>
            <li>My husband reports that the razor stopped closing properly after putting in a new blade--something bent or warped.  </li>
            <li>For me, this will be my new go-to razor for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to double edge razor shaving give enough time to get used to the routine and allow your hairs adjust to new style.</li>
            <li>so, I would give the new razor a 5 out of 10 overall.</li>
            <li>So I went to a local store and bought new blades.</li>
            <li>But, you have to pay enough to get a quality product and watch YouTube videos on how to use one if you don&#x27;t know or are new to one.</li>
            <li>I never asked for money back or for a new product.  </li>
            <li>tried this razor 4 different times w/a new blade each time.</li>
            <li>Good razor bad advertising rick harrison also known as homer Simpson and the whole family looks like the Simpson family</li>
            <li>I have a heavy beard and this product CANNOT begin to offer the same close smooth shave i get from my Gillette Fusion blades and razor.</li>
            <li>Razor handle is too short for comfortable everyday use.</li>
            <li>Based on many (but not all) of the Microtouch One negative reviews, I suspect possible quality control issues at the root of some consumer dissatisfaction as will be the case with any mass produced product from abroad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This may sound weird, but I look forward to shaving because I make it a fun event.  </li>
            <li>it takes 21 days to come from China, I gave up and ordered a different model from different company made of stainless steel not pot medal.</li>
            <li>MY OLD DOUBLE EDGE IS 44 YRS OLD</li>
            <li>I have sensitive to normal skin, I used the Fushion 5 for a long time, then switched to the Hydro 5.  </li>
            <li>He took his time to get comfortable with the razor as the instructions direct but he&#x27;s not loving it as the instructions said he would.</li>
            <li>Hubby forced the twisty mechanism on the handle and the entire top popped off.  </li>
            <li>I have this razor and used a few times but never really fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>not as good as the razor above but still good,just a little small.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t tug quite as much as a disposable single blade razor.  </li>
            <li>single razor blades for this do not cost much at all....</li>
            <li>If you want to try a single edge, you can buy one to try out for much cheaper than this junk.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very shocked &amp; pleasantly surprised to say that this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You cannot go wrong as most razors these days cost an arm &amp; a leg to use!</li>
            <li>Blades are not sharp.</li>
            <li>My first wet shaver!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!  </li>
            <li>First, order some Personna or other quality blades when you order the razor.</li>
            <li>not sharp enoght it will cut you</li>
            <li>, I can move right along with and really have to get clumsy to cut myself with it.  </li>
            <li>after several months the mechanism that you turn to open up the top for changing blades became harder and harder to turn.  </li>
            <li>THis product is just like 1960 all over it is not better safer or gives you a close clean shave.  </li>
            <li>This created an endless cycle of harsh, unsatisfying shaves, and so my search began for a better way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The one redemptive value of this product is that it has created interest in the old school style of wet shaving which is a much better, cleaner, less expensive and more satisfing method of shaving compared to the disposable three and four blade cartridges.  </li>
            <li>I guess they think it makes them look tough or sexy or something but to me</li>
            <li>Again, this razor is sharp and will do a great job, but slow down and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheaply made piece of junk with a dull blade</li>
            <li>used to use - and indeed it is cool looking, with extra blades and a little rack to hang it on...</li>
            <li>, these older style razors seem to be en vogue currently, no doubt due to the high cost of cartridges and some hipsters rediscovering them.  </li>
            <li>My primary complaint is that the razor is so unaggressive.</li>
            <li>closed which usually results in some more blood letting....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using safety razors since I was a teenager, and my wife gave me this because it looked similar to my 50 year old Gilette, but looks is where it ends.  </li>
            <li>You will cut yourself if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re used to traditional razors and so far one blade rusted even though it claims they are rust proof.</li>
            <li>It took some getting used to and it will cut you up if your not careful.</li>
            <li>I would recommend starting out with this one &amp; then once you get used to shaving with a DE, moving on to a nicer one with some higher quality blades (I&#x27;m going to buy the Merkur Long Handle &amp; Feather blades next).  </li>
            <li>Went back to my old razor.  </li>
            <li>This thing is barely over three inches and trust me, that doesn&#x27;t come off as an improvement with it in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Does not feel like the blade comes out far enough.</li>
            <li>Ordered direct from the company and was never notified of a 3 month back order.</li>
            <li>(I also like the Gillette silver blue blades), which are by far cheaper than buying cartridges.</li>
            <li>but it is an acceptable initial entry into world of old school</li>
            <li>No regrets at all.</li>
            <li>My husband is 46 years old and his grandfather and father both used this same razors that he is using today.  </li>
            <li>I also bought a shaving brush to apply my shaving gel with or will try some old fashioned shaving soap later.</li>
            <li>Current cost of replacement blade for my old razor ranged $8.00-$10.00 for 8 blades.</li>
            <li>Its old school and like all razors of this type, it requires patience, practice, and proper technique.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it a fifth star because it is not as well made as the old Gillette double edge razors.</li>
            <li>On this item you should follow the old ancient Chinese Proverb,  </li>
            <li>Over the years I have tried a number of different style of razors, primarily because I have a rather heavy coarse beard.</li>
            <li>A week later the screw inside broke completely.</li>
            <li>For this reason, when I took out my first blade (that I am still on after 7 shaves), I carefully smeared a tiny drop of Shave Secret oil on the top andbottom of it before letting it touch any water (NOT smearing in the direction to get cut).  </li>
            <li>Thanks but no thanks.</li>
            <li>my  husband cant stop raven about the razor he say it leave his face soft and smooth.and  the one blade last him a while.</li>
            <li>i went back to my old razor,and it made a world of difference on my face.</li>
            <li>However, I would ultimately steer a buyer toward a Merkur 34c, an Edwin Jagger DE89, or for the value conscious, a Maggard MR8.    </li>
            <li>(it always felt like there was too much razor blade exposed to the skin) and, in fact, I did cut myself once despite being careful not to.</li>
            <li>Too short and made out of an old beer can.</li>
            <li>This product is far below your standard.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s never had such a close shave and his skin is baby soft after use.</li>
            <li>So I just went back to the trusty old gillett sensor.</li>
            <li>Using the same blades that he used in the EJ, this razor was much rougher on his face and left numerous lacerations, where the EJ did not.</li>
            <li>But this thing is very cheap,and apparently you can&#x27;t get it wet.</li>
            <li>The shave itself is OK, but not great.</li>
            <li>I was tired of spending a lot of money for razor blades that have two or more blades.</li>
            <li>As soon as I learn what amount of pressure to use to keep from cutting myself and still get a good shave, I might be happier.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for a good, close shave, but what I got was shear disappointment.</li>
            <li>Was skeptical  because &amp;#34;as-seen-on-tv&amp;#34;, but build is quality and nicely weighted.  </li>
            <li>I loved the Hyrdo, but $30 a month is crazy for 4 blades.  </li>
            <li>me to get the closest shave, swipe down and then carefully swipe up(against grain) for a baby smooth skin</li>
            <li>I kept using the side with the wider gap (more blade exposure) and was cutting myself nearly every time I shaved!!!!</li>
            <li>THis razor you can open up and clean each time, and the blades stay sharp for a long time.  </li>
            <li>main pro to the razor is that in the long run, it will end up being significantly cheaper than multi-blade razors that are common now.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed on the first day that one of the butterfly flaps (that&#x27;s what I call them), where the blade is installed, wouldn&#x27;t go all the way down.</li>
            <li>Keeps the razor high and dry off the tub surface.  </li>
            <li>The multiple blades in the new razors are to prevent you from having to go over the same area over and over to get a close shave.</li>
            <li>I Mean Really Really Cheaply Made.  </li>
            <li>When I say smooth, I mean it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using safety razors for a little while now; I have a few various razors, the one is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>After using one side for a long while, I would switch to the other freshly sharpened side.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re tired of the huge prices of the multiple blade razors I can HIGHLY recommend these razors.</li>
            <li>remember my father using one of these and after buying several multi blade razors only to find the blades discontinued at my local store I tried this and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Seems extremely light and very small.  </li>
            <li>So much so that I ordered one for 4 other family members for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>As others have said, let the blade do the work, these are sharp and do not need much if any pressure.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that after a few shaves the blade is a little more forgiving.  </li>
            <li>I keep it pretty tight, though.</li>
            <li>I would notice a decline in shave quality by 5-6 shaves, typically...however, wanting to stretch my dollar as far as possible, I would refuse to change the blade until I had used it about double that amount, and the razor was to the point</li>
            <li>The handel is too short and blade not out far enough from razor edgeThe</li>
            <li>It feels cheaply made and does a terrible job even with good blades.</li>
            <li>kind of fool would keep buying the expensive razors with six or eight blades when you only need one.&lt;br /&gt;Great price also.........</li>
            <li>Now I pop in one single blade into my  Microtouch One Razor Classic Safety Razor and I can shave both sides of my face and back of my neck.  </li>
            <li>Dorco, the manufacturer of the DE razors that are used in the kit are not sharp enough for my chin whiskers.</li>
            <li>Was a little hesitant at first</li>
            <li>While this is not an adjustable DE razor, (using CAUTION) you can make it shave a little closer for your final pass (or make it shave a little more aggressively all the time).  </li>
            <li>I had give a little blood when I first got the razor, but after about 2 weeks of sticking to it, it doesn&#x27;t take me any longer in the morning</li>
            <li>Back to the high and dry comment.  </li>
            <li>I have been wet shaving for the past 2 years and have built up a decent collection of several new model Merkurs, Classic Gillette, Straight Razors, and single edge safety razors.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long the new blades last</li>
            <li>The hole idea of Wet Shaving is to shave while being wet right?  </li>
            <li>It never really felt like it closed right from the start, and the guard was a bit off causing the blade to scrape.  </li>
            <li>it fell apart when I took it out of the package and is a lot lighter weight than the same exact one I bought at Walgreen and have had for half a year now the one off Amazon weighed 33 grams or so</li>
            <li>but every other has been super sharp.</li>
            <li>Cut down on shaving costs, and you modernize an old product for a new generation.</li>
            <li>I was unaware of this and the blades are so sharp that I did myself some real damage on my bald head before I realized it was happening.  </li>
            <li>there are several different brands of razors that are adjustable, but i still have my old Gillette, and use the Gillette blue blades.</li>
            <li>I did get knicked up a few times at first, but once you get used to shaving with this style of razor</li>
            <li>I first tried it, the razor was uneven.  </li>
            <li>As explained in the documentation, the first few shaves aren&#x27;t all that.</li>
            <li>if I stepped up to the $40 price range for a butterfly razor I could get a closer shave but than again, This is my first few weeks in using this type of razor</li>
            <li>He cut himself a few times on the first couple uses but seems to have the hang of it now.</li>
            <li>Only effective on low stubble &amp; difficult to control w/constant risk of slicing skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this razor a few times since my first review.  </li>
            <li>I had to go over large sections of my face several times to get parts that I missed, and I had to follow that up with a conventional multi-blade disposable razor.  </li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t go fast with it just move it up or down and not alot of pressure, if you move it sideways yes you will get cut.</li>
            <li>The safety razor beats both disposable and straight edge razors hands down.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This would be a great razor for anyone new to wet shaving, but anyone who has been at this awhile would be disappointed with the non aggressive nature of this guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, use multiple short strokes instead of long ones like you would with the new multi-blades.</li>
            <li>noticed before the first shave with the other single edge razors, that the blade once put in, was not lined up the way it should be, not &amp;#34;equal&amp;#34; on both sides.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Not that difficult to get used to, I normally have a light touch with the razors--especially on my face</li>
            <li>I have since invested in Feather blades which provided a great improvement in the reduction of irritation, but overall I&#x27;m now disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Shaves great, but disappointed with short length of handle.</li>
            <li>Razor great no more expensive blades.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product because it was a gift, but I actively DESPISE IT!</li>
            <li>closest shave I&#x27;ve had in a while and much cheaper in comparison to the previous set up</li>
            <li>And as someone who wasted his time and money trying to get it to work over the last two months, that really, REALLY ticks me off!</li>
            <li>A little after shave balm soothed the minor irritation and I regarded the initial experience as a success.</li>
            <li>It does not shave as close as my Mach 3 in the same amount of time - you can get there with the Microtouch if you&#x27;re willing to spend twice the time taking little tiny strokes, and I was a lot bloodier with the Microtouch than I&#x27;ve ever been with the Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess I got caught up in all the hype of single old style safety razors.  </li>
            <li>Nothing like the closeness of a single edge shave, just like the old days, the way it should be and the way it should stay.</li>
            <li>This is EXACTLY the same thing and was less money!</li>
            <li>Not to mention the cartridge blades always seem to dull so quickly, even the second shave with one seemed to tug at the hairs.</li>
            <li>The handle is not long enough too.</li>
            <li>Not really flat, but in a plane, without twist or warp,</li>
            <li>Works as promised does not really take much getting used to save lots of money will last a long time...</li>
            <li>I gently and slowly shaved with a new blade.  </li>
            <li>Darn near sliced myself because of the loose blade .</li>
            <li>I read some bad reviews before buying it but more positive review</li>
            <li>I usually do not write reviews for products I dont actually own and use, however the purchase experience of this product was so bad I felt compelled to warn others to stay away.</li>
            <li>I was looking to save on razors, I usually use the Mach 3 which gives good results, and never irritates my skin, after using this one blade razor, I felt like it took much more effort to shave, I wasn&#x27;t really sure if it was cutting anything, and it irritated the crap out of my skin after using it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately the welding point in the base got rusted - not cool when you think that otherwise this razor looks awesome standing in your bathroom.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy so far, but I am still not sure about the quality of this razor, sorry Rick!</li>
            <li>Got the impression it was of better construction - seems a little on the &amp;#34;mass produced&amp;#34; at least cost side...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Third, the blades cut nicely, individually wrapped in paper, and packed in little cardboard boxes, so reasonable, environmentally speaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was a little surprised that the handle seemed shorter than I remember on my old safety razor too, but again, it has been years since I used one, and maybe I have just forgotten.</li>
            <li>a fingernail-sized amount will make enough lather for a full shave) and the replacement DE blades typically cost 1/10 or less than a multi-blade cartridge.  </li>
            <li>I learned to shave with a safety razor back in the early 70s and switched over to the old Trac II because it shaved a little closer.</li>
            <li>I gave ten USD for mine and it was worth my time and hard earned money.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> so this was a perfect torture test for this thing.</li>
            <li> Again, this is just a matter of how the razor pairs with my beard; it might be perfect for someone with lighter hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perhaps because the Microtouch is the perfect weight with the perfect length handle and perfect razor edge angling?  </li>
            <li> This allowed for the greatest degree of dexterity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying microtouch is the best out there, for all</li>
            <li> Best thing I ever bought!</li>

            <li> Husband did not feel it was a very good razor</li>
            <li> For the money, this is a very good razor.</li>
            <li> And a brand that&#x27;s best in one razor may not be best (or even good) in another, so the exploration must be done for each razor.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cost savings are incredible.</li>
            <li> This was.a brilliant gift ideal for my husband who use to use a dingle blade razor yeats ago.</li>

            <li> the included ones are rather good but its nice to buy a sampler to see what works best with your hair/skin.</li>
            <li> Harrison is real smooth!</li>
            <li> I love the stand that shows it off very nicely, I am very happy.</li>
            <li> This works great for me, purchased in December and use this 3-4 times a week with a good shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Rick, two stars is the best I can do with it.. : )</li>
            <li> But, I am glad to say this is a excellent razor!</li>
            <li> love it works awesome</li>
            <li> Great Product, my husband loved it.</li>
            <li> :P</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> nice finish and the razor stand are very handy and beautiful.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t able to get a very good shave with it.  </li>
            <li> Very good razor love lt WORKING GRATE</li>
            <li> Good shaver, inexpensive replacement blades.  </li>
            <li> I am used to shaving against the grain, however, and I&#x27;ll need to get used to using the blade before getting good use from it in that fashion.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how good this razor is for the money, someone bought for me as a gift.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but multi-blade razors are superior.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap to use, and that&#x27;s the best thing I can say about it.</li>
            <li> Its a good razor and you get a good shave, but the opening got stuck and broke when trying to replace razor.</li>
            <li> Not as good as my Gillette</li>
            <li> Received in good shape and time.</li>
            <li> The razor came damaged so I don&#x27;t know if shaves good or not.....</li>
            <li> , just does not do what it is suppose to do, and that is give a good shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M GOOD</li>
            <li> Good Quality for the price.  </li>
            <li> good for getting started.</li>
            <li> Hope all the money made goes to a good cause.</li>
            <li> My husband says it was a good shave</li>
            <li> The blades included are surprisingly good.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m just too used to HARRY&#x27;s, which I think is the best deal available  </li>
            <li> Spend your money on a good safety razor like merkur, gillette etc.</li>
            <li> he said it did a really good job on his bald head.</li>
            <li> Forgot how good these were.  </li>
            <li> My husband loved it.</li>
            <li> Not as good a product as</li>
            <li> Good DE blades can be had on Amazon for $12 to $18 per hundred.  </li>
            <li> This razor gives me as good of a shave as any multi-blade I have ever used</li>
            <li> Sometimes its good to go retro.</li>
            <li> Note you also need a good cream.</li>
            <li> As good as anything else.</li>
            <li> And check out the Nick Shaves videos on youtube for all lot of good information.</li>
            <li> Like the ads say, a person doesn&#x27;t need a six bladed razor to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> THIS RAZAR DO NOT SHAVE ME GOOD</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good safety razor for years, and this one fits the bill.</li>
            <li> This razor is advertised as if it the most incredible thing ever, but it&#x27;s identical to the one my Grandfather used...</li>
            <li> and you will get a good shave and probably won&#x27;t mangle your face.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality razor with good feel and balance.</li>
            <li> He loved the way it shaved his beard.  </li>
            <li> Feels good in my hand.  </li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking for a good starter Safety Razor to practice with to get a handle on how to use one, this \\&quot;As</li>
            <li> &quot; one is a good one to start with.  </li>
            <li> Exellent product at a fair price.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend a good quality shaving soap.</li>
            <li> The razor has a good feel and weight to it.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend absolutely loved it</li>
            <li> Quality of shave is good.</li>
            <li> Fairly good razor, inexpensive to use as replacement blades are a fraction of what you pay for those 3 or 4 bladed razors at walmart.</li>
            <li> Good:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good razor, have not used one of these since I was 16.</li>
            <li> It was good then and just as good now.</li>
            <li> Excellent smooth shave</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d have to admit it gave me a good shave that I was looking for how ever I went to wal-mart to try and find blades for it when that time comes and couldn&#x27;t find any there.</li>
            <li> You shouldn&#x27;t make the razor do all the work and expect good results.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job for removing hair fix the handle length</li>
            <li> and it would be a really good product.</li>
            <li> I know the Mekur is a superior unit.</li>
            <li> After getting a good shave with it, I was thinking about it and wondering, &amp;#34;Why</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband and he absolutely LOVED it.  </li>
            <li> Good shave with this blade</li>
            <li> Reasonably good value with the included blades.  </li>
            <li> For the money you get a fair shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> good handle</li>
            <li> to me, not as good as advertisement.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a good YouTube video called &amp;#34;Micro Touch One Razor&amp;#34; that describes how to use</li>
            <li> Good razor.  </li>
            <li> Good product to use with care.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li> An extremely good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Loved this razor .</li>
            <li> my husband loved it, had no complaints</li>
            <li> good shaving soaps have moisturizers), I then let it set for a moment and</li>
            <li> and if you learn to use it, will give you a good shave.</li>
            <li> Works Good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Originally loved this product.  </li>
            <li> Good size handle and seems well constructed.</li>
            <li> Could not get good angle on my head and ended up with lots of cuts</li>
            <li> A good buy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was truly hoping this would do a good job,</li>
            <li> He said it pulled at hi skin and didn&#x27;t give a good shave.</li>
            <li> I found it to be good product with one drawback.</li>
            <li> Again, I wanted to give this razor three stars, but just couldn&#x27;t and can&#x27;t in good conscience recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> good buy</li>
            <li> have since ordered a Merkur 34C, which I&#x27;m hoping will yield good results.</li>
            <li> not as good as advertised</li>
            <li> Works good on both.</li>
            <li> Good shave.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be fairly well made, but as I inspect closely, I see some variations in the thickness of the blade bed arms.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a good product that is inexpensive and works.</li>
            <li> it aren&#x27;t good</li>
            <li> you can buy on Amazon for a good price.</li>
            <li> Good quality razor.</li>
            <li> It does a good job and gives a shave as good as the Fusion I was using.</li>
            <li> It does not work to good.</li>
            <li> good luck</li>
            <li> Boyfriend loved it.</li>
            <li> It provides a nice lather that did a great job in softening my beard.</li>
            <li> Good old-fashioned razor.</li>
            <li> I gave this razor a good 2 months trial, but between the razor scraping and burns along with the use of a styptic pencil I could no longer stand the pain.  </li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll look into another safety razor as the shave, as I said, was quite good.</li>
            <li> Blade is really good too.</li>
            <li> I recommend buying some nice blades if your an experienced shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaves as good as anything ive used before.</li>
            <li> ... gave me a good shave.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give a good shave</li>
            <li> I feel like I could give George Clooney a run for his money in the good looks department (I was going to say Clark Gable</li>
            <li> But man, what a nice shave!!&amp;#34; Seriously,  Great product</li>
            <li> this razor is awesome very useful</li>
            <li> and it ,very easy to use,,,,give a great shave</li>
            <li> Very good quality and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The Razor in nicely built, has nice balance and works great.</li>
            <li> Anyway, great razor at a great price and the refills (gotta order them online) are dirt cheap compared to store-bought blades.  </li>
            <li> When you use it for the 1st time, it seems like it is not cutting well, however, after you finish, you&#x27;ll see that it cuts great!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the performance of this piece and plan to keep it until it is no longer usable</li>
            <li> Very cheap!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the quality of the razor &amp; the stand</li>
            <li> and my husband was very pleased.</li>
            <li> I was Very glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li> The blades that come with it work great for me, though you can take the time to find others that work better for you</li>
            <li> He is very satisfied with this razor.</li>
            <li> very happy worth the cost product</li>
            <li> Great shave better than the leading multi-blade razors at a fraction go the price.</li>
            <li> and i am very pleased with it..</li>
            <li> I assure you, if you make shaving a fun event, your Microtouch will be the best investment you ever made.  </li>
            <li> and he is very pleased with the quality and price.</li>
            <li> Great razor, Weishi for sure.</li>
            <li> It was more than I thought it would be works great</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for $20, including 12 blades and a chrome stand, and I must say that I am very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> Great way to save money and have a better shave.</li>
            <li> He is very satisfied with this razor.  </li>
            <li> like I said once i heal up my face is very smooth!</li>
            <li> but for the savings of the blades I am very pleased with the purchase.  </li>
            <li> Blades that came with it are good and the razor stand is a nice plus.</li>
            <li> Learn how to do it right for the best shave ever!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a very good razor and a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> Great product and much more cost effective over 3 and 5 blade razors.  </li>
            <li> do your self a huge favor to your self and your walet and get one !!</li>
            <li> Works for me...bought it yesterday at Walmart, used it before work, and was pretty impressed with the shave.  </li>
            <li> cheap piece of junk!!</li>
            <li> Also, shaving with the grain of the hair growth first, then against it produces the best, smoothest result for me.  </li>
            <li> I got an excellent shave the first time I used it, despite having forgotten how to use the gadget in 45 years.</li>
            <li> I dont care how many blades, you wont get a closer shave!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> but I love it!  </li>
            <li> I could give many reasons why this is not the razor for me but suffice it to say, this is a great idea on absolutely the best way to shave but the razor is cheeeeply made.  </li>
            <li> This one he&#x27;s satisfied with and he&#x27;s keeping!</li>
            <li> The first use, I was greatly impressed.  </li>
            <li> 100% satisfied!</li>
            <li> do yourself a favor buy a razor made in Germany you will love it!</li>
            <li> After 36 years of marriage to this wonderful woman this statement was a first for her.  </li>
            <li> and i love this razor!</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t impressed after the first couple passes</li>
            <li> By the bye, if you use this razor, you have better keep styptic pencil nearby!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this razor!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> My husband and son love it!</li>
            <li> Way better than paying $17 for 3 razors!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I own it!</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say I love it!</li>
            <li> Once you learn to use it lightly it works great and saves money.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> So happy this type of razor is available again.</li>
            <li> It provides a smooth shave that anyone would be proud of.</li>
            <li> Blades were real cheaply made razor</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy, well-built, well-crafted, works great, and the shave is close and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Works great but the blades it comes worh are cheap</li>
            <li> The razor blades themselves were still of good quality, but I can&#x27;t recommend buying this without being able to pick up the box.  </li>
            <li> If you can pick it up, you can make sure you buy the good one.</li>
            <li> Spend alittle more and get a good razor.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to this method of shaving, get a nice mug soap brush with badger bristles and go all the way with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, he is contemplating getting another safety razor, so he liked the shave while it lasted...</li>
            <li> my husband and I both use this (each have our own).</li>
            <li> and it did a nice job.</li>
            <li> I am loving this razor.</li>
            <li> IF you do good prep (shaving lather made with a brush from shaving soap or shaving cream, and not canned foam) and try a variety of brands of blades to see which one(s) work for you---and this razor works best with a sharper blade, like a Feather, Astra Superior Platinum, Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock SharpEdge, Voskhod, Personna Lab Blue, or the like.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this kind of razor for awhile just never did.</li>
            <li> The razor seems to have nice weight and length.</li>
            <li> was nice.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine gave me a nice shaving kit made by The Art of Shaving</li>
            <li> Nice close shave.</li>
            <li> My granddad used this kind of razor and he nicked himself a lot -</li>
            <li> A multi blade razor, (with a nice longer handle on it)</li>
            <li> If I liked it I planned to buy an antique quality one and keep this as a back-up.  </li>
            <li> Nice item, well built.</li>
            <li> I liked the razor for about a month after which it started to fall apart.  </li>
            <li> Very practical and a great gift!</li>
            <li> the cost is everything but not with how they work, the cost is weight, quality and build which this one is nice for its price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone wanting a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I put the Dorco blade in a Vanderhagen safety razor I own, and had NO problems.  </li>
            <li> Kind of defeats the purpose.  </li>
            <li> recommend to anyone who wants that wonderful close shave.</li>
            <li> Nice Razor.  </li>
            <li> Item not as nice as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> mom, being the kind hearted person she is, ordered this razor for me after I mentioned wanting to try it.  </li>
            <li> would have liked the handle to be a bit longer, but after shaving with it 3 times It felt nice, so  </li>
            <li> Handle is nice but the blades are what make a razor.</li>
            <li> To each his own, I guess.  </li>
            <li> cut the skin nicely.  </li>
            <li> That was all user error to be honest.</li>
            <li> can get the smoothest, best shaves you ever had from a DE straight razor.</li>
            <li> One video recommended going over your face three times which is kind of a pain in the ass</li>
            <li> Order this product and use it at your own risk.  </li>
            <li> He was thrilled.  </li>
            <li> Nice razor.</li>
            <li> Rick must be making a boatload on the product endorsements, but it actually is a nice DE razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy, well-built, has a nice finish, and provides a reliable shave.&lt;br /&gt;Tried ordering a couple of these from a popular online auction site, and got bit</li>
            <li> Nice it has the stand too.</li>
            <li> It looks nice sitting on the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> I tried it and although using it effectively took some finesse</li>
            <li> Nicely made.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to spend money on fancy handles and more blades just to get a good shave</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice to have a razor that the refill blades are affordable.</li>
            <li> Place your razor in the warm water to heat the blade.</li>
            <li> nice tips on shaving techniques providing in brochure</li>
            <li> and I wish they had been honest with me while I still had the packaging.</li>
            <li> The stand that comes with this is also nice to keep the razor on beside the sink.</li>
            <li> I use to own one years ago and then everybody went to plastic razors.</li>
            <li> This type is much more superior</li>
            <li> ......has a nice stand with it....</li>
            <li> Cleaning was fast and that is the best part of all.</li>
            <li> Honestly speaking.</li>
            <li> Its a nice looking razor</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as nice as the advertised pitch</li>
            <li> Boy, is this nice.  </li>
            <li> this razor was awesome and very affordable to use</li>
            <li> Good quality build, and extremely cheap!</li>
            <li> Safety Razors are the Best Way to get a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li> it worked great - he loved it - due to cheap manufacturing it broke after 6 months!!!!  </li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try a classic razor and this one works great!</li>
            <li> Used one years ago they are easier to clean then multi blade razors great to get a close shave again.</li>
            <li> has a decent weight to it.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy I decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> I get a great, clean shave from this system.</li>
            <li> However, the included Dorcos may not have the best rep, but i used them and received a decent shave.</li>
            <li> Best shave that I had in many years, still using my first blade.</li>
            <li> This is a decent razor at best.</li>
            <li> Very good saved me 40.00 the first month.  </li>
            <li> first time i used it i took  my time and got very good shave, i see people saying they got cut its not a safety razor</li>
            <li> This a great razor, for those who complain about it don&#x27;t know the true art of shaving.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a close smooth shave that he&#x27;s thrilled with!</li>
            <li> It is a great gift for $20, comes in a cool gift box.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am very satisfied with this razor and would recommend it to anyone looking for a better shave experience.  </li>
            <li> the face with warm water, make sure your face is feeling warm.</li>
            <li> Although some reviews said it was easier to cut yourself, he was careful and had no issues - happy husband, happy wife!</li>
            <li> this saved me lots of money on shaving, way better then those 14 dollar blade razors, i downsized and love the savings, and yes it shaves really good</li>
            <li> My husband has been looking for a good straight razor and this one is great.  </li>
            <li> but many more shaves for the price!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get what I believed would be the instrument for a very good, close, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Looks nice but very cheap.</li>
            <li> Very Good, Thanks....</li>
            <li> It good, i use it and leaves my face smooth, very easy to change blades.</li>
            <li> Personally I absolutely loved it the very first time using it!</li>
            <li> Be sure to warm the area with water and shaving foam or soap before use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure how to use it effectively.</li>
            <li> I use Derby Blades in mine with good results for cheap.</li>
            <li> The product is amazzzzing by far the best cleanest shave I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Junk at best do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> So every couple days I can have a fresh blade that and great shave!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good buy for cheap alternative.</li>
            <li> The price Amazon is charging for these is good, and they are the genuine article.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> It is the best razor by far.  </li>
            <li> Good razor leaves skin smooth used mine for 7 months before it fell apart</li>
            <li> This razor will pay for it&#x27;s self in a couple months with how cheap the blades are and the shave is just as good.</li>
            <li> the old fashion razor is one of the best and most economical razors out there from the best shave to the easiest to clean.</li>
            <li> Great shave right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> Not quite as good as the Gillette Proglide, but value wise, it does a pretty good job of getting a close smooth shave at a much more affordable cost.</li>
            <li> I love this razor, works well, easy to clean, and best of all, cheap to use.</li>
            <li> razor-- and good is always better than fine.</li>
            <li> wish it worked out better as it sure would have been cost effective.</li>
            <li> They may offer close shaves, but when trimming around beards they can&#x27;t get a good clean edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40 years old and have always used the latest and greatest razor.  </li>
            <li> good:&lt;br /&gt;It gives a good clean shave.  </li>
            <li> it took a few times to not cut myself up, but once you get used to it, it&#x27;s a great deal and a great razor !</li>
            <li> Great razor easy to clean</li>
            <li> Love it, works well, is light weight and does a good job.</li>
            <li> He says it is a good clean shave.</li>
            <li> I am somewhat surprised, because I have always been  perfectly well satisfied with your merchandise.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t ready to invest a significant portion of time buying the blades online or shopping around for the best price</li>
            <li> Great gateway razor to the Merkur- much higher quality.  </li>
            <li> Great deal and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Worked great at first.</li>
            <li> because let&#x27;s face it, if it&#x27;s too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
            <li> $15 seemed to good to be true</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad shave, just not as good as the disposable ones.</li>
            <li> I knew the price is too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Great shave, clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll do fine!</li>
            <li> Razor VERY cheap.</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Very cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li> Hubby was happy that I was able to find this shaver at Amazon at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Razor seems very cheaply made .</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made, but</li>
            <li> It is VERY cheaply built.</li>
            <li> He gets a very smooth shave and says it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; when his hair is a bit longer like the multi-blade razors did.</li>
            <li> It is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> The shave was very smooth compared to the multi-blade razors I had been using.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t order this unless you have a very very light beard.</li>
            <li> I tried this updated classic razor and I have to say it provides the best and most comfortable shave of all my razors</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been interested in making the switch to a safety razor like this for a while, and this was a great way to give it a shot without investing a lot of money (many safety razors like this style start out at fifty bucks and go up from there).</li>
            <li> , i even ordered the brush and soap, for hot lather shave, im happy :)</li>
            <li> This razor is nicely balanced and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The razor was adequate, good buy for the price of razor blades.</li>
            <li> I loved safety razors for years and have missed them on super market shelves.</li>
            <li> Good unit Classic look!!!</li>
            <li> Quality of the razor is fine; reminds my husband of his own father&#x27;s razor.</li>
            <li> it works but its very light, which isn&#x27;t the greatest thing in a double edge.</li>
            <li> great product razor is very high quality shipping was faster than another site I sometimes use.</li>
            <li> this is ok shave really&lt;</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> in all I consider this much better than the supermarket razors.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m still impressed with the build.  </li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery</li>
            <li> Satisfied with razor after using a couple of times.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li> Sincerely Michael Pisano</li>
            <li> Go with the van de hagan, better quality</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li> The razor is okay.</li>
            <li> So the &amp;#34;supplied&amp;#34; blades may seem flimsy, but they work better for me.</li>
            <li> I do not think he will use it more than once.  </li>
            <li> He shaved against the grain without adding more shaving cream.</li>
            <li> If you think your getting a top dollar razor here think again.</li>
            <li> the more blades the more you pay.</li>
            <li> This razor is the best I bought this Asa present</li>
            <li> I thought this razor would be like buying a better mouse trap.  </li>
            <li> Did not work as stated, I&#x27;m using a three blade disposable and it works way better.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this razor.</li>
            <li> So much better than throw away razors.</li>
            <li> love it....</li>
            <li> and it just seems more sanitary than the junk that gets stuck in multiblade razors.</li>
            <li> That is what I started shaving with many years ago.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, there are MUCH better razors for the novice.</li>
            <li> Would purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li> It is either a piece of junk, or maybe I could try better blades.</li>
            <li> I just tried again to make sure.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a fancy one then spend more</li>
            <li> The safety ravor is a lot better.</li>
            <li> Thought the shaver would be a better quality metal.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Smooth shave!</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> While I used to love this razor, it has now stopped opening and closing with ease.</li>
            <li> till you die or see if grandpa has one you can steal and send out to a reputable refinisher .</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this razor.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to the savings and enjoyably close shaves.</li>
            <li> fast shipping great razor</li>
            <li> It shaves ok once you get use to it.</li>
            <li> Now I am dismayed because I think he is fleecing too many people.</li>
            <li> the famous person on the package led me to believe.</li>
            <li> Excellent Service Will Be Back Again.</li>
            <li> it went away for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This does not work as well as my mach 3 razor, I have been shaving for twenty five years and this razor works but does require more effort and time to work, I also get a closer shave with my mach3 razor.</li>
            <li> Why would they be any better today.</li>
            <li> Outstanding razor.</li>
            <li> It seemed the more blades they added, the faster the razor clogged up.</li>
            <li> Can any one explain why a razor requires more than one blade?.</li>
            <li> It started out awesome but after a month the handle broke, not allowing me to open our close the head fully to change the blades or shave.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for more than 40 years.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s come out fantastic every time!  </li>
            <li> There are many options for shave soap &amp; brushes, I recommend experimenting and trying out various options to see what works best for you.</li>
            <li> product is ok , just not for me.</li>
            <li> Have to say I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Most of us learned how to shave with razors with pivoting heads/blades.  </li>
            <li> You do not need more than one blade to shave with.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off buying disposables</li>
            <li> not does it get the job done any better on the curves of your face, like around ones chin.  </li>
            <li> Probably has more to do with my R.A.D.  </li>
            <li> hope it is better.</li>
            <li> I have one &amp; love it.  </li>
            <li> YOU MAY HAVE BETTER</li>
            <li> It words OK</li>
            <li> Never will I miss my mach 3 and glad I set my son on path to much better shaving experience than I had.</li>
            <li> If you look for an instructional video then you&#x27;ll understand and you will love the razor.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I took the leap to try it.  </li>
            <li> They are much better quality construction.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My cheapness turned out to cost me more in the end.</li>
            <li> It does not compare to shaving with the Gillette Pro Fusion that I had come to love.</li>
            <li> I got so many cuts on my face after 3 stokes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I bought this razor.</li>
            <li> look for better quality.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have had the razor for about a month and love it.</li>
            <li> Spend a couple dollars more get a Parker.</li>
            <li> Better shave then multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li> It would be easier to manipulate around the face, making for a better experience.</li>
            <li> LOVE it :)</li>
            <li> Okay for a starter razor, but I&#x27;ve had it six months and the butterfly hinge has rusted shut.</li>
            <li> DE safety razors seem to be more of a luxury in today&#x27;s standars.  </li>
            <li> I love the shave this razor provides</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to get.  </li>
            <li> thanks to micro touch razor , rick harrison and alway&#x27;s great amazon</li>
            <li> I know that binding arbitration has an overwhelming preference for the company NOT the &#x27;injured&#x27; consumer</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this thinking you no longer need the more tech type shavers.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I watch my father shave with type of razor for most his of life.</li>
            <li> I love the Safety Razor, but the &#x27;supplied with it</li>
            <li> Would be better for men</li>
            <li> I have, like many guys out there, become feed up with the price of razor blades ($30 or more for 5 cartridges? -</li>
            <li> I have used mostly Gillette, Attra, etc.most of my life</li>
            <li> and I even purchased the better blades</li>
            <li> I used to always get ingrown hairs and razor bumps and now since i&#x27;ve started using this shaving method my skin on my face is much better.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s because of a shaved hair getting caught under the skin because you&#x27;re shaving more than hair off.  </li>
            <li> I replaced it with a Merkur which didn&#x27;t cost that much more</li>
            <li> , I came to Amazon and found one :)</li>
            <li> However, the blades did cost more.  </li>
            <li> You will love this razor.</li>
            <li> Fells cheap!</li>
            <li> I LOVE MINE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> It may be acceptable to some men, but others will not be satisfied with the closeness of the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its ok</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for a one day but not for more than two days.</li>
            <li> I think this was the best idea to come back into marketing</li>
            <li> you will get better item</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy again,  great product!</li>
            <li> absolutely love the product.  </li>
            <li> You will love it.</li>
            <li> Even Parkers are better than this.</li>
            <li> my girl wants one now for her legs lol.</li>
            <li> Had one many years ago, did not know that they were still around.</li>
            <li> More on that point in a moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should have known better than to trust something a cheezy Pawn Shop guy claims.</li>
            <li> Safety razors are the best shave possible.</li>
            <li> Sure, its not a $35 EJ or a $40 Merkur.</li>
            <li> suggest getting better blades; my preference is Feather or Merkur.</li>
            <li> Way better shave than the Lords, Concords, Astras, and Sharks I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> So my journey towards a better shaving experience began.  </li>
            <li> So many razor cuts had my head looking a crime scene.</li>
            <li> Take my advise and buy the more expense blades.</li>
            <li> Definitely not the best shave</li>
            <li> This type of razor requires a different style of shaving, I found some excellent tutorials on google, and when done correctly is the closest shave I have</li>
            <li> his favorite gift</li>
            <li> I just got this razor as a gift works better then</li>
            <li> It delivers an excellent shave when used with the proper touch.  </li>
            <li> but the blades need to be sharper,going with Wilkinson blades when i need more</li>
            <li> I think the stand is cute.</li>
            <li> This Razor is top of the line.</li>
            <li> I am going to purchase a better one now on Amazon.</li>
            <li> great buy and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure, and that might affect the quality of the shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure with more practice</li>
            <li> I will have a better quality shave, and my time frame will shorten also.</li>
            <li> The Lord Premium Safety Razor Model LP1822L was better than this razor.</li>
            <li> My wife also enjoyed it since i was shaving almost every morning because of how well I thought it worked.</li>
            <li> I have used a Gillette Mach 3 for about 10 years and love it.  </li>
            <li> Take your time and learn proper techniques and you will achieve the best shave of your life.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.  </li>
            <li> I will try some better blades when these run out</li>
            <li> Much better.</li>
            <li> This one blade is better than any shave I ever gotten from the Gillette Fusion blades I used for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this razor....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 20 years with cartridge razors and like most men</li>
            <li> After using for approx 15-20 shaves I love it.</li>
            <li> Also get yourself a variety pack of blades here on Amazon, not all blades are created equal and you&#x27;ll end up finding the brand that works best for you.</li>
            <li> Since they have no swiveling or tilting head you will need to learn to hold the razor at the proper angle that is best for your type of beard thru out the stroke.</li>
            <li> Razor was ok but the blades that came with it did not do the job, according to my husband.</li>
            <li> Love this razor.</li>
            <li> Just like the one I learned on many years ago.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves this, says one of his favorite gifts ever.</li>
            <li> I tried several times shaving with the razor and found that it does not produce a close shave without irritation, even though I used the best shaving soaps that were recommended.</li>
            <li> Many cheaper alternatives on amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> packaged razors performed underwhelmingly, I had better luck with others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I bought a MERKUR Bakelite which I love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
            <li> but I got used to it and its my favorite blade ever...</li>
            <li> it is okay</li>
            <li> I think I get a better shave with the multi blade and my electric.  </li>
            <li> Causes razor burn, better to get a multi blade</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> And best of all, the blades last and are a lot cheaper than multi blade</li>
            <li> twisting the handle stem opens top for razor replacement.</li>
            <li> but it was a breeze to use and does a fantastic job!</li>
            <li> and I think most of criticisms Ive seen are from people who are not used to using this type of a razor.</li>
            <li> Then the companies started telling me the more blades the better.  </li>
            <li> I also have more money to  spend on things besides razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;Bought</li>
            <li> I am sure that mineral oil would work just as well for preventing oxidation of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Never got a shave I was satisfied with and it felt clunky.</li>
            <li> Way better then crappy multiblades...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 99% sure he does not shave his head with this product.</li>
            <li> Face shaves ok.</li>
            <li> This ok.</li>
            <li> WOULD make a lot better.</li>
            <li> so many years wasting money on razors</li>
            <li> Looks appealing, but doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; it.</li>
            <li> To get a closer shave you may have to apply more pressure to the blade, risking a cut.</li>
            <li> Be prepared t buy better blades, I prefer Wilkinson</li>
            <li> The razor is ok, needs a better blade for better satisfaction</li>
            <li> I will look for some better blades--</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Learned real quick, now I love it.</li>
            <li> Nothing more.  </li>
            <li> My husband and son love this product.  </li>
            <li> TALKING ABOUT A SMOOTH SHAVE!</li>
            <li> How anyone could give this more than two stars, I do not know.</li>
            <li> could have gotten a better shave with my pocket knife.</li>
            <li> I will buy better blades and keep the razor.  </li>
            <li> 5 blades is better.</li>
            <li> I will look for a better quality one.</li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t listen to the nay sayers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> It has saved me hundreds of dollars on blades, and provides a nice, smooth, close shave.</li>
            <li> One blade is definitely better than 3.</li>
            <li> but glad I tried it</li>
            <li> Having the blade warm is a huge part of getting a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received it as a gift and wanted it as an inexpensive way to try shaving with a safety razor before spending a lot of money on a more upscale model.</li>
            <li> Grandson&#x27;s love the razors.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I needed more practice.</li>
            <li> I picked it up on a clearance and love it.  </li>
            <li> this is night and day better.</li>
            <li> no turning back after realizing this is the best shaving method ive ever found.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> and it did a much better job.</li>
            <li> but I could shave better with a butter knife.</li>
            <li> On top of that, the shave takes triple the amount of time.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find a better deal and no you don&#x27;t need a razor with 4 or 5 blades.</li>
            <li> Great product, and work very well</li>
            <li> The razor is a lower end for safety razors but still better than cartridges.</li>
            <li> Every man should be able to shave without a mirror.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Mach 3 for many years now</li>
            <li> You can get there in Microtouch, eventually, and with a lot more fussing around and discomfort; if you&#x27;re into that, then the Microtouch is the razor for you.</li>
            <li> My legs look and feel healthy.  </li>
            <li> Great shave fast shipping</li>
            <li> 3 blades, 4 blade, 5 blades, this one shaves better than anyone of those.</li>
            <li> Bought for my dad and he really like it, says it works great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, today, I tried it again, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> It might get better as my face gets used to it.  </li>
            <li> I have never been happy with the throw away razors both the shave and having so much material to throw out.</li>
            <li> Get the better blades.</li>
            <li> If you want a better shave with it go out and get some Feather blades to go alone with it.</li>
            <li> But the most dissatisfying issue with this product is the &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; factor.</li>
            <li> the more sevre the cut.</li>
            <li> And I had hoped I&#x27;d get a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I love the close shave.</li>
            <li> I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Will surely take some getting used to.4th shave and still workin at it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> So glad I grabbed this for a Father&#x27;s Day gift....</li>
            <li> It is everything and more than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I then when to Dollar Shave club and got their top of the line for $9 shipped to my door.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You would be better off trying to shave with a plastic spoon than with the one razor.</li>
            <li> its okay.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> I have used disposables that work much better.</li>
            <li> I like it, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s more of a involved process he uses it at home and a disposable at work.</li>
            <li> got the Microtouch today from their website, so I was able to get the case with mirror.</li>
            <li> The razor works better</li>
            <li> So smooth!</li>
            <li> I bought some Feathers and like them a lot more.  </li>
            <li> I also bought the Edwin Jagger DE89 for like 13 dollars more than I paid for this one</li>
            <li> I like the 3 piece way better than the butterfly.  </li>
            <li> Satisfied with product quality and delivery.</li>
            <li> Worked ok while it did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m opting to go with a better made safety razor.</li>
            <li> love it.  </li>
            <li> More, you CANNOT return it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ok if you want to shave twice in the morning.</li>
            <li> then the many challenges I had at the beginning disappeared.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get  a close and confortable shave without nicks or scrapes moving forward.  </li>
            <li> My dad is in love with this thing.  </li>
            <li> I learned to shave with a razor like this many years ago.</li>
            <li> Best Christmas present ever!  </li>
            <li> Better than the disposables I&#x27;ve been using.  </li>
            <li> , found it at a much better price and bought it.</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> I have never had a better shave with any razor.  </li>
            <li> Get the Feather Safety Razor; it is outstanding</li>
            <li> He said this razor gives a better result them any razor he has bought to date</li>
            <li> We both love the fact that it is a hell of a lot cheaper to get the blades</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> like it, don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> The blades can easily be swapped out with a very easy twist design for the top.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not easily giving up, I pursued my quest for a perfect shave and found it in purchasing the Merkur 34C which is quality built with a good weight and has a slight 30 degree angle and feels like a feather crossing your face and gives the closest shave that I have ever experienced.  </li>
            <li> Get a good safety razor and your in right.  </li>
            <li> Right out of the box it shaves good.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get an excellent shave that is as good or better than what I have been getting the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> Tried it out today and was very excited.</li>
            <li> Nice to return to the original again.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> They are far superior!</li>
            <li> Nice clean cut.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this is a decent entry level DE razor, I would not recommend it for an experienced DE shaver.</li>
            <li> Good product and in the long run a great value.</li>
            <li> So great, I was nervous about getting him something like this because men are so particular about these types of things...</li>
            <li> The design is makes it very easy to use and to change and secure blades.  </li>
            <li> Good solid construction, smooth opening and closing, a handy storage stand and a good, close shave.</li>
            <li> If these razors were so great, then they wouldn&#x27;t have invented something new, and subsequently BETTER.</li>
            <li> old school Razor work super great!!</li>
            <li> It does give a very clean shave, after my cuts heal up I have to get used to using it,but</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy, however read up on how to shave and the other products needed to successfully shave with the micro touch.  </li>
            <li> I was speculative at first, but after a couple weeks, it shaves just as good as my 5 blade</li>
            <li> I would say the Parker 24C is slightly more comfortable and more efficient than the Edwin Jagger, but both are MUCH better than this razor.</li>
            <li> For $20 this is a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> I loved the razor at first.  </li>
            <li> Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li> The best shave I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li> and it sliced up my face pretty good,</li>
            <li> Best buy in a long time!</li>
            <li> The finish of the micro touch is of course brand new, and it&#x27;s an attractive unit.</li>
            <li> Looks ok but easy to use.</li>
            <li> : It gives a VERY mild shave and you will not experience the type of closeness that a more aggressive DE razor can deliver.</li>
            <li> Easy to use safely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried it is is economical and effective.</li>
            <li> Good solid razor but does not give a good shave.  </li>
            <li> Take it from an old hand with these type of razors, get yourself a good badger hair brush and a nicely scented cake soap.</li>
            <li> Love it, gives a better shave than a 4blade disposable,  refill blades are cheap .</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Great razor for the price perfect for any one that wants an entry level safety razor but the blades could be a little better getting</li>
            <li> it came with extra blades which is so nice for this package,,and ,,i am very happy with what i got and how fast it arrived here to me,,very pleased..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely a fine razor, and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Yes, there is a certain old-timey romance in using an all-steel razor, but it doesn&#x27;t translate into a superior shave in my experience.</li>
            <li> nice looking product, highly polished chrome with a nice soild weight to it.  </li>
            <li> Love it, works fantastic and is way cheeper than store bought blades</li>
            <li> really glad I did give it a shot, this safety razor is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Whether you approach &amp;#34;DE&amp;#34; shaving to save money, or become a true devotee that spends many times the cost of the Micro Touch a year, it can and does (for me) bring many moments of enjoyment.</li>
            <li> (the multi-blades seem to move more smoothly over the face).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> On my first shave, I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the razors out there and this one by far does the job every time at a great price.  </li>
            <li> So far really happy with it.</li>
            <li> and I am happy with it so far..</li>
            <li> Ever looking for the safest and most comfortable way to shave, I ordered a Microtouch One razor when I saw it advertised on TV.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it does a great job for me.</li>
            <li> A great investment over the old disposable.</li>
            <li> I was able to get a free sample of the 5 blade razor called Hydro  when I bought Edge shaving  </li>
            <li> Great to shave with just like old times</li>
            <li> what I wanted works good, thanks</li>
            <li> The handle is very durable and the razors provide a good close shave.</li>
            <li> Fair, but you really shouldn&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> I had forgotten what a good shave really is.</li>
            <li> seems like a good shave when a person gets used to how much pressure one puts on the blade when closing the handle.</li>
            <li> I loved this package so much</li>
            <li> I was able to shave much more quickly and &amp;#34;carelessly&amp;#34; with this razor.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;it&#x27;s very important to have a clean shaver at all times.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this razor because it is the right size and the “heft” is nice.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a safety razor and read around for shaving suggestions, a lot of being successful in not cutting yourself must come from proper preparation and use of good shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> Overall good product!</li>
            <li> This is not like other \\&quot;celebrity\\&quot; endorsed products, this one really is as awesome as it&#x27;s claimed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He did buy other blades to test out what he likes best</li>
            <li> All in all, not a bad deal for around $20!</li>
            <li> Not a bad razor!</li>
            <li> Honestly not bad!  </li>
            <li> The cleanup is so easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and all as promised.</li>
            <li> It also, always makes me happy when I can get a better price, than at the local Wal....</li>
            <li> Easily nicks your fave.  </li>
            <li> Definitely more economical than cartridge razors, and a better shave I my opinion.</li>
            <li> The stand is a simple but elegant design and works great.</li>
            <li> Device is heavier than I am used to, but I will easily adapt.</li>
            <li> REALLY EASY TO USE AND MAINTAIN.</li>
            <li> However the unit does work as advertised, it shaves close and is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The razor provides an easy way to remove the grubby unshaven look that surfaced in the fashion magazines.</li>
            <li> The double edge razor is a great way to shave but spend the money on a top of the line</li>
            <li> only is it a great shave, it is somehow much more pleasing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very mild cut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to grab a sampler of different blades from Amazon just to see if there are any that work better for me, but the Dorcos that came with mine already work great.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my husband, who has a stubborn beard that easily clogs multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li> I also love how easy it is to clean.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> weighted well, the blades are easy to replace and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Product works well, easy to use and keep clean and for the money I love it.</li>
            <li> It rinses easily.</li>
            <li> Blades are inexpensive and easy to find.  </li>
            <li> I love a clean razor shave.  </li>
            <li> Easy to nick  your skin.</li>
            <li> and it still going strong (shaving 1 to 2 times a day, depending).</li>
            <li> But, the ones I used worked and they were strong and sturdy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fourth, the razor grip is good, and the handle mechanism twists open nicely for cleaning and replacing blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> please do not buy this product, I strongly recommend against it.</li>
            <li> It was described as a good beginner safety razor, with decent weight and quality to it.</li>
            <li> Nice shave, I like that you can change the blades very fast</li>
            <li> The angle is not right for the best shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a different shaving experience, so don&#x27;t expect your best shave right away, you need to get used to the feel of it.</li>
            <li> Impressive is the only word I can use to describe the performance of this entry-level, budget razor once I found the right angle of attack for the blade.</li>
            <li> Find the right Blade for your skin type and learn the proper method for the best shave ever!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice gift for someone who might be willing to make the switch over from cartridges)</li>
            <li> This was my first DE razor and I do kind of regret the purchase.  </li>
            <li> Not bad I think most of the problems people are having is the blades that came with</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor to replace those 4 blade junk razors and it works like a charm, I wanted a small one to travel with and this is a nice one, the weight is nice and the handle is pleasant to hold on to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now however, the new razors have a pivoting head and does not require you to adjust the blade to get good shave.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the new razors</li>
            <li> I can live with that because I plan on sticking with this type of shaving now that I know that it is superior to the cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> Hi the product is fine.</li>
            <li> Mine works fine and has for a year now.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t throw it around or use it to pound nails into the wall and it will work fine.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for a couple months</li>
            <li> Let the weight of the razor pull and you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li> The razor in itself is fine.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> The shave with the Dorco blades were fine.  </li>
            <li> It worked fine for about a week</li>
            <li> Works just fine.</li>
            <li> IF you know how to use a safety razor then you should be fine.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for one month.</li>
            <li> and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> I did just fine.  </li>
            <li> My brother says the shaver itself is fine</li>
            <li> I guess its fine but to me it takes longer and shave is not as close as multi blade razors</li>
            <li> ago)&lt;br /&gt;But once you learn  or relearn it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fine DE safety razor.</li>
            <li> the razor works fine and the addition of the stand was an additional bonus....</li>
            <li> The razor is fine, but the blades need improving.  </li>
            <li> seems work fine</li>
            <li> Once I figured that out I was fine with it.</li>
            <li> Will like it fine once I get use to it.</li>
            <li> It gave me a super close shave, better than multi blade razors.</li>
            <li> If you are in a hurry, I suggest your favorite disposable (I use them when I must shave quickly).  </li>
            <li> It must work better on bold heads.</li>
            <li> I love this Classic shaver!!!  </li>
            <li> The one is light weight which makes it ideal for anyone interested in DE shaving but are intimidated by old school shaving.</li>
            <li> Anyone that says this old single-blade &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; razor will give you a shave as good as a multi-blade razor is full of baloney!</li>
            <li> Awesome if you want a new age old school razor</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, easy to replace blades.  </li>
            <li> I do plan to eventually upgrade to a more aggressive safety razor, but I feel this was an excellent starting point while I learned the new techniques.  </li>
            <li> Maybe for guys (and dolls) that have light &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; hairs/beard, it may work fine.</li>
            <li> The four or five blade cartridges are just fine and cheap.</li>
            <li> Love the old razor, Shaving made easy nice close shaves</li>
            <li> If you really want to be kind to your face and if you are finished with razor bumps and ingrown hairs then try this razor, you&#x27;ll have the desired shave and the smooth skin you want.  </li>
            <li> Cheap cheap cheap.</li>
            <li> I got a huge divot in my lip to remember this</li>
            <li> So I bought FOUR MICRO TOUCH ONE razors because their was a huge sale going on</li>
            <li> , I personally enjoy something with a longer shaft on it.  </li>
            <li> Cheap quality.</li>
            <li> It is very well built and holds up nicely.</li>
            <li> fast shipping nice gift</li>
            <li> Smooth shave</li>
            <li> Yep it is cheap and it works.</li>
            <li> This is a Weishi and it won&#x27;t be as pain free as a EJ or Merkur starter line.</li>
            <li> However, I found I liked it very much, so much, that I bought my wife one for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> This is a cheap razor.</li>
            <li> I like how easy it is to clean</li>
            <li> that was easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t get through the free blades before this thing rusts shut.  </li>
            <li> Cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> buy the smooth sales pitch from Mr. Harrison.</li>
            <li> The wife says my face is as smooth as baby&#x27;s butt..</li>
            <li> They were cheap, dependable, and required no maintenance.  </li>
            <li> Easy to keep clean</li>
            <li> IMPORTANT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of cheap pot metal.</li>
            <li> I enjoy shaving</li>
            <li> Even if it didn&#x27;t work the joy he receive from the memories it brought up would be reason enough to buy again.</li>
            <li> It shaves smoothly, but that&#x27;s nothing to brag about.</li>
            <li> His face is so smooth after his shave no razor bumps,</li>
            <li> It gave me a smooth, close shave with no bumps.  </li>
            <li> I figured it is cheap</li>
            <li> /&gt;Learn from my mistake, don&#x27;t cheap out.</li>
            <li> The gillette opens and shuts like a well oiled machine and blades fit like a glove.</li>
            <li> But I did enjoy the way it shaved.  </li>
            <li> It does what is supposed to do and is a huge improvement over the cheap inefficient plastic razors men have been brainwashed to buy since the 70&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> razor is all metal, and feels comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> the price Husband was tried of cheap razors and some were pricy .He</li>
            <li> It worked well for about 2 months, then the razor stopped opening smoothly and I ended up breaking the actuating pin inside the razor.</li>
            <li> I applied light machine oil to all moving parts hoping to cure the problem.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver as the double edge versions go</li>
            <li> the wife was so amazed how well it work and easy to clean</li>
            <li> product itself is all metal and weighty but feels like a cheap mass produced item from China (which it is) but expectable at this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Metal was cheap.</li>
            <li> It gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Should have known from the cheap paper razors they send it with.</li>
            <li> Shaver functions smoothly.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Hay, guys, buy this for a great shave &amp; yes only 1 blade.</li>
            <li> If you want a light and semi-decent razor then this is the one.</li>
            <li> There is a reason the micro touch razor is cheap.</li>
            <li> No razor burn and glides smooth with a close shave.</li>
            <li> If the only option I had was to not shave, or shave with these, I would be happy to shave with these.</li>
            <li> My face is smooth with no nicks or cuts.  </li>
            <li> It works great and will probably last another lifetime or two.</li>
            <li> I enjoy shaving with it</li>
            <li> If you currently use the multi-blade razors and are happy with those, this may not appeal to you.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought this from Amazon then it would be a hassle free return.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to clean and feels like a quality product.</li>
            <li> Cheap made in china...</li>
            <li> CHEAP CHEAP</li>
            <li> Only used once but seems to be a great razor.</li>
            <li> Use the BIC cheap razors instead.</li>
            <li> Go with bic cheap razors instead folks..</li>
            <li> but I really enjoy shaving now.</li>
            <li> And for a product that should be  readily available, it took all 6 weeks stated for mine to be delivered.  </li>
            <li> It gives a smooth shave and unless you&#x27;re Michael J. Fox, you shouldn&#x27;t suffer any nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> My face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s keister.  </li>
            <li> but I enjoy shaving now.</li>
            <li> Some reviews make it sound like you have to learn how to shave all over again</li>
            <li> This razor is too light weight and</li>
            <li> how easy it is to clean.</li>
            <li> While everyone&#x27;s face and beard growth/density is different, this works great for me.  </li>
            <li> Appears to be cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> He seems to really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I had forgot how great shaving with a double edge safety razor was.</li>
            <li> Then I heard about the Microtouch One and bought it as soon as it was available at Showcase.  </li>
            <li> Cheap blades lasted two shaves.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable handling.</li>
            <li> but today&#x27;s razors are safer and &amp;#34;blood&amp;#34; free....</li>
            <li> Really fit in with today&#x27;s situation of saving money.</li>
            <li> Love it worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I light andgives a smooth shave</li>
            <li> Great starting razor.  </li>
            <li> Nice safety razor but does not give a very close shave.</li>
            <li> The razor is cheaply made, scratches your face, and has a tendency to cut you.</li>
            <li> What you see today are Chinese-made with cheap materials.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor to my friends if they want a close, smooth, and scar free shave.</li>
            <li> The construction is cheap.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> One recomendation, don&#x27;t skimp and buy the cheap blades.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done and has your face feeling smooth as a fishes belly with in minutes.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone wanting a smooth close shave.</li>
            <li> Face is smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> It is cheaply made and the opening-closing mechanism arrived non-operative.</li>
            <li> Precise, close shave.  </li>
            <li> it works and is gonna save us some cash since the refills are cheap as heck.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s what a smooth shave is suppose to be&amp;#34</li>
            <li> it is a scrapper and with this razor being so light the blade drags against the skin and will cause nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is a great product</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s actually very well built and looks nice in its stand.</li>
            <li> but this is built well and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> So nice to get a really close shave.</li>
            <li> He is a traditionalist so he liked the idea of using a retro razor and really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> I am still looking for that good old fashion razor.</li>
            <li> So far so good for me.</li>
            <li> A multi blade system is far superior in that sense.</li>
            <li> A multi blade system is far superior in that sense.</li>
            <li> I myself tried it because a good friend had been on a search for a better shave and he is a freakin hairy beast of a human being,  </li>
            <li> Complete Junk, Its made in China, Good Luck.</li>
            <li> This razor is a good gift idea and is a well put together complete kit.</li>
            <li> good old school razor</li>
            <li> good old fashioned razor handle needs to be longer</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the purchase of this item, very good quality, really easy to handle, good presentation and accessory to save is very good, the only thing I&#x27;m not contemto is size, as it is a bit small, and should in be a little longer, but you adapt, I recommend it 100%.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, the kit came with 24 blades and a case, which this particular package being sold on Amazon doesn&#x27;t have, but this one here does come with a nice stand, which is something I didn&#x27;t think about - a nice extra I would have liked to let the razor air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Take your time shaving and make sure you are doing so at the right angle if you&#x27;re having issues.  </li>
            <li> Like many of the other 1 star reviews it worked great for a while</li>
            <li> the whole package including 100 blades was cheaper than buying the replacement blades (5) for the razor I was using..........should have thought of this sooner....!!!</li>
            <li> IT SHAVES CLEAN AND EASY TO CLEAN THE BLADES</li>
            <li> The stand is fine if working at the sink, it would not work in the shower unless you have a special or built in shelf to support it.</li>
            <li> I like a clean smooth shave that won&#x27;t leave me with a five o&#x27;clock shadow at noon...</li>
            <li> Used like it said to and could not get a clean, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Build quality seemed decent, but weight was kind of lacking in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, this got me interested in DE shaving, and I ended up getting a Edwin Jagger DE89bl&#x3D;much more precise.</li>
            <li> My Husband says its a pretty good razor, he has been using it for about a month and really likes it.</li>
            <li> is well made, opens very easily and closes very well;</li>
            <li> So basically if you&#x27;re new then go for it but don&#x27;t expect to have it your entire life like some of the merkur razors out there, but it&#x27;s a perfect starter.</li>
            <li> Those new to this kind of shaving should be patient - it does take time to become comfortable with a &amp;#</li>
            <li> These razors just work and are super easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> My husband has such sensitive skin so buying him a very good razor is important!  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t cut my throat, success!</li>
            <li> OK for a first time safety razor.  </li>
            <li> I have been on the original blade now for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> worth it in the end!</li>
            <li> I use mine for the first time today and i love it..</li>
            <li> This razor is based off of the original Glilette patent.  </li>
            <li> The original S&amp;H fee was $4.99.</li>
            <li> My husband was excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li> The significant issue is the cost.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need to get familiar using the shorter handle and let the weight of the razor do the work.</li>
            <li> My first safety razor, i love it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as my original razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I have bought many items off amazon and this the first review I&#x27;ve given.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve written and hopefully won&#x27;t have to do many more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My original razor I purchased fell apart.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this and was sorta excited about shaving with this style razor again.</li>
            <li> works great and hopefully saves me money in the long run.</li>
            <li> I needed to re-apply the lather after a first pass, much better with the lotion.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure that this razor is not representative of all safety razors, but this one did not do the job advertised.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to compromise quality when you purchase this wallet friendly Razor.</li>
            <li> and I was excited.</li>
            <li> Go buy a original vintage one for $20 on eBay.</li>
            <li> I originally gave this a 5 STAR review, but now after 5 months I need to change it to 1 STAR.  </li>
            <li> Certainly works better than the light multiblace disposable razors.</li>
            <li> The advantage here is a nice new razor.&lt;br /&gt;The razor would be classified as medium aggressive, meaning that it is neither aggressive or nonaggressive.</li>
            <li> I prefer my Excel for clean shave.</li>
            <li> liked the shave, but can&#x27;t open the razor any more</li>
            <li> Once you do, after 2 or 3 shaves, you&#x27;ll notice a totally clean shave.</li>
            <li> After use, I carefully clean it and put it on the stand that came with it.</li>
            <li> my job requires me to keep a totally clean shave.</li>
            <li> He uses it whenever he shaves and reports that he has a clean shaven feeling.</li>
            <li> but well made, clean, and it works.</li>
            <li> so I could clean it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and economical.</li>
            <li> Blades are super cheap, just get them from the dollar stores..</li>
            <li> that give smooth shaves but wear out quickly, and are getting way too pricey.</li>
            <li> Clean shave</li>
            <li> Especially with shark blades, they&#x27;re cheap gorgeous blades.</li>
            <li> Whenever I see someone who does that I always think, &amp;#34;Grow a beard or shave your face clean but make up your friggin&#x27; mind!&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Clean, close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li> The most important thing is not to apply much pressure and let the blade do the work.</li>
            <li> Good shave, will not be going back to cheap plastic ones in store.</li>
            <li> close and clean shave.</li>
            <li> when,i shave my neck,i have too go over,and over,and i still don&#x27;t get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> was looking forward to having a razor that would give me a clean shave.i</li>
            <li> So, save your money and buy gillette and clean the razor, or buy into the dollar shave club or use dorco&#x27;s website to buy razors.</li>
            <li> I kept the razor clean and up to that point</li>
            <li> You try and try to go over spot and doesn&#x27;t shave clean.</li>
            <li> I soaked the whole thing in wd-40 for a couple days, then was able to free it up with pliers.</li>
            <li> The blades are cheap and rust quickly.</li>
            <li> My razor centers the blades well, and rinses cleanly.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the first shave seems closer than the overpriced 5 blade razor I previously used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still glad to own this razor, but you can purchase a vastly superior DE safety razor for mere dollars more.</li>
            <li> I loved the first one, that my wife bought for me at Wal-Mart, the razor was heavy and as good as razors costing more than twice as much.  </li>
            <li> : )t certainly  </li>
            <li> special deal.</li>
            <li> They had a special going on where you got the razor and 24 blades for $19.99.  </li>
            <li> Wanted to try an old-school safety razor and this one looked decent compared to some of the cheap ones without spending a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Well made and works much better than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> Great razor - my husband loves it so much better than the multi blade razors that cost a small forture to buy blades for it.</li>
            <li> The boar brush and wet shave is great.</li>
            <li> I finally got a genuine Micro Touch One and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I love the thought of using antiques and have used a true straight razor before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shaves pretty close, very cost effective.</li>
            <li> My hair is very coarse so waxing isn&#x27;t a good option for me either.  </li>
            <li> Frankly, with the use of this razor, I no longer get &#x27;stressed&#x27; at the thought of someone touching my face...which makes me very</li>
            <li> I think its got a cool retro vibe also</li>
            <li> it looks good but just don&#x27;t work for me,so will have to look for a larger razor</li>
            <li> Feels like it should last for a good while.</li>
            <li> When you really think about it who the heck even needs more than one blade.</li>
            <li> Which is much more cheaper then the modern multi-blade cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> The end result is once you try a good saftey razor you won&#x27;t go back to cartridges.  </li>
            <li> Overall good shaving tool.  </li>
            <li> 5 stars are not enough, this razor is better then I expected, and everybody should buy one, and one for your best friend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a full beard for 30 years, and since I&#x27;m not on Duck Dynasty</li>
            <li> After using this for almost a year I&#x27;m ready to upgrade to something better.</li>
            <li> or so it provided a closer shave than more modern razors.  </li>
            <li> It really does do a better job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a different style of shaving that yields a superior result.</li>
            <li> Many thanks to Amazon and to this company.</li>
            <li> I saw it advertised by the guy from Pawn Stars, and thought it was a cool looking throwback safety razor like dad</li>
            <li> For the price I thought it would be a good starting point to try one out.</li>
            <li> and it is much heavier built and works a lot better.</li>
            <li> This is a good double edge razor.</li>
            <li> pleased with it all-around for the cost</li>
            <li> Almost everything I read about it told me the same thing, that once people made the switch, almost everyone found it a much better, more comfortable way to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You need to marry this razor with proper face hydration and a good shavingsoap.  </li>
            <li> I think I made a good choice overall.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea however and found an old model Gillette made in the USA with one of those cups and brushes.</li>
            <li> The micro touch cut smooth and let your skin fresh and feeling.</li>
            <li> Have to make several passes to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> So if you are looking for a better shave, at a much lower cost, try a safety razor.</li>
            <li> It is true &amp;#34;they don&#x27;t make&#x27;em like they used too&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> People need to understand that it take more finesse to use a DE or straight razor.</li>
            <li> and I thought it would be cool.  </li>
            <li> I shaved with the Microtouch three times (twice more than I really wanted to but wanted to give it a fair try) and finally conceded that I had been duped (ripped off).</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use the razor in an upwards motion after the initial downward motion, then you miss a good portion of your beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but no a big deal their lot of good blades</li>
            <li> Good as an introductory product, but not made to last.</li>
            <li> Have only used it 3-4 days - still haven&#x27;t found it all as good as advertised.</li>
            <li> Came early which was nice.</li>
            <li> I found this razor not only gave me a clean shave, it was nice and easy on my face.  </li>
            <li> It is not really a bad deal.</li>
            <li> the weight is not bad you get use to it he says also bought of</li>
            <li> But, its actually not bad comparatively, at that price point.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product at all.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice well made razor that is near identical in all respects to the classic Gillette superspeeds, of which millions were produced.</li>
            <li> Once you have that down, you&#x27;ll be rewarded with a great, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> The main thing with these razors is learning not to expect a one swipe clean pass like many men are used to through using multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li> and the stand that comes with it is super cool.</li>
            <li> Be sure to swish the razor in the sinks warm water to clean the blade.</li>
            <li> I was about to try a second discount brand of multi-blade cartridges, but in my quest of finding a better, more cost effective way to shave, I learned about the old school method of using a double-edge safety razor.  </li>
            <li> The best thing to come from the purchase is the little stand that comes in handy to use with my 6 blade razor, keeping it high and dry off the counter which is very important.  </li>
            <li> Not only am I happy with the shave I get, but I am happy to report no more cactus legs when I sleep with my wife.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still sharp and works great.</li>
            <li> sure you shave after a hot shower to soften your whiskers, Use pre shave oil, then a badger hair brush, some Cremo shave cream, and enjoy a real shave.</li>
            <li> and it made quick work of it.  </li>
            <li> just a good old fashion straight razor.</li>
            <li> If you are lucky and bought it on Amazon you might get your money back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quick</li>
            <li> Yes, it takes a minute or two longer, but it&#x27;s worth the extra time for a good shave at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> good razor, not a great razor, but exceptionally good for what i paid for it.  </li>
            <li> Too many passes to acquire a decent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is an ok razor and if you like the quality of the shave you will likely purchase a much better one elsewhere</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;a lucky find.</li>
            <li> I bought this, luckily discounted.</li>
            <li> My razor of comparison is a &#x27;58 Gillette Super Speed.</li>
            <li> The razor arrived quickly and is well made.</li>
            <li> I have been using double edge razors since the 50&#x27;s, and the best one is the adjustable double edge razor.</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;ll want to upgrade really quick.</li>
            <li> The razor seems well made, with the construction seeming quite adequate.</li>
            <li> I have more nicks and cute than with my traditional heavier razor.</li>
            <li> If you need to shave quickly this razor may not be for you.</li>
            <li> If it is tightened all the way, then backed off even a TINY amount, it will set the blade at a more aggressive angle for shaving (but use caution and make sure you still see it bowed from the side).  </li>
            <li> It shaves too aggressively in some areas and too mild in others...</li>
            <li> However, for a few dollars more you can get a good safety</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor and so far i&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
            <li> word of advice, although the razor does come with 12 replacement blades (a quick rinse after use is all you need.</li>
            <li> The disposables clog so quickly.</li>
            <li> Husband was able to get it back together; it does shave okay, but it pulls a lot.  </li>
            <li> Cheap but not as good as I would have expected from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a good shaver and a great alternative to expensive disposables.</li>
            <li> A little light and fair quality, but cuts just fine.</li>
            <li> Enjoy it very much.  </li>
            <li> but if you pay a little more you can get a much better razor and a much better shave.</li>
            <li> But honestly if you&#x27;re in the market for a double edged safety razor and do not want to spend an arm and a leg for a good one, watch eBay or your local antique shops and get a vintage gillette super speed or fat boy.  </li>
            <li> just right in order to get the clean shave.</li>
            <li> It is more economic (thinking about how many blades come with it, and how long do they last) and the shaving quality is great.</li>
            <li> Works great, better than the more expensive Mercur razors, which have a screw on/off head.  </li>
            <li> When you use a DE you have to use a good quality Shaving Soap and brush, a sharp blade and a light touch.</li>
            <li> and I really do get much closer and more comfortable shaves from my disposables.</li>
            <li> Hinge broke very first time</li>
            <li> I am on my third and very satisfied with them.     </li>
            <li> I tried it out, and managed to get some good shaves, but not for long.</li>
            <li> A litte bit small in my large hands, but it provides a great shave!</li>
            <li> Better off with the galette 4 blade much more comfortable and smooth, this product is not smooth</li>
            <li> It is very sharp and does a great job.</li>
            <li> great shave, very sharp blades</li>
            <li> Works well but just doesn&#x27;t have the weight and build quality of my other safety razors but it is an excellent choice for my shaving kit when traveling, I don&#x27;t mind loosing a $20 razor as much as I would once costing 5-6 times as much.  </li>
            <li> My son loves this...much more economical and effective than the other fancy, shmancy razors out there.</li>
            <li> This model is nice, easy to load &amp; clean, &amp; the blades are really sharp.</li>
            <li> That said, it is a better shave than any of the new razors offer.</li>
            <li> I decided to give it a try anyway, because the experience I had with my previous razor had not been great.</li>
            <li> good overall first impression.</li>
            <li> Aside from a barber&#x27;s straight razor,  the micro touch will give you a way closer shave vs the easy mode multi blade razors.  </li>
            <li> Shave is smooth, and I like being able to open and clean blade.</li>
            <li> (These are places that a modern disposable easily navigates.)</li>
            <li> This particular one is a cheaply made knock off of the original, and I do not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we&#x27;ve been looking for!  </li>
            <li> The razor was not as cheaply made as I expected &amp; it had pretty good heft to it.  </li>
            <li> I having owned other safety razors can honestly say that this razor is a piece of junk!  </li>
            <li> really close....!!</li>
            <li> and I went to change the blades, not one, but BOTH of the razors twist handles to open the top part of the razor, were stuck!</li>
            <li> They are inexpensive and work very well!!</li>
            <li> ,it was my first time with a safety razor and didn&#x27;t cut myself, !</li>
            <li> I kept trying to get my boyfriend to shave on a consistent basis and it was this razor that did the trick!</li>
            <li> I liked the product so much that I reordered a new one for myself in February.  </li>
            <li> Hubby did not like the lack of straight edge for fine shaping.</li>
            <li> At first I opened after each use to clean blade.</li>
            <li> The razor is fine, but the blades could stand much improvement.</li>
            <li> This is a great little Razor.</li>
            <li> The razor is great but the blades that come with it are a little flimsy.  </li>
            <li> Looks nice, chrome top and handle and comes with a little stand to suspend it upright on the counter.  </li>
            <li> nice razor just wish the handle was a little bit longer put happy with it.the razor last longer than fusion</li>
            <li> I got a very nice, close shave off of this one razor versus the three and four blade setups from other companies that way overcharge for blades (which is why I was drawn to safety razor shaving in the first place).</li>
            <li> Very tinny and cheap.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;UPDATE\\&quot; Been using this for a few weeks; works great.</li>
            <li> It works great per my husband and he has always had a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> This is a pain free, close shave but, be ready for the after shave splash</li>
            <li> Got a very close comfortable shave, I would recommend it for anyone that needs to shave.</li>
            <li> I had about two days worth of growth</li>
            <li> Within a week one side of razor top sprung, wouldn&#x27;t close completely.</li>
            <li> So for the price I picked one up, and it was worth it.</li>
            <li> this is the closest shave and with no cuts, also brings back those memories of his dad using this kind of razor.</li>
            <li> #34;Yes, It truly is worth it&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> Good idea, made with cure platedbmaterial versus actual stainless steel.</li>
            <li> It would be such a nice travel razor with the nice kit and short handle.</li>
            <li> I rarely write a product review but this item has eliminated my cost of shaving for life.  </li>
            <li> The head is HUGE, and you have trouble getting a good shave around the edge of your lips and under your nose.</li>
            <li> If you have never used a safety razor, it is worth it to read the instructions and not get in a hurry.</li>
            <li> The Dorco blades aren&#x27;t worth the surplus scrap they were made from.  </li>
            <li> and I rarely get cut,</li>
            <li> this item may throw you for a curve, but I have to say it is worth the purchase and time to learn to use it.  </li>
            <li> razor is worth it.  </li>
            <li> you only get 12 blades with this, not the 24 like on the TV deal, also a case did not come with mine, but a nice chrome stand.</li>
            <li> But once you get a hang of it, its pretty cool to use.  </li>
            <li> but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I saw Rick (from Pawn Stars) advertise this on TV several times before I paid attention.</li>
            <li> Liked it enough ordered my son set from amazon.</li>
            <li> worth</li>
            <li> The handle is way too short for a grown man to use effectively.  </li>
            <li> the old Gellate had a lot more feel in your hand, but would cut you.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li> The razor is nice and solid.</li>
            <li> This razor shaves better than the old safety razor and the blades cost $0.10 each.  </li>
            <li> ,,worth</li>
            <li> It has succeeded beyond my wildest imagination and is a distinct value at its price point.</li>
            <li> Worth the money if it holds up over time.</li>
            <li> I have been using mine for hundreds of shaves, and I rarely if ever get cut.</li>
            <li> Had to shave the same spot over and over to get my skin smooth my 3 blade disposables work better</li>
            <li> To top that off I have extremely sensitive skin and am prone to bumps and irritation.</li>
            <li> compact double edge razor ........... nice shave .........</li>
            <li> Outstanding seller who ships immediately without waiting for funds to clear unlike some sellers</li>
            <li> That alone makes it worth it.</li>
            <li> Far better than multi blade razors.</li>
            <li> well worth it.</li>
            <li> The quality is nice and he loves just rinsing it clean and letting it dry.  </li>
            <li> Its worth getting compared to the multi blade rip off.</li>
            <li> This one is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Got mine for $10 and worth every cent.  </li>
            <li> well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Blades at $0.08 cents apiece rather than $4.00 makes this a smoking deal and worth the time to re-learn the process.  </li>
            <li> The Microtouch One took three times longer than a cheap disposable razor to get a close shave and the multiple passes created much more razor burn.</li>
            <li> I would like to start by saying that I rarely write reviews on products unless I have a reason to.</li>
            <li> Buy a good double edge razor for 10 or 20 dollars more, and definitely don&#x27;t judge a de razor based off of this one.</li>
            <li> I returned it and CVS was nice enough to accept the return.  </li>
            <li> The top flap came off completely and it nicked and scarred my face.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that was a rare fluke, but I guess not.</li>
            <li> They just don&#x27;t work,i should have asked around to see if anyone else has had the same results as,i have.&amp;#34; Have a nice shave &amp;#34; dh</li>
            <li> I hope this is useful for some and that it does take take</li>
            <li> It is fun to shave again.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this one for me as a gift, I had mentioned that I had a razor like this when I was younger and really liked that one.</li>
            <li> It will take some getting used to, but it is worth it, trust me.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to cut yourself with this classic razor and the sharper the blade</li>
            <li> but it seems to be ok so far.</li>
            <li> I found I get a far better shave using the Wilkinson blades.</li>
            <li> My old Gillette adjustable was better, but they are now collectables.</li>
            <li> Gets a good close shave but just has to be careful he doesn&#x27;t cut himself.</li>
            <li> I have had a traditional shave done by a barber and those kind of shaves</li>
            <li> Worth</li>
            <li> Lots of fun lathering up each morning with the boar bristle brush and cup of shaving soap.</li>
            <li> They say things were better in the old days.</li>
            <li> Not as good as expected.</li>
            <li> well worth the change from Mach razors.</li>
            <li> This razor isn&#x27;t worth your money or your time.</li>
            <li> This is a good starter safety razor for beginners to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Time will tell, but so far, I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> it’s time to put this thing on the sink and get a useful mach type razor out of the cabinet.</li>
            <li> My dalliances with this razor confirmed I’m not one of them, nor am I willing to allocate the time required to use this one as compared to zipping along with the higher priced cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would just buy the bic single blade razors... 2 stars is because it is packaged nice, and looks cool in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> particular brand razor worked just great for me straight out of the box with the standard blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes a few shaves to get used to using these classic razors, but once your comfortable, they provide a great shave at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> The one isn&#x27;t so mild that seasoned DE shavers will be turned away by it.</li>
            <li> This, combined with a good shaving soap and a bottle of Old Spice, will bring you back to the days of yesteryear and leave you clean shaved and refreshed.</li>
            <li> He has only had to change blade once in more than a month because this one he can take apart and clean.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to at first but works great after that.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t have a full beard because the sides are soft and too sparse, yet many passes are needed, and the blades wear out fast.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the system works greats and comes with a good amount of blades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The other factor  that is involved with how good of a shave</li>
            <li> Shaves 1/2 as good as a twin blade disposable but extremely heavier.</li>
            <li> Other than that, good investment.</li>
            <li> $20 bucks for a razor which will seemingly last a decade seems like a good value to me, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> If your one to rush through your morning, this might not be the best razor for you, but if you can slow down and allow yourself some man time in the morning, this razor will give you an amazing shave.</li>
            <li> I can shave with this thing right out of the shower, no cream, and I go upwards against the grain, no problems and no cuts.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box, it worked like a dream.</li>
            <li> The right  creme/brush/blades ..</li>
            <li> and this was not the right product.</li>
            <li> Even shaving at a 30 degree angle it still took the skin right off.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li> your time with it and it will treat you right.</li>
            <li> Mine was bent right at the safty bar.</li>
            <li> Once you learn and have the right equipment it puts all the multi razors to shame.</li>
            <li> and yes I was turning it the right way.</li>
            <li> For the average person the might be thinking this is cool and a good way to get into wet shaving but honestly for $15 you&#x27;d be better off just throwing it directly into the trash can.</li>
            <li> Not the right choice for shaving ones head...</li>
            <li> comes with 12 razors if i counted right.  </li>
            <li> This works well if used right.</li>
            <li> If you look through the side of the razor as you tighten a blade in, you can see how it &amp;#34;bows&amp;#34; the blade up into a curve right as it starts to max out, setting up the angle at which this razor was meant to shave at.  </li>
            <li> And they have every right to be, since they have to use it every day... on their face</li>
            <li> and I think that helped because I could feel it done right.</li>
            <li> right out of the box</li>
            <li> right  </li>
            <li> Right up to my expatiations of the product.</li>
            <li> With the right razor and blades, plus some learning time, the results are everything people claim.</li>
            <li> This is neither the right razor nor blades.</li>
            <li> The covers on top were loose and did not want to close easily after I had cleaned the blade.</li>
            <li> I got this for my dad for fathers day he had been looking for a straight razor for a long time he absolutely loved this</li>
            <li> if a lawsuit for normal nicks and cuts wasn&#x27;t dismissed immediately the company, and society as a whole has a lot more to worry about.  </li>
            <li> Bought a local grocery store brand of razors and got a better shave and didn&#x27;t have to use a ton of shaving lotion and after shave to cool my burning skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely much easier to clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, I don&#x27;t think thinks provides a closer or more comfortable shave, but if you figure out how to use it correctly, you&#x27;ll save money in the long run.  </li>
            <li> First I thought it was just a commercial thing, but then I tried and to be honest</li>
            <li> It saves so much money monthly and it does a clean shave.</li>
            <li> My husband is really happy with it, although he reports it takes a little practice to get the knack!</li>
            <li> After retiring I figured I&#x27;d go back to the great way of shaving and decided I&#x27;d try something cheap to see if I was really going to get back into it</li>
            <li> Thought it would give me as good a shave as back in the day (the 60&#x27;s) when this was one of a few style of razors available, but that was when I had more &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; than beard.</li>
            <li> He says you do have to pay more attention and be more careful because cuts and nicks are easier with this razor, but at the same time, this razor provides a much better shave and lasts longer than the disposables on the market now...</li>
            <li> If you are new to real shaving this is an okay try out.</li>
            <li> A very smart add</li>
            <li> It gives a very mild shave and even a beginner is not likely to have problems if he takes his time and uses light pressure.</li>
            <li> I was allured by how cheap it would be to get a single blade razor versus buying more blades for my Gillette Pro Fusion.</li>
            <li> It is an ok product, actually works well, just surprised that it as most things was made in China...</li>
            <li> four was great now not sure if it was the blade on not</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s OK if your the type of person who barely grows hair.</li>
            <li> My legs are usually full of scars and very itchy.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say, I am getting a better shave from this razor than the newer, more expensive models.</li>
            <li> Not worth a penny if you can&#x27;t get a good shave.</li>
            <li> Appears to be good quality and blades are sharp!</li>
            <li> I can honestly I will never go back, I am highly impressed with this single blade razor, I would recommend it for anyone wanting to back to the old school razors.</li>
            <li> so it took a little getting used to, but overall I was very happy with the job it did.  </li>
            <li> There are better razors out there for a little more money</li>
            <li> This razor is good looking and the blades are very sharp.  </li>
            <li> The razor itself is very comfortable to hold, easy to load blades into, and in general is very forgiving if you&#x27;re new to DE shaving, as I was.  </li>
            <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t qualify as a \\&quot;safety razor.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible!</li>
            <li> and I think I made the right choice for my first one.</li>
            <li> and they give this razor a new meaning to fresh clean shave</li>
            <li> Overall good quality, handle is short, needs to be an adjustable setting for a closer clean shave</li>
            <li> That way, only one thing has changed and you get a better determination of if it worth your time and money.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t close completely and cuts my face too easily.</li>
            <li> I thought this was initially a great Razor only to discover that the Razor rusted shut which means that I cannot replace the actual blade.</li>
            <li> Gave good shave but head broke off in less than 2 months</li>
            <li> Minor cuts the first shave, now that I&#x27;ve used it a month I am loving the close shave.</li>
            <li> The microtouch provides a neat trim line to my beard, is easy to clean, and the blades last through a number of shaves.</li>
            <li> I have an old style straight razor that does a better job than this.</li>
            <li> Believe me, it does not take much getting used to and the shave is much closer and smooth.</li>
            <li> reason why I only gave it 4 stars, ironically, is the same reason why it&#x27;s great for beginners.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, simple to clean</li>
            <li> but, shave is faster, easy to rinse and clear the blade.</li>
            <li> Do your homework, spend a few more dollars and buy a better razor.</li>
            <li> looking forward to use this razor, shave ok but to many nicks, waste my money, don&#x27;t buy, unless u want to cut yourself every shave</li>
            <li> I can really whip around and do a quick shave with the Mach 3, but not so with this razor.  </li>
            <li> good too get back old school shaving</li>
            <li> It was light, flimsy and just felt cheap all around, not like described on video by different reviewers.</li>
            <li> Also a light second shaving lightly against the grain was needed for a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I bought it because of how simple and easy it is to clean</li>
            <li> Works like brand new again!!!</li>
            <li> Comes in handy if you shave once per week, since the single edge of the blade does not clog up like a multi-blade razor</li>
            <li> Nice single blade shaver but not for me.</li>
            <li> You can buy a nice sturdy single blade razors from any beauty store like sallys etc.</li>
            <li> tried Dorco&#x27;s equivalent razor, not bad at all considering how much cheaper it was, but I still wasn&#x27;t totally satisfied for the same reasons I was unsatisfied with Fusions.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest adding some better blades to your order right away since you will be needing them in the future anyway.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised quick delivery thanks.</li>
            <li> have to be very gentle with it</li>
            <li> The trick with this razor is to take your time and don&#x27;t use very much pressure.  </li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d try something with more weight and just one sharp and precise blade.</li>
            <li> This razor is satisfactory, but I expected more insofar as the clean shave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and has no &#x27;down side&#x27; that comes to mind.</li>
            <li> This thing reminded me that the old classic designs were so much better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe Rick Harrison has developed a methodology for shaving his head but as far as I’m concerned once I get to the area where I kind of remember having a widow’s peak (when I didn’t get a nice sharp line)</li>
            <li> lasted a year of hard use then rusted but for the price great.</li>
            <li> The blades are very reasonable &amp; last for many shaves.  </li>
            <li> I love the quick release action so I can empty clumps easily and often.</li>
            <li> razor gets right up to your beard line and offers a precise razor clean edge and with a simple stroke allows you go have clean neck and cheek</li>
            <li> To much pressure it doesn&#x27;t shave close enough, to little it strips your skin off like skinning a salmon wish it had a stop for the perfect tension on the blade.</li>
            <li> If you get this, I highly recommend you go for the full &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; shaving setup with a shaving brush and traditional shaving cream or soap in order to get the most out of this</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband and he likes it much better than the traditional razor.  </li>
            <li> They never last more than a week or so.</li>
            <li> Thanks to MicroTouch 3!</li>
            <li> The top 2 plates were out of line and the razor doesn&#x27;t close properly.  </li>
            <li> First time using a safety razor</li>
            <li> Years ago when I first started shaving, this is what you used.  </li>
            <li> first time opened</li>
            <li> A bit to get used to, more so than a commercial disposable blade type.</li>
            <li> Whichever comes first.  </li>
            <li> To my amazement I continued to get excellent results with the same blade, shaving daily for an entire month.</li>
            <li> so I tried it two more times with the same results.</li>
            <li> My face is worth whatever Gillette wants to charge for their multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li> Grate razor, has sam weight and feel of my first razor 45 years ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s back to the good old world of straight razors for me.</li>
            <li> Overall the product is ok, I would probably give it a 3 or 4.</li>
            <li> They are my first double edge experience but seems like there could be better blades out there.</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time having never used a safety razor before.</li>
            <li> , I really wanted to, but as I labor through my shaves, this has not been a fun experience.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to be like my Dad, filling the sink with hot water, lathering my face all up and coming away with what I thought would be a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I butchered my face with the first pack, thinking my skin would &amp;</li>
            <li> Find yourself a decent Gillette adjustable or even a Gillette Super Speed or Flair Tip.  </li>
            <li> He will be returning to his old cheap razors.  </li>
            <li> but these were far from cheap.  </li>
            <li> Prices soon climbed to more than $20 for a pack of 4 blades at local retailers.  </li>
            <li> So I bought the Microtouch One; and tried it for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for im sure a more expensive safety razor would be even better</li>
            <li> Kind of a rough shave ..</li>
            <li> In fact the blades fit an old Gillette i had.  </li>
            <li> Merkur is one that ive read about but did not experience first hand.  </li>
            <li> Being my first time using a DE</li>
            <li> This razor meets all my expectations except one; the handle is too short and a longer handle is needed in order to get a better grasp on,</li>
            <li> no biggie&lt;br /&gt;Fully able to open and rinse our hair</li>
            <li> I first gave this razor a 5 star.</li>
            <li> My first shave was not as close as I get with my Merkur razor and Persona blades.</li>
            <li> Cut up my face first couple of shaves.</li>
            <li> first time user......love the way it works,&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Magical unicorns will not appear and tickle your man bits while cherubs dance above you.  </li>
            <li> I never got to use it,it broke the first time I was putting the blade in I</li>
            <li> This product fell apart the first month</li>
            <li> Our stepson used the Microtouch One Razor for the first time and had never used one before.  </li>
            <li> Shaves pretty well.</li>
            <li> Two cuts on the first shave.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> I would advise anyone interested in a DE safety razor to start off with something affordable, but do it cautiously.  </li>
            <li> my husband got his razor today and used it for the first time</li>
            <li> There is a risk, through use exactly as designed and intended that the user will suffer injury,</li>
            <li> I bit trick at the first time</li>
            <li> First use of a safety razor</li>
            <li> OK, My review will be similar to another that I read before buying this...</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptic, but now I am sitting at my computer after shaving and I haven&#x27;t even put my pants on yet.</li>
            <li> First, I would like to thank John Harrison.</li>
            <li> I am 57 years old and now for the first time in my life, I enjoy shaving.</li>
            <li> Really!)</li>
            <li> Fast delivery to boot!</li>
            <li> I never even cut myself on the first try.</li>
            <li> will give it to him for his Birthday next month! :)</li>
            <li> Razor is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Just keep your face covered in hot water and soap with every pass</li>
            <li> The stand is sadly the best part of the eintire kit.</li>
            <li> Was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> It sounds surreal</li>
            <li> Installing the first blade was easier than I thought.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the acquisition of this item</li>
            <li> Keep them in the back of your drawer in-case you run out of your favorite blades.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve used Gillette and many Gillette knockoffs as well as various style</li>
            <li> After that I began my search for a higher quality razor, and I realised my mistake.</li>
            <li> I followed instructions the first time, hot shower,</li>
            <li> , I thought it wasn&#x27;t working at first because I couldn&#x27;t feel a thing, and I was scruffy as hell.</li>
            <li> wanted to write a review after the first shave, but to avoid comformation bias I waited two weeks and shaved</li>
            <li> No nicks first time out, so I&#x27;m sold on this one.</li>
            <li> Grew up with this type of razor, first shaving with one as a 19 year-old Marine.  </li>
            <li> Worked well at first them broke.</li>
            <li> It seems that I am constantly trying to find a better grip to shave my face.</li>
            <li> He was skeptical at first,  but says it&#x27;s the best razor/shave he&#x27;s ever had.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor.</li>
            <li> Although I cut myself the first time using it</li>
            <li> If this is your first de razor please try anything else.</li>
            <li> I love it, it takes regular blades</li>
            <li> Thats a simple aproach to shaving, and it washes better than a multiblade</li>
            <li> I was a scared of shaving the  first time</li>
            <li> Have been using safety razors for many years and I have to say that this razor gives me a shave equal to my Merkur and Jagger razors.</li>
            <li> Shave in the direction of the hair growth first, rinse and re-lather, then shave again against the grain.</li>
            <li> it did a number on my head first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but I would not trade in my double blades for it.</li>
            <li> but for men with simple beards it will do ok</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay what they wanted.  </li>
            <li> I started shaving many decades ago using a razor very similar to this.  </li>
            <li> it worked for my Grand Dad and my Dad why not me.&lt;br /&gt;Some traditions should be left to die.</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t think he would after becoming used to what&#x27;s on the market in general.  </li>
            <li> and they last a month or more.</li>
            <li> My first shave with no cuts and no razor burns.</li>
            <li> The first time.</li>
            <li> First time ever used a razor like this.</li>
            <li> We used them exactly two blades and</li>
            <li> so you have some hot water in the sink.</li>
            <li> If you want to get into shaving with a traditional safety razor, I doubt you&#x27;d get much better for the price.</li>
            <li> I almost gave this product three stars, but just before writing this review, I decided to inspect my razor closer and noticed I could no longer open the top anymore</li>
            <li> I had to use a pair of pliers to twist the top lids open (and cut myself twice doing it).</li>
            <li> I will probably be looking for a slightly higher priced razor soon.</li>
            <li> The TV commercial had me convinced I would get a better shave and save money</li>
            <li> i think its kinda short 4 most guys</li>
            <li> I love it and would totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am not getting cuts &amp; scrapes like I was when I first started using it.</li>
            <li> First of all the stand won&#x27;t hold the razor.</li>
            <li> I used one of these years ago when I first started shaving</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably buy another one but a different brand as I wouldn&#x27;t feel confident in the quality or craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> The price of everything is getting higher.</li>
            <li> After trying this item I&#x27;m 100% satisfied and with the extra 50 blades</li>
            <li> Microtouch One&#x27;s marketing makes a big deal about not needing more than one blade</li>
            <li> about 30 shaves out of each blade, shaving after I shower and using Pacific Shave Oil instead of cream/gel, bringing my grand total for blades per year to a whopping $24.00.  </li>
            <li> first shaving experience did not go so well.  </li>
            <li> I should have done some research first because it turned out to be a mistake.</li>
            <li> My first observation has to do with quality.</li>
            <li> First, I thought I would get a closer shave</li>
            <li> ;-)  </li>
            <li> This is my first attempt at using these types of razor.</li>
            <li> it is a better shave though compared to traditional razors</li>
            <li> Overall the experience with this razor is enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Go with the grain first then go against the grain.</li>
            <li> After the first week, I tossed the junk &#x27;5 blade&#x27; disposable razors.</li>
            <li> Again this was my first time shaving with this razor</li>
            <li> Love the razor, I have bought others similar to it, just not at all the quality</li>
            <li> , that was the first thing I looked at.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not difficult to learn to use.</li>
            <li> Well if you prefer the 1938 Willys over the present day cars, you&#x27;ll love this razor.</li>
            <li> The ergonomics of the modern day razor, in my hands, is so far superior to this razor that it outweighs&lt;br /&gt;the benefit of low cost.  </li>
            <li> needs to be more precision,each side cuts differently</li>
            <li> This razor is not an exact precision instrument.  </li>
            <li> but once I learned about shaving  while holding the blade in a 45 degree angle and to heat the blade just by running hot water on it</li>
            <li> It is exactly what my husband has been looking for.</li>
            <li> My husband really loves this razor and we are saving money not buying disposable razors!</li>
            <li> although I find I have to make several more passes than I ever have to with the cartridge type razor.</li>
            <li> There are a few good videos on  how-to shave with safety razor on youtube.  </li>
            <li> The new stainless steel blades are great and should last longer than the old</li>
            <li> ,it is latter bit short but it very nice product.i can recommend this product to anyone who want to get very close shave.</li>
            <li> when it arrived, he was very excited to open it and try it.</li>
            <li> He is right though; all he wants is your money.</li>
            <li> The handle of this model is also much shorter than I would prefer, obligating me to hold it just under the head to get both the amount of pressure and angle right.</li>
            <li> I kind of expected a little better quality of razor, but it works and that&#x27;s the important thing.  </li>
            <li> The blades are only good if you shave everyday, If you don&#x27;t shave for a few days the blades don&#x27;t cut the hair very good.</li>
            <li> so far just make sure you clean it properly and no problems.</li>
            <li> I guess for the chineese thing this is its fine but do yourself a favor and spend a few more dollars on a much higher quality product.  </li>
            <li> The razor cut very close, was gentle against the grain after the initial pass with the grain, and was extremely easy to clean.</li>
            <li> (my youngest boy had more toilet paper corners on his face after using product for the first time).</li>
            <li> Got this for my father in law it was something he was asking for he was all excited when he got it reminded him of the old time razors.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still super shinny and my favorite part is that when he shaves it lasts longer than the other store razors.</li>
            <li> I bought one for my son a couple months after I bought mine because I really liked the whole wet shave thing.</li>
            <li> In fact I think any of the Classic Safety Razors is worth a try if you are as fed up with blade prices as I am.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely coarse facial hair and unless I can rinse through the cartridge they get clogged easily and shave more like duct tape than a razor.</li>
            <li> Shave was good - it didn&#x27;t last a year - the razor would not open to replace the blades</li>
            <li> smooth close shave, leaves face soft and with out whiskers would recommend to everyone who is looking for a very close shave</li>
            <li> I was always left with short stubble no matter how good I got at using this dang thing.</li>
            <li> With modern technology Double edge razors and blades have been perfected over the years and are vastly better than years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> My favorite way to shave was the Adjustable Injector with a six pack of blades ran almost a $1 per blade that gave me about 3 to 4 shaves per blade if I showered first, no matter how long my beard was.</li>
            <li> Just have to get used to it, it&#x27;s heavier than a more modern style and if you run low on shaving cream</li>
            <li> I have finally returned to a safety razor and it works just as good as a razor with multiple blades.  </li>
            <li> Side by side they are similar in the head, but the handle is a slightly more modern version on this.</li>
            <li> nice to go back to the old style razor.</li>
            <li> razor is a great buy, and most of the reviews I have seen that are negative sound like people who did not use proper technique and punished themselves with cuts!&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say anything but positive remarks about this razor and hope to see a come back of DE razors!</li>
            <li> Once you get the angles right, take it very slow you will see how great this is.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, there are better quality razors out there and if used daily you need to spend more!</li>
            <li> Using the twist to open on the Micro touch, it sounds cheap, squeaky, and at times the butterflies need assistance to shut right.</li>
            <li> Woefully underwhelming shave - to put about as much of a positive spin on it as I can.</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t care for the Dorco blades it came with, I&#x27;m having great results with other blades in the same razor.  </li>
            <li> First bought a Straight Razor.</li>
            <li> I love  double edge razor shaving, it&#x27;s simple, practical and comfortable.</li>
            <li> yes it has worked very well and still using my first blade</li>
            <li> Being my first safety razor, I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.</li>
            <li> After getting the razor and using it a few times I was very pleased with how well it worked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually very efficient and shaves pretty close</li>
            <li> Cause even on light fuzz it barely does the job.</li>
            <li> All though, he was very nervous when he first tried it -</li>
            <li> Wish this was made with higher quality stainless instead of plastic.</li>
            <li> So you&#x27;d be better off with the real deal or a low cost modern razor.</li>
            <li> I get as good a shave, if not better.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little longer, but it works great, it is also a much faster and enjoyable shave,  minute to lather up the shave soap and apply, then the shave itself only takes about 20 to 30 seconds, rinse, wipe, Alum, after shave, and done, but even though its faster, its more relaxing, no more fighting trying to get the hair to rinse out from between the multi blades, no more shave cream all over my hands, this method is a lot cleaner, plus using the brush on your face just feels good.</li>
            <li> It is much gentler on the skin (my reason for adopting the method in the first place) and slows life down just a bit in a nice way....</li>
            <li> and I knew it was a mild razor, but I was unprepared for how mild it actually was.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read and been told that the blades are extremely sharp, therefore we want to make sure we do it right.</li>
            <li> The shave from this razor is not even as good as the cheap generic 2-blade disposable (the blue ones that you&#x27;ve all seen).Even with proper moisturizing, lathering and DE techniques I learned from watching Youtube videos, my face is still scraped, nicked and razor burned.</li>
            <li> The husband is  getting  a better shave than he has in a very long time.</li>
            <li> Blades can be changed easily with a twist of the handle to open the head.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and comes with plenty of extra razors.</li>
            <li> When the razor is installed you can shave from either end of the head allowing you to easily shave with and against the various grains of your face without having to turn the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Classic razors like this as far back as I can remember have always had nice solid handles that were 5 inches or more long and made it easy to wield around ones face for that very reason.  </li>
            <li> It brought back the old sensation that shaving should be somewhat of a pleasure, and it is suitable.  </li>
            <li> My approach was with light pressure at first and it simply would not move.  </li>
            <li> While you have the warm water running close the drain slightly</li>
            <li> So, gentle readers, I ask you this:  How in hell did this $20.00 Microtouch razor shave me as good (if not better)</li>
            <li> They are well made &amp; good quality steel that will last a long time.</li>
            <li> More of the blade is exposed in a single system like this</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s enjoying the single blade again.</li>
            <li> Over time your skin will become more accustomed to the single blade.</li>
            <li> I tried a single razor, I love it</li>
            <li> I still feel stubble in certain places after using this.  </li>
            <li> I have large hands</li>
            <li> Certainly a disposal problem.</li>
            <li> I am certain</li>
            <li> I quickly came to realize that pivoting in a razor is very important as in order to use the Micro Touch One to shave as close as my Gillette Mach 3 that I would have to have the flexibility of a Cirque de Soleil gymnast to maintain an effective cutting angle.</li>
            <li> Maybe your results may be different, but all I can say to you good reader is that the Micro Touch One single bladed safety razor</li>
            <li> Maybe your results may be different, but all I can say to you good reader is that the Micro Touch One single bladed safety razor</li>
            <li> Held the blades fine and did a decent shave but even with consistent cleaning the internal screw rusted through in about 2 months.</li>
            <li> but it does a slightly better job than a more traditional multi blade for less money.</li>
            <li> Seems fine to me,appreciate them bringing it back.</li>
            <li> one point my father-in-law suggested this product (not specifically, but a classic razor with disposable blades like how &amp;#34;he used to shave&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> This razor design has a convenient twist open butterfly top which makes changing blades very simple and quick.</li>
            <li> Cleaning the razor is very important to get a good shave and throwing it away just because it&#x27;s dirty</li>
            <li> So, my advice to anyone who doesn&#x27;t need a shaver with fourteen blades, it&#x27;s own shaving cream squirter, or neon lights attached to the handle, is to buy this nifty little razor.</li>
            <li> but I liked it aside from a little razor burn.</li>
            <li> Only those who are married to the idea of using a classic design, despite the discomfort and safety concerns, could enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> My hubby loved this surprise - a little old school</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good razor go ahead and spend a little more money on a german or english brand.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and with a little guidance he was able to get a good close shave without cutting his face.  </li>
            <li> I realized the blades are extremely cheap and left me very irritated after a shave.</li>
            <li> I was a bit concerned that there was some tugging as I shaved, but when i switched from a shaving gel to an actual foam (a cheap Barbasol foam worked very well in fact)</li>
            <li> My wife told me this morning she really is please with results; my face is no longer red and irritated and incredibility smooth.</li>
            <li> I got this because I pitched a fit last time I had to buy modern razor blades.</li>
            <li> Works OK, have to be careful how much blade one cranks into it.</li>
            <li> I will no longer be wasting my money on cheap razors that cost so much and just don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> The makers claim that the razor is made of chrome plated solid brass, and the handle may very well be, but the rest of the razor seems to be made of cheap chrome plated diecast or pot metal.</li>
            <li> product is a piece of JUNK and the whole promotion is a scam.</li>
            <li> It does shave very close.</li>
            <li> The blades were absolutely garbage.</li>
            <li> It gives me very close shaves</li>
            <li> Also, yesterday the razor screw somehow broke - it is responsible to lock the blade in the razor.</li>
            <li> I find that I prefer Wilkinson blades available locally.</li>
            <li> my whole face</li>
            <li> This is straight razor shaving without a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband who saw it on TV and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> He would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very well made razor, just like the safety razors that everybody used before the disposables came out.</li>
            <li> Was a gift but he like it real well.</li>
            <li> but it works very well.</li>
            <li> It still does not open and close smoothly.</li>
            <li> It will work reasonably well</li>
            <li> That combo has treated me well and has been very</li>
            <li> Otherwise it is an absolute pleasure to shave with.  </li>
            <li> works well, can really give you some gashes</li>
            <li> I gets a real close</li>
            <li> Better and easier than I expected.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Ended up having to use pliers to change blades then the whole thing fell apart.</li>
            <li> Make sure the razor blade is seated correctly and the razor is tightly closed.  </li>
            <li> However, much to my surprise, this is the closest shave I have had in years.</li>
            <li> He really likes it.</li>
            <li> Seems like quality product, very shiny metal.</li>
            <li> this one gets the job done very well.</li>
            <li> Much to my delight</li>
            <li> And a whole lot cheaper than to keep buying the gilette fusion blades all of the time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to cut yourself with them.  </li>
            <li> Shaves very well.  </li>
            <li> Cheap Chinese RIP OFF.</li>
            <li> If the extra blades are free, why did they charge me $10 for them.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This is not like modern razors.</li>
            <li> You will be bleeding if you go fast.</li>
            <li> Now he can really save money on blades.</li>
            <li> This is the type of razor I shaved with when I had to shave my whole face.</li>
            <li> are really a hit or miss.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a bit of an exageration, but not by much.  </li>
            <li> I really should have returned it.</li>
            <li> It really is garbage.</li>
            <li> works very well</li>
            <li> Each blade is wrapped and when you unwrap the blade it states stainless blade..</li>
            <li> doubt Rick Harrison really uses this, but it is all I use now.</li>
            <li> It was awsome using a real razor again, one time over</li>
            <li> Thank you Microtouch, Thank you so very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just bought Dorco st301 Stainless Steel Razor Blades, 100-Count Dispenser Pack for $7.52.  </li>
            <li> &#x27; razor blades - not so much.  </li>
            <li> I used to much longer handles.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a flimsy cheap metal stand that looks like it was welded together as a last minute add-on.</li>
            <li> My husband had said to me a while ago that he really wanted a razor like this</li>
            <li> works well, takes some practice if you are accustom to modern razors</li>
            <li> Too much pressure and you will cut yourself.</li>
            <li> Dont you need that to be straight?</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I have been a very satisfied DE blade shaver for the past 4 plus years using some well regarded equipment (Mergress and Fat Boy razors, quality badger brush, etc.).</li>
            <li> doesnt shave very well</li>
            <li> Micro touch gives a real close shave</li>
            <li> The very bottom of the razor handle is flimsy and seems like it was placed loosly on the bottom.</li>
            <li> Thanks for nothing Rick</li>
            <li> I had considered a straight razor and a safety razor for some time and done my research.</li>
            <li> Actually better than expected.</li>
            <li> The weight and mechanics of this feel better than expected.</li>
            <li> No nics/cuts no irritating skin.</li>
            <li> After the constant barrage of advertisements I decided to give it a try.at $20 it was a cheap investment and the results showed just that.</li>
            <li> Does not give me a close shave regardless of how I hold the razor, how much pressure I apply or going with or against the grain.</li>
            <li> He really likes this razor.  </li>
            <li> bought for boyfriend,  absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I still prefer my gillette mach 3, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; as much on your whiskers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Schick hydro triple blade shaves much closer.</li>
            <li> Try one, you&#x27;ll like the results and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Real talk.</li>
            <li> my husband has one and really likes it</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much from the blades that came with it and was correct.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is much of a difference between the quality of shave between the two products, BUT you can feel the difference while you&#x27;re shaving</li>
            <li> I have skin that&#x27;s susceptible to ingrown hair so a close shave is absolutely required.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than 5 blade systems.</li>
            <li> Did&#x27;nt care much for the blades it came with</li>
            <li> And a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Like a straight edge shave.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I really don&#x27;t like having to spend fifteen to twenty minutes every morning trying to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> A dependable sturdy razor with high quality performance!</li>
            <li> Double edge blades are still available</li>
            <li> dropped one in and got straight edge quality shave.  </li>
            <li> My barber uses a Straight razor but this isnt that.</li>
            <li> They dont even give a real close shave.</li>
            <li> it also works out to be much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Cleanup is SO much easier with this style of razor.  </li>
            <li> He absolutely LOVES it.  </li>
            <li> He really likes the stand it came with.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have this razor and it is very...</li>
            <li> Been using it for 2 weeks straight.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Microtouch One.  </li>
            <li> The razor blade sides stick out too much making it a very aggressive shave.  </li>
            <li> Item as described Fast Shipping  A+++++</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved with everything from a straight blade to a safety razors to gas station twins to vibrating 5 blades.  </li>
            <li> haha.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much.</li>
            <li> You get a really close shave.</li>
            <li> Expected better from Rick</li>
            <li> Husband really likes this razor and got van der Hagen shave kit to go with it.</li>
            <li> With more pressure my sons razor dial knob just crushed to pieces… In my frustration I discarded his in the trash.  </li>
            <li> Work the oil in and be ready to shave.</li>
            <li> I can get the same shave using a cheap plastic disposable.</li>
            <li> I figured I could get over the short handle and light weight but the closeness if the shave just wasn&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li> I really like the razor.  </li>
            <li> I like it, but don&#x27;t like it as much</li>
            <li> blades seem to much cheaper than what i was using</li>
            <li> So I just didn&#x27;t shave very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are much sharper than the blades I have been using.</li>
            <li> Modern razors are here for a reason - they work well.  </li>
            <li> The delta between this and what I&#x27;d save with the Microtouch One is negligible, and the Mach 3 shaves closer, faster, and cleans easier, and is MUCH easier to dispose of the used bade assemblies than the Microtouch One.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> Also, very well made.</li>
            <li> He really likes Pawn Stars</li>
            <li> He said it did not give him as smooth a shave as a regular multi-bladed razor.  </li>
            <li> the weight of the real one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Originally, I was going to try a straight razor, but after realizing the maintanence (sharpening, stroping, etc.)</li>
            <li> The quality of this razor is  much more than I expected.</li>
            <li> In short, there was nothing comfortable to using a Microtouch</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Shave Club razor this morning and got a much easier, and quicker, shave than this anachronism of a thing.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I get a very close shave with this razor; but you must take your time.</li>
            <li> Since I was use to using modern razors shaving my face and head.  </li>
            <li> I also thought that I could get a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> That said, the seller was very responsive in immediately refunding my money.  </li>
            <li> blade is all you really need.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the blades that come with it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Micro Touch.</li>
            <li> Also included are a dozen Dorco stainless steel blades.</li>
            <li> cuts real well</li>
            <li> You need to adjust to a learning curve as you need not apply as much pressure as with multi blade razors.</li>
            <li> it was really inexpensive</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dad for Father&#x27;s Day because he really wanted it.</li>
            <li> It takes some time to learn how to use it but works really well</li>
            <li> Husband loves it - he says it doesn&#x27;t pull when shaving and left his face baby bottom smooth.  </li>
            <li> I was only able to get a few shaves out of one blade, and when I did I would nick myself more often than not.</li>
            <li> cause we really expected more.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know much about razors.</li>
            <li> However now that I&#x27;ve had some practice, I can now shave almost as fast as with the Mach.</li>
            <li> Overall,  I am completely 100% satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice and heavy.</li>
            <li> At work today, I looked in the mirror, absolutely no nicks or irritation, and my face feels good actually.</li>
            <li> I wanted to shave more traditional because around a year ago I changed to the brush and bowel set up, and also use natural Dr Bronner&#x27;s soap instead of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Microtouch with my platinum coated Derby Extra blades and so far I love them both.</li>
            <li> As advertised, theshaver uses old school double edge blades, Most of us have gotten used to disposable or cartridge type razors.</li>
            <li> , the instructions want clear enough, but some advice from my 92-year-old  grandpa helps me take the most from this product.</li>
            <li> All three types of disposable razors in our household (under magnification) clearly have only a single-bevel edge (from the top).  </li>
            <li> Far better than anything that I have tried with multiple blades.</li>
            <li> Disposable razors, such as Bics or Gillette Good News weren&#x27;t an option for me, as they always were rough on my face and caused a lot of irritation, afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I have brought this product a few weeks ago and I am thrilled by the quality of the shave that I have received.  </li>
            <li> I tried this model for several days and think that it’s very good in relation to weight and size of the razor, but the razor blades didn&#x27;t last long , so I had to change those very frequently.</li>
            <li> All those years of paying $40 or more for a pack of &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; razors that last a month or two at best make my sick.  </li>
            <li> But certainly  not does it get the job done any better on the curves of your face, like around ones chin.  </li>
            <li> no matter how long is my beard it shaves real good without taking half an hour with the regular one.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> Works just like my old one!!!  </li>
            <li> He only cut himself once, and got the hang of it pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> Pretty fair shave, reasonably smooth but impossible to get the area right under your nose.</li>
            <li> The shaves were great initially, but I started having issues opening and closing the head to clean and replace the blades after approximately 9 months.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend had wanted a safety razor for a long time but while the blades are easy to find in stores</li>
            <li> key to a good shave is using fresh quality blades every time and working the shaving cream/gel firmly for a full minute into your face and neck before starting to shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to give myself better shaves with a straight razor in the first few tries.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a heavy feel to it and is easy to open a close, holding the blade very securely.  </li>
            <li> This razor irratates my way more than any other razor.</li>
            <li> Gives a closer and smoother shave than the other razers that have more blades.</li>
            <li> One side of the razor had more exposure than the other.  </li>
            <li> This is a version of the original, prd-bic double edge shaver.</li>
            <li> Forgot that razors originally had only one blade!</li>
            <li> I ordered it thinking it will be better than the other store brands, but is does not cut at is says.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the original blade weeks later.</li>
            <li> Way better then expected, received on time!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this razor at a local department store for my husband to use.  </li>
            <li> I have seen these sell for twice or more at other stores, websites.</li>
            <li> - sure glad I didn&#x27;t order any extra blades as they might have been a waste of addition dollars!</li>
            <li> He already had purchased a Edwin Jagger safety razor about 6 months earlier and has for quite some time been familiar with the technique.</li>
            <li> Since I am of the proper age to have used both the original Gillette double edged razor and am able to compare the old to the new, I really feel no difference between the two.  </li>
            <li> The razor is simple to use and clean plus it will not slip in your hand while shaving.</li>
            <li> definitely a lot easier to clean, and gives a close close shave...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any irritation, but I noticed after my first couple shaves that I had a few nicks, mostly on my neck.  </li>
            <li> Shave not as clean as with multiple blade razor.</li>
            <li> WHO WANTS A CLASSIC,CLEAN SHAVE IN THE CLASSIC STYLE.</li>
            <li> The only downside I noticed was when I went to clean the razor.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few things I liked the commercials for and thought it would be better than my previous razor.</li>
            <li> Works great just had to learn how to get back to the basics of shaving with a single blade, I don&#x27;t think I would ever go back to a specialty razor again. !</li>
            <li> /&gt;Either way, I recommend this razor to anyone looking to make the switch, super smooth shave but with a little bit of a learning curve.</li>
            <li> These types of razors were probably dubbed &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; razors when compared to a barber&#x27;s super sharp open switch blade, but they are not all that safe compared to today&#x27;s modern disposables or not so disposables.</li>
            <li> High quality and stainless steel.  </li>
            <li> unlike the 4 blade razors the safety razors take a special technique or you will open your face to a work of pain.</li>
            <li> You can find a very high quality German or English made razor for about $10 more here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Decent enough, the action could be smoother but in all not bad!</li>
            <li> I have a short-cropped full beard, so the only place I shave is the neck underneath.</li>
            <li> I have a full glorious beard, but I still need to shave my neck and cheeks to shape and edge my beard properly.</li>
            <li> Really, the only thing I would say is different is the top rattles when opened/loose.  </li>
            <li> Blade is much easier to clean and dry than for modern multiblade shavers.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend $100 on a kit to find out the horror stories of slicing my face open was true.</li>
            <li> I first used my Fathers when I was young.</li>
            <li> Just barely got my money’s worth . . .</li>
            <li> Not bad at all compared to the big name safety</li>
            <li> You will have to put in the time to learn how the razor works and you may need to change the way you shave or what other products you might use when shaving, but its a small price to pay to be clean shaven and a bit wealthier.s me as good of a shave as any multi-blade I have ever used</li>
            <li> Once  I  got the technique down now i love it.</li>
            <li> , so i put a couple drops down the top of the barrel.</li>
            <li> you self the effort and spend a little extra for a good one.</li>
            <li> It will take you a little longer to shave, but overall the cost savings outweigh the additional time needed to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will take a little more practice on my neck, but the shave was very close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle was a little too short to give you really good stability and angle control during shaving.</li>
            <li> Was great for the first 3 months but became harder and harder to open.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find good options for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> With the modern razors I had to go through about 2 every month and then to buy a new package</li>
            <li> This razor worked OK at first, but it is cheaply made and you have to be very careful because the angle of the blade is not quite correct and it will bloody you up pretty good.</li>
            <li> This is an OK entry level razor, but it has some good and some bad points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;First impression : if you are accustomed to wet shaving, this is an easy switch.</li>
            <li> In this case less is truly more for your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use canned shave cream with these razors, they will dry out your skin and will not give you a comfortable experience.</li>
            <li> then I rinse lightly then towel dry.</li>
            <li> Had it for less than 2 weeks and the top would not close.  </li>
            <li> I love these razors and saved a TON of money since I no longer have to buy those expensive Gillette blades any more.  </li>
            <li> Did not seem like classic safety razor I used to shave with decades ago.</li>
            <li> If I had a heavy beard, or even had to shave my whole face, I&#x27;m sure I would be giving 1 star.</li>
            <li> but it is a decent quality product.</li>
            <li> Most of the complaints are likely from people who are used to shaving with overpriced, multiple blades(which get clogged), plastic pieces of junk.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to buy the latest most expensive offering from any of the shaving companies, just don&#x27;t buy the BS that Harrison is laying on you.</li>
            <li> I had just watched the episode of How It&#x27;s Made that featured the classic safety razor &amp; became intrigued.  </li>
            <li> But the blazer only give 3 stars because they&#x27;re only better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Decent razor.</li>
            <li> For the $8-20 you will find this for it is a decent price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the Razor itself a decent razor for its cost, Just like everything else</li>
            <li> I am also an older guy</li>
            <li> The low cost drew me back in, but now I&#x27;m even more sold on the quality of shave</li>
            <li> This is a decent product.</li>
            <li> All in all, a decent product.</li>
            <li> So, I thought, why not give the classic safety razor like my dad used to use, a shot.</li>
            <li> If I had only known that someday I would pay $2 (or more) for a cartridge, I would never have left the safety razor.  </li>
            <li> but that is not a serious problem.</li>
            <li> I would not reccomend the Microtouch One Razor Classic Safty Razor to anyone.</li>
            <li> To everyone&#x27;s post that reads &amp;#34;this will cut your face&amp;#34; I used this style shaver for the first time today and after properly prepping my face with hot water and a lather cream this razor glided effortlessly over my face and gave me a barber shop shave.</li>
            <li> There is definitely a learning curve, and the first few shaves are typically not the best, however the real payoff comes from sticking with it and taking the extra time needed to learn proper technique and blade angle when shaving.  </li>
            <li> In all fairness, this was the standard for most of the 20th century.</li>
            <li> A lot of reviewers mention the proper shave method (vital if you are going to enjoy this razor), build quality of the razor, sharpness of the blades, etc.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t particularly like the blades that are supplied with the razor.  </li>
            <li> Its so short handled that it makes me feel like I should be 6 years old to fit in my hand.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, spend the extra and buy a good one.</li>
            <li> Just use a multi-blade razor or a gillette alta II and clean and dry the razors really well.</li>
            <li> Overall it is a mild DE razor</li>
            <li> This seems like a decently made DE razor.</li>
            <li> Overall I love the solid weight and ease of blade change with this razor.</li>
            <li> Does a decent job.</li>
            <li> The length of the handle didn&#x27;t bother me, and the razor itself is steady and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I would particularly recommend the EJ that I got or a Merkur HD.</li>
            <li> With the platinum double edged blades I get a super close shave.</li>
            <li> I almost forgot what a decent razor is supposed to perform like.</li>
            <li> The first time I saw his commercial I almost choked, because I laughed so hard.</li>
            <li> With this single blade setup, taking your time produces an effortless, comfortable, and close shave.</li>
            <li> Switching to a single blade safety razor has been fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Also for men that have sharp edges or prefer clean crisp lines on their beards this product will not do that</li>
            <li> I should also add that many have complained about the short handle, but I like the shorter handle because I was able to quickly switch the angle of the razor and move it around within my hand without a long handle getting in my way.</li>
            <li> My husband was excited to try this, after they had disappeared from the market for so long.  </li>
            <li> the normal disposable razors I&#x27;ve always typically used give me a bit of a better shave than this.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> the name brand blade refills are sky high, and im no longer used to using the plastic ones from BIC etc.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> High quality for a razor.</li>
            <li> high make</li>
            <li> Highly recommended buy if you want to save money.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> It is highly recommended for any man who wishes to avoid the &amp;#34;drunk-tank&amp;#34; graduate appearance.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Highly recomend this razor.</li>
            <li> It may not be for every man, but my two men would recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a cheap foreign made feel, but holds the blade very well.</li>
            <li> That would keep the blade &#x27;flat&#x27; against the inner side of the top.</li>
            <li> The blades that come with it are not high quality, but I just bought a package of new blades for five bucks and it works fine.</li>
            <li> The best thing i can say for my broken razor, is it got me to appreciate the old style, single blade razor.</li>
            <li> Bought for husband and while it provided a good cut at first, it was impossible to get the top open to change the blade after 10 months.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little more work than the multi-blade disposables, but the cost of blades is a fraction of their price.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this or even a $30 one with a little more weight to it</li>
            <li> and I get a little better at it each time I use it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t rush as a little nervous about nicks but made it out ok.</li>
            <li> A little more weight, and heavyier.</li>
            <li> Also, I love the little stand it comes with.  </li>
            <li> I still like DE razors, so after spending a little more time researching I decided to buy the Merkur 34C (just ordered today so no review).</li>
            <li> , it did the job just as well as those insipidly overpriced multi-blade razor cartridges that dull easily and don&#x27;t last long, like a 4-pack of multi-blade cartridges will only last a month at best.  </li>
            <li> but my family have tough beards good luck</li>
            <li> Id really appreciate it if u could refind my money for shipping i live on a very fixed income and money counts every penny of it.  </li>
            <li> Very good shave; alittle slower because I&#x27;m not used to it, and maybe alittle afraid of it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try it just because it&#x27;s old fashion looking, but like the model T nice to see and mess around with but for the long haul technology wins mach 3 for me.</li>
            <li> There are actually openings all underneath the blade to allow for easy cleaning, and I have noticed that a fast pumping up and down in hot water cleans the blade very well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp, doesn&#x27;t get clogged up, rinses easily.</li>
            <li> I had never used a safety razor before, other than playing with my dad&#x27;s safety razor when I was a boy, but I got the hang of it very quickly.</li>
            <li> But close inspection of the item reveals a cheap rehash of an old classic, probably manufactured in China at bargain rates to the distributor (who no doubt is making a killing in the spread).</li>
            <li> You have to tug hard to get any kind of shave.</li>
            <li> Great razor, takes little practice but once you have the style of shaving down...</li>
            <li> this is the best part of my shave, knowing I have a bad a$$ razor but didn&#x27;t break the bank for it.</li>
            <li> I see all these bad reviews and can&#x27;t imagine their troubles because this is a great razor!!</li>
            <li> ... run far and fast...</li>
            <li> The mechanical action which opens and closes the razor in order to load a blade has too much play and does not close fully allowing the blade to shift....</li>
            <li> Of course you have to be careful and thoughtful of how you are shaving</li>
            <li> My old razor (the &amp;#34;expensive, four blade model that doesn&#x27;t shave any closer than the Micro Touch One&amp;#34; according to ads) pivots on the contours of my very non-flat head.</li>
            <li> You still have to be careful until you are comfortable shaving with the saftey razor .</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, not very well made just cheap junk in my opinion .</li>
            <li> razor allows me to be detailed while using really minimal pressure</li>
            <li> difference is like driving a 100 year old car versus a modern car.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how much my hubby loves this razor.  </li>
            <li> Kept it clean and dry.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it works great</li>
            <li> I now feel I know the reason the industry went away from shavers like this, they are old technology and really don&#x27;t work all that well.</li>
            <li> There are 11 more to go, which will last a long time at this rate.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using a safety razor, some of the reviews bashing this apparently dont know how to read directions or</li>
            <li> Worth the extra money</li>
            <li> cuts you more than shaves wasted 20 dollars never again</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> Aside from the mediocrity of the build (being made in china aside, this razor is lighter than most others)</li>
            <li> Ok Shaver, takes some getting use to, Lather up heavy.</li>
            <li> The extra money is worth it.</li>
            <li> Requires a slightly different technique, but really worth the adjustment.</li>
            <li> He is now looking for an antique one but will keep using this one for his normal touch-ups.  </li>
            <li> So it was worth $20.00 bucks to me to reintroduce me to Double Edged shaving again.  </li>
            <li> Very simple and economical.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this razor, but Rick Harrison&#x27;s endorsement and the low price made it worth the gamble.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through all of the normal razors: electric shavers, disposables, the Gillette cartridge razors, and this is the winner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, you might think you save money, but you waste more time.</li>
            <li> Shave with the grain, first, and then if you have to shave against the grain, re-lather and use short, gentle, upstrokes.  </li>
            <li> He has had trouble with so many of the disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> Your first few shaves may not be as smooth as you are used to with multiblade razors.</li>
            <li> It simply doesn&#x27;t work worth a darn.  </li>
            <li> Once you break the bracket by opening it to replace the blade , consider it broken for good.</li>
            <li> And being that its a single blade its easier to clean.</li>
            <li> My SS is 56 years old and it has a vintage cool look, but definitely not all shiny and new.</li>
            <li> Only down fall so far is a bit hard to shape sideburns and get in near my lip but with more practice I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> was a bit scared at first, but took it slow and easy, and was very surprised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These new razors require you to shave every day to be effective but don&#x27;t do so well with a longer, thick growth.  </li>
            <li> This is a simple easy to use razor, I should have never stopped using this type way back when.</li>
            <li> Touch One is just a cheap imitation of a classic DE razor.</li>
            <li> Some users might prefer the cost savings associated with using double edge blades in lieu of the purchase of extremely over- priced multi-blade cartridges required by most modern razors.</li>
            <li> I debated whether to give this three or four stars, and I ended going with four because the product is exactly what is advertised - a decent and economical shave when compared to more expensive razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It had been many years since I used a single blade razor and it all came flooding back to me as to why I switched to the multiblade razors.</li>
            <li> And the price is right for something that will last forever...except for blades...</li>
            <li> Rick Harrison is right; you only need one blade to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> sometimes a couple times a day when I first got it, (new shiny toy and all) , not a single cut</li>
            <li> , they work very well, I can get about 2 weeks of good shaving from them.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: flip the blade over and you can get a few extra shaves, try that with a mega-blade that last about 3 shaves a week.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tried slow and easy, and whatever else I could think of to make it work right.  </li>
            <li> That was because it took a long time to clean the old one.</li>
            <li> And clearly you can get a good shave with a Double Edge razor for a whole lot less ongoing expense than with the stuff being sold by the big boys now.    </li>
            <li> As a shaver who grew up in the era when multi-bladed razors gained dominance I used disposable single/double bladed razors for a significant time while I was in the military.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t shave with anything other than the Micro Touch now because the blades for it are dirt cheap.</li>
            <li> I love the classy little stand too.  </li>
            <li> if you are used to the supermarket shaves, you will get some cuts while you will get used to this new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re new to using this method, go online, study up.</li>
            <li> hubby loves his new razor</li>
            <li> With this razor, just twist the handle stick under the sink and presto a new blade.  </li>
            <li> He did not want those new fangled triple bladed razors.  </li>
            <li> As with any new, tricky endeavor, it takes practice to shave with this style razor.  </li>
            <li> After I got my new one,</li>
            <li> but if you order something brand new it should look brand new.</li>
            <li> I get cut all the time, even when I put in a new razor blade.  </li>
            <li> My Husband loves his new razor.</li>
            <li> had switched to this from disposable blades to try and save a dime not to buy a new razor every 6 months.  </li>
            <li> thought there might be a new twist</li>
            <li> I pay $9 a month for four new blades shipped</li>
            <li> I would buy new ones</li>
            <li> This is my new &#x27;at home&#x27; shaver.</li>
            <li> I opened the box with the new razor</li>
            <li> If your new to wet shaving this might be a good choice to see if you like it then spend some money on a nicer one for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I also tried all the upper quality shave creams( Cremo) and soaps ( which may have been why the irritation was higher in the beginning), and nothing works better for me than the plain Ole $1.50 Barbersol Beard bust.  </li>
            <li> As i looked around the Amazon site i saw several of the same items with free shipping.</li>
            <li> Back to the old day&#x27;s type shaving - simple and easy.  </li>
            <li> He shaves his head and beard everyday because his hair grows so fast and thick, and this has been the only way he&#x27;s gotten a good, clean shave with a blade that&#x27;s lasted a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> Clearly I expected this to last more than 6 months though.</li>
            <li> Razor blades dont fit in razor, wont shave correctly, not enough razor sticks out to properly shave with.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess ok for those that shave everyday, but nowhere near what billed as.</li>
            <li> Blades are not very sharp, so the shave is not close like what one is used to at a much higher cost, which leads me to believe the old adage, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34</li>
            <li> That said, I am very surprised at this razor&#x27;s quality, esthetics and ease of use.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Very old school</li>
            <li> This is cuts a little better than  the double and triple blade razors that I have always used, and it is much cheaper too,</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve decided to cut back in all areas including researching new car insurance and many other areas.</li>
            <li> Use a fresh new blade every shave, such as Derby Extra platinum coated blades, they&#x27;re very affordable at 10 cents a piece</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even strong enough to close them tight enough to not be able to open them again!</li>
            <li> The lack of the 5th star is solely due to the fact that I would love to see a version strictly for the female user with a longer handle.def by another.  </li>
            <li> The lack of the 5th star is solely due to the fact that I would love to see a version strictly for the female user with a longer handle.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ever used a razor such as this....</li>
            <li> If this is your first razor, consider some different blades.</li>
            <li> I am not entirely sure it wasn&#x27;t anything more than a bubble of plating that wasn&#x27;t supposed to be there</li>
            <li> The first thing you will struggle with is trying to get the ziplock off the Razor, next trying to get the blades out of the plastic holders.</li>
            <li> Blades are crazy cheap compared to cartridges and have the ability buy stainless that is much better than disposable razors that degrade fast.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I just got replacement heads for from Amazon and ordered it and wanted the first shave to be a growth, it was only five days but another three days it would have been a beard to trim.</li>
            <li> I will be looking at merker for the higher quality and probably one that doesn&#x27;t twist open.</li>
            <li> Blast from the past - but better.  </li>
            <li> it take me back to my first shave</li>
            <li> Actually shaves better than any of my other $10-$20 razors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll tell ya what I didn&#x27;t like first, the handle is a bit short.</li>
            <li> Your first shave will totally suck, but hang in there</li>
            <li> When I first began shaving 53 years ago, my dad taught me to shave using a double edged safety razor.</li>
            <li> A good safety razor should last 50 years, this one barely made it past 50 days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the mechanism broke during first shaving session and now wont open at all</li>
            <li> I understand that learning the proper technique can take time, however, after my first go around</li>
            <li> Get the long handle one here on Amazon its worth it.</li>
            <li> I have not purchased this exact product, but I have owned the same razor.</li>
            <li> The modern razor is economical enough, especially given the performance and convenience.  </li>
            <li> It does shave pretty well, and it will take several shaves for my face and my hands to adapt to a safety razor again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> He said it works better than any other razor he has tried, and would never go back.  </li>
            <li> but wow it gives a close shave!</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and even though i hold it at a 45 degree angle, It still pulls and gets stuck on the hairs, I think it actually plucks more hairs than it</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a traditional razor.</li>
            <li> so I had to reeducate myself in my shaving techniques such as softening the bearded area by using soap and hot water.  </li>
            <li> My first razor ~50 years ago was the same type/style as the Microtouch.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll find a consistent pattern if you read the 1-star reviews first - which is, starts out great but then turns to crap.</li>
            <li> it was a present for my husband, he wanted one since the first time he had seen it advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After years of trying Braun, Norelco, Remington and Panasonic electric razors, I have used disposable twin blade razors for the last few years, anything without a lubricating strip (that irritates my skin and takes away the traction that I personally need to get a good, close shave).  </li>
            <li> and the little handle makes it easy for me NOT to misplace it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little piece of paper in the package, easy to miss</li>
            <li> Then I realized it comes down to anything being sold:  M-O-N-E-Y (yours that you spend and the company&#x27;s that use a huge mark-up on anything with steel in it).  </li>
            <li> I will add that he is notoriously prone to screwing things down too tightly:  light bulbs, jar tops, etc.</li>
            <li> Also shaving lightly with the grain letting the weight of the razor to glide down and capture all the bearded areas.  </li>
            <li> The handle is a little to small for me, but it works great anyway.</li>
            <li> The one I got must of been an imitation because it didn&#x27;t come with the case the original Microtouch One is suppose to come with.</li>
            <li> the money, not a bad deal, and I&#x27;d recommend it to most guys, except if you have big, thick hands or stubby fingers - could get tricky!</li>
            <li> I also was nervous at first, but by the time I finished the first side, I was fairly comfortable using it and shaved a little faster on the other side.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mechanism is poorly crafted, the knob that you turn to open and close the compartment gets rusty and there is no way to detach or clean device that controls the top part which opens and closes.</li>
            <li> First up and most frustrating with it?  </li>
            <li> The first time that I tried to change the blade I could not open the clam shell to get the old blade out.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use Shave Secret shaving oil (or sometimes even just hot water), rather than the soap, brush, and mug that most DE shavers use.  </li>
            <li> When I reported this razor fell apart after my very first shave (when I opened it to clean the blade after the shave) it would not close properly and in fact one of the four connecting nubs that fit into the doors that open had broken.</li>
            <li> it comes down to it, the only reason Gillette is making its razors fancier is so that they can charge you more money.  </li>
            <li> Glad I finally broke down and tried it.</li>
            <li> Shaves as well as any other razor and it doesn&#x27;t cost as much as a full tank of gas every month.</li>
            <li> I had one blade that right away wasn&#x27;t very good, not sure if it was in wrong or something</li>
            <li> Also, the blades are less expensive &amp; do an excellent job.</li>
            <li> This razor will most likely cut you if you are not super cautious and ssslooowww when shaving.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong its easy and cheap because you don&#x27;t throw them away.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re after a smooth and tight shave, you may want to consider something else.</li>
            <li> I did get a VERY smooth shave on my legs with this, but I had to be very cautious and go very slow.</li>
            <li> Have always been curious about old straight razors and safety razors, having always seen old ones in &#x27;showcases&#x27; at flea markets and wondering what was so special about them when I was younger, then into my early 20&#x27;s almost considering one but never taking the plunge.</li>
            <li> Oh one last thing, make sure you keep the blade in tight.</li>
            <li> I was smart enough to buy a sampler pack.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect the quality of the ones from &#x27;back in the day&#x27;, but this one is certainly passable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit cheaply made but it works.</li>
            <li> It glided nicely through my tough whiskers with no pressure required.</li>
            <li> I (female) have to be extra careful around knees and ankles, but it is a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> After six weeks even when switching to a brush and using Nivea Sensitive Skin formula and using Personna blades, I&#x27;m still got  a lot of nicks and cuts, still got a lot of irritation and razor burn, and still missed large patches of stubble even after multiple passes.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about buying something advertised by the pawn shop guy, but have to say I am impressed with the product.  </li>
            <li> Pay a little extra a get the better quality.</li>
            <li> Overall, pretty decent for a starting safety razor.</li>
            <li> for areas you may have missed but be sure to press hard with the shaver or it will cut you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I did a little research on the interwebz &amp; was surprised by how many people recommended using a DE over the 5 blade monstrosities that I was currently using.  </li>
            <li> You just have to be a little more gentle and careful.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and unlike the multi blade razors that feel like they are pulling your hair instead of shaving it and little hairs that get stuck in between the blades and poke your face then becomes hard to clean.</li>
            <li> we have tried many of the blades and they are all bad and one top of it</li>
            <li> But let&#x27;s be clear:</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave very closely, I had to go back to my old store razor</li>
            <li> Now I want to be clear on this....</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS CHEAP RAZOR OLD SCHOOL SUCKED.</li>
            <li> This razor gives me a close clean shave with less irritation than a multi blade.  </li>
            <li> He used it one time and it took the skin clear off his head in spots.  </li>
            <li> The Dorcos are better, at least for me.</li>
            <li> It will also take a few shaves for your face to adjust to it as it is not quite as comfortable as these fancy multi blade razors, but you&#x27;ll adjust.</li>
            <li> Some old things don&#x27;t need to be revived.</li>
            <li> It finally completely seized up</li>
            <li> This thing shaves so no worries there, the only problem I got is that I underestimated the instructions warnings and out of habit pressed the razor against my face as I would do with a modern razor</li>
            <li> Now if I can only master shaving with a straight edge...</li>
            <li> the handle eventually gummed up until it was completely unusable.</li>
            <li> I was watching Skyfall, and there&#x27;s a part where James Bond is shaving with an old style barber&#x27;s razor, and he says to Miss Moneypenny &amp;#34;Sometimes</li>
            <li> the old ways are still the best&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll recognize this from the old World War II movies.</li>
            <li> You really do need only one blade to shave.</li>
            <li> This is delicate instrument compared to the more brutish disposables.  </li>
            <li> Keep far away from this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this three times so far</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this blade to anyone looking to try something different.</li>
            <li> Traditionally DE (double edge) safety razors are hefty so you don&#x27;t have to apply any pressure this can lead to nicks or cuts if you apply pressure as you would with a multi-blade modern razor cartridge.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s completely bogus.</li>
            <li> (old school)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was concerned about nicks and cuts like my old safety razor years ago</li>
            <li> I wasted the money on this only to have to purchase more tips for my old razor anyways.</li>
            <li> Now that I bought it, I realize that there was a reason everyone stopped shaving with this old junk.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;my old, &amp;#34;duel blade&amp;#34</li>
            <li> #34;There&#x27;s my old razor!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I can use this razor (including blades, etc) for ten years rather than use modern razors for a month.  </li>
            <li> Cartridge razor blades are for boys, double edge blades are for men, straight razor is reserved for the hero and the brute.</li>
            <li> I am traveling on a work trip and was sitting around the hotel room with the TV on and saw the Pawn Star guy with an old fashioned razor.</li>
            <li> loves how it works so far</li>
            <li> and I like using my old soap mug and brush.  </li>
            <li> blade razors...cause the old singles....cut the he_l out of my face.........</li>
            <li> Just like the old days.  </li>
            <li> Any who, I have sensitive skin on my neck, and I am skinny</li>
            <li> So, if you have smallish hands or, if you travel a lot, this razor will work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions: I like the old school shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to take a few passes to get that baby smooth feeling</li>
            <li> Handle is too short, you cannot get a real feel.</li>
            <li> No where near as close a shave.</li>
            <li> hard.save your money look for a old one at a swap meet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m into nostalgia as much as the next person</li>
            <li> STAY FAR AWAY.  </li>
            <li> Nearly cut my dick off while shaving pubes.</li>
            <li> I also picked up an inexpensive Tweezerman shaving brush, and some old fashioned shaving cream in a tub.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long, as I was a convert after the first couple of shaves.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at the quality for the price.</li>
            <li> This product totally surprised me.</li>
            <li> when I first used it I had to remember to hold the business end at a 45 degree angle, since it&#x27;d been so long since I used one.  </li>
            <li> I have two safety razors- an old style one piece head and a butterfly opening ( this one).</li>
            <li> This is old school and</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the size of the handle.</li>
            <li> like old dad taught me to shave with.</li>
            <li> it is not as quality as the old razors used to be does the job</li>
            <li> Old school baby.</li>
            <li> I am a prime member and order frequently from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> A lot of folks are surprised that an old-fashioned DE razor can shave as close (or closer) than a multi-blade disposable razor (or cartridge).  </li>
            <li> Used for two weeks and then went back to a modern razor.</li>
            <li> Just keep the blades cleaned with an old tooth brush.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, it was a real step back.</li>
            <li> when i tried to get it to open to change the blade the whole thing came apart.</li>
            <li> This is a razor for a man, who realized the importance of that quiet time of reflection every morning while he exercises the manly art of shaving with a real razor.</li>
            <li> Nearly scalped my head.  </li>
            <li> I think part of it is the fact that we are so used to using those throw away razors that we forget how to use this old school one.  </li>
            <li> Then the side bracket, which opens and closes the butterfly doors, completely came apart.</li>
            <li> My granddad had an old school razor “like” this that probably lasted his lifetime. . .</li>
            <li> DE shaving is a skill that must be learned and it took me about a week to match my old 6 blade cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> , I now feel that all the extra blades on Razors really do make a difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews over the durability, it seems okay to me</li>
            <li> Razor blades are so much cheaper with these models &amp; last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> It is an old Gillette patented design, but these days they are not made by Gillette.  </li>
            <li> Blade is not adjustable, and the blade is fixed at an aggressive angle.</li>
            <li> and so far no probs.</li>
            <li> some know how to shave regardless if you are 20 or 65 yrs old.</li>
            <li> The Microtouch One is 100 year old technology</li>
            <li> You see, as a child, I had an accident with my mother&#x27;s &amp;#34;safety razor.&amp;#34;  I nearly cut off one of my toes in an attempt to emulate my mother shaving.  </li>
            <li> Complete garbage.</li>
            <li> Not like the safety razors of old.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyone who has had a professional shave can appreciate this razor.</li>
            <li> Ended up having to try and use some pliers to gently open it, that didnt work well, whole thing is busted.</li>
            <li> I am 71 years old.</li>
            <li> My my twin razor blows this old tech.</li>
            <li> Complete junk don&#x27;t wast your money</li>
            <li> His completely fell apart.</li>
            <li> In closing I&#x27;d like to quote a line from a song by Neil Young: &amp;#34;Saw</li>
            <li> So far he says it works well.</li>
            <li> I was surprised because, well, look at it.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t as much blade exposure as I&#x27;d like, but this definitely gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I wanted the old version of razors like my dad used to use.  </li>
            <li> It did not nick the skin like the old version used to do on my face.</li>
            <li> One side should be marked.</li>
            <li> Throw away&#x27;s were then used, but I was desirous of another early style safety razor.</li>
            <li> just like old fashion ones.</li>
            <li> far as the bearded surface areas are concerned, this system works</li>
            <li> Spend a few extra dollars and get something worthwhile.</li>
            <li> part of the head could use more definition, not just a few low grooves.</li>
            <li> For a few dollars more with German precision.</li>
            <li> my razor shave me every bit as good as the expensive Merkur blades.  </li>
            <li> Go slow and careful and you may need to shave twice but defiantly a good buy and the blades have been made forever.</li>
            <li> The trick is to shave slowly and carefully and use good shaving cream/gel.</li>
            <li> but the only downfall is that he had to disassemble the head to clean the blades as compared to the single edge razors.</li>
            <li> Like other folks stated you need to be a bit more careful</li>
            <li> Well with all due respect to Rick and Pawn Stars, I think he should stick to minding his shop and making fun of his old mans age.  </li>
            <li> After learning to reduce the stubble through multiple light passes with this razor, those other razors feel like a hack and go option.</li>
            <li> so it is small and easy to pack</li>
            <li> It is advertised as a single edged razor and that is exactly what it is.  </li>
            <li> the only way to cute yourself is to either not have the butterfly closed all the way, or slide it from side to side, if you pull straight down</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s price, I&#x27;ve used other micro-touch products with success before, and because Rick Harrison is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my Gillette fusion which is 2 weeks old left me with much less second day shadow,also tried to shave my head with this razor,forget it too many nicks</li>
            <li> The weight is very much the same and overall quality is what you would get for $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this razor, I was so tired of paying the high prices for replacement blades for what ever multiblade razor I had.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to any budget conscious individual!</li>
            <li> The feels loose and the first time I used it</li>
            <li> You only want to use that side if you have more facial hair to cut down.</li>
            <li> He has a heavy beard and the disposable ones get clogged up and no way to clean, and he goes thru a ton of them.  </li>
            <li> At first it would open or close properly.</li>
            <li> After years of not getting a decent shave, I finally returned to the safety razor</li>
            <li> There is a slight learning curve but nothing that doesn&#x27;t take a quick video and one shave to figure out.  </li>
            <li> I properly hydrate my face (hot water, towels) and use a quality shave mug and brush to whop up a proper lather.  </li>
            <li> I used two double edge plastic razors to one blade in this Microtouch One Razor Classic Safety Razor.</li>
            <li> It actually seems like the rebuilt a classic Gillette butterfly razor.</li>
            <li> Even disposable razors have no less than 2 blades each these days.  </li>
            <li> And the first thing I notice when I open it was how it open</li>
            <li> I will admit, I cut my head a few times (minor nicks), but after about 3 times shaving with this it got a lot better.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical from the low price, but these actually work very well and are extremely easy to clean out in the sink.  </li>
            <li> It will not hold the product very well unless you leave it on at a certain angle and pray that nothing makes any slight vibration your way.</li>
            <li> I have major allerigies to gluten and corn and its prob why my skin is so sensitive to the &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; razors.</li>
            <li> However due to the cheapness of this product several problems emerged to prevent a close, clean and bloodless shave.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> The price is right and the blades are sharp.  </li>
            <li> Back in High School and the US Army</li>
            <li> I switched back to my high price razor so I wouldn&#x27;t bleed to death.  </li>
            <li> ;  ! :) Love the handle, blades are not sharp :(</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and spend a little more for one of the German models before you give up on the idea of double edged shaving.</li>
            <li> The razor dulls very quickly and it is not a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> Simple, two blades, long lasting, just all around better than the single blade setup.</li>
            <li> Even using great care in a steamy shower I sustained multiple facial lacerations for a mediocre shave result.</li>
            <li> The handle is to small, light in weight and</li>
            <li> I can usually get baby smooth on my cheeks, but the neck area still leaves something to be desired.  </li>
            <li> Well I was in the shower on the morning of our anniversary, cleaning up when she thought I was taking to long in the shower (which I was as i was shaving a very un-shaved area).</li>
            <li> It keeps falling out.i&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the blades that came with the razor,but i have not gotten a smooth shave yet.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made - too small.</li>
            <li> I found the handle short, the razor was not comfortable to use even after a hot shower or placing hot towels on my face.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t shaved with it before, take your time, don&#x27;t press hard, you will be fine young grasshopper, trust me.  </li>
            <li> Funny thing is I read the reviews and was careful with it</li>
            <li> So I went and bought normal size razor blades only to find that the Microtouch razor is smaller and will not take normal sized blades.  </li>
            <li> I tried every normal way to get the dial or knob to turn to open the razor.  </li>
            <li> After a little practice and your skin gets used to this razor, you&#x27;ll obtain super close shaves every time.</li>
            <li> I only have one word of caution - and this is about safety razors in general, not this one in particular.  </li>
            <li> This is one area where progress wins hands down.</li>
            <li> What razors cost today the money you&#x27;ll save down road is well worth it</li>
            <li> Nothing special wasted money too much work send it back and ask for money back</li>
            <li> I guess I could use an electric razor and set it so that it only cuts to a certain depth like a lot of younger guys do nowadays.  </li>
            <li> My husband likes the razor but finds the razors handle to be a little to short for comfortable use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking my skin simply needs to get used to the new razor, then it will calm down.</li>
            <li> But after a month of use, not even every day, the top became hard to open.</li>
            <li> My husband reports that the razor stopped closing properly after putting in a new blade--something bent or warped.  </li>
            <li> For me, this will be my new go-to razor for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to double edge razor shaving give enough time to get used to the routine and allow your hairs adjust to new style.</li>
            <li> so, I would give the new razor a 5 out of 10 overall.</li>
            <li> So I went to a local store and bought new blades.</li>
            <li> But, you have to pay enough to get a quality product and watch YouTube videos on how to use one if you don&#x27;t know or are new to one.</li>
            <li> I never asked for money back or for a new product.  </li>
            <li> tried this razor 4 different times w/a new blade each time.</li>
            <li> Good razor bad advertising rick harrison also known as homer Simpson and the whole family looks like the Simpson family</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and this product CANNOT begin to offer the same close smooth shave i get from my Gillette Fusion blades and razor.</li>
            <li> Razor handle is too short for comfortable everyday use.</li>
            <li> Based on many (but not all) of the Microtouch One negative reviews, I suspect possible quality control issues at the root of some consumer dissatisfaction as will be the case with any mass produced product from abroad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This may sound weird, but I look forward to shaving because I make it a fun event.  </li>
            <li> it takes 21 days to come from China, I gave up and ordered a different model from different company made of stainless steel not pot medal.</li>
            <li> MY OLD DOUBLE EDGE IS 44 YRS OLD</li>
            <li> I have sensitive to normal skin, I used the Fushion 5 for a long time, then switched to the Hydro 5.  </li>
            <li> He took his time to get comfortable with the razor as the instructions direct but he&#x27;s not loving it as the instructions said he would.</li>
            <li> Hubby forced the twisty mechanism on the handle and the entire top popped off.  </li>
            <li> I have this razor and used a few times but never really fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> not as good as the razor above but still good,just a little small.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t tug quite as much as a disposable single blade razor.  </li>
            <li> single razor blades for this do not cost much at all....</li>
            <li> If you want to try a single edge, you can buy one to try out for much cheaper than this junk.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very shocked &amp; pleasantly surprised to say that this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong as most razors these days cost an arm &amp; a leg to use!</li>
            <li> Blades are not sharp.</li>
            <li> My first wet shaver!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!  </li>
            <li> First, order some Personna or other quality blades when you order the razor.</li>
            <li> not sharp enoght it will cut you</li>
            <li> , I can move right along with and really have to get clumsy to cut myself with it.  </li>
            <li> after several months the mechanism that you turn to open up the top for changing blades became harder and harder to turn.  </li>
            <li> THis product is just like 1960 all over it is not better safer or gives you a close clean shave.  </li>
            <li> This created an endless cycle of harsh, unsatisfying shaves, and so my search began for a better way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The one redemptive value of this product is that it has created interest in the old school style of wet shaving which is a much better, cleaner, less expensive and more satisfing method of shaving compared to the disposable three and four blade cartridges.  </li>
            <li> I guess they think it makes them look tough or sexy or something but to me</li>
            <li> Again, this razor is sharp and will do a great job, but slow down and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheaply made piece of junk with a dull blade</li>
            <li> used to use - and indeed it is cool looking, with extra blades and a little rack to hang it on...</li>
            <li> , these older style razors seem to be en vogue currently, no doubt due to the high cost of cartridges and some hipsters rediscovering them.  </li>
            <li> My primary complaint is that the razor is so unaggressive.</li>
            <li> closed which usually results in some more blood letting....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using safety razors since I was a teenager, and my wife gave me this because it looked similar to my 50 year old Gilette, but looks is where it ends.  </li>
            <li> You will cut yourself if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re used to traditional razors and so far one blade rusted even though it claims they are rust proof.</li>
            <li> It took some getting used to and it will cut you up if your not careful.</li>
            <li> I would recommend starting out with this one &amp; then once you get used to shaving with a DE, moving on to a nicer one with some higher quality blades (I&#x27;m going to buy the Merkur Long Handle &amp; Feather blades next).  </li>
            <li> Went back to my old razor.  </li>
            <li> This thing is barely over three inches and trust me, that doesn&#x27;t come off as an improvement with it in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Does not feel like the blade comes out far enough.</li>
            <li> Ordered direct from the company and was never notified of a 3 month back order.</li>
            <li> (I also like the Gillette silver blue blades), which are by far cheaper than buying cartridges.</li>
            <li> but it is an acceptable initial entry into world of old school</li>
            <li> No regrets at all.</li>
            <li> My husband is 46 years old and his grandfather and father both used this same razors that he is using today.  </li>
            <li> I also bought a shaving brush to apply my shaving gel with or will try some old fashioned shaving soap later.</li>
            <li> Current cost of replacement blade for my old razor ranged $8.00-$10.00 for 8 blades.</li>
            <li> Its old school and like all razors of this type, it requires patience, practice, and proper technique.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it a fifth star because it is not as well made as the old Gillette double edge razors.</li>
            <li> On this item you should follow the old ancient Chinese Proverb,  </li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried a number of different style of razors, primarily because I have a rather heavy coarse beard.</li>
            <li> A week later the screw inside broke completely.</li>
            <li> For this reason, when I took out my first blade (that I am still on after 7 shaves), I carefully smeared a tiny drop of Shave Secret oil on the top andbottom of it before letting it touch any water (NOT smearing in the direction to get cut).  </li>
            <li> Thanks but no thanks.</li>
            <li> my  husband cant stop raven about the razor he say it leave his face soft and smooth.and  the one blade last him a while.</li>
            <li> i went back to my old razor,and it made a world of difference on my face.</li>
            <li> However, I would ultimately steer a buyer toward a Merkur 34c, an Edwin Jagger DE89, or for the value conscious, a Maggard MR8.    </li>
            <li> (it always felt like there was too much razor blade exposed to the skin) and, in fact, I did cut myself once despite being careful not to.</li>
            <li> Too short and made out of an old beer can.</li>
            <li> This product is far below your standard.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s never had such a close shave and his skin is baby soft after use.</li>
            <li> So I just went back to the trusty old gillett sensor.</li>
            <li> Using the same blades that he used in the EJ, this razor was much rougher on his face and left numerous lacerations, where the EJ did not.</li>
            <li> But this thing is very cheap,and apparently you can&#x27;t get it wet.</li>
            <li> The shave itself is OK, but not great.</li>
            <li> I was tired of spending a lot of money for razor blades that have two or more blades.</li>
            <li> As soon as I learn what amount of pressure to use to keep from cutting myself and still get a good shave, I might be happier.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for a good, close shave, but what I got was shear disappointment.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical  because &amp;#34;as-seen-on-tv&amp;#34;, but build is quality and nicely weighted.  </li>
            <li> I loved the Hyrdo, but $30 a month is crazy for 4 blades.  </li>
            <li> me to get the closest shave, swipe down and then carefully swipe up(against grain) for a baby smooth skin</li>
            <li> I kept using the side with the wider gap (more blade exposure) and was cutting myself nearly every time I shaved!!!!</li>
            <li> THis razor you can open up and clean each time, and the blades stay sharp for a long time.  </li>
            <li> main pro to the razor is that in the long run, it will end up being significantly cheaper than multi-blade razors that are common now.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed on the first day that one of the butterfly flaps (that&#x27;s what I call them), where the blade is installed, wouldn&#x27;t go all the way down.</li>
            <li> Keeps the razor high and dry off the tub surface.  </li>
            <li> The multiple blades in the new razors are to prevent you from having to go over the same area over and over to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> I Mean Really Really Cheaply Made.  </li>
            <li> When I say smooth, I mean it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using safety razors for a little while now; I have a few various razors, the one is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> After using one side for a long while, I would switch to the other freshly sharpened side.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired of the huge prices of the multiple blade razors I can HIGHLY recommend these razors.</li>
            <li> remember my father using one of these and after buying several multi blade razors only to find the blades discontinued at my local store I tried this and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Seems extremely light and very small.  </li>
            <li> So much so that I ordered one for 4 other family members for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> As others have said, let the blade do the work, these are sharp and do not need much if any pressure.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that after a few shaves the blade is a little more forgiving.  </li>
            <li> I keep it pretty tight, though.</li>
            <li> I would notice a decline in shave quality by 5-6 shaves, typically...however, wanting to stretch my dollar as far as possible, I would refuse to change the blade until I had used it about double that amount, and the razor was to the point</li>
            <li> The handel is too short and blade not out far enough from razor edgeThe</li>
            <li> It feels cheaply made and does a terrible job even with good blades.</li>
            <li> kind of fool would keep buying the expensive razors with six or eight blades when you only need one.&lt;br /&gt;Great price also.........</li>
            <li> Now I pop in one single blade into my  Microtouch One Razor Classic Safety Razor and I can shave both sides of my face and back of my neck.  </li>
            <li> Dorco, the manufacturer of the DE razors that are used in the kit are not sharp enough for my chin whiskers.</li>
            <li> Was a little hesitant at first</li>
            <li> While this is not an adjustable DE razor, (using CAUTION) you can make it shave a little closer for your final pass (or make it shave a little more aggressively all the time).  </li>
            <li> I had give a little blood when I first got the razor, but after about 2 weeks of sticking to it, it doesn&#x27;t take me any longer in the morning</li>
            <li> Back to the high and dry comment.  </li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving for the past 2 years and have built up a decent collection of several new model Merkurs, Classic Gillette, Straight Razors, and single edge safety razors.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long the new blades last</li>
            <li> The hole idea of Wet Shaving is to shave while being wet right?  </li>
            <li> It never really felt like it closed right from the start, and the guard was a bit off causing the blade to scrape.  </li>
            <li> it fell apart when I took it out of the package and is a lot lighter weight than the same exact one I bought at Walgreen and have had for half a year now the one off Amazon weighed 33 grams or so</li>
            <li> but every other has been super sharp.</li>
            <li> Cut down on shaving costs, and you modernize an old product for a new generation.</li>
            <li> I was unaware of this and the blades are so sharp that I did myself some real damage on my bald head before I realized it was happening.  </li>
            <li> there are several different brands of razors that are adjustable, but i still have my old Gillette, and use the Gillette blue blades.</li>
            <li> I did get knicked up a few times at first, but once you get used to shaving with this style of razor</li>
            <li> I first tried it, the razor was uneven.  </li>
            <li> As explained in the documentation, the first few shaves aren&#x27;t all that.</li>
            <li> if I stepped up to the $40 price range for a butterfly razor I could get a closer shave but than again, This is my first few weeks in using this type of razor</li>
            <li> He cut himself a few times on the first couple uses but seems to have the hang of it now.</li>
            <li> Only effective on low stubble &amp; difficult to control w/constant risk of slicing skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this razor a few times since my first review.  </li>
            <li> I had to go over large sections of my face several times to get parts that I missed, and I had to follow that up with a conventional multi-blade disposable razor.  </li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t go fast with it just move it up or down and not alot of pressure, if you move it sideways yes you will get cut.</li>
            <li> The safety razor beats both disposable and straight edge razors hands down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This would be a great razor for anyone new to wet shaving, but anyone who has been at this awhile would be disappointed with the non aggressive nature of this guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, use multiple short strokes instead of long ones like you would with the new multi-blades.</li>
            <li> noticed before the first shave with the other single edge razors, that the blade once put in, was not lined up the way it should be, not &amp;#34;equal&amp;#34; on both sides.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Not that difficult to get used to, I normally have a light touch with the razors--especially on my face</li>
            <li> I have since invested in Feather blades which provided a great improvement in the reduction of irritation, but overall I&#x27;m now disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Shaves great, but disappointed with short length of handle.</li>
            <li> Razor great no more expensive blades.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product because it was a gift, but I actively DESPISE IT!</li>
            <li> closest shave I&#x27;ve had in a while and much cheaper in comparison to the previous set up</li>
            <li> And as someone who wasted his time and money trying to get it to work over the last two months, that really, REALLY ticks me off!</li>
            <li> A little after shave balm soothed the minor irritation and I regarded the initial experience as a success.</li>
            <li> It does not shave as close as my Mach 3 in the same amount of time - you can get there with the Microtouch if you&#x27;re willing to spend twice the time taking little tiny strokes, and I was a lot bloodier with the Microtouch than I&#x27;ve ever been with the Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess I got caught up in all the hype of single old style safety razors.  </li>
            <li> Nothing like the closeness of a single edge shave, just like the old days, the way it should be and the way it should stay.</li>
            <li> This is EXACTLY the same thing and was less money!</li>
            <li> Not to mention the cartridge blades always seem to dull so quickly, even the second shave with one seemed to tug at the hairs.</li>
            <li> The handle is not long enough too.</li>
            <li> Not really flat, but in a plane, without twist or warp,</li>
            <li> Works as promised does not really take much getting used to save lots of money will last a long time...</li>
            <li> I gently and slowly shaved with a new blade.  </li>
            <li> Darn near sliced myself because of the loose blade .</li>
            <li> I read some bad reviews before buying it but more positive review</li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews for products I dont actually own and use, however the purchase experience of this product was so bad I felt compelled to warn others to stay away.</li>
            <li> I was looking to save on razors, I usually use the Mach 3 which gives good results, and never irritates my skin, after using this one blade razor, I felt like it took much more effort to shave, I wasn&#x27;t really sure if it was cutting anything, and it irritated the crap out of my skin after using it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately the welding point in the base got rusted - not cool when you think that otherwise this razor looks awesome standing in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy so far, but I am still not sure about the quality of this razor, sorry Rick!</li>
            <li> Got the impression it was of better construction - seems a little on the &amp;#34;mass produced&amp;#34; at least cost side...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, the blades cut nicely, individually wrapped in paper, and packed in little cardboard boxes, so reasonable, environmentally speaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised that the handle seemed shorter than I remember on my old safety razor too, but again, it has been years since I used one, and maybe I have just forgotten.</li>
            <li> a fingernail-sized amount will make enough lather for a full shave) and the replacement DE blades typically cost 1/10 or less than a multi-blade cartridge.  </li>
            <li> I learned to shave with a safety razor back in the early 70s and switched over to the old Trac II because it shaved a little closer.</li>
            <li> I gave ten USD for mine and it was worth my time and hard earned money.  </li>
            <li> I went this route because I wanted less waste...throwing away a small blade versus a large blade or whole disposable razor.</li>
            <li> very harsh on my face and left more bumps than usual.</li>
            <li> You will have to put in the time to learn how the razor works and you may need to change the way you shave or what other products you might use when shaving, but its a small price to pay to be clean shaven and a bit wealthier.</li>
            <li> The blades that come with the razor are flimsy and seem dull right out of the package.  </li>
            <li> Just used it for the first time - I have a heavy beard and was apprehensive about using a single blade, plus I cut my hand to shreds on one of these back in 1977 when I was 4 -</li>
            <li> Seems decently made and holds the blades in alignment and tightly.</li>
            <li> Through the years of ridiculous double blade, triple blade and finally the most monstrous of all, the 7 blade waste of money.</li>
            <li> Also if your older or have looser skin on your neck, you need to pull or stretch the skin a little in order for the razor to get as close as possible.</li>
            <li> I also do the same as I clean up after each shave, using Shave Secret as an aftershave too.  </li>
            <li> But do yourself a favor, go to the 99¢ Store, Walgreens, Target, CVS, or other store and buy razor blades that are certainly going be sharp.  </li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, my blade is still just as sharp as when I started using it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be alarmed by the initial investment cost (razor, brush, cream), as this will actually save money in the long run since traditional shaving cream lasts for ages (</li>
            <li> The razor is a poor copy of the original Gillette safety razor.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it hard to figure out how to hold the razor properly at all, but if you are at all worried about it, I&#x27;d suggest looking online for a you tube video or something first.</li>
            <li> Be careful when using though as they are VERY Sharp..never use sideways only up and down</li>
            <li> But I used it slowly &amp; with less pressure and it works fine.</li>
            <li> You can clean the razor, but the device to hold the razor is poorly designed.</li>
            <li> The cost of feeding this is far less than $25+ for refills that only last a week.</li>
            <li> If they make one with a longer shaft I&#x27;d give that a 5 star, but the short shaft on this just isn&#x27;t long enough for me.</li>
            <li> To add to Pro&#x27;s, I was looking at the prices of blades, and if they last as long as the current one, they sell around 100 blades for $11-15 dollars.  </li>
            <li> but if you try it and like it I would recommend upgrading for the weight and maybe the handle length, there is short and long and this one is a short one.</li>
            <li> This razors overall length is only 3.5&amp;#34; long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently gone back to a safety razor after a long time using a multi blade razor.</li>
            <li> His only complaint is razors are so sharp bit likes n or much better than typical disposable razor.</li>
            <li> if you use this you will prove that the new style blades are worth the expensive price .</li>
            <li> The handle is very short and little, not like a normal long handle razor.</li>
            <li> You CAN use a multiple blade razor for MONTHS, the same blade, if you keep it dry after each use.  </li>
            <li> With this one  open, rinse, store slightly open to dry.</li>
            <li> This one does even cut properly with regular single blades</li>
            <li> You will have to pay close attention to what you&#x27;re doing with this thing just like you did back in the day when these single blade systems were the standard...</li>
            <li> Whereas with the Microtouch One, a single blade, when treated properly, can last a month, maybe</li>
            <li> No more high priced razor&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> The razor itself is well built and a real blast from the past.</li>
            <li> this also means long lasting and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> just flat out do not know how to shave.  </li>
            <li> As for some of the detractors claim about rusting I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to judge that.  </li>
            <li> CLOSE SHAVES, LONG LASTING BLADES.....</li>
            <li> I have big hands but that is minor.</li>
            <li> I personally uses the Murker long handle one</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t think that the handle is long enough.</li>
            <li> This shaver is like a ford escort with a flat.</li>
            <li> I recommend going slow to at first.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to adjust to the new touch -</li>
            <li> Go old school &amp; save money down the road ..</li>
            <li> Poorly made safety razor, spend a little more money and get a Merkur.</li>
            <li> A little advice though, shave slow and thoughtfully until you are used to it.</li>
            <li> SLOW DOWN, don&#x27;t come at your face with the edge of the razor and hack like you do with the Mach 3, instead, press the rounded top of the razor to your skin, then slowly tilt downward and use slow long smooth strokes.</li>
            <li> It seems sturdy enough, but the handle is very short and holding it in my hands and using it makes me feel like I&#x27;m a giant at some little girl&#x27;s tea party, trying to hold a tiny teacup with my big sausage fingers.  </li>
            <li> I hate to take the time to write reviews, but after the fifth great shave with the same blade and still sharp I had to make a shout out and share.  </li>
            <li> A lot of reviews say to spend the extra money for a merkur or any other more expensive model</li>
            <li> It is not easy to shave with it, but if you do it right you get less irritation</li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone who would like to start shaving with a real device, but, unsure it they really want to leave the realm of expensive multi-blade disposables.  </li>
            <li> razor works great, a must buy if your tired of being ripped off by purchasing expensive razor blades.</li>
            <li> Finally, got a pliers and thought I was careful in trying to open it.</li>
            <li> I fell through the shower curtain knocking her off the toilet.</li>
            <li> I have spent allot of cash for the plastic throw aways and only get one side of my face shaved to one double edge plastic razor.</li>
            <li> I remembered my grandfather walking around with toilet paper stuck to his face after shaving to stop the bleeding.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Didn&#x27;t have to rush out to the emergency room with wads of toilet paper all over my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The supplied blades seem rather thin and flimsy, and I&#x27;m not sure how long they will last, but you can still buy double edge blades at most drugstores or online.</li>
            <li> At the price of $19.95 and up I&#x27;d expect it to be at least good if not excellent.</li>
            <li> I got tired of buying a 4-pack of Gillette multi-blade razor cartridges for $20 which consumed a good portion of my disposable income and was getting tired of it.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone tired of the new high priced multi blade</li>
            <li> I have also found a way to resharpen the single blades, so I will likely never pay to shave again.  </li>
            <li> He is scamming younger folks who never used a single blade razor.</li>
            <li> Again research how to properly use a single blade razor before getting this razor.</li>
            <li> but before you judge, try it yourself,  keep your multiple blade razor, and forget buying this neanderthal single blade unit.</li>
            <li> The single blade does not even  compare to my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; double edge blade</li>
            <li> Because I am retired, I generally shave every other day.</li>
            <li> This shouldn&#x27;t be a problem as long as they are flat on the blade support surface.</li>
            <li> It worked okay, but only lasted for a few months before it became increasing difficult to open and then just fell apart.</li>
            <li> The single blade razor does save money as long as the razor doesn&#x27;t need to be constantly replaced.</li>
            <li> We later bought a Van Der Hagen razor that was less expensive, sturdier, and gives a much better shave.</li>
            <li> Other reviews have mentioned problems with longevity, so I will keep my eye on it for a while and come back to edit my review if necessary.</li>
            <li> The blades are not particularly sharp&lt;br /&gt;and will only give one shave per edge.</li>
            <li> This is SHARP and I also purchased 50 Derby Extra Double Edge Razor Blades at  around $8.00.</li>
            <li> It has only one side that is sharp, So to use one blade, you have to open it up and turn the blade around.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Place a few drops of Shave Secret in your palm and rub your hand slightly to get it even then apply to your warm face.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t go back to disposable razors anymore after shaving with this razor and i have never had any problems with irritation or cuts because i read up and studied the proper way to hold and use the razor before hand if you purchase and have never used a razor like this before i would advise the same because if not you can mess your face up</li>
            <li> it being a little heavier than my old razor.</li>
            <li> It still takes slightly longer after two weeks, but the shave from this razor is much closer than I could ever get before and with much less</li>
            <li> The only downside is that I&#x27;m not real comfortable going against the grain on my upper lip area.</li>
            <li> And poor design the blade doesn&#x27;t fit in the head tight enough.</li>
            <li> The blades are flimsy and dull fast.</li>
            <li> When I got it out of the package there was a little, round, silver tab that fell out of the packaging at first</li>
            <li> Too bad, because I really liked it</li>
            <li> This razor was a huge fail for me and my step dad.</li>
            <li> The thing that dulls a blade the most is actually oxidation of the cutting edge.  </li>
            <li> At least I didn&#x27;t buy it off the tv and pay 2x as much for this garbage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with Gillette razors for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> but that is minor.</li>
            <li> but it takes getting used to because you have to be careful especially around the chin.</li>
            <li> But then opening the razor became harder, and needed pliers to open it.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I started getting comfy with it and trying to move a long a litlte faster.  </li>
            <li> I spent double money on a Merkur Bakelite &amp; I</li>
            <li> Blades don&#x27;t last as llng as expected</li>
            <li> For how long I don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li> I forgot to pack razors on my3 week long work  trip so for 20$</li>
            <li> I guess somewhere along the way I became spoiled by the razors with long handles and disposible heads.  </li>
            <li> Both are slightly rough compared to todays multi  blade razors but make up the difference in the ultimate cost incurred for the shave.  </li>
            <li> Remains to be seen how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> but it takes me twice as long to get a close shave like I am used to.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to return to wet shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> Will not completely close.</li>
            <li> I got a long handled Murker.  </li>
            <li> So I ran across this last week at Walgreens and spent the $20.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a complete waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> The mechanism that allows you to open the clam shell and change out the blade had corroded closed and could not be loosened.</li>
            <li> After using for several months, I find the shaver harder to open and closed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what took me so long to make this change.</li>
            <li> of the reviews here say the razor will break earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> When closed, the blade did not seat properly and was unsafe to use.</li>
            <li> But it won&#x27;t take long before I&#x27;m saving loads of money by not buying those quintuple fancy-pants razors blade cartridges.</li>
            <li> In 4 months of shaving, I&#x27;ve only spent $35.  </li>
            <li> (Dorco) are of minimal quality and only give me about four uses.</li>
            <li> I expect to use this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I could have spent the same amount of money and bought it at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Have used disposable razors for a long time.</li>
            <li> He really doesn&#x27;t have a lot of hair or thick hair, but he works in an office where he has to shave often to look neat and he wanted something that would work well</li>
            <li> the part that flips down to tighten the blade is too thin and  comes out of the hole it is supposed to fit in.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment... took a few days to get the technique down- and to learn not to over tighten the blade (controls angle to frame)...</li>
            <li> You are not suppose to bare down.  </li>
            <li> It looks cool and the single blade sounded appealing but it was a terrible shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to be hard to get a modern razor when all hell brakes loose.</li>
            <li> Small wonder there is a disclaimer form from New Jersey about hacking yourself with them.  </li>
            <li> If you like pain and want to live in the past, then buy this razor.</li>
            <li> Fallow the instructions or you could be in line right behind me...</li>
            <li> It does a descent job, perhaps I did something wrong, but ended up with several nicks for the very first time using it.</li>
            <li> This razor has a very small blade exposure, and while it makes it a forgiving razor, it&#x27;s a little too mild for my beard.  </li>
            <li> A little hard to navigate the chin but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This item is very poorly made of cheap materials.</li>
            <li> Usually I had to allow myself at least 30 minutes to clean it, running water and my fingers to get debris out.</li>
            <li> I needed to change my shaving device due to the unaffordable price of the multiple blade razor heads I&#x27;ve used since the 1970s.</li>
            <li> Only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because I have not used other brands of safety razor to compare this to.</li>
            <li> Rather, there are other of the same products but with the quality built in.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to not have to buy ridiculously expensive shaving equipment anymore.</li>
            <li> the more expensive multi blade razor&#x27;s.he would recomend this razor to anyone!</li>
            <li> Other than that I&#x27;m amazed at why this razor isn&#x27;t the standard that is used.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware I&#x27;m going back to my very expensive over priced Mach 3 at least its a good shave.</li>
            <li> Double edge shaving does require a little practice to obtain the proper angle of the blade to the skin which is about 30 degrees.</li>
            <li> I only have to shave every other day since I started using this razor and quit using my 4 &amp; 5 blade razors.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see myself going back to the Mach 3 or any other type of razor.  </li>
            <li> I never buy things off TV, but after suffering from male pattern baldness and having to shave my head every other day, I decided I would give this a shot.</li>
            <li> I gave this gift to my father for christmas, He has had some close calls with facial wounds due to the sharpness of the blade, but still screams praises from the rooftops about it.  </li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and get a Merkur 34C or something a little more expensive.</li>
            <li> Been using an electric shaver too long!</li>
            <li> These other companies stick it to us consumers with the rolls royce price the charge for their 2, 3,4,5 multiple razor blades which do a lousy job because you can&#x27;t clean the hair out.  </li>
            <li> This is due to a combination of learning the proper technique and allowing your face to &amp;#34;adjust&amp;#34; to the single blade shave.</li>
            <li> I shave dry</li>
            <li> When I opened the shiny and heavy razor, I probably had a look on my face similar to the boy who got the Red Ryder BB gun on &amp;#34;A Christmas Story&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I picked one of these up a few months back at a big-box store while going to buy a pack of replacement cartridges for my five bladed razor of choice for the last six or seven years.</li>
            <li> I had to use pliars after only a few shaves to twist open the blade holder.</li>
            <li> If you must go this way at least put a decent blade in it.</li>
            <li> I did admit to getting a few small nicks when I first started using Micro Touch One</li>
            <li> So guys if you have a thick curly spanish beard and got sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Multiple cuts on my face and neck, very loose pieces on item, poor construction, overall lack of a decent product.</li>
            <li> This product did not live up to its advertised claims.  </li>
            <li> I just got sick and tired of the multi blade super duper razors that cost much more than a razor</li>
            <li> little razor is well balanced and offers am extremely close shave</li>
            <li> I will be buying another single blade razor, but not this brand.</li>
            <li> You have to be patient in shaving, I&#x27;ve never used a single blade</li>
            <li> I forgot what it was like to shave with a single blade.  </li>
            <li> so it was on that point that I made the purchase of this single blade razor.  </li>
            <li> I am in my 50s and have been using single blade style safety razors since I was 19.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Mack 3 vibrate razor for 10+ years, to me this single blade felt even smoother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d this razor if you&#x27;re looking for a single edge blade</li>
            <li> Well it is what it is a single blade after about four shaves</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used just about every type of razor out there, multi blade, single and electric.</li>
            <li> I kept seeing the commercials for my father&#x27;s type butterfly razor and decided after the barber shaved me with a single edge blade to try it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was wondering about single blade shaving</li>
            <li> They do not shave any closer than a single blade razor like the one my Dad used.</li>
            <li> I guess there is a reason why they don&#x27;t shave with single blades anymore.</li>
            <li> It took some getting use to a single blade razor again.</li>
            <li> It reminds me why I switched from the single edge razor 50 years ago  </li>
            <li> single blade is not for everyone</li>
            <li> I saw the infomercial and thought I would give this a try, remembering the old Gillette twist-to-open DE razor that my Dad used when I was very little (1970&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li> It took a few times of getting used to it, basically he says you use less pressure than the ones he used to use, but now he wouldn&#x27;t go back to the expensive ones he used to use, because this is much better.</li>
            <li> I tried various varieties of blades to see if that would change the quality, to no success.</li>
            <li> so I plan on putting a small milk jug under my sink in the bathroom to put the old blades into.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it to send it back</li>
            <li> It was broken as soon as I locked in the first blade.  </li>
            <li> The husband&#x27;s facial hair is very coarse and thick and he could use shaving almost twice daily and with this razor he gets a closer, cleaner shave than the disposables can provide.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s loose</li>
            <li> If I had to describe my experience with using this razor it would come down to simply two words, and those words would be UNRELENTING MISERY.</li>
            <li> Following the 1st down stroke, I had about 90% of my stubble in that patch still on my face.</li>
            <li> It will no longer open or close without the help of pliers and the blade will no longer seat without holding it down with something while you try to wrestle it</li>
            <li> I truly thought the extra time to shave would be the down fall</li>
            <li> Definitely not high quality.</li>
            <li> I have used multiple blade razors with much success over the last few years, but the blade replacements are rather expensive.</li>
            <li> After watching a TV commercial exposing the merits of the old fashion double edge razor as I had grown up shaving with, I decided to shun the expensive Gillette Mach razors and go back to the basics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A rinse between strokes kept the razor clean and with a little skin stretching and pulling by my fingers I was able to get an awfully close shave.</li>
            <li> I have noticed many reviews on not only this but other DE razors from folks saying how badly they have gotten cut up.</li>
            <li> Also, I have used the same blade twice with no signs of dulling, where the Mach 3 would start pulling at my hair half way through one shave.</li>
            <li> I actually look forward to shaving with this razor, and don&#x27;t skip shaving like I used to, leaving me looking like a stubbly hobo half the week.</li>
            <li> Meaning, half of the cost is from the marketing, a quarter is profit, and a quarter of the cost covers the initial shipping costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Obviously the higher end cut throats and safety razors can be quite expensive</li>
            <li> I was using the more expensive razors in the past thought I would give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> These are not your typical 21st century shave.</li>
            <li> Only thing I like is if I don&#x27;t shave for like a week it cuts the hairs and not pulls them less of a &amp;#34;tug&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Before i deep six it,i&#x27;m going to buy other blades,and see if that helps.if not it will go into the drawer with all the other razors,i bought over the years.i</li>
            <li> A set of refills for the razors they sell at grocery stores have gotten SUPER expensive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent razor, but it&#x27;s difficult to compare it to current multi-blade razors because it works and shaves differently.  </li>
            <li> only real cons I have is that I didn&#x27;t like the length of the handle (shorter than conventional razors), and it seemed like the blades that came with the razor were not great</li>
            <li> I saw another reviewer who said they have often broken their plastic razors while tapping them firmly against the sink, and I have had the exact same</li>
            <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt that blades are much less expensive than for his old razor.</li>
            <li> I mean he really looks like he just climbed down from thetrees .  </li>
            <li> I wanted to like this razor, I prefer the single blade setup over the overly priced blades with the unnecessary number of blades in them, because the blades rinse out so much easier and they&#x27;re like $7 for 100 blades.</li>
            <li> I suppose with a little practice, I could get used to it, but still prefer my current razor.</li>
            <li> You have to shave a little slower to start only to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I used these when I was younger when I had little options</li>
            <li> As some others have mentioned the handle is a little short</li>
            <li> handle is a little to short</li>
            <li> I always suggest just putting a little layer of personal oil on the blade.</li>
            <li> You definitely have to take your time and practice with this little piece.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure whether DE (double edge) blades are called that because they have two cutting edges (where you spin your razor around 180 degrees and use the other edge) or because they are sharpened/honed from the top and bottom of the blade.  </li>
            <li> I definitely took a little to get used to, but not really.</li>
            <li> The razor after being used for about a month became hard to open and in fact I had to use pliers to open the butterfly blade opening.  </li>
            <li> The Blades Are DULL DULL and you can not get the razor at the right angle for shaving..</li>
            <li> Like the single blade, versus the useless, hard to clean 5 blades that they are coming out with recently.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just ok not that bad</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am surprised at the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Was really hoping this would work for my husband, however he cant use as the handle is way too short and uncomfortable in his hand to use....</li>
            <li> It is noted on the package to use the razor carefully until you become accustom to the sharpness of the blade.  </li>
            <li> It had to force it closed</li>
            <li> The Sharks don&#x27;t seem to cut as well, and they tend to drag on my skin.</li>
            <li> Lightweight not stainless steel.</li>
            <li> It is a rough shave..</li>
            <li> ( with maybe a few extra passes).  </li>
            <li> in here i was tired of paying way to much for the multi blade ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always spent the $40+ for replacement heads for my Gilette razor, but never again.</li>
            <li> Opening and closing has become harder and harder.</li>
            <li> If I could give it minus numbers</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had it for only a few months.</li>
            <li> For this attention to wet shaving, I thank you Micro Touch.  </li>
            <li> Shave with the grain and use a roughly 45 degree angle.  </li>
            <li> I expected my bathroom to look like a murder scene when I was done.  </li>
            <li> beginners research \\&quot;Wet Shaving\\&quot; to learn how to use this type of razor, and use a per-shave</li>
            <li> Once you get into wet shaving it&#x27;ll change everything you thought you knew about shaving.</li>
            <li> , I will admit that if you take your time and are careful, this razor will indeed give you a shave that can rival that of some multi blade systems.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It IS NOT stainless steel.  </li>
            <li> But wouldn&#x27;t have gotten it if I knew it would nick me as much (minus 3 stars for that).</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll thank yourself, and be buying a quality, American made piece of masculinity for around the price as this waste of metal.</li>
            <li> I was curious how it would compare to my Merkur Razor made in Germany.</li>
            <li> Serviceable for a beginning safety razor, but you&#x27;ll want to graduate to a big boy razor in a few months.</li>
            <li> I was tired of spending $30 to $40 for modern razor blades, so I went retro with this product.</li>
            <li> Used this for one month, noticed that it was getting harder and harder to change the blade.</li>
            <li> You must be careful if you have never used this type of razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive and will get you into the DE shaving experience with minimal outlay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything I expected.</li>
            <li> I was curious about the Micro touch one razor and have now shaved with it 5 times.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money flimsy pos broke and wasnt using it</li>
            <li> Product arrived at the expected time and is providing service to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Not a whole month.</li>
            <li> Just bee careful</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard, it&#x27;s heavy enough for me to look like a bum when I don&#x27;t shave daily.  </li>
            <li> Just gotta be careful</li>
            <li> Rough shave for me.</li>
            <li> What I expected to be.  </li>
            <li> and i was being careful.</li>
            <li> but know it was not what he expected.</li>
            <li> but considering that you pay around $5 per cartridge that normally last a month (for me) versus 4 blades@10 cents each.... is up to you if you want to waste your dollars with Gillete.</li>
            <li> I saw the as seen on TV  ad for this and got curious.</li>
            <li> I watched some videos online on how to wet shave</li>
            <li> And remember to give it a few shaves and learn the proper technique for shaving this way.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest someone unfamiliar with DE shaving to watch a few Youtube videos to learn the proper technique.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bet Mr. Harrison will not give me one dollar for the razor that was used four (4) times and still has 20 of the 24 blades remaining from the kit that I spent $20</li>
            <li> the butterfly controll broke, now it won&#x27;t stay closed.</li>
            <li> I spent almost $20 in shipping cost, all which is non-refundable.</li>
            <li> so you need to be careful how you hold it.</li>
            <li> A couple tries and you&#x27;ll adjust.</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll pay roughly $10.00 for 4 cartridges.  </li>
            <li> the money spent.</li>
            <li> The shave was rough, not uniform, not close</li>
            <li> a  Van Der Hagen razor a few months back</li>
            <li> and I feel like it&#x27;s harder to shave my legs with.</li>
            <li> Not very well designed closing flaps hang and blade does not seat well</li>
            <li> Whatever attraction the ritualistic acts of classical shaving used to hold for me, after a few months scalping myself with this razor, those feelings of spiritual unification with times past are long gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but alas, it is the same old safety razor from the</li>
            <li> It is worthless as a shaver but nice case...</li>
            <li> So far shave is no better than previous 3-5 blade razors, as they advertise, but the blades are a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> Some are dull right out of the wrapper and some have one sharp side and one dull side.  </li>
            <li> The same folks touting how shaving  is a life changing event with one of these are a bit on the melodramatic side or just plain nuckin futz.  </li>
            <li> Certainly not to anyone</li>
            <li> This razor will save you a ton of money on replacement blades, but only if you invest the time to watch a few YouTube videos on safety razor shaving and spend the time to go VERY slowly your first few shaves.  </li>
            <li> Cuts my face way too easy very uncomfortable and ruggided.</li>
            <li> So she thought it would be funny to sneak in with a large cup of freezing cold water stand on the toilet and dumb the seemingly arctic water on to my head.</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful or you could cute yourself badly.</li>
            <li> can go into any pharmacy or Walmart and get the same safety razor for less than half what they are asking here.&lt;br</li>
            <li> never had a closer shave,but be careful it&#x27;s sharp</li>
            <li> It is extremely sharp &amp; has to be used carefully.</li>
            <li> First time he used it he cut himself up several times he has been afraid to use it since.  </li>
            <li> I was so frustrated in my own strength, thinking I can&#x27;t possibly be this weak that I decided to use my teeth.</li>
            <li> I prefer the single blade razors over multi blade razors for less skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> If not piss your money away and deal with the razor burns and bumps and think of all the skin and nasty hair that is trapped in them 5 blade razors absulotly disgusting and use it that way all week think about it its a win win for you guys and women</li>
            <li> it becomes fun and much less expensive.</li>
            <li> I think it was a due to over tightening the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure I am angling it properly to get the closest shave.</li>
            <li> Like other&#x27;s have said I was also looking for a cheaper way to shave.</li>
            <li> The other day, I couldn&#x27;t get it opened to change the blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen from other reviews</li>
            <li> (The reason that blade sampler packs are so common is that the same brand of blade will work great for one guy and be horrible for another---thus each shaver must experiment to discover which brand(s) work for him.</li>
            <li> I have been using an Edwin Jagger double edge with Derby ultra blades for the past 5+ years.</li>
            <li> other reviewers</li>
            <li> Not sure why but will be looking into either an exchange or return if possible.</li>
            <li> The sharp edge on a discarded tuna can would provide a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> Looking into some of the other DE razors now.</li>
            <li> so these newer chinese made versions will be no better.</li>
            <li> The blades are extremely sharp.</li>
            <li> He also likes the convenience of the sharp looking stand as he no longer has to hunt for his razor.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d give it a try with extreme hesitation based on some of the comments I had read online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too damn short and small.  </li>
            <li> The company also gave my info to \\&quot;partners\\&quot; who tried to solicit me for gas vouchers and other scams via phone.</li>
            <li> The blades that come with it are not consistent.  </li>
            <li> other note</li>
            <li> You will get an extremely close shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;He was extremely</li>
            <li> Extremely please with quality of razor and the shave my husband achieves with this product.  </li>
            <li> but I would not use any other razor to shave with.  </li>
            <li> This razor gives an extremely close shave.  </li>
            <li> see other reviews praise this razor.  </li>
            <li> I personally like, not love, this razor.</li>
            <li> I have a microtouch for trimming up other areas</li>
            <li> Also, cannot control it as well due to the handle.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll save a ton of money compared to Mach 3 and other multi-blade razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that the razor works</li>
            <li> and it is still sharp.  </li>
            <li> I do recommend it for beginners but not seasoned shavers.</li>
            <li> Such a deal don&#x27;t waste money on those over priced plastic razors ever again!</li>
            <li> And if you know what you are doing you won&#x27;t cut yourself as one of the other reviews said.</li>
            <li> Using a safety razor had become almost a lost art form, but they seem to be making a comeback, probably due to the cost of quality disposables.</li>
            <li> The blades do not seat straignt from one side of the razor edge to the other on both sides.  </li>
            <li> then the other.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about other brands of safety razors</li>
            <li> This razor is well made and comes with a small stand allowing you to hang it upright for storage and drying plus it protects the blade currently in the razor.  </li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> I was compelled to write this so other can avoid the run around I got.</li>
            <li> I will never&lt;br /&gt;order from them again (any of their products) and suggest other Amazon customers BEWARE of Beauty&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> it is pretty scary looking, a stright razor and all, but he loves it and finds that it gives him a closer shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing this is due to rust build up on the inside.</li>
            <li> guess it&#x27;s like all the other things</li>
            <li> ; stand with other &amp;#34;TV&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li> They sell your credit card information to other companies, who try to send you gas cards and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shave closer than any other razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how other razors would be different, but this one gets the job done well.</li>
            <li> O do not forget a nick stick till you get use to those feathers they are sharp as sharp can be</li>
            <li> I am not able to use this razor for the same reason.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor due to</li>
            <li> I switched my shave club to every other month.  </li>
            <li> I need to try some other blades as the ones included</li>
            <li> not exactly like safety razor.</li>
            <li> I noticed complaints of misalignment, but this one shaves as well on one side as the other.</li>
            <li> Has a very expensive feel to them and blade refills are cheap</li>
            <li> Got some learning to due with this one</li>
            <li> Too sharp a blade, must be very very careful.</li>
            <li> It is very rough on the face.</li>
            <li> FYI be very careful</li>
            <li> I have this piece of crap for 7 mouth it was working good until this morning when I had a hard time turning the handle to replace the blade the shaft inside sheared off and the head fell off.</li>
            <li> Try it, all you have to loose it a little blood.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to shave closely around my pencil thin mustache for that tailored nostalgic look.  </li>
            <li> I start at my left temple and move down in small strokes with the grain of my beard.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because most of the ASOTV crap I&#x27;ve bought is just that</li>
            <li> I am a Black male and I am not sure if this product was designed to be used for people of color.  </li>
            <li> arrived quickly and as described but it is a very dangerous razor to use  cheaply made as compared to the one of old times but will give a close,although dangerous shave  watch out for cuts!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize until now how far razor technology has evolved - the Microtouch is an example of the primitive, painful, heavy, relatively ineffective early version.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying any more of those overprices expensive Gillette Fusion razor cartridges ever again!!  </li>
            <li> You have to unlearn a lot of shaving habits that were fine for cartridge razors, but which are bad habits for safety razors.  </li>
            <li> I had read in the reviews where other customers complained about the same thing.</li>
            <li> He has said however, the adjustment period has been a little longer than expected.  </li>
            <li> You can feel it as it cuts but there is so little drag that it cuts better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At about 5 weeks it became hard to open to change the blade.</li>
            <li> The handle is very short, about 3 1/4 inches, a little small for ladies</li>
            <li> It will only cut if I go against the hair grain and press really hard</li>
            <li> Handle is too short, blades are dull - had to buy Wilkinson.</li>
            <li> Then one day it got hard to open it up.</li>
            <li> handled very short hard to handle</li>
            <li> not worth it</li>
            <li> Personal preference issues not product complaint.</li>
            <li> so I switched back to disposables for the past few years.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> and they said late next month I should be receiving it.</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH BUYING.  </li>
            <li> Not worth risk of shaving with it.</li>
            <li> Average, I will not buy another one</li>
            <li> I have never heard of such a thing and have placed a complaint in with the BBB.</li>
            <li> and they average 5.5&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It is not worth the money</li>
            <li> I have been wanting a real safety razor for awhile now because I have a curly beard and suffer from ingrown hairs and have tried some expensive razors along with your choosing of creams and after shaves.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Gillette and Schick no longer make real razors, having chosen to go the &amp;#34;excess blade&amp;#34; route.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money or my time that it took to use.</li>
            <li> not worth the money charged</li>
            <li> That being said, the razor is not worth 15-20$ by any means...</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> off amazon, this product is not worth 17.00 bucks.</li>
            <li> The only negative is the Dorco brand blades that come with it.</li>
            <li> only negative is the blades that came with the razor</li>
            <li> Im surprised that Rick Harrison still stands behind this product.  </li>
            <li> to short of a handle, just going slow with it .was</li>
            <li> she got one for her self and now use nothing but this completely beautiful made razor if I ever was forced to use a 5 blade razor agine it would be the worst fight of my life</li>
            <li> I have thick, course facial hair</li>
            <li> then thick shave cream and left on for 1-2 minutes</li>
            <li> It takes a few tries to get the hang of it</li>
            <li> They look good, appear to be made well, but they give a terrible shave.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how thin those blades are.  </li>
            <li> Finally the mechanism just plain broke, no more replacing the blade.</li>
            <li> It beats any disposable razor hands down.</li>
            <li> Rick has let me down.</li>
            <li> Looking down the barrel there is soap and gunk.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t let me down.  </li>
            <li> Take your time with it; don&#x27;t press down.  </li>
            <li> so maybe I don&#x27;t quite have the technique down.</li>
            <li> The stand came bent down, and the razor kept falling off it.</li>
            <li> Hands down it out shines any razor you buy at the store.</li>
            <li> Bought mine at a Walgreen down the street.</li>
            <li> If I bought mach 3 blades every 6 weeks or so, I&#x27;m saving about 300 a year just in blades, the 100 pack alone was only 8 dollars, so no more multi blades for me !</li>
            <li> the naysayers, the blades provided are quite sharp!</li>
            <li> Dangerously sharp!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is sharp!</li>
            <li> This razor with the single thin blade does just as well as any of the others, and the replacement cost of the blades is a fraction of Gillette and similar razors.</li>
            <li> Other than that it seems to be heavy and built well</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it could be a little heftier.</li>
            <li> Very Sharp</li>
            <li> Very sharp, needs longer handle</li>
            <li> Dad loves it, very sharp.</li>
            <li> Took a little bit longer than I expected to figure out how to use it, but now I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have a really tough beard and this one causes a minimal amount of irritation especially on my neck.  </li>
            <li> The life span is less than a year.</li>
            <li> Multi-blade razors claim to produce less irritation</li>
            <li> I threw it in trash after half shaving.</li>
            <li> he had less irritation from the one touch micro razor than from</li>
            <li> The multi-blade disposable razors I used previously clog up after one shave and need to be replaced.  </li>
            <li> But they have been replaced by these lame multibladed ingrown hair creators, some running $5+ per blade, and I get maybe 2 lousy, skin irritated and nicked shaves from them and can&#x27;t have more than a 2 day growth.</li>
            <li> Once discharged I couldn&#x27;t find the show much less the razor anywhere.</li>
            <li> The blades are not good at their only job, my shaving gel is gone and my face is dry before I can even get one side of my face.&lt;br /&gt;The blades may be cheaper, but they also dull WAY faster than any other razor blade I have ever</li>
            <li> Not a super duper shave, in fact I prefer the shave of a triple blade Schick.</li>
            <li> Since I have switched over to the side with less blade exposure my skin gets a lot less irritated</li>
            <li> So, it lasted much less time than a disposable razor, and I now have 24 razor blades with no razor to put them in.  </li>
            <li> My neck became slightly irritated, however.</li>
            <li> I even purchased it at Amazon for slightly less than MSRP.</li>
            <li> and there is less irritation.</li>
            <li> Saves at 90% the closeness of my Fusion for 90% less cost on blades.</li>
            <li> Blades, and replacements, are far less expensive than the multi-type widely advertised to appeal to the sports car and lite&lt;br /&gt;beer generation.  </li>
            <li> The blades that come with it are a slightly cheaper blade then you can purchase</li>
            <li> It costs less on Amazon.</li>
            <li> After trying two, three, four and five bladed razors with less than sterling results</li>
            <li> I bought this razor and was not super fond of it, till I discovered the problem.</li>
            <li> The blade will shift slightly.</li>
            <li> Odd...</li>
            <li> So compared to your typical razors</li>
            <li> Mine broke in less than a year.  </li>
            <li> My second point is that the bulky design makes it a difficult item to handle in some parts of the face, such us under the nose or where the neck joins the jaw.</li>
            <li> I typically have too get 5 blades or 6 when I can find them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not built on a slight angle to capture the beard without scraping.  </li>
            <li> Each shave produces half a dozen nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> My main shavers are fancy (and expensive)</li>
            <li> The cold water shave leaves less of a razor burn, and ice also stops any irritation, versus the hot water shave is relaxing, but can leave you with rash or razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Sometimes, I get in a hurry and don&#x27;t want to mess with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Also experiment with hot and cold water shaves.</li>
            <li> I wet shaved for years but got lazy and in always in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> Not good for someone like me that has bigger hands.  </li>
            <li> This specific type of safety razor is not good.  </li>
            <li> I felt I had no true control.  </li>
            <li> Pull your skin tight for the closest shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since this is my first DE safety razor it took a little bit of experimenting to keep from cutting myself repeatedly.   </li>
            <li> New expensive razors are like Lotus racecar......</li>
            <li> After pricing disposables, second handles for my normal Gillette Fusion, and being frustrated with the expense</li>
            <li> I did end up stop shaving half of my face off after a few attempts.</li>
            <li> electric shavers didn&#x27;t get close and left a lot behind because of how my whiskers lay down.</li>
            <li> To me it was just common sense and physics, and I didn&#x27;t have a single nick or cut.</li>
            <li> but a little to&lt;br /&gt;sharp for me</li>
            <li> However im a little discouraged.  </li>
            <li> so there was little to no learning curve for me--</li>
            <li> The stand is a little bent on mine so the razor tends to slide off of it</li>
            <li> By the time I got it opened, the little cap at the end of the handle had fallen out.</li>
            <li> , I saw this little razor.</li>
            <li> like I do it takes a little bit of time to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I even use it a little and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Kinda gets a little corroded.</li>
            <li> After a little learning curve, this thing has already paid for itself twice over.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> Again they were dependable and required little maintenance (though hair clogging happened often)</li>
            <li> It made him a little nostalic thinking of relatives</li>
            <li> I just with the handle was a little longer.</li>
            <li> I found that I needed to change the way I use this razor, and practice with it a little, but after a week</li>
            <li> Have a little patience with this razor.  </li>
            <li> It was a little heavier than I thought it would be, but I&#x27;ve been using plastic disposables for years and didn&#x27;t have a point of reference.</li>
            <li> razor burn is a little issue</li>
            <li> It Could Be A Little heavier.</li>
            <li> Close the razor until the doors just start to apply a little pressure on the blade, then adjust the blade in all directions so you have</li>
            <li> Also little hairs get stuck in the razor after each razor pass.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little bummed</li>
            <li> wish it were a little heavier.</li>
            <li> Took a little get used to</li>
            <li> I would like to point out that it will nick the face but just a little.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little getting use to as I was used to the mach 3 with rotating head.  </li>
            <li> the blade extends past side of razor cover leaving a sharp edge that will cut you-like lower part of ear-my husband cut himself twice before we sent it back-bad design</li>
            <li> The design does not fit well in tight areas around the chin and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> razor blades were to cheap to shave my stepson very disappointing</li>
            <li> Its useless - i have always used single blade razors and still looking for a proper one since i moved to states.</li>
            <li> (by twisting the handle) to replace the blades, which are all a little dull and rough by the way.</li>
            <li> Wash your face, work in a little conditioner and let set for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Lather and shave your face in sections, let the blade do the work don&#x27;t press or it will cut/nick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apply a little conditioner lest set a few minutes.</li>
            <li> That also means no gunk to rinse off the sink edge, no gunk splattered on the wall behind the sink by the tapping, and no more of the occasional disposable snapping off at the neck due to my vigorous attempts to dislodge the gunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> This product is pure crap and the company that sells it is a total scam.</li>
            <li> Turns out our hard water jammed the mechanism and a 30 minute soak in CLR took care of that.</li>
            <li> Also, when this razor first arrived in the mail, I noticed a small chip in the silver plating on the neck, which was a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades were hideously dull, the razor was difficult to use, and it was the most inefficient and uncomfortable system I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was concerned that I might end up cutting my self up, but really, it hasn&#x27;t happened at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t know how much pressure was needed to apply without cutting myself)</li>
            <li> Too short handle and light weight make for one of the terrible purchases I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how they can make such junk, this razor combined with the Derby blades were a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> The blades on mine did not seat properly into the razor body and the mechanism that secures the blade was difficult to get closed.</li>
            <li> My wife even used it on her legs without any trouble....</li>
            <li> waste of money I will stick with the Gillette Fusion</li>
            <li> This was a few months after purchase.  </li>
            <li> This products is junk - don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Razor handle is too small for average sized hands.  </li>
            <li> The trouble with multi razors is that they are not precise.</li>
            <li> The razor itself is heavy, and seems well constructed.</li>
            <li> This is honestly the worst razor I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> just a razor is a waste ...</li>
            <li> Now it is broken by March just outside the window of returning item.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you money.</li>
            <li> I was extremely tired of overpaying for 5 blade razors and had seen a commercial for this run during a Pawn Stars marathon.  </li>
            <li> Not a comfortable relaxed shave at all in my opinion...</li>
            <li> and I cut myself a few times.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on this.</li>
            <li> Mine began to come apart after a few shaves when I went to change the blade out.</li>
            <li> It feels a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> Others argue that it&#x27;s heavy.  </li>
            <li> A can of barbasol and a few minutes if time paying attention in the mirror</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was tired of the constant increase in disposable razors.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty material.</li>
            <li> bought this at walmart a couple weeks ago, have shaved with it everyday</li>
            <li> I have been a DE razor user for quite a few years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to tell Rick Harrison he owes me a few Band-Aids.  </li>
            <li> Use it for a few days</li>
            <li> Like others have written, spend the extra $10-$15 and buy something with crafted pride behind it, like a merkur or an Edwin.</li>
            <li> If I was traveling, and left my Merkur behind, I would go to wally world and buy one of these again as a substitute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Blades are cheap crap too.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> Mine does not hold the blade firmly in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I watched a few YouTube videos on shaving technique and gave it a go.</li>
            <li> My husband had trouble using it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
            <li> but you get use to it after a few shaves.  </li>
            <li> I am going to cover a few things that I have not seen mentioned (or coverd in detail).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The actual company refused to stand behind their product...is made from garbage metal.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> This is one piece of &amp;#34;nostalgia&amp;#34; that is left behind for a reason.  </li>
            <li> I got tired of spending tons of money on the multiple blade replacements.</li>
            <li> the clamping mechanism for the blades seems a bit poorly designed since it does not close properly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money is locked up after two weeks</li>
            <li> They described it as the razor blades seem too narrow for the razor, almost like it didn&#x27;t overlap so</li>
            <li> I used the 5 blade deal for years - so much wasted money.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with an electric for over 20 years, and just got tired of shaves which left me feeling like I hadn&#x27;t finished.</li>
            <li> Used this for a few months.</li>
            <li> According to a few video reviews of the Microtouch One safety razor.</li>
            <li> Cheap piece of crap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Dont&#x27; waste your money.</li>
            <li> Medium to heavy beards you have to shave three times to get the hair off your neck and your cheeks.</li>
            <li> It was not a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> make nicks in my skin every few times I use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less hair taken from a down swipe and not much more for up swipes...</li>
            <li> I bought one of these the other day at the local pharmacy and was a little skeptical and hesitant.  </li>
            <li> I get sick of going to the store and buying $100 worth of stuff that used to cost about $35 a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> I never used this type of razor before and will not go back to the expensive replacement blades of the other razors.</li>
            <li> No More expensive disposable razors old school ROCKS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely surprised that Rick Harrison is endorsing this very, very poor product.</li>
            <li> To hard to use and very rough against your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful, keep having to go over same spots in order to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> As a consumer that was tired of spending ridiculous amounts on cartridges, I took the plunge to old school shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The razor itself isn&#x27;t a bad starter for new single blade users.  </li>
            <li> Nostalgic but not worth going back to......</li>
            <li> Tired of plastic razors and my electric razor is pretty lame.</li>
            <li> It always amazed me how expensive they were compared to how long they lasted (not very).  </li>
            <li> Do a little bit at a time, small sections.  </li>
            <li> It is a little small</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sold as if its durability was on par with similar razors of previous generations, but sadly its just mass produced junk....</li>
            <li> I am not the only one reviewing this poorly, this cheap thing will rust or seize shut on you after just a month or two of use making it impossible to remove the blade, and it is impossible to use this thing without getting multiple nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> , so maybe he screwed down the closure too hard.  </li>
            <li> This metal razor feels heavy compared to my usual two blade Gillette Sensor razor.</li>
            <li> Do not give up to soon after a few challenges because you could be missing out!</li>
            <li> The Mach 3 seems to dull out half way through the job.</li>
            <li> The hack and go method would leave my face feeling raw, create ingrown hairs, and made shaving a dreaded process.</li>
            <li> that will burn your face raw.</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard and shave nightly which typically gives me irratation along my neck and jaw line.</li>
            <li> I used Shave Secret lotion, and did not encounter a single cut, scrape, or rash.</li>
            <li> If your and idiot, have no mechanically comprehension, or less then stellar dexterity you should use disposables.</li>
            <li> Get this and a 100 count of blades for about $10 and your in about $30 bucks for the next few YEARS!!!!</li>
            <li> For me this razor is to heavy and to hard to control.</li>
            <li> The workmanship is sloppy and loose.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too small, too heavy, hard to hold, and cut my face up.  </li>
            <li> (hence the small stem).</li>
            <li> razor is way to small for my hands ,so</li>
            <li> this really is a shady business practice.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a Gillette Mach 3 user, but I got this as a gift</li>
            <li> The handle is heavy, and clumsy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by a slick sales pitch from a &amp;#34;tv star&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure why I purchased this razor.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t waste a lot of money now on cartridges!</li>
            <li> Not sure about the blades either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to those expensive cartridges.</li>
            <li> Initial quality, I am not impressed with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s terrible, and it will do the job, but I&#x27;m not buying the ad line that it is better than the multi-blade shavers.</li>
            <li> so adams apple and a scare on my chin usually get the brunt of the job.</li>
            <li> However I did not like how small it was.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money!  </li>
            <li> He uses it everyday!</li>
            <li> but once I got the razor, I was unable to shave every day without bleeding from several nicks.</li>
            <li> I re-lathered and gave my neck a second pass as the opposing grain on my nape has always been difficult to get on one pass with any razor.</li>
            <li> (I usually do the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The shaver is extremely small for my hands.</li>
            <li> The handle is too small and not a close shave at all.</li>
            <li> I like the concept of the &amp;#34;Microtouch;&amp;#34; however, the handle is just too small for my hands.</li>
            <li> ALREADY SAVING BEAUCOUP BUCKS BECAUSE DISPOSABLE RAZORS ARE A THING OF THE PAST.</li>
            <li> Short handle which makes it difficult for me because of my hand size.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it takes some getting use to</li>
            <li> It even comes with a small chrome stand for the razor.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll have to keep go over and over and over (tried 4 dif blade brands) until there&#x27;s no more lather on you face.</li>
            <li> a second one cause the children over twisted the handle and broke the piece that holds the blade housing on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It got one star for sentimental value.</li>
            <li> no more hitting them against the tile to get hair out.</li>
            <li> Not much better as others here on amazon.</li>
            <li> I never experienced any of the nicks or cuts that some have been, but I&#x27;m guessing they&#x27;re inexperienced shavers.</li>
            <li> so unfortunately I am stuck with a razor and 100+ extra blades</li>
            <li> Microtouch...drop dead !</li>
            <li> Back to the expensive Shick Hydro Blades for me.</li>
            <li> The razor was too small for my hands</li>
            <li> My husband has been noticing thsi razor for some time now and has been wnating to try it, so, I ended up getting it for him this past V-Day</li>
            <li> A small inconvenience, though, for the quality of the shave you get.  </li>
            <li> The short handle is extremely difficult to hold and use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how people can review this piece of garbage favorably.  </li>
            <li> but, no better than the one I had in the 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure yet.  </li>
            <li> because I have a very heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a distant reminder of how bad razors were back in the 60s and before.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I have is the blades sent with it are slightly larger than the razor base is.</li>
            <li> If you are rushing to beat the clock when shaving this is NOT the razor for you, but on the other hand when you arrive late for work your boss will say, &amp;#34;Hey, you are late!  </li>
            <li> and they were not very good.</li>
            <li> Not a very good item, does not do what it was advertised to do.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m tired of paying almost 20 dollars for only 5 blades per pack, ridiculous!</li>
            <li> this is the most shitiest thing ever the blades are not even sharp in anyway instead of cutting the hair it cut his head bad!</li>
            <li> They were both sick of paying through the nose for replacement blades for other razors and now they can go to our local grocery store and buy replacement blades for $2.19!  </li>
            <li> The handle has broken after less than 2 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> Does not work better than conventional triple blades, was disappointed with product and Rick from Pawn Stars :(</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to not nick yourself; especially when you ignore the instructions and use the razor in an upward motion to get to the difficult area of your face...like your chin, upper lip and lower lip.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is hard to shave close under the nose and it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I would like.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been hard on the &amp;#34;As</li>
            <li> The blades that this comes with are dull to start, and you won&#x27;t get a close shave, even if you try.  </li>
            <li> The blades I received with the razor weren&#x27;t dull.  </li>
            <li> Blades for this razor are hard to find and we found this razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another flaw is when the blade goes dull and you shave with it</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not the use of a blade that makes it dull, it&#x27;s the moisture that is allowed to remain on it after its use.  </li>
            <li> 2-3 shaves before getting dull, but at .20 cents a blade, you can&#x27;t beat this.  </li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars, but he said that the blade seems dull, and pulled his beard.  </li>
            <li> hard to handle.</li>
            <li> Blade was dull.  </li>
            <li> Hard to tell that I have shaved after I finish</li>
            <li> hard for me to use</li>
            <li> It may be hard to believe, but I didn&#x27;t cut myself at all.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and hated paying to much for to little then buy this product now.</li>
            <li> You know why there are some negative reviews on this product?</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just a sucker for infomercials.  </li>
            <li> This was changed without my authorization to $12.98.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called customer service and complained.</li>
            <li> I feel the need to shave at least part of my face.</li>
            <li> at least and about the price of a pack or two of the multi-blade disposables.  </li>
            <li> When I complained, their response was, once we have credit card info, we process.</li>
            <li> and it still sucks.</li>
            <li> Also the handle is very short and awkward to use.  </li>
            <li> I guess there&#x27;s a sucker born every minute I&#x27;ve lost all respect for Rick Harrison</li>
            <li> The shock made me jump cutting myself with the what I am now describing as a Hellish razor that only the devil would use to cut his victims.</li>
            <li> Needless to say we both spent the morning of our anniversary in the hospital.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those 3-blade razors have at least 3 times the drag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not thrilled with shave</li>
            <li> I gave this product this rating because there were no choices in the negative (below zero)</li>
            <li> There is a sucker born every minute.  </li>
            <li> You have to be extremely careful not to get cut, which unfortunately I did.</li>
            <li> I was as delicate as I could be with mine and</li>
            <li> I think the use of Dorco blades in both the Safety Razor and the Dollar Shave Club razors might be the common denominator here.</li>
            <li> He always complained about the multi blade disposables.</li>
            <li> But it did come on the slow boat from China.</li>
            <li> You must remember to shave slow.</li>
            <li> If you have time to take it slow then go for it.</li>
            <li> If you have a thick beard, this is not for u.</li>
            <li> My beard is so course and thick.  </li>
            <li> Shaved carefully, slowly.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions and took my time slowly.</li>
            <li> I mean at least 2&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I was sick of disposable razors and decided to check into an old fashioned safety razor.</li>
            <li> I hate this razor, the handle short and hard to hang on to, It takes twice as long as my Gillette sensor and is a worse shave.&lt;br /&gt;save</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve fallen prey to a slick marketing campaign!  </li>
            <li> the blade is no better then any others out there!</li>
            <li> I mean after all it&#x27;s a razor.  </li>
            <li> after realizing (cause the wife usually buys them) that the razors where 30 FRKN dollars!</li>
            <li> I was dumb and dumber to fall for the slick TV commercial.&lt;br /&gt;Any</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li> A little disappointed, as the handle is too short.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not easy in the beginning because it&#x27;s sharp and dangerous if you don&#x27;t know how to use</li>
            <li> It is not catastrophic failure; I can still use it, but the blade is in a sub optimal</li>
            <li> but I would credit that to operator failure rather than the razor.</li>
            <li> At least with the standard razor you wont cut your skin as bad when they go dull.</li>
            <li> Even the blade pops up, not sure if that&#x27;s a feature to help you get the blades out, but it&#x27;s irritating.</li>
            <li> and I hate to shave because the expensive 3-4 blade razors last me only a time or two to shave with.  </li>
            <li> To add insult to injury, they charged me over $5 to return the razor which I used only twice for very uncomfortable shaves.</li>
            <li> But those couple of pros do not in any way make up for the horrible little toy like size of the thing, nor the fact it is so much easier to cut yourself with just trying to move it around chasing the direction of your beard.  </li>
            <li> But those couple of pros do not in any way make up for the horrible little toy like size of the thing, nor the fact it is so much easier to cut yourself with just trying to move it around chasing the direction of your beard.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product at Walgreens to get away from the ridiculous razor blade prices.</li>
            <li> I can understand a backorder of 2 or 3 weeks but 3 months is ridiculous for anything.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t shaved with a safety razor in over 20 years, but now I seriously wonder why I ever switched.  </li>
            <li> $22 to $50 for a set of refill blades depending on the razor and number of blades being sold is just completely ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> Then the next time i tried it was impossible.</li>
            <li> This was slightly less expensive</li>
            <li> The trick is not to screw the bottom knob too tight, otherwise it bends the blade to the point that the razor&#x27;s edge  touches the protector metal, rendering it utterly useless.  </li>
            <li> Not as well as my Atra Plus (and a little difficult to maneuver comparatively).  </li>
            <li> It is almost an inch shorter than another razor I&#x27;ve been using, which makes it a little uncomfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> , so bad that I have to use Skintimate female shaving gel &amp; ladies razors.</li>
            <li> The razor is not good.</li>
            <li> i ordered this because i remembered this type of razor gave me the closest shave i&#x27;ve ever had, but its also not good around the knees.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t judge these poorly before using them at least 10 shaves to allow your face and hand coordination adjust.</li>
            <li> In China, nothing made there is worth a crap!</li>
            <li> Just not a good close shave.</li>
            <li> Sorry I wasted my money on it.</li>
            <li> These things are dangerous and not very ergonomic.</li>
            <li> Not a good purchase for me.</li>
            <li> Not good quality.</li>
            <li> Long story short not good quality, customer support of the maker is terrible!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very difficult to use as well, and not a smooth shave unless you cut yourself shaving...</li>
            <li> was a waste of money  sorry.</li>
            <li> was not good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ugly enough as it is</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s user error, but I&#x27;ve tried shaving with this blade 3 times and cut myself up so much each time that I had to give up and go buy some really expensive blades again :(</li>
            <li> It is just too short - too hard to hold on to - very disappointing...</li>
            <li> Clumsy and bulky..blades are really thin and some last longer than others.not a bad product but not a great one either.</li>
            <li> Which brings me to another problem with it, and a very nostalgic one with these single blade systems.  </li>
            <li> In other words, it&#x27;s awkward to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when taken those blades out of the box, they are crazy sharp</li>
            <li> Too sharp and awkward to my liking.</li>
            <li> after using it for the first time he was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this razor; the head fell off when I first opened it to insert a razor.  </li>
            <li> The single blade razor seemed impossible to find until I saw an ad with Pawn Star&#x27;s Rick Harrison. &amp;</li>
            <li> NOSTALGIC AND VERY ECONOMICAL in todays outrageous economy!!!!</li>
            <li> I was sick of paying ridiculous prices for multi-blade razors so decided to give a single blade razor a shot.</li>
            <li> It did a very poor job of cutting my facial hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> The process of shaving is no more  difficult than the 2, 3, or 4 bladed razors.</li>
            <li> This razor was my hope, but unfortunately it is pretty horrible.</li>
            <li> SUCKS!</li>
            <li> SUCKS!</li>
            <li> No more buying those ultra expensive 5 bladed refills.</li>
            <li> When seeking product reviews, I always read the worst reviews first thus giving me the hypeless product lowdown.  </li>
            <li> If you have no technique behind the blade it is not a good shave at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor sucks!  </li>
            <li> I will post later after I receive the razor blades and have used it : (</li>
            <li> We could only hope:(</li>
            <li> I hate buying expensive razors and have been looking for ways to save money, as well as new types of razors.  </li>
            <li> I have tough whiskers and my neck</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard and clog multiblade razors.</li>
            <li> I have tough beard / whiskers</li>
            <li> I have an extremely tough beard on my face where I have 3 to 9 hairs coming from one hair follicle, and a wimpy, wimpy one on my neck.</li>
            <li> Tough beards it will not work trust me on that</li>
            <li> I found a way to contact the maker and the said tough try to find the person you bought it from..</li>
            <li> I was wrong about having a hard time opening the head.</li>
            <li> Not the quality I expected, not a good close shave,,,,,  disappointed</li>
            <li> POOR technique and or inadequate prep/ protection that causes poor results.</li>
            <li> The worse razor that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I am not happy with the quality of this razor.</li>
            <li> The execution, however is poor.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product until the fix the issue of poor craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the worst piece of junk I&#x27;ve ever purchased on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s happening with everything from phones to tools, and I hate it for its not at all conducive to people like me with big hands and fingers.  </li>
            <li> Tired of paying a lot of money for replacement blades, I had nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> Razor has broken already.</li>
            <li> It seems to be poorly crafted.</li>
            <li> Should have read the poor reviews.  </li>
            <li> Poorly manufactured.</li>
            <li> My husband decided to try this because he was getting tired of the electric and then tried the hand held with multi razors.</li>
            <li> but now with the broken handle, I have to assume a poor product.</li>
            <li> This razor is just poorly engineered...  </li>
            <li> Flimsy and poor shave.</li>
            <li> Not a close shave, the handle is heavy and makes maneuvering the razor awkward.</li>
            <li> Bought it because I was tired of spending a ton of money on those multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li> It is broken and have to buy another one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of paying for over priced and over marketed razor blades.</li>
            <li> Amazon stood behind it though and refunded the cost...</li>
            <li> ; and FBrand POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the worst razor ever!  </li>
            <li> He was tired of paying for the disposable&lt;br /&gt;razors or the inflated prices of replacement blades.  </li>
            <li> but I realized it was broken off from the bottom of the razor.</li>
            <li> so I bought another one and cant change out blades the head is broken in side......</li>
            <li> If you are tired of paying out the whazzoo for cartridges and want a cost-effective alternative, this is your ticket.  </li>
            <li> I was annoyed that the details in the advertizment did not mention blades included so I separately purchased a pack of blades, which are not returnable.</li>
            <li> It is heavy, causing me to make mistakes and cutting my face and head.  </li>
            <li> poorly made,not a quality product.</li>
            <li> But, alas, I was enthralled with the ease of use and the closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li> If you are unable to do that I would at least like you to acknowledge the poor quality of this product and have Rick Harrison stop endorsing it and take it off the market.</li>
            <li> and that is just false.  </li>
            <li> The razor body itself was sloppily built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also it pays to use a high quality shave soap like Blades Grim.</li>
            <li> Hated expensive, dull triple and double edge razors, both non-disposable and disposable.  </li>
            <li> If you are under 30, slightly retarded, or have never shaved with a single blade you may want to avoid this product.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the worst razor that I ever used.</li>
            <li> Getting tired of expensive multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li> and I ended up a bloody mess...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the MicroTouch, but I tried it anyway.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, this razor is not for me.</li>
            <li> There is nothing inherently wrong with this item, but the shave was NEVER as close as I got when using the cartridge blades.</li>
            <li> 40+ times to get a mediocre shave.  </li>
            <li> Lasted about 6 weeks until mechanism failed</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need all the blades in the expensive razors.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the razor, just like man6</li>
            <li> well i was shaving wrong.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> After following the instructions, I received the worst series of shaves ever.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this wasn&#x27;t the solution for me.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it tore his face up along the chin area.  </li>
            <li> But some of them get abysmally expensive.  </li>
            <li> Scary razor.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it on amazon, but I just wanted to warn people of how uncomfortable a shave this is.</li>
            <li> he has used electric razor&#x27;s and multi blade expensive razor&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The razor is not as scary as it looks.</li>
            <li> Everything is wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Which everyone knows is expensive to replace the heads, but also it can irritate skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still cheesy pot metal/ tin.</li>
            <li> Lame.  </li>
            <li> They are useless.</li>
            <li> Stupid and a waste of time/money.</li>
            <li> but it hurt sorry</li>
            <li> These guys that cut themselves and get a lousy shave just don&#x27;t know how to shave.</li>
            <li> if you think you can just go to shaving you will be sorry I will assure you if you fail to read how to use one</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> For this task, I think it&#x27;s too cumbersome and difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> My husband only used this twice and hated it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with the razor yet</li>
            <li> All efforts to follow the instructions failed.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, that&#x27;s just telling it like it is.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a safety razor because the refills on the 4 to 5 razor blades are really expensive.</li>
            <li> It is a fake.</li>
            <li> No need for expensive 6-blade razors.</li>
            <li> It works almost as well as the expensive multi razor.  </li>
            <li> All three shaves were uncomfortable, worrisome</li>
            <li> you have a moderately difficult beard and lots of nooks and crannies, forget this and dial in the Dollar Shave Club.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought this razor thinking I could save some money from not buying expensive Gillette Fusion Proglide blades.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll pony up the dough for the Proglide blades based on this and Dollar Shave club blades being mediocre as well.  </li>
            <li> BIG disappointment!!!</li>
            <li> But now it&#x27;s totally useless.</li>
            <li> When I read these Amazon reviews, I was skeptical and apprehensive.</li>
            <li> Multi blade shavers way too expensive.</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH 5 CENTS!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> **** out of your face if you are careless and have no experience with one of these</li>
            <li> The handle has been difficult to turn for over a month now...</li>
            <li> Be wary, ladies--</li>
            <li> Very poorly constructed.  </li>
            <li> The one I bought was very poorly made.  </li>
            <li> The design was very poor</li>
            <li> Very Poor Quality.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews often but because of the VERY POOR QUILITY and Customer service from FBrand</li>
            <li> it is made very poorly.</li>
            <li> It felt very awkward in my hand and it was hard to maneuver around my face .</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed I spent the money on it.</li>
            <li> I used a Mach 3 for years and the blades where crazy expensive.  </li>
            <li> It was hands down the worst razor I have used to date.</li>
            <li> what a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I believe the used blades could be a cutting hazard to my wife when she cleans</li>
            <li> after you shave put cold h20 on your face and a bit of aloe again to replace for aftershave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- If you are cutting yourself, it&#x27;s not because of the product, it&#x27;s either because of how you are shaving, or the blades you are using.  </li>
            <li> That is dangerous.  </li>
            <li> It takes skill to use a razor like this without cutting yourself.  </li>
            <li> Still cutting well.</li>
            <li> Said he couldnt figure out how to use it without cutting himself...</li>
            <li> He said it didn&#x27;t feel like it was cutting</li>
            <li> That was a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> It was not smooth, cut up my husbands face terribly.</li>
            <li> This razor was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> and he says it&#x27;s awkward to use.</li>
            <li> and I was afraid I would be adding insult to injury...or perhaps injury to insult with this razor.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money !!!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted this to be a grooming experience that I would pass on to my son, but sadly it is nothing of the sort!  </li>
            <li> This is so fake!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually skeptical about things on TV, but, I took a chance and it&#x27;s paying off !</li>
            <li> I WAS WRONG!</li>
            <li> WRONG!  </li>
            <li> After using the newer razors, found that this one is VERY difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I was very wrong.</li>
            <li> Its virtually impossible to shave with this without getting nicks.</li>
            <li> One Razor is bulky, smallish in size and almost impossible to shave yourself without knicking the skin and causing the blood to flow.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t post bad reviews on their site.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a bad product for the money it is an ENTRY LEVEL razor.</li>

            <li> Worst razor I ever used.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good shaver, inexpensive replacement blades.  It is a short handle razor however, I personally enjoy something with a longer shaft on it.  If they make one with a longer shaft I&#x27;d give that a 5 star, but the short shaft on this just isn&#x27;t long enough for me.</li>
            <li> this is ok shave really&lt;br /&gt;good but a little to&lt;br /&gt;sharp for me</li>
            <li> Not all I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> Very nice and it got here on time</li>
            <li> Around a mouth of use (I shave 2-3x a week) One Razor started to develop problems. At first it would open or close properly. Finally it just fell apart.&lt;br /&gt;After the thirty day warranty period their customer support doesn&#x27;t want to talk to you.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t post bad reviews on their site.&lt;br /&gt;This product is a piece of JUNK and the whole promotion is a scam.</li>
            <li> never had a closer shave,but be careful it&#x27;s sharp</li>
            <li> Why buy disposable anymore. It works great, and doesn&#x27;t get plugged up with hair.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband and he likes it much better than the traditional razor.  He has said however, the adjustment period has been a little longer than expected.  It is noted on the package to use the razor carefully until you become accustom to the sharpness of the blade.  It does shave very close.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I loved the first one, that my wife bought for me at Wal-Mart, the razor was heavy and as good as razors costing more than twice as much.  This one that I bought from Amazon, however, was entirely different.  Aluminum and plastic construction and the razor blade boxes were simply cardboard boxes without the used razor reservoir.  It was simply trash.  The razor blades themselves were still of good quality, but I can&#x27;t recommend buying this without being able to pick up the box.  If you can pick it up, you can make sure you buy the good one.</li>
            <li> I hate buying expensive razors and have been looking for ways to save money, as well as new types of razors.  I&#x27;ve been shaving with Gillette razors for as long as I can remember.  They never last more than a week or so. I have tough whiskers and my neck has lots of curves.  I&#x27;ve tried different razors, the last one was the razor that Pawn Stars recommends.  That one didn&#x27;t work for me...it&#x27;s too small, too heavy, hard to hold, and cut my face up.  I was skeptical about the MicroTouch, but I tried it anyway.  I LOVE it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and have been using the same blade.  When you use it for the 1st time, it seems like it is not cutting well, however, after you finish, you&#x27;ll see that it cuts great!  I shave in one direction and then back in the opposite direction.  I love these razors and saved a TON of money since I no longer have to buy those expensive Gillette blades any more.  Thanks to MicroTouch 3!</li>
            <li> Best buy in a long time! No more high priced razor&#x27;s! No I spend about 5 bucks a month! No Brainer</li>
            <li> arrived quickly and as described but it is a very dangerous razor to use  cheaply made as compared to the one of old times but will give a close,although dangerous shave  watch out for cuts!</li>
            <li> Nothing special wasted money too much work send it back and ask for money back not worth it</li>
            <li> Cheap quality. Fell apart in a month.</li>
            <li> I used this razor as soon as I received it and was very happy with the results.  I did not use the Dorco blades that came with the razor but the Personna blades, which I purchased separately.</li>
            <li> This thing is terrible  i would not recommend at all save ur self from a nightmare</li>
            <li> This razor is satisfactory, but I expected more insofar as the clean shave.  I prefer my Excel for clean shave.</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon I did from Wal-Mart and what terrible terrible terrible product. The blades were absolutely garbage.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised quick delivery thanks.</li>
            <li> Bought one for my son, then had to buy another one for my husband.  Excelllent quality!</li>
            <li> This razor works absolutely great!! It is very well built and holds up nicely. It gives me very close shaves and I have never nicked myself. My wife even used it on her legs without any trouble.... I highly recommend this. I&#x27;ll be buying some for gifts...</li>
            <li> lasted a year of hard use then rusted but for the price great.</li>
            <li> It does a descent job, perhaps I did something wrong, but ended up with several nicks for the very first time using it.</li>
            <li> Not the best quality product.  Very tinny and cheap.  The top 2 plates were out of line and the razor doesn&#x27;t close properly.  Don&#x27;t waste your money, there are better quality razors out there and if used daily you need to spend more!</li>
            <li> Sorry, this razor is not for me. I found the handle short, the razor was not comfortable to use even after a hot shower or placing hot towels on my face.The design does not fit well in tight areas around the chin and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it worked out better as it sure would have been cost effective.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor about 6 months ago and it was a great companion while it lasted, until yesterday. It is more economic (thinking about how many blades come with it, and how long do they last) and the shaving quality is great. But let&#x27;s be clear: if you are used to the supermarket shaves, you will get some cuts while you will get used to this new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the welding point in the base got rusted - not cool when you think that otherwise this razor looks awesome standing in your bathroom. Also, yesterday the razor screw somehow broke - it is responsible to lock the blade in the razor. It is not catastrophic failure; I can still use it, but the blade is in a sub optimal angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I consider this much better than the supermarket razors.</li>
            <li> Save your money... not big deal,bs</li>
            <li> Used one time and cut my face in multiple places. Did not seem like classic safety razor I used to shave with decades ago. Something about the shiny finish seemed peculiar - unstainless steel like. I am still looking for that good old fashion razor. This was not it!</li>
            <li> I Mean Really Really Cheaply Made.  I didn&#x27;t know plastic could squeak.</li>
            <li> only way to go..who needs 5 blades that will make you bankrupt.  Have enough for over a year w what comes with.  Great shave can&#x27;t beat it..</li>
            <li> Works for me...bought it yesterday at Walmart, used it before work, and was pretty impressed with the shave.  I had about two days worth of growth and it made quick work of it.  I am used to shaving against the grain, however, and I&#x27;ll need to get used to using the blade before getting good use from it in that fashion. Overall I&#x27;m still impressed with the build.  Give it a shot...</li>
            <li> Razor VERY cheap. Within a week one side of razor top sprung, wouldn&#x27;t close completely. Spend alittle more and get a good razor.</li>
            <li> In seeing the cost of my Fusion blades creep skyward, I figured &amp;#34;what the heck&amp;#34; and decided to try this item. I&#x27;ve used it for about 6 months, and now realize that it&#x27;s time to go back to my Fusion. There is nothing inherently wrong with this item, but the shave was NEVER as close as I got when using the cartridge blades. I was shaving with this every day, and not getting the results that I was used to. I tried various varieties of blades to see if that would change the quality, to no success. I ALWAYS use a cream to shave with, and had ALWAYS received a &amp;#34;glassy-smooth&amp;#34; shave with cartridges, that would last for 3 or 4 days. If you&#x27;re after a &amp;#34;clean-up&amp;#34; shave, this may be the item for you. If you&#x27;re after a smooth and tight shave, you may want to consider something else.</li>
            <li> Very Good, Thanks....</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for my dad who likes that barbershop shave.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery</li>
            <li> fast shipping nice gift</li>
            <li> This was a gift &amp; he said he loves it!</li>
            <li> Mu husband loves this razor. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift for Christmas. The razor seems well made. The blades included perform well. I find that I prefer Wilkinson blades available locally. It gives a great shave and I&#x27;m so happy to not spend wads of money for those replacement cartridges. The process of shaving is no more  difficult than the 2, 3, or 4 bladed razors.</li>
            <li> Worst razor I ever used.  It took me 14 minutes to shave with it.  I had to go over my whole face 40+ times to get a mediocre shave.  I&#x27;ve been using safety razors since I was a teenager, and my wife gave me this because it looked similar to my 50 year old Gilette, but looks is where it ends.  I hope she kept the receipt.</li>
            <li> If I could give this a zero I would. It will take me weeks to recover from all the cuts this razor gave me.</li>
            <li> Item was delivered as promised. Satisfied with razor after using a couple of times. Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> First time using a safety razor so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  I used this razor for about 2 months it took a week or so to get the hang of it but was happy with the shave. At about 5 weeks it became hard to open to change the blade. Eventually I had to use pliers to open and finally the handle broke trying to get it open.  Haven&#x27;t given up on safety razors but will not buy this one again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how good this razor is for the money, someone bought for me as a gift. Never will I return to disposable razors again.</li>
            <li> Years ago when I first started shaving, this is what you used.  Now however, the new razors have a pivoting head and does not require you to adjust the blade to get good shave. I suppose with a little practice, I could get used to it, but still prefer my current razor.</li>
            <li> As a consumer that was tired of spending ridiculous amounts on cartridges, I took the plunge to old school shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little razor is well balanced and offers am extremely close shave when properly used, keyword properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t use this like a multi blade cartridge. This is straight razor shaving without a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to using this method, go online, study up. If you grew up with this you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades the send with it are passable but I&#x27;m switching to feather platinum coated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also.. If you&#x27;re going to this method of shaving, get a nice mug soap brush with badger bristles and go all the way with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end it becomes fun and much less expensive.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband who saw it on TV and he absolutely loves it. He said it&#x27;s the best razor he&#x27;s ever had. He would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t deserve a rating&lt;br /&gt;BIG P. O. S.</li>
            <li> cheap piece of junk!! first time opened It had to force it closed... run far and fast...</li>
            <li> Hi the product is fine. However im a little discouraged.  As i looked around the Amazon site i saw several of the same items with free shipping. Id really appreciate it if u could refind my money for shipping i live on a very fixed income and money counts every penny of it.  If you have any doubts please look around and see for yourself. Sincerely Michael Pisano</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for seven months. It does the job, but multi-blade razors are superior. I have a big goatee, and only shave my cheeks, I don&#x27;t have a full beard because the sides are soft and too sparse, yet many passes are needed, and the blades wear out fast. It&#x27;s cheap to use, and that&#x27;s the best thing I can say about it. If I had a heavy beard, or even had to shave my whole face, I&#x27;m sure I would be giving 1 star.</li>
            <li> A bit to get used to, more so than a commercial disposable blade type. Smooth shave and I didn&#x27;t cut my throat, success!</li>
            <li> I have some facial hair and I dislike the pain of tweezing.  My hair is very coarse so waxing isn&#x27;t a good option for me either.  The cost of 5-6 blades for plastic razors is outrageous and while looking for another option, I found the micro touch safety razor.  I was a 20 year user of the personal touch razor until they discontinued it. (sigh) Been using this razor for 5 mos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The Razor.  Looks nice, chrome top and handle and comes with a little stand to suspend it upright on the counter.  The stand is fine if working at the sink, it would not work in the shower unless you have a special or built in shelf to support it. The handle is very short, about 3 1/4 inches, a little small for ladies but you get used to it. Blades can be changed easily with a twist of the handle to open the head.  **In the 5th month, the twist bottom was stuck, had to use a pair of pliers to open it. I think it was a due to over tightening the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Usage.  Not that difficult to get used to, I normally have a light touch with the razors--especially on my face so there was little to no learning curve for me--DO NOT SCRAPE against the skin or you will be left with an unsightly knick.  Be sure to warm the area with water and shaving foam or soap before use.  Also, shaving with the grain of the hair growth first, then against it produces the best, smoothest result for me.  When I say smooth, I mean it.  It looks and feels like I have no hair growth at all.  I also have found that the results of this shave last longer for whatever reason meaning I don&#x27;t have to shave every day (as I did with a regular razor) and instead find every couple of days to suffice.  Frankly, with the use of this razor, I no longer get &#x27;stressed&#x27; at the thought of someone touching my face...which makes me very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the performance of this piece and plan to keep it until it is no longer usable or I die.  Whichever comes first.  If its the former, I&#x27;ll def by another.  The lack of the 5th star is solely due to the fact that I would love to see a version strictly for the female user with a longer handle.def by another.

            <li> I regret buying this, I don&#x27;t like it. This razor irratates my way more than any other razor.</li>
            <li> Its a good razor and you get a good shave, but the opening got stuck and broke when trying to replace razor. Go with the van de hagan, better quality</li>
            <li> I needed to change my shaving device due to the unaffordable price of the multiple blade razor heads I&#x27;ve used since the 1970s. I got an excellent shave the first time I used it, despite having forgotten how to use the gadget in 45 years. To my amazement I continued to get excellent results with the same blade, shaving daily for an entire month. Completely satisfied beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li> waste of money I will stick with the Gillette Fusion</li>
            <li> It is hard to shave close under the nose and it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I would like.  It doesn&#x27;t tug quite as much as a disposable single blade razor.  I do like all the extra blades and intend to use it.</li>
            <li> Not as good as my Gillette</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he hasn&#x27;t stopped talking about how great it is since he recieved it.</li>
            <li> get used to bleeding... need septic stick.</li>
            <li> Lasted about 6 weeks until mechanism failed</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave very closely, I had to go back to my old store razor</li>
            <li> The razor is okay. I&#x27;m not quite sure how to use it effectively. Not sure I am angling it properly to get the closest shave.</li>
            <li> Very well made razor, just like the safety razors that everybody used before the disposables came out. This thing reminded me that the old classic designs were so much better. It beats any disposable razor hands down. The supplied blades seem rather thin and flimsy, and I&#x27;m not sure how long they will last, but you can still buy double edge blades at most drugstores or online. I have a short-cropped full beard, so the only place I shave is the neck underneath. Sometimes, I get in a hurry and don&#x27;t want to mess with shaving cream. I can shave with this thing right out of the shower, no cream, and I go upwards against the grain, no problems and no cuts. Great retro product!  Update: When I ran out of the supplied Dorco blades, I replaced them with Shark blades. The Dorcos are better, at least for me. The Sharks don&#x27;t seem to cut as well, and they tend to drag on my skin. So the &amp;#34;supplied&amp;#34; blades may seem flimsy, but they work better for me.</li>
            <li> Item as advertised. Received in good shape and time.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed. I have a heavy beard and this product CANNOT begin to offer the same close smooth shave i get from my Gillette Fusion blades and razor. Maybe for guys (and dolls) that have light &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; hairs/beard, it may work fine. VERY DISAPPOINTED. Thought it would give me as good a shave as back in the day (the 60&#x27;s) when this was one of a few style of razors available, but that was when I had more &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; than beard. soooooo...be forewarned.</li>
            <li> Like other&#x27;s have said I was also looking for a cheaper way to shave. So for the price I picked one up, and it was worth it. Shaves great no cuts for me, and that&#x27;s saying something. For me it was a great buy I just purchased another for a gift hope they also like it.</li>
            <li> Item was as described and arrived promptly</li>
            <li> The razor came damaged so I don&#x27;t know if shaves good or not.....</li>
            <li> Back to the old day&#x27;s type shaving - simple and easy.  this also means long lasting and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> My husband reports that the razor stopped closing properly after putting in a new blade--something bent or warped.  This was a few months after purchase.  He doesn&#x27;t remember dropping it or anything and ended up throwing it out.  However, he is contemplating getting another safety razor, so he liked the shave while it lasted...I will add that he is notoriously prone to screwing things down too tightly:  light bulbs, jar tops, etc., so maybe he screwed down the closure too hard.  Still, it should have lasted longer, I think.</li>
            <li> My husband cut himself up with this razor.  I do not think he will use it more than once.  Much different from Mach razors, there is no give so they cut but he didn&#x27;t follow directions.  He shaved against the grain without adding more shaving cream.</li>
            <li> OK for a first time safety razor.  A little light and fair quality, but cuts just fine.</li>
            <li> This products is junk - don&#x27;t waste your money.  Razor handle is too small for average sized hands.  The blades are a joke.  You won&#x27;t cut yourself by running your finger over them.  Worst shaves I have ever had - save your money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect!!  Exactly what we&#x27;ve been looking for!  Thank you, and will look for your products in the future!! A+</li>
            <li> Yep it is cheap and it works. Who ever told you that you are going to get the same razor for 20$ as you can get for 200$ LIED! It isn&#x27;t a bad product for the money it is an ENTRY LEVEL razor. Not a Merkur or an Edwin Jagger. If you think your getting a top dollar razor here think again. POOR technique and or inadequate prep/ protection that causes poor results. Mine works fine and has for a year now. Don&#x27;t throw it around or use it to pound nails into the wall and it will work fine. I do agree the Dorco Blades Suck though. I use Derby Blades in mine with good results for cheap. If you want a Merkur or EJ type shave then pony up the cash and buy one. This is a Weishi and it won&#x27;t be as pain free as a EJ or Merkur starter line.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try a classic razor and this one works great!</li>
            <li> the more blades the more you pay. you don&#x27;t need all the blades in the expensive razors. my husband and I both use this (each have our own). he uses it for his face face and head. I use it everywhere (ladies everywhere) with no razor burn.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst razor that I ever used. It looks cool and the single blade sounded appealing but it was a terrible shave. It was a bumpy shave from the start and left my neck cut up and with razor burn. I thought maybe I just needed to get used to it so I tried it two more times with the same results. Do NOT buy this razor. Stick with your current name brand three razor system.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once and it did a nice job.</li>
            <li> This razor is the best I bought this Asa present and my guy says why have I never thought to gets this for myself, he says he will never use another razor again this is the closest shave and with no cuts, also brings back those memories of his dad using this kind of razor. I would recommend this as a gift or if your man says maybe go out and get him one he will thank you and use it daily...go get this</li>
            <li> I am loving this razor. This came with spare razors. I love the stand that shows it off very nicely, I am very happy.</li>
            <li> It handled well and gave a close shave</li>
            <li> Product did not come with razars, as stated on box.</li>
            <li> The life span is less than a year. The shaves were great initially, but I started having issues opening and closing the head to clean and replace the blades after approximately 9 months. The razor is virtually unusable in 11 months. This is another lesson in getting what you paid for. I would not recommend the purchase of this item.</li>
            <li> Very Good Shave once you learn HOW TO SHAVE ALL OVER AGAIN. That said, it is a better shave than any of the new razors offer. I dont care how many blades, you wont get a closer shave!</li>
            <li> I thought this razor would be like buying a better mouse trap.  However, I found I liked it very much, so much, that I bought my wife one for Christmas.  She used to buy those packs of plastic razors that did not work so well.  Not only am I happy with the shave I get, but I am happy to report no more cactus legs when I sleep with my wife.</li>
            <li> Did not work as stated, I&#x27;m using a three blade disposable and it works way better.</li>
            <li> The mechanical action which opens and closes the razor in order to load a blade has too much play and does not close fully allowing the blade to shift....</li>
            <li> As others mentioned, this is a lot smaller than it seems but it is a decent quality product. Comes with instructions if you haven&#x27;t used a safety razor before. The stand is a little bent on mine so the razor tends to slide off of it but that is minor. Overall, pretty decent for a starting safety razor.</li>
            <li> Lightweight not stainless steel. Hubby did not like the lack of straight edge for fine shaping. Personal preference issues not product complaint.</li>
            <li> this was a gift &amp; he totally loves it.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor to replace a sensor II razor. This razor shaves no closer than an electric razor! NOT a close shave at all! Wanted to like it as my dad had a razor similar to this that I started shaving with. This one has a handle that is to short and does not shave close at all. Other than that it seems to be heavy and built well, just does not do what it is suppose to do, and that is give a good shave.</li>
            <li> Now I remember why I have not used a double-edged razor in 40 years. Even using great care in a steamy shower I sustained multiple facial lacerations for a mediocre shave result. My face is worth whatever Gillette wants to charge for their multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this razor. Bought one for myself and my husband. So much better than throw away razors. just a good old fashion straight razor. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a cheap razor. I having been shaving with a safety razor for quite a while now and this one is garbage. The feels loose and the first time I used it I looked like I had been in fight with a herd of cats. I&#x27;m going to buy one like I had.</li>
            <li> Was a gift but he like it real well.</li>
            <li> The worse razor that I have ever used.  I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> I like the razor but it takes getting used to because you have to be careful especially around the chin.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll cut your head off. now I know why they stopped using this type of razor. I almost needed a transfusion after using thia.</li>
            <li> YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO SHAVE ALL OVER AGAIN ...  BLOOD FLOWS IN THE BEGINNING ... BUT 10 SHAVES IN ... I&#x27;M GOOD AT IT ONCE AGAIN ...</li>
            <li> Good Quality for the price.  Comes in handy if you shave once per week, since the single edge of the blade does not clog up like a multi-blade razor does.  Also, the blades are less expensive &amp; do an excellent job.</li>
            <li> The razor is not good. The workmanship is sloppy and loose. It is what we should expect from Asian products (the razor is made in China and the blades in Vietnam) . Rick has let me down.</li>
            <li> liked the shave, but can&#x27;t open the razor any more...broke after about a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will get another safety razor...just not this one.</li>
            <li> Great product, will help me save money.</li>
            <li> I bought this to see what these razors were like given the low price. So far so good for me. Very impressed with the first shave seems closer than the overpriced 5 blade razor I previously used. Read the instructions, take your time and let the razor do the work.</li>
            <li> It seems sturdy enough, but the handle is very short and holding it in my hands and using it makes me feel like I&#x27;m a giant at some little girl&#x27;s tea party, trying to hold a tiny teacup with my big sausage fingers.  In other words, it&#x27;s awkward to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the normal disposable razors I&#x27;ve always typically used give me a bit of a better shave than this.  I still feel stubble in certain places after using this.  Yes, there is a certain old-timey romance in using an all-steel razor, but it doesn&#x27;t translate into a superior shave in my experience.</li>
            <li> Not the comfort of a Gillette 3 blade.  It is a rough shave.. No swivel on the razor to shave around nose and chin.</li>
            <li> love it....but now...wth....you can buy it at cvs!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Overall good quality, handle is short, needs to be an adjustable setting for a closer clean shave</li>
            <li> Love it, works fantastic and is way cheeper than store bought blades</li>
            <li> You know why there are some negative reviews on this product? Because people have no patience nor can figure out what they are doing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is not a Shick Quattro where you can just go to town on your face! After you get used to it you will ditch any multi blade razors!&lt;br /&gt;You have to be very gentle with it (hence the small stem). You will cut yourself if you are not careful. Once you get the angles right, take it very slow you will see how great this is. The cleanup is so easy. None of this beating your multi blade against the side of the sink to get out the clogged hairs in the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must add it comes with additional razors and on the record I have been using the same razor since last Christmas! It&#x27;s still sharp and works great.</li>
            <li> Ive had this for about a month. Im very happy with it. Like other folks stated you need to be a bit more careful but it works very well. I like how easy it is to clean and it just seems more sanitary than the junk that gets stuck in multiblade razors. I think its got a cool retro vibe also and the little handle makes it easy for me NOT to misplace it. Solid product</li>
            <li> It works, just wish the handle was a bit longer and the head wasn&#x27;t so bulky, because it prevents me from getting a close shave when I shave my head.</li>
            <li> I was speculative at first, but after a couple weeks, it shaves just as good as my 5 blade Gillette Pro-glides.  I definitely took a little to get used to, but not really. After no longer being concerned with having to change the way I shaved (that&#x27;s what everything I read said), I found that just shaving as I used to, do did the trick.  I also noticed that after a few shaves the blade is a little more forgiving.  Its almost as if the blade needs to condition (maybe not).  Now, I am no longer getting nixes, I am shaving against the grain as I have always done, and I get just as close of shave as I have always have ( with maybe a few extra passes).  I have been on the original blade now for 2 weeks and it still going strong (shaving 1 to 2 times a day, depending). There are 11 more to go, which will last a long time at this rate.  I also tried all the upper quality shave creams( Cremo) and soaps ( which may have been why the irritation was higher in the beginning), and nothing works better for me than the plain Ole $1.50 Barbersol Beard bust.  So, I recommend that if you are going to try a safety razor like these, just stick with the same you have been using for cream, soap, gel, lotions until afterwards. That way, only one thing has changed and you get a better determination of if it worth your time and money. In conclusio, initial I said, &amp;#34;what a scam, i see why they made the newer versions like the 5 bladers, technology advancement&amp;#34; but now, &amp;#34;Yes, It truly is worth it&amp;#34; for me. To add to Pro&#x27;s, I was looking at the prices of blades, and if they last as long as the current one, they sell around 100 blades for $11-15 dollars.  Overall,  I am completely 100% satisfied with my purchase. Oh one last thing, make sure you keep the blade in tight.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just ok not that bad</li>
            <li> Takes a little more work than the multi-blade disposables, but the cost of blades is a fraction of their price.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t go back to disposable razors anymore after shaving with this razor and i have never had any problems with irritation or cuts because i read up and studied the proper way to hold and use the razor before hand if you purchase and have never used a razor like this before i would advise the same because if not you can mess your face up lol</li>
            <li> Grate razor, has sam weight and feel of my first razor 45 years ago.</li>
            <li> I have a beard and I use this. I have a full glorious beard, but I still need to shave my neck and cheeks to shape and edge my beard properly. The trouble with multi razors is that they are not precise. They may offer close shaves, but when trimming around beards they can&#x27;t get a good clean edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor gets right up to your beard line and offers a precise razor clean edge and with a simple stroke allows you go have clean neck and cheek lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and comes with plenty of extra razors. The razor itself is heavy, and seems well constructed. When the razor is installed you can shave from either end of the head allowing you to easily shave with and against the various grains of your face without having to turn the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a different shaving experience, so don&#x27;t expect your best shave right away, you need to get used to the feel of it. Once you do, after 2 or 3 shaves, you&#x27;ll notice a totally clean shave. Will save you money.  It will also take a few shaves for your face to adjust to it as it is not quite as comfortable as these fancy multi blade razors, but you&#x27;ll adjust.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a safety razor, some of the reviews bashing this apparently dont know how to read directions or just flat out do not know how to shave.  This works great for me, purchased in December and use this 3-4 times a week with a good shaving soap. Will likely try other brands of double edge blades just for curiosity as the dorco branded blades that come with it are supposedly not as consistent as other brands.  Only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because I have not used other brands of safety razor to compare this to.</li>
            <li> This razor will most likely cut you if you are not super cautious and ssslooowww when shaving. It does not compare to a 5 blade razor. I was convinced to try it because of its marketing but it does not work as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have wanted one of these safety razors for some time. That is what I started shaving with many years ago. I am not happy with the quality of this razor. I have owned it since the end of April. Because I am retired, I generally shave every other day. After use, I carefully clean it and put it on the stand that came with it. The other day, I couldn&#x27;t get it opened to change the blade. By the time I got it opened, the little cap at the end of the handle had fallen out. It still does not open and close smoothly. I guess it&#x27;s time for the trash bucket.</li>
            <li> good for getting started.</li>
            <li> What a rip! Hope all the money made goes to a good cause. Some old things don&#x27;t need to be revived.</li>
            <li> NOSTALGIC AND VERY ECONOMICAL in todays outrageous economy!!!!</li>
            <li> hubby loves his new razor</li>
            <li> Like many of the other 1 star reviews it worked great for a while but.... after several months the mechanism that you turn to open up the top for changing blades became harder and harder to turn.  It finally completely seized up and I could not open it.  I tried WD40 before and after it seized but to no avail.  I then resorted to pliers and it then broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve seen from other reviews I&#x27;m extremely surprised that Rick Harrison is endorsing this very, very poor product.</li>
            <li> maybe I must have a bad one it will cut nothing have tried three razor blades and can&#x27;t see were it even tried to work razor is way to small for my hands ,so it looks good but just don&#x27;t work for me,so will have to look for a larger razor</li>
            <li> It will work reasonably well IF you do good prep (shaving lather made with a brush from shaving soap or shaving cream, and not canned foam) and try a variety of brands of blades to see which one(s) work for you---and this razor works best with a sharper blade, like a Feather, Astra Superior Platinum, Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock SharpEdge, Voskhod, Personna Lab Blue, or the like. (The reason that blade sampler packs are so common is that the same brand of blade will work great for one guy and be horrible for another---thus each shaver must experiment to discover which brand(s) work for him. And a brand that&#x27;s best in one razor may not be best (or even good) in another, so the exploration must be done for each razor.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, there are MUCH better razors for the novice. I recommend the Parker 24C or one of the Edwin Jagger models (the heads are all the same; prices vary by handle). I would say the Parker 24C is slightly more comfortable and more efficient than the Edwin Jagger, but both are MUCH better than this razor.</li>
            <li> My husband says it was a good shave and he was so happy to have a shaver again that was easy to clean.  &amp;#34;it&#x27;s very important to have a clean shaver at all times.&amp;#34; I guess I bought the best gift for him.</li>
            <li> Good idea, made with cure platedbmaterial versus actual stainless steel. Held the blades fine and did a decent shave but even with consistent cleaning the internal screw rusted through in about 2 months.</li>
            <li> WOW!!! This product works as they say.  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t make the switch sooner.  All those years of paying $40 or more for a pack of &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; razors that last a month or two at best make my sick.  These razors just work and are super easy to clean.  Especially at the price they ask for it, it&#x27;s almost a steal!  If you are like me and hated paying to much for to little then buy this product now.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t get through the free blades before this thing rusts shut.  Cheaply made.  Get a good safety razor and your in right.  I would pass on this one if I had it to do over again.</li>
            <li> I did not think it shaved well</li>
            <li> Not as good as the new razors</li>
            <li> Hubby thinks the handle is a bit too short.</li>
            <li> Great product and much more cost effective over 3 and 5 blade razors.  Would purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li> I have been using an Edwin Jagger double edge with Derby ultra blades for the past 5+ years. That combo has treated me well and has been very inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just received the micro touch one as a gift and decided to try it out last night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impression : if you are accustomed to wet shaving, this is an easy switch. This handle is shorter, but was not an issue. Very comfortable and easy to use. I was able to shave much more quickly and &amp;#34;carelessly&amp;#34; with this razor. The blades included are surprisingly good. I was able to get an excellent shave that is as good or better than what I have been getting the past 5 years. I am going to try a derby blade next time to see if it is the blades or the razor that improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am surprised at the negative reviews. Time will tell how the materials hold up, but performance was excellent</li>
            <li> This is honestly the worst razor I have ever owned. Heed my warning and save your money. It&#x27;s awful.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor at another site, not knowing Amazon had it.  It is either a piece of junk, or maybe I could try better blades. It cut me up five times before I gave up.  I tried slow and easy, and whatever else I could think of to make it work right.  I guess I&#x27;m just too used to HARRY&#x27;s, which I think is the best deal available  https://www.harrys.com/products/harrys-blades.    I just tried again to make sure.  I gently and slowly shaved with a new blade.  Cut myself four times.    What a shame!  It would be such a nice travel razor with the nice kit and short handle.</li>
            <li> Very good shave. Handle could be larger!</li>
            <li> This razor was my hope, but unfortunately it is pretty horrible. It leaves your face shredded if it bothers to cut the hair at all. It&#x27;s back to the good old world of straight razors for me.</li>
            <li> Works great!! Very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Nice and heavy. Made to last. I hope</li>
            <li> Overall the product is ok, I would probably give it a 3 or 4. But I want people to know that my order took 4 weeks to get to me. I would not recommend buying anything from &amp;#34;Saranl&amp;#34;. Oh well, lesson learned.</li>
            <li> Looks ok but easy to use. I think I&#x27;ll switch to this type razor. If you&#x27;re looking for a fancy one then spend more</li>
            <li> I forgot my razor when going to the gym, and didn&#x27;t have time to run back to the house before work. Thankfully, there was a Wal-Mart across from where I work, so I decided to look. After pricing disposables, second handles for my normal Gillette Fusion, and being frustrated with the expense, I saw this little razor. Right out of the box, it worked like a dream. I used Shave Secret lotion, and did not encounter a single cut, scrape, or rash. The razor cut very close, was gentle against the grain after the initial pass with the grain, and was extremely easy to clean. Other reviews have mentioned problems with longevity, so I will keep my eye on it for a while and come back to edit my review if necessary.</li>
            <li> Worthless pos.Spend your money on a good safety razor like merkur, gillette etc. The blades arent the worst but the razor? I think they yanked this thing off of the front of a road scraper and downsized it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because like some others have posted here the name brand blade refills are sky high, and im no longer used to using the plastic ones from BIC etc. This thing shaves so no worries there, the only problem I got is that I underestimated the instructions warnings and out of habit pressed the razor against my face as I would do with a modern razor this let to several cuts! But overall once I got the hang of it I finished shaving like always. My only advise is to warn you ahead of time that this thing is kinda short so if you have big hands like I do it takes a little bit of time to get used to it. Now if I can only master shaving with a straight edge...</li>
            <li> This is the worst razor! Worked fine for a couple months but then the opening mechanism lock-up and could not replace the blade. I would not recommend this razor!</li>
            <li> I wish there was -1 category. This is a ripoff. Within weeks of using it the shaft started getting stuck. I bought this off of some TV advertising and I don&#x27;t even know where to call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviewers the handle eventually gummed up until it was completely unusable. For a while I needed pliers to open it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then today it just broke. Looking down the barrel there is soap and gunk. We have a water softener so it is not calcium buildup. If you are lucky and bought it on Amazon you might get your money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The twisty barrel needs to oiled or cleaned somehow periodically. OR hey how about a silicone sleeve that does not bind?</li>
            <li> I rarely write a product review but this item has eliminated my cost of shaving for life.  If you are under 30, slightly retarded, or have never shaved with a single blade you may want to avoid this product.  Otherwise it is an absolute pleasure to shave with.  I have also found a way to resharpen the single blades, so I will likely never pay to shave again.  Great product.  Most of the complaints are likely from people who are used to shaving with overpriced, multiple blades(which get clogged), plastic pieces of junk.  If you haven&#x27;t shaved with it before, take your time, don&#x27;t press hard, you will be fine young grasshopper, trust me.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> It is very rough on the face. My face would bleed all over. I wish I can get my money back and try the Dollar Shave online. The safety ravor is a lot better.</li>
            <li> Thought the shaver would be a better quality metal.</li>
            <li> works well, can really give you some gashes if you&#x27;re used to traditional razors and so far one blade rusted even though it claims they are rust proof.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the razor, just like man6 in here i was tired of paying way to much for the multi blade ones. One of the guys recommended this he said it did a really good job on his bald head. I&#x27;ve had it for about a week.  The 1st time i used it i wasnt to happy...well i was shaving wrong. Once  I  got the technique down now i love it. I gets a real close shave my wife also noticed  it. I use the blades  that came  with it.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic!  I bought it to see if I would like this versus the disposable razors and I have had no issues transitioning, no nicks or cuts shaving my legs, pits or lady bits.  Of course you have to be careful and thoughtful of how you are shaving but I love it!  I wish the holding piece was longer only reason why I didn&#x27;t do 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Still getting use to but over all Iam happy.</li>
            <li> Very good saved me 40.00 the first month.  But it did come on the slow boat from China. But it saved 3.00.</li>
            <li> Better and easier than I expected.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard and clog multiblade razors. I used this type safety blade razor when I started shaving. This is a well built razor and the balance is perfect, best shave I have had in decades.</li>
            <li> blades seem flimsy but boy does this razor work wonderfully! I even use it a little and it works like a charm. Smooth shave!</li>
            <li> Forgot how good these were.  Used one years ago they are easier to clean then multi blade razors great to get a close shave again.</li>
            <li> Received this as a birthday present. I wanted to try this kind of razor for awhile just never did. I will never go back to the multi-blade razors. I have not had razor burn or any ingrown hairs. I have been using it for two months now. I will try different blades. I get about 2-3 shaves from one dorco blade. They are my first double edge experience but seems like there could be better blades out there. There not horriable, i will use them up. I am still using up my shaving cream before I switch to the lather and brush. The razor seems to have nice weight and length. Feels like it should last for a good while. 4 stars just cause the quality of the blades that come with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Christmas and my husband still hasn&#x27;t used it. There is no instructions on how to properly place the razors in. I&#x27;ve read and been told that the blades are extremely sharp, therefore we want to make sure we do it right. We may just give it away.</li>
            <li> Good job ! Quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Jerry</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t press in with these, let the weight do the work</li>
            <li> Kinda gets a little corroded.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been hard on the &amp;#34;As Seen on TV&amp;#34; products because let&#x27;s face it, if it&#x27;s too good to be true, it probably is. But damn, I fell for Rick&#x27;s pitch. But I&#x27;m glad I did.  I just used this for the first time having never used a safety razor before. I&#x27;ve always spent the $40+ for replacement heads for my Gilette razor, but never again. After a little learning curve, this thing has already paid for itself twice over. Yes, it takes a minute or two longer, but it&#x27;s worth the extra time for a good shave at a fraction of the price.  UPDATED 1 AUGUST 2015: While I used to love this razor, it has now stopped opening and closing with ease. I literally have to force the thing to turn. Not sure why but will be looking into either an exchange or return if possible. I&#x27;ve owned this for just over seven months.  UPDATE 2 AUGUST 2015: I was wrong about having a hard time opening the head. Turns out our hard water jammed the mechanism and a 30 minute soak in CLR took care of that. Works like brand new again!!! Very happy. If anyone else has this issue, soak it before you chuck it.  UPDATE 3 OCTOBER 2016: Opening and closing has become harder and harder. It&#x27;s to the point now where it won&#x27;t even fully open and is a pain to close. I realized the blades are extremely cheap and left me very irritated after a shave. I have since invested in Feather blades which provided a great improvement in the reduction of irritation, but overall I&#x27;m now disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to like this Razor, I really wanted to, but as I labor through my shaves, this has not been a fun experience.  I wanted to be like my Dad, filling the sink with hot water, lathering my face all up and coming away with what I thought would be a close shave.  I wanted this to be a grooming experience that I would pass on to my son, but sadly it is nothing of the sort!  I feel violated as I&#x27;ve been a Pawn Star fan for years this really is a shady business practice.  I like those guys on Pawn Stars but I&#x27;ve fallen prey to a slick marketing campaign!  I wouldn&#x27;t use this razor to scrape stickers off my kids bedroom mirror.  The sharp edge on a discarded tuna can would provide a closer shave.  The blades that this comes with are dull to start, and you won&#x27;t get a close shave, even if you try.  I suggested a family member pick this up for me for the Holiday&#x27;s and they did, but what a disappointment.  I can&#x27;t recommend this inferior product, please realize it would be a bad investment.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast. My husband loved it.</li>
            <li> I was watching Skyfall, and there&#x27;s a part where James Bond is shaving with an old style barber&#x27;s razor, and he says to Miss Moneypenny &amp;#34;Sometimes the old ways are still the best&amp;#34;. Then I used this razor (which I got as a gift). You&#x27;ll recognize this from the old World War II movies. It&#x27;s the same type of razor that someone like John Wayne or Lee Marvin would use. And they are probably the last guys who used it.  I&#x27;m usually a Gillette Mach 3 user, but I got this as a gift so I had to give it a go. I like the idea. Cut down on shaving costs, and you modernize an old product for a new generation. The execution, however is poor. The handle is heavy, and clumsy. The blades aren&#x27;t very good. The head is HUGE, and you have trouble getting a good shave around the edge of your lips and under your nose. And it just doesn&#x27;t give you a very good quality shave. I had to go over large sections of my face several times to get parts that I missed, and I had to follow that up with a conventional multi-blade disposable razor.  After six weeks even when switching to a brush and using Nivea Sensitive Skin formula and using Personna blades, I&#x27;m still got  a lot of nicks and cuts, still got a lot of irritation and razor burn, and still missed large patches of stubble even after multiple passes. I really wanted to like this product because it was a gift, but I actively DESPISE IT! If these razors were so great, then they wouldn&#x27;t have invented something new, and subsequently BETTER. I&#x27;ve gone back to using the Gillette Mach 3. If I had to describe my experience with using this razor it would come down to simply two words, and those words would be UNRELENTING MISERY. Maybe your results may be different, but all I can say to you good reader is that the Micro Touch One single bladed safety razor SUCKS! And as someone who wasted his time and money trying to get it to work over the last two months, that really, REALLY ticks me off!Mach 3. Maybe your results may be different, but all I can say to you good reader is that the Micro Touch One single bladed safety razor SUCKS! And as someone who wasted his time and money trying to get it to work over the last two months, that really, REALLY ticks me off!</li>
            <li> Was great for the first 3 months but became harder and harder to open. Ended up having to use pliers to change blades then the whole thing fell apart. Looking into some of the other DE razors now. Highly Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very cheap! I recommend going with merkur...worth it in the end!</li>
            <li> It is an ok product, actually works well, just surprised that it as most things was made in China...</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong as most razors these days cost an arm &amp; a leg to use! This is a simple easy to use razor, I should have never stopped using this type way back when.</li>
            <li> Do your homework .spend the extra bucks for a 5 star razor. ...metal not plastic.  Look for a shave kit .  The right  creme/brush/blades .. just a razor is a waste ...watch utubes on De razors.  You are putting a knife to your face dude.  Do you want a yugo or a Cadillac?  Look at jagger.Parker .merkur. 3 peice units last forever  no moving parts .or be dareing get a vintage Gillette fat boy adjustable that&#x27;s been replated and rebuilt . It&#x27;s the best unit you can ever have ..till you die or see if grandpa has one you can steal and send out to a reputable refinisher .</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t close completely and cuts my face too easily.</li>
            <li> I get a big kick out of some of the lesser favorable reviews. I have enjoyed this razor. If you have never used a safety razor, it is worth it to read the instructions and not get in a hurry. Make sure the razor blade is seated correctly and the razor is tightly closed.  I am looking forward to the savings and enjoyably close shaves.</li>
            <li> Got the impression it was of better construction - seems a little on the &amp;#34;mass produced&amp;#34; at least cost side...</li>
            <li> fast shipping great razor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillete models for 15 years to shave both head, and face. The Mach 3 seems to dull out half way through the job. I bought the MicroTouch ONE figuring it would be another &amp;#34;As seen on TV&amp;#34; bust. However, much to my surprise, this is the closest shave I have had in years. Also, I have used the same blade twice with no signs of dulling, where the Mach 3 would start pulling at my hair half way through one shave. For me, this will be my new go-to razor for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for 4 months after two months it started to rust and now the finish is falling off. I guess what you pay for. It shaves ok once you get use to it.</li>
            <li> Decent enough, the action could be smoother but in all not bad!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and all as promised.</li>
            <li> I thought this was initially a great Razor only to discover that the Razor rusted shut which means that I cannot replace the actual blade. I called Customer Service to remedy the situation and they said, just spray WD-40 on it but they were not going to replace the unit. C&#x27;mon, I bought over 36 replacement blades for this thing...oh well, never again.</li>
            <li> It gave me a super close shave, better than multi blade razors. It took some getting used to and it will cut you up if your not careful. But it broke within a month. The twist at the bottom to open the head got locked and cracked off. Junk. I will be buying another single blade razor, but not this brand. Go buy one not from as seen on tv. Wish I could get my money back.</li>
            <li> Husband is very happy with razor. It also, always makes me happy when I can get a better price, than at the local Wal....</li>
            <li> Harrison is real smooth! He is scamming younger folks who never used a single blade razor. If you are thinking about buying this POS, ask your dad. I always had a stiptic pencil in my drawer to stop bleeding from the cuts I got from my &amp;#34;old classic&amp;#34; razor. If you don&#x27;t know what a stiptic pencil is, its a salt stick used to stop bleeding. I trashed a lot of white collared shirts by bleeding on the collar after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy the smooth sales pitch from Mr. Harrison. He&#x27;s laughing all the way to the bank. You don&#x27;t have to buy the latest most expensive offering from any of the shaving companies, just don&#x27;t buy the BS that Harrison is laying on you. The first time I saw his commercial I almost choked, because I laughed so hard. Now I am dismayed because I think he is fleecing too many people. For this device to have 3 to 3 1/2 stars just blows my mind. Don&#x27;t be fooled by a slick sales pitch from a &amp;#34;tv star&amp;#34;. I have never watched this guy&#x27;s show but will hold on to my wallet if he is ever nearby!</li>
            <li> If I could give it minus numbers I would!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on Rick for endorsing this POS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still bleeding all over from using the MADE IN CHINA Piece of Crap!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING.....IT&amp;#34;S A DON&amp;#34;T BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Got this for my hubby and he loves it. Nice clean cut.</li>
            <li> Very cheap and flimsy. I started out with these types of razors. But, the ones I used worked and they were strong and sturdy.</li>
            <li> The razor itself isn&#x27;t a bad starter for new single blade users.  The Dorco blades aren&#x27;t worth the surplus scrap they were made from.  I butchered my face with the first pack, thinking my skin would &amp;#34;toughen up&amp;#34; as you are told. Small wonder there is a disclaimer form from New Jersey about hacking yourself with them.  I was smart enough to buy a sampler pack.  I used a Shark blade for two weeks with no cuts or nicks. Went back to a Micro Touch blade (Dorco) No nicks with one use, second use, blood.  I&#x27;ve been at this for a couple months..  The rest of the Dorco blades are going in the trash.</li>
            <li> I like the razor.  The problem is it&#x27;s braking and falling apart and I&#x27;ve had it for only a few months.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly! Takes a little getting used to. You have to shave a little slower to start only to get used to it. The cost savings are incredible.</li>
            <li> Definitely have enuf blades</li>
            <li> No big deal.  Not as good a product as the famous person on the package led me to believe.</li>
            <li> Freaking love this razor!!!! Warning! You have to be patient in shaving, I&#x27;ve never used a single blade and I paid the price with my face. I&#x27;ve gone use to it now and I rarely get cut, if any. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go back to a regular 3/4 blade one. So I suggest you buy this too!</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I could give many reasons why this is not the razor for me but suffice it to say, this is a great idea on absolutely the best way to shave but the razor is cheeeeply made.  The razor is made in China and can be had for $4 to $6 delivered from China under a different name.  The one redemptive value of this product is that it has created interest in the old school style of wet shaving which is a much better, cleaner, less expensive and more satisfing method of shaving compared to the disposable three and four blade cartridges.  For this attention to wet shaving, I thank you Micro Touch.  Find yourself a decent Gillette adjustable or even a Gillette Super Speed or Flair Tip.  Worth the extra money and you will pass it on to your grandson. Good DE blades can be had on Amazon for $12 to $18 per hundred.  That beats $48 for 8 cartridges.  Again, Great Idea and Thank You Micro Touch!!  You really do need only one blade to shave.</li>
            <li> Excellent Service Will Be Back Again. Thank You</li>
            <li> Great value for the cost</li>
            <li> This takes me back to when I watched my father shave every morning. One simple blade, a twist to rinse it and continue shaving. When you really think about it who the heck even needs more than one blade.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Micro Touch Razor on January 22, 2015. Now it is broken by March just outside the window of returning item. Once you break the bracket by opening it to replace the blade , consider it broken for good. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it will shave before you break the bracket ,that holds the razor. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product until the fix the issue of poor craftsmanship.Funny thing is I read the reviews and was careful with it and it still broke.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my son.  He really likes it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband for Christmas after he saw the commercial on tv and showed interest in it. when it arrived, he was very excited to open it and try it. after using it for the first time he was very disappointed. He told me that the razor simply didn&#x27;t work. he said he followed the instructions but it wasn&#x27;t a close shave at all. He will be returning to his old cheap razors.  He really doesn&#x27;t have a lot of hair or thick hair, but he works in an office where he has to shave often to look neat and he wanted something that would work well and this was not the right product. very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Like the single blade, versus the useless, hard to clean 5 blades that they are coming out with recently.  Plus it&#x27;s very easy to clean.  You just have to angle this just right in order to get the clean shave.</li>
            <li> I use mine for the first time today and i love it..The wife says my face is as smooth as baby&#x27;s butt..I will never go back to a multi blade razor again...And you can get 100 blades for under $10.00</li>
            <li> For me this razor is to heavy and to hard to control.</li>
            <li> For people who have been used to the safety razors or multi-blade razors this item may throw you for a curve, but I have to say it is worth the purchase and time to learn to use it.  As a shaver who grew up in the era when multi-bladed razors gained dominance I used disposable single/double bladed razors for a significant time while I was in the military.  They were cheap, dependable, and required no maintenance.  Later I made the switch to the multi-bladed razors with replaceable heads.  Again they were dependable and required little maintenance (though hair clogging happened often) but these were far from cheap.  Prices soon climbed to more than $20 for a pack of 4 blades at local retailers.  I wasn&#x27;t ready to invest a significant portion of time buying the blades online or shopping around for the best price so I switched back to disposables for the past few years.&lt;br /&gt;At one point my father-in-law suggested this product (not specifically, but a classic razor with disposable blades like how &amp;#34;he used to shave&amp;#34;).  I have seen the Rick Harrison commercial once before so I decided to make the buy.  I have to admit that if you are unfamiliar with using this type of razor it can seem daunting, but basic principals still apply.  Shave with the grain and use a roughly 45 degree angle.  The really key is the amount of pressure you use, people used to safety razors and multi-blades know you can put quite a bit of force on your face with no worries.  Don&#x27;t do that here.  This is delicate instrument compared to the more brutish disposables.  Let the weight of the razor pull and you&#x27;ll be fine.  I was a bit concerned that there was some tugging as I shaved, but when i switched from a shaving gel to an actual foam (a cheap Barbasol foam worked very well in fact) it went away for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;This razor is worth it.  In fact I think any of the Classic Safety Razors is worth a try if you are as fed up with blade prices as I am.  This razor gives me as good of a shave as any multi-blade I have ever used and I can get a pack of 50 replaceable blades for around $10.  You will have to put in the time to learn how the razor works and you may need to change the way you shave or what other products you might use when shaving, but its a small price to pay to be clean shaven and a bit wealthier.s me as good of a shave as any multi-blade I have ever used and I can get a pack of 50 replaceable blades for around $10.

            <li> The Razor in nicely built, has nice balance and works great.</li>
            <li> This does not work as well as my mach 3 razor, I have been shaving for twenty five years and this razor works but does require more effort and time to work, I also get a closer shave with my mach3 razor. This one is cheaper and well save you money, but time is money also.</li>
            <li> Clumsy and bulky..blades are really thin and some last longer than others.not a bad product but not a great one either.</li>
            <li> Back in High School and the US Army I started out with an electric razor; then switched to Bic disposables and Gillett cartridges and the like; with favorable results. However, the $$$! So I bought the Microtouch One; and tried it for the first time this morning. This is the first time I ever used a razor such as this....good overall first impression. Very good shave; alittle slower because I&#x27;m not used to it, and maybe alittle afraid of it. At work today, I looked in the mirror, absolutely no nicks or irritation, and my face feels good actually. Seems like quality product, very shiny metal. I wanted to shave more traditional because around a year ago I changed to the brush and bowel set up, and also use natural Dr Bronner&#x27;s soap instead of shaving cream. Now I want to be clear on this....you only get 12 blades with this, not the 24 like on the TV deal, also a case did not come with mine, but a nice chrome stand. Very happy with this purchase, but I admit, it was the Pawn Star&#x27;s TV commercial which got me thinking about it.</li>
            <li> So I went ahead and bought the Micro Touch One razor because Rick Harrison from Pawn Stars was the spokesperson on the ad and he seems legit (and he&#x27;s bald like me). When I opened the shiny and heavy razor, I probably had a look on my face similar to the boy who got the Red Ryder BB gun on &amp;#34;A Christmas Story&amp;#34;. The blades run about 75 cents a piece versus 4-5 dollars for the newer technology razor blades. I read the directions and it said that the razor needs to be at a 45 degree angle to shave closely. My old razor (the &amp;#34;expensive, four blade model that doesn&#x27;t shave any closer than the Micro Touch One&amp;#34; according to ads) pivots on the contours of my very non-flat head. I quickly came to realize that pivoting in a razor is very important as in order to use the Micro Touch One to shave as close as my Gillette Mach 3 that I would have to have the flexibility of a Cirque de Soleil gymnast to maintain an effective cutting angle. Don&#x27;t waste your time unless you are really hurting for money, and plan on either being a contortionist at some point- or needing rotator cuff surgery.</li>
            <li> Not worth it. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I had this razor about three months before the handle started getting stuck. I had to use pliers to open it up. It finally broke. I cannot believe Rick would put his name on something like this.</li>
            <li> I used these when I was younger when I had little options and they were not very good. Why would they be any better today. This co claims they are best because that is what Pro&#x27;s used to use and still use. Well I used to use them and nothing beats a quality multiblade like mach 3. In fact the ones I used were made in the USA back then so these newer chinese made versions will be no better. do not fall for the hype.</li>
            <li> This a great razor, for those who complain about it don&#x27;t know the true art of shaving. The blades I received with the razor weren&#x27;t dull.  Those who swear by multi blade razors are too used to convenience.  This is a great buy, however read up on how to shave and the other products needed to successfully shave with the micro touch.  Aside from a barber&#x27;s straight razor,  the micro touch will give you a way closer shave vs the easy mode multi blade razors.  Again research how to properly use a single blade razor before getting this razor.</li>
            <li> my job requires me to keep a totally clean shave. this one gets the job done very well. you get what you pay for im sure a more expensive safety razor would be even better but mine gets the job done.  Update** Ive owned this thing for 6+ months, no problems so far just make sure you clean it properly and no problems. I recommend you buy a sampler pack of safety razors. the included ones are rather good but its nice to buy a sampler to see what works best with your hair/skin.</li>
            <li> I got this for my dad for fathers day he had been looking for a straight razor for a long time he absolutely loved this</li>
            <li> Looks great but, it&#x27;s made with chrome plated pot metal. Not durable. Drop it and you might as well throw it away. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Rick thumbs up to you old school Razor work super great!!</li>
            <li> Kind of a rough shave .. Easy to keep clean ...nice to have around if your electric shaver doesn&#x27;t work..</li>
            <li> Outstanding razor. Best one I ever owned.</li>
            <li> After years of not getting a decent shave, I finally returned to the safety razor I began with. Through the years of ridiculous double blade, triple blade and finally the most monstrous of all, the 7 blade waste of money. It seemed the more blades they added, the faster the razor clogged up. Can any one explain why a razor requires more than one blade?. Ever see a barber shaving with a multi-bladed razor?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Micro Touch Safety Razor gives me the cleanest shave I&#x27;ve had in years!</li>
            <li> I shave my head. This is the best razor I have ever used. No question.</li>
            <li> This razor is based off of the original Glilette patent.  In fact the blades fit an old Gillette i had.  The problem is in the quality of the product.  It shaved great, after learning how to shave without nicks.  But then opening the razor became harder, and needed pliers to open it. Finally the mechanism just plain broke, no more replacing the blade. Do not buy this product.  Rather, there are other of the same products but with the quality built in. Merkur is one that ive read about but did not experience first hand.  Its a shame, but I believe Gillette stopped making these in 1985. The best thing i can say for my broken razor, is it got me to appreciate the old style, single blade razor. Which is much more cheaper then the modern multi-blade cartridge razors. btw: Im surprised that Rick Harrison still stands behind this product.  Bad taste</li>
            <li> Gave good shave but head broke off in less than 2 months</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Walgreens to get away from the ridiculous razor blade prices. It started out awesome but after a month the handle broke, not allowing me to open our close the head fully to change the blades or shave. It turned me on to safety razors but the quality is definitely lacking. Contacted their customer service to see what I can get out of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for awhile.  At last I found it.  This razor is nicely balanced and easy to use.  Good-bye disposables!</li>
            <li> This is so fake! the blade is no better then any others out there! it cut my head! Ponstars says he used it on his head, i don&#x27;t believe it now!</li>
            <li> I had just watched the episode of How It&#x27;s Made that featured the classic safety razor &amp; became intrigued.  I did a little research on the interwebz &amp; was surprised by how many people recommended using a DE over the 5 blade monstrosities that I was currently using.  I work at CVS &amp; we had recently gotten the Microtouch One in.  I was skeptical at first because most of the ASOTV crap I&#x27;ve bought is just that, crap.  But it had Rick from Pawn Stars endorsement so I decided to give it a shot (also my employee discount &amp; some coupons helped with my decision).  I was very pleased with the quality of the razor &amp; the stand was nice. The razor was not as cheaply made as I expected &amp; it had pretty good heft to it.  A friend of mine gave me a nice shaving kit made by The Art of Shaving so I lathered up &amp; off I went.  Being my first time using a DE I expected my bathroom to look like a murder scene when I was done.  Much to my delight I didn&#x27;t suffer any mishaps.  I have large hands so it took a little getting used to, but overall I was very happy with the job it did.  I have never had a shave quite like this one before &amp; I am now sold on the DE razors.  This is a very good razor for noobs to start with and it doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.  I would recommend starting out with this one &amp; then once you get used to shaving with a DE, moving on to a nicer one with some higher quality blades (I&#x27;m going to buy the Merkur Long Handle &amp; Feather blades next).  For $20 this is a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> Nice close shave. Sometimes its good to go retro. And a whole lot cheaper than to keep buying the gilette fusion blades all of the time.</li>
            <li> My husband thought these worked well but the only downfall is that he had to disassemble the head to clean the blades as compared to the single edge razors.</li>
            <li> Its useless - i have always used single blade razors and still looking for a proper one since i moved to states. This one does even cut properly with regular single blades</li>
            <li> Horrible. Cut my husband&#x27;s face all up.</li>
            <li> Great price, great product</li>
            <li> A very bad experience. And poor design the blade doesn&#x27;t fit in the head tight enough. Even shaving at a 30 degree angle it still took the skin right off. Don&#x27;t waste you money. And don&#x27;t get discouraged. If you are wanting to go the saftey razor route try ( The shaving factory ). It is in my opinion the best you can get for the money. You still have to be careful until you are comfortable shaving with the saftey razor . The blades are extremely sharp. The end result is once you try a good saftey razor you won&#x27;t go back to cartridges.  Note you also need a good cream. Try(creamo cream). Happy shaving.</li>
            <li> Good product and price!</li>
            <li> Overall good shaving tool.  The trick is not to screw the bottom knob too tight, otherwise it bends the blade to the point that the razor&#x27;s edge  touches the protector metal, rendering it utterly useless.  But once you get a hang of it, its pretty cool to use.  Great for precision beard trimming.</li>
            <li> He uses it whenever he shaves and reports that he has a clean shaven feeling. He also likes the convenience of the sharp looking stand as he no longer has to hunt for his razor.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the worst piece of junk I&#x27;ve ever purchased on Amazon.  The razor fell apart after 3 shaves, but I&#x27;m thankful for that because each shave tore the crap out of my skin and I ended up a bloody mess...and I&#x27;m no rookie,  I have been shaving for more than 40 years. I have never had this terrible an experience. I am giving it one star, only because a star rating is required.  I would give it no stars if I were allowed.  Keep far away from this one.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with my grandfathers DE razor for about 5yrs, the best shave.&lt;br /&gt;I found this at Walgreen&#x27;s, the clerk let me open it and inspect it, (clerks no nothing about these types of razors so don&#x27;t expect any help from them).&lt;br /&gt;This is well made, opens very easily and closes very well; no blade wobble.&lt;br /&gt;Handle is standard length, weight/heft is good.&lt;br /&gt;Blades: I by mine at Dollar stores for about a $1.00 for 10, they work very well, I can get about 2 weeks of good shaving from them.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: flip the blade over and you can get a few extra shaves, try that with a mega-blade that last about 3 shaves a week.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to buy this to replace and retire my grandfathers.&lt;br /&gt;For beginners research \\&quot;Wet Shaving\\&quot; to learn how to use this type of razor, and use a per-shave oil.&lt;br /&gt;My method: Wash your face, work in a little conditioner and let set for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Lather and shave your face in sections, let the blade do the work don&#x27;t press or it will cut/nick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;UPDATE\\&quot; Been using this for a few weeks; works great. *IMPORTANT* You will get nicks from all DE razors, learn to shave correctly with this type of razor.&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash face. 2. Apply a little conditioner lest set a few minutes. 3. Apply shave cream. 4. Shave; don&#x27;t apply pressure let the blade do the work, take your time, re-shave if needed.&lt;br /&gt;These razors act different than the plastic sissy sticks multi-blade do all&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I was extremely tired of overpaying for 5 blade razors and had seen a commercial for this run during a Pawn Stars marathon.  I figured I&#x27;d give it a try with extreme hesitation based on some of the comments I had read online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really glad I did give it a shot, this safety razor is fantastic.  I&#x27;ve also ordered some replacement blades which I have not yet received, however the included blades are great.  I&#x27;ve never used a safety razor and read around for shaving suggestions, a lot of being successful in not cutting yourself must come from proper preparation and use of good shaving cream.  I was told not to use canned shaving cream as additives irritate your skin.  This gets a closer shave, for cheaper.  Take your time shaving and make sure you are doing so at the right angle if you&#x27;re having issues.  I&#x27;ve used this three times so far and it&#x27;s come out fantastic every time!  I would absolutely recommend this blade to anyone looking to try something different.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it!  He was constantly buying and throwing away razors....This one he&#x27;s satisfied with and he&#x27;s keeping!</li>
            <li> Did not like it at all.  Easily nicks your fave.  Went back to my old razor.  No nicks.</li>
            <li> I tried this updated classic razor and I have to say it provides the best and most comfortable shave of all my razors and I have a variety collection.  I hate to take the time to write reviews, but after the fifth great shave with the same blade and still sharp I had to make a shout out and share.  My granddad used this kind of razor and he nicked himself a lot - I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes to save a buck or two. But found that it there is a reason for all those blades after all. It&#x27;s called a close shave! This by no means can replace my Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is hope though! This might be perfect for those doomsday&#x27;s if and when they get here. It&#x27;s going to be hard to get a modern razor when all hell brakes loose. So off the the go bag with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using safety razors for a little while now; I have a few various razors, the one is my favorite so far. Traditionally DE (double edge) safety razors are hefty so you don&#x27;t have to apply any pressure this can lead to nicks or cuts if you apply pressure as you would with a multi-blade modern razor cartridge.The one is light weight which makes it ideal for anyone interested in DE shaving but are intimidated by old school shaving. The one isn&#x27;t so mild that seasoned DE shavers will be turned away by it. Overall I fully endorse the Microtouch One.&lt;br /&gt;My advice, forget the canned shave gels/creams they are bad for your skin. Get a shave brush and shave soap/cream such as Taylor of Oldbond street. There are many options for shave soap &amp; brushes, I recommend experimenting and trying out various options to see what works best for you. Once you get into wet shaving it&#x27;ll change everything you thought you knew about shaving. Multi-blade razors claim to produce less irritation well I can tell you without a doubt that&#x27;s completely bogus. Geofatboy and Mantic have great DE shaving tutorials on YouTube.</li>
            <li> Cut my face up .and to short of a handle, just going slow with it .was cut .I don&#x27;t think my forst shave was this bad and that was foty years ago .the product is ok , just not for me.</li>
            <li> Great gateway razor to the Merkur- much higher quality.  The Micro Touch is a low-investment way of trying before committing to the razor system.</li>
            <li> just what&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just what I wanted works good, thanks</li>
            <li> This razor meets all my expectations except one; the handle is too short and a longer handle is needed in order to get a better grasp on,</li>
            <li> good razor, not a great razor, but exceptionally good for what i paid for it.  it does give a great shave.</li>
            <li> first time i used it i took  my time and got very good shave, i see people saying they got cut its not a safety razor so you can&#x27;t go fast with it just move it up or down and not alot of pressure, if you move it sideways yes you will get cut. i think its perfect.</li>
            <li> The razor is a poor copy of the original Gillette safety razor. The open / close action is rough. The blades are not particularly sharp&lt;br /&gt;and will only give one shave per edge.</li>
            <li> This is a closer shave than you get with a disposable razor.  It has safety features and comes with extra blades.</li>
            <li> A great razor for the price. I&#x27;ll never go back to cartridge razors. I had to learn to shave all over again but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> Picked mine up at the local drug store in the &amp;#34;As Seen on TV&amp;#34; section.  Have to say I absolutely love it.  I only have one word of caution - and this is about safety razors in general, not this one in particular.  Most of us learned how to shave with razors with pivoting heads/blades.  The heads on safety razors do not pivot.  This razor will save you a ton of money on replacement blades, but only if you invest the time to watch a few YouTube videos on safety razor shaving and spend the time to go VERY slowly your first few shaves.  You have to unlearn a lot of shaving habits that were fine for cartridge razors, but which are bad habits for safety razors.  Spend the time to learn how to use this razor properly and you&#x27;ll reap a lifetime of savings.</li>
            <li> For over 30 years I have used a variety of double and triple blade disposal razors. Well suffice it to say they don&#x27;t make &#x27;em like they used to. You do not need more than one blade to shave with. So if you wish to throw your money away continue to be fooled by the multiple blade phenom. In this case less is truly more for your money.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money. You&#x27;re better off buying disposables</li>
            <li> I actually got a hold of this razor when someone else got it for themselves and didn&#x27;t like it.  I had seen it advertised and decided to try it rather than see it trashed.  Well with all due respect to Rick and Pawn Stars, I think he should stick to minding his shop and making fun of his old mans age.  First up and most frustrating with it?  It&#x27;s too damn short and small.  I am not a fan of all the downsizing that is going on these days to begin with.  It&#x27;s happening with everything from phones to tools, and I hate it for its not at all conducive to people like me with big hands and fingers.  Classic razors like this as far back as I can remember have always had nice solid handles that were 5 inches or more long and made it easy to wield around ones face for that very reason.  This thing is barely over three inches and trust me, that doesn&#x27;t come off as an improvement with it in my opinion.  You end up trying to cram your fingers in there to move it around your face and it only ends up with you making it easier to nick yourself.  Which brings me to another problem with it, and a very nostalgic one with these single blade systems.  It&#x27;s much easier to cut yourself with them.  More of the blade is exposed in a single system like this and I found myself bleeding anytime I started getting comfy with it and trying to move a long a litlte faster.  A multi blade razor, (with a nice longer handle on it), I can move right along with and really have to get clumsy to cut myself with it.  You will have to pay close attention to what you&#x27;re doing with this thing just like you did back in the day when these single blade systems were the standard... Not a comfortable relaxed shave at all in my opinion...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I will admit that if you take your time and are careful, this razor will indeed give you a shave that can rival that of some multi blade systems.  (The cheaper ones that is, not the best of them.)  And being that its a single blade its easier to clean. But certainly  not does it get the job done any better on the curves of your face, like around ones chin.  A multi blade system is far superior in that sense. But those couple of pros do not in any way make up for the horrible little toy like size of the thing, nor the fact it is so much easier to cut yourself with just trying to move it around chasing the direction of your beard.  I think I will keep it for if and when I run out of my multi blade cartridges, but that&#x27;s about all.  Sorry Rick, two stars is the best I can do with it.. : )t certainly  not does it get the job done any better on the curves of your face, like around ones chin.

            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure why I purchased this razor.  I have been wet shaving for the past 2 years and have built up a decent collection of several new model Merkurs, Classic Gillette, Straight Razors, and single edge safety razors.  Maybe I&#x27;m just a sucker for infomercials.  Probably has more to do with my R.A.D.  I had read the reviews of this razor and I knew it was a mild razor, but I was unprepared for how mild it actually was.  Too many passes to acquire a decent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be a great razor for anyone new to wet shaving, but anyone who has been at this awhile would be disappointed with the non aggressive nature of this guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build quality seemed decent, but weight was kind of lacking in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said though, for $20.00 why not give it a try.  Maybe I can pass it off to my wife.</li>
            <li> I got for my husband birthday.  Enjoy it very much.  Shaves very well.  He very happy with this thing.  I the best wife now</li>
            <li> Terrible....Stay Away...Does not even take off any of my facial hair. Does not feel like the blade comes out far enough.</li>
            <li> If you basically know how to shave this razor fits the bill...............no biggie&lt;br /&gt;Fully able to open and rinse our hair</li>
            <li> I wanted to try it just because it&#x27;s old fashion looking, but like the model T nice to see and mess around with but for the long haul technology wins mach 3 for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve watched a commercial on tv about this razor and decide to give it a try. The problem was when I used the razor... It felt very awkward in my hand and it was hard to maneuver around my face . This metal razor feels heavy compared to my usual two blade Gillette Sensor razor. Also, I didn’t like the feel of the blade shaving against the grain and I cut myself a few times. I would not recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> Hubby was happy that I was able to find this shaver at Amazon at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> lasted about three blade changes and the gear inside broke. Darn near sliced myself because of the loose blade . Don&#x27;t waste money on this. It&#x27;s made of cheap pot metal. Go to E bay and buy a vintage Schick or Gillette..........Cheap Chinese RIP OFF.</li>
            <li> Shave was good - it didn&#x27;t last a year - the razor would not open to replace the blades</li>
            <li> I first gave this razor a 5 star. But after a month of use, not even every day, the top became hard to open. I put a drop of white grease in it, now a week later the threads are stripping. Junk! I spent double money on a Merkur Bakelite &amp; I hope it is better.</li>
            <li> husband loves this razor, it just falls out of it;s stand a lot, but he doesn&#x27;t care, he wanted this style of razor for along time, he hates the disposible, multi blade razors</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this using my wife&#x27;s account. So don&#x27;t believe someone named Linda is shaving their face with his razor. The razor in itself is fine. As good as anything else. I believe the blades are of substandard quality. My first shave was not as close as I get with my Merkur razor and Persona blades. I give the razor 5 stars. But the blazer only give 3 stars because they&#x27;re only better than nothing. If this is your first razor, consider some different blades. And check out the Nick Shaves videos on youtube for all lot of good information.</li>
            <li> Decent razor. Definitely not high quality. Mine began to come apart after a few shaves when I went to change the blade out. Spend a few extra dollars and get something worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor for a couple of months and have had zero problem with it.  While I didn&#x27;t care for the Dorco blades it came with, I&#x27;m having great results with other blades in the same razor.  It&#x27;s got a heavy feel to it and is easy to open a close, holding the blade very securely.  Easy to clean, easy to replace blades.  It&#x27;s simple and works, just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It good, i use it and leaves my face smooth, very easy to change blades.</li>
            <li> I would of gave a 5, but the handle is too short.</li>
            <li> I have one &amp; love it.  So I bought this one for my best friend  $-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice razor! I enjoy shaving and I don&#x27;t waste a lot of money now on cartridges! Gives a really good shave if you know how to shave like a boss!</li>
            <li> Blades don&#x27;t last as llng as expected</li>
            <li> I bit cheesy,the bottom piece fell out and after 4 days the shaver started to rust. The handle is to small, light in weight and the handle is also to short.</li>
            <li> Razor seems very cheaply made . Not sure about the blades either. Cut up my face first couple of shaves.</li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews for products I dont actually own and use, however the purchase experience of this product was so bad I felt compelled to warn others to stay away. Ordered direct from the company and was never notified of a 3 month back order. Called today after 2 months and they said late next month I should be receiving it. I can understand a backorder of 2 or 3 weeks but 3 months is ridiculous for anything. The company also gave my info to \\&quot;partners\\&quot; who tried to solicit me for gas vouchers and other scams via phone. I cancelled my order because this company deserves no business even if the razor meets a gold standard in shaving.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor because of Rick Harrison&#x27;s endorsement.  After following the instructions, I received the worst series of shaves ever. It does not shave close at all.  If you try to shave closer, you just cut yourself.  The last time I used it, I looked like I went through a meat grinder.  The blades that come with it are not consistent.  Some are dull right out of the wrapper and some have one sharp side and one dull side.  Save money and stay away from this razor.</li>
            <li> 5 stars are not enough, this razor is better then I expected, and everybody should buy one, and one for your best friend</li>
            <li> My hubby loved this surprise - a little old school but well made, clean, and it works. It made him a little nostalic thinking of relatives he&#x27;d seen shave with these when he was growing up. Even if it didn&#x27;t work the joy he receive from the memories it brought up would be reason enough to buy again.</li>
            <li> I like it . Like the ads say, a person doesn&#x27;t need a six bladed razor to get a good shave. My only complaint is that it could be a little heftier.</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH BUYING.  THIS RAZAR DO NOT SHAVE ME GOOD AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;THOUGH YOU MAY HAVE BETTER EXPERIENCE.&lt;br /&gt; EVERYONES FACE IS DIFFERENT.</li>
            <li> first time user......love the way it works,&lt;br /&gt;plus, i noticed how expensive most desposable razors are,&lt;br /&gt;but single razor blades for this do not cost much at all....very&lt;br /&gt;happy with!</li>
            <li> I ordered a basic razor. Then I got a phone call and I told them I wanted just the basic razor. What did they do? They upgraded me against my will to the &amp;#34;Deluxe&amp;#34; offering. The only difference was the number of &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; razor blades. If the extra blades are free, why did they charge me $10 for them. The original S&amp;H fee was $4.99. This was changed without my authorization to $12.98.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called customer service and complained. What I was offered was a return of $29.98. Thus I am out $12.98 plus return postage. Since I did not authorize either the upgraded offer or the increased shipping and handling charge, I consider this to be fraudulent behavior.</li>
            <li> It was just what it claimed to be and my husband was very pleased.I was Very glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I picked one of these up a few months back at a big-box store while going to buy a pack of replacement cartridges for my five bladed razor of choice for the last six or seven years. For just about the same price as a package of four cartridges, I got this razor with fifty double edged blades. I&#x27;ve been interested in making the switch to a safety razor like this for a while, and this was a great way to give it a shot without investing a lot of money (many safety razors like this style start out at fifty bucks and go up from there). The main thing with these razors is learning not to expect a one swipe clean pass like many men are used to through using multi-blade razors. After learning to reduce the stubble through multiple light passes with this razor, those other razors feel like a hack and go option. The hack and go method would leave my face feeling raw, create ingrown hairs, and made shaving a dreaded process. Not to mention the cartridge blades always seem to dull so quickly, even the second shave with one seemed to tug at the hairs. With this single blade setup, taking your time produces an effortless, comfortable, and close shave. I actually look forward to shaving with this razor, and don&#x27;t skip shaving like I used to, leaving me looking like a stubbly hobo half the week. This razor is SOLID, and for the price the quality is on par with much more expensive safety razors. The blades that come with it work great for me, though you can take the time to find others that work better for you (I also like the Gillette silver blue blades), which are by far cheaper than buying cartridges. Each razor seems to last A LOT longer before dulling as well, leading to further cost savings. Take the time and learn to use this razor, you won&#x27;t regret it!!! It may take an additional three or four minutes to shave, but you will be very happy with the outcome!!!</li>
            <li> To be honest, I saw Rick (from Pawn Stars) advertise this on TV several times before I paid attention. Tired of paying a lot of money for replacement blades, I had nothing to lose. This is SHARP and I also purchased 50 Derby Extra Double Edge Razor Blades at  around $8.00. The MicroTouch One is my razor from now on.</li>
            <li> Great deal and fast shipping! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Good solid construction, smooth opening and closing, a handy storage stand and a good, close shave. I&#x27;ve been looking for a good safety razor for years, and this one fits the bill. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Gives a closer and smoother shave than the other razers that have more blades.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. He says he loves it and it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Razor has broken already. My husband went to change the blade and one of the pieces fell off. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Great razor! and the stand that comes with it is super cool.</li>
            <li> It words OK but you have to go over your face 5 or 6 times to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> This razor is advertised as if it the most incredible thing ever, but it&#x27;s identical to the one my Grandfather used...the one he nicked himself with! It shaves smoothly, but that&#x27;s nothing to brag about. After all, what else is a razor supposed to do? It feels a bit heavy. I could have lived without it.</li>
            <li> My husband has been wanting this razor for awhile. He&#x27;s thrilled!! His face is so smooth after his shave no razor bumps, no marks showing where the hair on his face was, it&#x27;s a close smooth shave that he&#x27;s thrilled with!</li>
            <li> Bought set at wal Mart. Liked it enough ordered my son set from amazon. Never will I miss my mach 3 and glad I set my son on path to much better shaving experience than I had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40 years old and have always used the latest and greatest razor.  I&#x27;ve used the vibrating multi-blades to the Mach 3 and fusions.  I have never used a DE razor until I bought this one.  The first use, I was greatly impressed.  It gave me a smooth, close shave with no bumps.  The big kicker is I bought 100 blades from amazon for only $10.  You can&#x27;t beat that.  Others argue that it&#x27;s heavy.  It is suppose to be.  The weight of the razor is what shaves you.  You are not suppose to bare down.  If you look for an instructional video then you&#x27;ll understand and you will love the razor.  There is a slight learning curve but nothing that doesn&#x27;t take a quick video and one shave to figure out.  After that, You won&#x27;t have a problem.  I hope the razor last. It seem like quality.  I love the classy little stand too.  And the best part is that I don&#x27;t have to worry about my wife using it for her legs.</li>
            <li> This was a birthday gift for my boyfriend. He&#x27;d read reviews about it, lots of complaints he said. When he opened his was skeptical......but couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. It&#x27;s sharp, doesn&#x27;t get clogged up, rinses easily. Don&#x27;t know what everyone was griping about. Totally recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor in a local store, seems you can&#x27;t avoid coming across it at the moment.  I figured it is cheap and I will give it a whirl having only used cartridge razors my entire shaving life.  If I liked it I planned to buy an antique quality one and keep this as a back-up.  On to my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;It gives a good clean shave.  Closer than any I ever got with a cartridge razor.  But as I have researched this is the norm for safety razors.&lt;br /&gt;It is inexpensive.  For the $8-20 you will find this for it is a decent price.&lt;br /&gt;It is a turn to open (TTO) style razor.&lt;br /&gt;It is all metal, no plastic parts as best I can tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;It IS NOT stainless steel.  After shaving with it only 3x the plating is wearing off.&lt;br /&gt;The end cap on the handle has already come off.  I am not entirely sure it wasn&#x27;t anything more than a bubble of plating that wasn&#x27;t supposed to be there but it&#x27;s gone now revealing the internal mechanism in the handle.&lt;br /&gt;It is more expensive than an antique safety razor (if you look around) that functions the same and has already lasted decades longer than this will ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall impression:  I am glad I took the leap to try it.  It is not the same quality as an antique but it does the job.  For how long I don&#x27;t know.  I have already purchased 2 antique razors one from the 1940s and one from the 1950s.  They are much better quality construction.  In my opinion this is an ok razor and if you like the quality of the shave you will likely purchase a much better one elsewhere but it is an acceptable initial entry into world of old school shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other note, these older style razors seem to be en vogue currently, no doubt due to the high cost of cartridges and some hipsters rediscovering them.  I myself tried it because a good friend had been on a search for a better shave and he is a freakin hairy beast of a human being,  I mean he really looks like he just climbed down from thetrees .  The same folks touting how shaving  is a life changing event with one of these are a bit on the melodramatic side or just plain nuckin futz.  You will get an extremely close shave.  That is all.  Magical unicorns will not appear and tickle your man bits while cherubs dance above you.  You also don&#x27;t need all of the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; shaving accessories to go with it.  A can of barbasol and a few minutes if time paying attention in the mirror and you will get a good shave and probably won&#x27;t mangle your face.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this for my Dad who is used to this type&lt;br /&gt;of razor. (old school)&lt;br /&gt;He was extremely happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great job.</li>
            <li> I have been using for two weeks now. Nice item, well built. Very inexpensive. You must remember to shave slow. This is not like modern razors. You will be bleeding if you go fast.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to not have to buy ridiculously expensive shaving equipment anymore. Unfortunately, this wasn&#x27;t the solution for me.  Maybe it&#x27;s user error, but I&#x27;ve tried shaving with this blade 3 times and cut myself up so much each time that I had to give up and go buy some really expensive blades again :(</li>
            <li> Junk.  Nothing would line up and one of the wings would keep popping out so I popped it in the trash and kept the razor stand.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my grandson. Now he can really save money on blades.</li>
            <li> I never got to use it,it broke the first time I was putting the blade in I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying one</li>
            <li> you cannot shave across the grain.</li>
            <li> This is a great little Razor. The handle is a little to small for me, but it works great anyway.</li>
            <li> Extremely please with quality of razor and the shave my husband achieves with this product.  It certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt that blades are much less expensive than for his old razor.</li>
            <li> smooth close shave, leaves face soft and with out whiskers would recommend to everyone who is looking for a very close shave</li>
            <li> This is a good quality razor with good feel and balance. I was concerned about nicks and cuts like my old safety razor years ago but this one has not been any problem. I&#x27;m glad I tried it is is economical and effective.</li>
            <li> I was allured by how cheap it would be to get a single blade razor versus buying more blades for my Gillette Pro Fusion. My cheapness turned out to cost me more in the end. I wasted the money on this only to have to purchase more tips for my old razor anyways. Now that I bought it, I realize that there was a reason everyone stopped shaving with this old junk. The blades are flimsy and dull fast. The razor body itself was sloppily built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions and was directed that it would take time to get used to using a safety razor. I did end up stop shaving half of my face off after a few attempts. I was always left with short stubble no matter how good I got at using this dang thing. It does not compare to shaving with the Gillette Pro Fusion that I had come to love. I like a clean smooth shave that won&#x27;t leave me with a five o&#x27;clock shadow at noon...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn from my mistake, don&#x27;t cheap out. You get what you pay for! Unless you like an aggravating shave that leaves you cursing Rick Harrison&#x27;s name, stay away friend!</li>
            <li> I threw it in trash after half shaving. Blades are not sharp. Handle of the razor is too short. I got so many cuts on my face after 3 stokes.</li>
            <li> This product fell apart the first month</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I bought this razor. It has a heft to it&lt;br /&gt;and feels great in my hand. The angle is pithed so that&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t even tell that there is a blade in it. I&#x27;ve thrown away&lt;br /&gt;my old, &amp;#34;duel blade&amp;#34; piece of plastic that used to cut me&lt;br /&gt;and all the &amp;#34;duel blades&amp;#34; that went with it, and I won&#x27;t be&lt;br /&gt;paying $28 every time I need blades. I bought 100 Dorco&lt;br /&gt;blades for $6.20 and that will last me for years. This was&lt;br /&gt;a lucky find.</li>
            <li> Giving it two stars for the closeness of the shave. But wouldn&#x27;t have gotten it if I knew it would nick me as much (minus 3 stars for that).</li>
            <li> Just as advertsed.  Replacement blades can be found for under 10 cents a piece!  It takes a little practice to adjust to the new touch - but once you get it - you will never go back.</li>
            <li> This is the type of razor I shaved with when I had to shave my whole face. I&#x27;ve had a full beard for 30 years, and since I&#x27;m not on Duck Dynasty I feel the need to shave at least part of my face. My cheeks and neck still have to be scraped every couple of days&lt;br /&gt;and I just got sick and tired of the multi blade super duper razors that cost much more than a razor should, and promised to shave hair that hasn&#x27;t even grown yet. A rip off if ever there was one. The single blade razor seemed impossible to find until I saw an ad with Pawn Star&#x27;s Rick Harrison. &amp;#34;There&#x27;s my old razor!&amp;#34; I said to myself, and I ordered one. It&#x27;s absolutely a fine razor, and I&#x27;m glad I bought it. No regrets at all. I am an advocate of going back to simplicity in just about everything, and this razor, though it will take some getting used to, is the thing I need. So, my advice to anyone who doesn&#x27;t need a shaver with fourteen blades, it&#x27;s own shaving cream squirter, or neon lights attached to the handle, is to buy this nifty little razor. You probably will find no reason to curse me, or my review.</li>
            <li> I liked the razor for about a month after which it started to fall apart.  I now have a pile of peices that don&#x27;t work.  I went to change the blade and it just fell apart.  I&#x27;m now hooked on safety razors, but if you want one yourself.. look for better quality.  $15 seemed to good to be true and aparently it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safe you self the effort and spend a little extra for a good one.</li>
            <li> Item was damaged on delivery. Very poorly constructed.  Not worth risk of shaving with it.</li>
            <li> My first wet shaver! This is a great starter for someone who has never used this type of razor. I&#x27;ll never go back to those expensive cartridges. Now if I could just find one my wife could use, she doesn&#x27;t like how short the handle is. After using this for almost a year I&#x27;m ready to upgrade to something better.</li>
            <li> My husband was excited to try this product.  Unfortunately it tore his face up along the chin area.  He said it would be great for bald heads.  Too bad he&#x27;s not bald.</li>
            <li> Average, I will not buy another one</li>
            <li> My husband bought this razor at Wal-Mart for 19.95. This was an excellent buy.  He needed the blades to go with his 1930-1940 Star3 piece razor that was a gift to him.  Blades for this razor are hard to find and we found this razor. It came with 12 blades.  Our stepson used the Microtouch One Razor for the first time and had never used one before.  He loved the way it shaved his beard.  It is easy to clean and with a little guidance he was able to get a good close shave without cutting his face.  My husband is 46 years old and his grandfather and father both used this same razors that he is using today.  He loves this razor and now our stepson is hooked on this razor also.</li>
            <li> The best way to shave.  Wish I had one years ago when I started shaving.  These other companies stick it to us consumers with the rolls royce price the charge for their 2, 3,4,5 multiple razor blades which do a lousy job because you can&#x27;t clean the hair out.  With this razor, just twist the handle stick under the sink and presto a new blade.  Hate saving, still do, but I would not use any other razor to shave with.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I am not a shaving connoisseur by any means, but I do know quality. I bought this, luckily discounted. I bought the one that came with the stand instead of the case.  Initial quality, I am not impressed with. My razor of comparison is a &#x27;58 Gillette Super Speed. The finish of the micro touch is of course brand new, and it&#x27;s an attractive unit. My SS is 56 years old and it has a vintage cool look, but definitely not all shiny and new. Well. Using the twist to open on the Micro touch, it sounds cheap, squeaky, and at times the butterflies need assistance to shut right. Even the blade pops up, not sure if that&#x27;s a feature to help you get the blades out, but it&#x27;s irritating. The gillette opens and shuts like a well oiled machine and blades fit like a glove. There&#x27;s a chrome plastic cover on the end of the razor that&#x27;s loose so you can hear it rattle when you shake the razor, the gillette does not have one, nor needs it. The micro touch came over from china, so I knew not to expect a Cadillac of a razor. But honestly if you&#x27;re in the market for a double edged safety razor and do not want to spend an arm and a leg for a good one, watch eBay or your local antique shops and get a vintage gillette super speed or fat boy.  You&#x27;ll thank yourself, and be buying a quality, American made piece of masculinity for around the price as this waste of metal.</li>
            <li> Works great, better than the more expensive Mercur razors, which have a screw on/off head.  Certainly works better than the light multiblace disposable razors.</li>
            <li> Great razor for the price perfect for any one that wants an entry level safety razor but the blades could be a little better getting feather blades made a big difference</li>
            <li> I have been on a shaving kick the last couple of months.  First bought a Straight Razor. Which is great!  Purchased the Shave Soap to go along with it.  And that made shaving a dream.  Then bought a replacement handle for my Atra Plus.&lt;br /&gt;  And then I said what the heck, let me try the Safety Razor.  But some of them get abysmally expensive.  If I am going to try one, I don&#x27;t want to spend a ton of $ on one if I don&#x27;t like it.  So since I had a 25% off for CVS, I saw this Safety Razor there, I figured let me buy it and see what I think. If I don&#x27;t like it, I am not out of a lot of money. $15 plus tax and I was good.&lt;br /&gt;  I used it, and you know something?  It&#x27;s not that bad.  Feels good in my hand.  Shaves pretty well. Not as well as my Atra Plus (and a little difficult to maneuver comparatively).  But I did enjoy the way it shaved.  The only reason why I am giving this a 4 star rating is because the razor blades it came with are a hit or miss for sharpness.&lt;br /&gt;  So if you&#x27;re looking for a good starter Safety Razor to practice with to get a handle on how to use one, this \\&quot;As Seen On TV\\&quot; one is a good one to start with.  But do yourself a favor, go to the 99¢ Store, Walgreens, Target, CVS, or other store and buy razor blades that are certainly going be sharp.  The one&#x27;s this comes with are really a hit or miss.</li>
            <li> Scary razor. I didn&#x27;t buy it on amazon, but I just wanted to warn people of how uncomfortable a shave this is. Two cuts on the first shave. Stick to the triple blades. Bloody awful razor. Literally.</li>
            <li> I was sick of disposable razors and decided to check into an old fashioned safety razor. I saw Rick of Pawn Stars endorsing this product, so I thought &amp;#34;Why Not?&amp;#34;.  And just like any deal with Rick, you don&#x27;t feel like you got screwed, but you are not 100% happy.  It does what is supposed to do and is a huge improvement over the cheap inefficient plastic razors men have been brainwashed to buy since the 70&#x27;s.  It has a cheap foreign made feel, but holds the blade very well. It brought back the old sensation that shaving should be somewhat of a pleasure, and it is suitable.  It is lightweight and rather short for me, but one thing I know now....I am NOT going to use a plastic razor anymore. I feel I can use this razor until I decide on another brand.  It is not really a bad deal.</li>
            <li> Once you learn to use it lightly it works great and saves money.</li>
            <li> I was sick of paying ridiculous prices for multi-blade razors so decided to give a single blade razor a shot. It will take you a little longer to shave, but overall the cost savings outweigh the additional time needed to get a good shave. Very attractive looking razor as well.</li>
            <li> gift for my hubby. He used to use a disposable a day. He has only had to change blade once in more than a month because this one he can take apart and clean. Very practical and a great gift!</li>
            <li> Exellent product at a fair price.  Arrived on time and works as it should.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor to replace those 4 blade junk razors and it works like a charm, I wanted a small one to travel with and this is a nice one, the weight is nice and the handle is pleasant to hold on to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something to keep in mind, if you have never used a safety razor before and prior to buying one get on youtube and find out how to use one. unlike the 4 blade razors the safety razors take a special technique or you will open your face to a work of pain. I&#x27;m 37 and was raised on one so I know how to use it but if you have no idea how it works or how to use it you will hate it and write a review that shouldn&#x27;t be written. the Razor itself a decent razor for its cost, Just like everything else the cost is everything but not with how they work, the cost is weight, quality and build which this one is nice for its price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are starting out I would recommend this or even a $30 one with a little more weight to it but if you try it and like it I would recommend upgrading for the weight and maybe the handle length, there is short and long and this one is a short one.</li>
            <li> i ordered this because i remembered this type of razor gave me the closest shave i&#x27;ve ever had, but its also not good around the knees.</li>
            <li> I have had the razor for about a month and love it. I never used this type of razor before and will not go back to the expensive replacement blades of the other razors.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was tired of the constant increase in disposable razors. It works great. Just like the ones we,50+, grew up using. The only issue I have is the blades sent with it are slightly larger than the razor base is. You have to be very careful or you could cute yourself badly.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I have been looking for. High quality for a razor. I just with the handle was a little longer. I like to buy another one soon.</li>
            <li> Plastic crap do not buy. Spend a couple dollars more get a Parker. That&#x27;s what I did after I bought this junk.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an Alright starter razor if you&#x27;ve never used this style before. Mine lasted about 10 months before it would no longer open, so I couldn&#x27;t switch out blades. A friend of mine is currently having the same issue, using a wrench to pry it open. So basically if you&#x27;re new then go for it but don&#x27;t expect to have it your entire life like some of the merkur razors out there, but it&#x27;s a perfect starter.</li>
            <li> I found that I needed to change the way I use this razor, and practice with it a little, but after a week or so it provided a closer shave than more modern razors.  The significant issue is the cost.  I can use this razor (including blades, etc) for ten years rather than use modern razors for a month.  That&#x27;s a bit of an exageration, but not by much.  My recommendation is to try it.</li>
            <li> Razor works great. Better shave then multi-blade razors. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a nice close shave. With proper lather and care this could be the last razor you will ever need.</li>
            <li> Handle could be just a tad longer. It would be easier to manipulate around the face, making for a better experience.</li>
            <li> I simply hated the product.  The product simply did not work for me.  I am a Black male and I am not sure if this product was designed to be used for people of color.  It did a very poor job of cutting my facial hair and scalp.  I really should have returned it.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about buying something advertised by the pawn shop guy, but have to say I am impressed with the product.  Works just as well as my Gillette Fusion without all the cost for blades.  I did get knicked up a few times at first, but once you get used to shaving with this style of razor you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> This was an impulse purchase from a local store. I was curious how it would compare to my Merkur Razor made in Germany. I&#x27;ve been using the Microtouch with my platinum coated Derby Extra blades and so far I love them both. This razor design has a convenient twist open butterfly top which makes changing blades very simple and quick. The included stand makes it a great value. With modern technology Double edge razors and blades have been perfected over the years and are vastly better than years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to a good shave is using fresh quality blades every time and working the shaving cream/gel firmly for a full minute into your face and neck before starting to shave. If you&#x27;re new to double edge razor shaving give enough time to get used to the routine and allow your hairs adjust to new style. Don&#x27;t judge these poorly before using them at least 10 shaves to allow your face and hand coordination adjust. Over the years I&#x27;ve used all the fanciest Gillette models and after getting used to double edge razors I&#x27;m not going back to cartridge style shaving again. These razors and blades give me a closer shave than cartridge razors. I love  double edge razor shaving, it&#x27;s simple, practical and comfortable. Use a fresh new blade every shave, such as Derby Extra platinum coated blades, they&#x27;re very affordable at 10 cents a piece and you won&#x27;t go back to shaving with cartridges again. Cartridge razor blades are for boys, double edge blades are for men, straight razor is reserved for the hero and the brute.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the razor and the stand. The shave seems closer. Its all neat and together in the bathroom. Heavy duty material. We have had this product for about a year now and it is of superb quality. No rust, no cuts, no complaints. He is very satisfied with this razor.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it and so do I.!</li>
            <li> I am traveling on a work trip and was sitting around the hotel room with the TV on and saw the Pawn Star guy with an old fashioned razor. I forgot to pack razors on my3 week long work  trip so for 20$ I thought what the heck.  I have tough beard / whiskers and I hate to shave because the expensive 3-4 blade razors last me only a time or two to shave with.  I am also an older guy and I believe in keeping things simple.  That is what this is a simple time tested shaving device.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it and it didn&#x27;t let me down.  I found replacement blades on amazon quantity of 100 for around 11$ enough blades for a year at least and about the price of a pack or two of the multi-blade disposables.  I believe the used blades could be a cutting hazard to my wife when she cleans so I plan on putting a small milk jug under my sink in the bathroom to put the old blades into. As for some of the detractors claim about rusting I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to judge that.  I do wish it came with a travel case.  I also bought a shaving brush to apply my shaving gel with or will try some old fashioned shaving soap later.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these razor kits.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit scared at first, but took it slow and easy, and was very surprised.&lt;br /&gt;It will take a little more practice on my neck, but the shave was very close.&lt;br /&gt;The razor is all metal, and feels comfortable in my hand. has a decent weight to it.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy I decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> I am a female and I use this razor.  It works great...no cuts.  Take your time with it; don&#x27;t press down.  Let the weight of the razor do the work.  I have NEVER had a closer shave using those expensive 4 bladed razors, which cost me $16.00 for FOUR!!  NEVER AGAIN!!  This razor gives an extremely close shave.  LOVE it :)</li>
            <li> Okay for a starter razor, but I&#x27;ve had it six months and the butterfly hinge has rusted shut. Serviceable for a beginning safety razor, but you&#x27;ll want to graduate to a big boy razor in a few months.</li>
            <li> Minor cuts the first shave, now that I&#x27;ve used it a month I am loving the close shave. Only down fall so far is a bit hard to shape sideburns and get in near my lip but with more practice I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I prefer the single blade razors over multi blade razors for less skin irritation.  DE safety razors seem to be more of a luxury in today&#x27;s standars.  I saw the micro touch at a local store.  For the price, I decided to give it a try.  For $20, you get the safety razor, a razor stand, &amp; 2 packs of Dorco blades.  Not bad at all compared to the big name safety razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried it, the razor was uneven.  One side of the razor had more exposure than the other.  I put another Dorco blade in there, and the same results.  I thought the blades were defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I put the Dorco blade in a Vanderhagen safety razor I own, and had NO problems.  The shave with the Dorco blades were fine.  The micro touch safety razor I purchased was built pourly.  Defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see other reviews praise this razor.  I wish I could say the same thing.  With this product, you do get what you pay for.  I would advise anyone interested in a DE safety razor to start off with something affordable, but do it cautiously.  Hopefully you won&#x27;t have the problem I had.</li>
            <li> Nothing but bumps and cuts. Threw it in the trash. Don&#x27;t think its because we don&#x27;t know how to shave either. It really is garbage.</li>
            <li> As advertised, theshaver uses old school double edge blades, Most of us have gotten used to disposable or cartridge type razors. This is a version of the original, prd-bic double edge shaver. It really does do a better job. As explained in the documentation, the first few shaves aren&#x27;t all that. It&#x27;s a different style of shaving that yields a superior result.</li>
            <li> This product is best,I bought from Africa.but I didn&#x27;t know that I can find something like that in USA .It works very well,it is latter bit short but it very nice product.i can recommend this product to anyone who want to get very close shave. Many thanks to Amazon and to this company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually skeptical about things on TV, but, I took a chance and it&#x27;s paying off ! I bought this razor, along with 100 pack total was around 30 dollars .... give or take, but the 100 pack should last around 2 years if I changed every week. If I bought mach 3 blades every 6 weeks or so, I&#x27;m saving about 300 a year just in blades, the 100 pack alone was only 8 dollars, so no more multi blades for me ! it took a few times to not cut myself up, but once you get used to it, it&#x27;s a great deal and a great razor !</li>
            <li> this saved me lots of money on shaving, way better then those 14 dollar blade razors, i downsized and love the savings, and yes it shaves really good, i even ordered the brush and soap, for hot lather shave, im happy :)</li>
            <li> I personally like, not love, this razor. My husband has tried it about 3 times. He hates it and wont use it anymore. It is extremely sharp &amp; has to be used carefully. He&#x27;s always in a hurry to get  done &amp; because of that, he gets cut a lot. I tried it just to see what he was talking about. He&#x27;s right. But I used it slowly &amp; with less pressure and it works fine. So if when you shave, your always in a hurry, don&#x27;t buy this. If you have time to take it slow then go for it.</li>
            <li> worth the price Husband was tried of cheap razors and some were pricy .He loves how it works so far the weight is not bad you get use to it he says also bought of Dorco ST301 Platinum Extra Double Edge Razor Blades to do with it very happy worth the cost product high make</li>
            <li> Bought for husband and while it provided a good cut at first, it was impossible to get the top open to change the blade after 10 months.  Kind of defeats the purpose.  Hubby forced the twisty mechanism on the handle and the entire top popped off.  It&#x27;s in the trash now.</li>
            <li> Shaved with this razor 3 times...my Gillette fusion which is 2 weeks old left me with much less second day shadow,also tried to shave my head with this razor,forget it too many nicks</li>
            <li> I saw it advertised by the guy from Pawn Stars, and thought it was a cool looking throwback safety razor like dad used to use - and indeed it is cool looking, with extra blades and a little rack to hang it on... but I must say for me it is NOT an improvement upon my Gillette Mach 3 blade system. I found the blade to snag on whiskers (or skin),, and had to use the Mach 3 as a &amp;#34;clean up&amp;#34; a couple of times. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s terrible, and it will do the job, but I&#x27;m not buying the ad line that it is better than the multi-blade shavers. Your mileage may vary. It is a great gift for $20, comes in a cool gift box. And who knows, the recipient may be happier than me. Or it may just take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> This was.a brilliant gift ideal for my husband who use to use a dingle blade razor yeats ago. He&#x27;s enjoying the single blade again. Perfect gift!</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t shaved with a safety razor in over 20 years, but now I seriously wonder why I ever switched.  I love the shave this razor provides and I like using my old soap mug and brush.  The low cost drew me back in, but now I&#x27;m even more sold on the quality of shave I&#x27;m able to get.  100% satisfied!</li>
            <li> Cut the he_l out of my face.  now I remember why they invented &amp;#34;triple&amp;#34; blade razors...cause the old singles....cut the he_l out of my face.........Nostalgic but not worth going back to......</li>
            <li> This razor works like a traditional razor which is what my husband wanted for a close shave.  He did not want those new fangled triple bladed razors.  It is made well and comes with 20 blades.  My husband says &amp;#34;buy it&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> my husband got his razor today and used it for the first time said it is the best shave he has had. he has used electric razor&#x27;s and multi blade expensive razor&#x27;s. he had less irritation from the one touch micro razor than from the more expensive multi blade razor&#x27;s.he would recomend this razor to anyone! thanks to micro touch razor , rick harrison and alway&#x27;s great amazon</li>
            <li> It worked well for about 2 months, then the razor stopped opening smoothly and I ended up breaking the actuating pin inside the razor.</li>
            <li> Liberal or Conservative doesn&#x27;t matter, when a company demands you agree to binding arbitration they have one motive and one motive only, to deny you your rights.  There&#x27;s a little piece of paper in the package, easy to miss that is your binding arbitration agreement.  To me demanding binding arbitration is an admission that they are scared of liability for a faulty or unsafe product.  What does that say about their confidence in their product?  I mean after all it&#x27;s a razor.  There is a risk, through use exactly as designed and intended that the user will suffer injury, if a lawsuit for normal nicks and cuts wasn&#x27;t dismissed immediately the company, and society as a whole has a lot more to worry about.  I know that binding arbitration has an overwhelming preference for the company NOT the &#x27;injured&#x27; consumer and I will not agree to this abusive practice where I have a choice, so I returned the product, unused.  BUYER BE-VERY-WARE.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor to trim my beard. The multi-blade disposable razors I used previously clog up after one shave and need to be replaced.  The microtouch provides a neat trim line to my beard, is easy to clean, and the blades last through a number of shaves.</li>
            <li> I bit trick at the first time, the instructions want clear enough, but some advice from my 92-year-old  grandpa helps me take the most from this product.</li>
            <li> First use of a safety razor so I&#x27;m not an expert.. Seems extremely light and very small.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do though and gets the job done.  For the price I thought it would be a good starting point to try one out.</li>
            <li> At 58 years of age this is the type of razor I learned to shave with. I am well versed in the use and care of double edge saftey razors. I cleaned the razor after each use. After using this razor for about 6 months it refused to open after shaving so I could clean it. I had to use pliers to open and remove the blade after shaving. I applied light machine oil to all moving parts hoping to cure the problem. It worked fine for about a week then I had the same issue. This time the razor broke when trying to open. Now I find warranty only applies for online and phone purchases. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Just like the old days.  Easy to use and economical.</li>
            <li> I having owned other safety razors can honestly say that this razor is a piece of junk!  Very cheaply made, but then i realise where it was made! In China, nothing made there is worth a crap! do yourself a favor buy a razor made in Germany you will love it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this thinking you no longer need the more tech type shavers. Its virtually impossible to shave with this without getting nicks.</li>
            <li> The first thing you will struggle with is trying to get the ziplock off the Razor, next trying to get the blades out of the plastic holders. Each blade is wrapped and when you unwrap the blade it states stainless blade..I put one in the razor and tried shaving. Complete Junk, Its made in China, Good Luck.</li>
            <li> Frankly they make safety razors for a reason, using this is like going back in time. I had nicks all over. I would not recommend</li>
            <li> The handle is way too short for a grown man to use effectively.  I took it out, held it, tried to see how it could possible be positioned to shave me, and it didn&#x27;t seem possible.  It may be a great razor, as I didn&#x27;t use it, just returned it.  But, for me, a longer handle is necessary.</li>
            <li> Woow!! This works really great!! recommend to anyone who wants that wonderful close shave. FYI be very careful when taken those blades out of the box, they are crazy sharp</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this through Amazon, but through the product website. Do not buy it through the product website. As soon as they had my credit card info, they processed an order. I never &amp;#34;placed&amp;#34; the order. When I complained, their response was, once we have credit card info, we process. I have never heard of such a thing and have placed a complaint in with the BBB. Getting on to the product. For approx. $20.00 you get the base razor, a stand (woo hoo!) and 12 blades. I followed the directions and recommendations hoping for a wonderful close shave. Following the 1st down stroke, I had about 90% of my stubble in that patch still on my face. The blade sits to deep and doesn&#x27;t get close enough to the skin. Maybe, if you shaved a bout an hour ago with a double/triple edge razor and then used this you could foll yourself in to thinking it works. If you want to try a single edge, you can buy one to try out for much cheaper than this junk.</li>
            <li> Excellent item. Forgot that razors originally had only one blade! Shave is smooth, and I like being able to open and clean blade. Current cost of replacement blade for my old razor ranged $8.00-$10.00 for 8 blades. This will pay for itself before I open 2nd set of blades that come with the razor!</li>
            <li> Have always been curious about old straight razors and safety razors, having always seen old ones in &#x27;showcases&#x27; at flea markets and wondering what was so special about them when I was younger, then into my early 20&#x27;s almost considering one but never taking the plunge. My girlfriend and I were out shopping and I saw this one. I have a microtouch for trimming up other areas so I recognized the brand instantly but was drawn to the fact they had produced a safety razor. I said to myself and to her I was going to just up and buy one and if I didn&#x27;t like it then I&#x27;ll keep it as a &amp;#34;collectible&amp;#34;. I must say after having used it, I will NEVER go back to disposables, multi-blades, etc..&lt;br /&gt;This thing has given me the best shave EVER. Even &#x27;sculpting&#x27; my beard as I have to I&#x27;ve grown to know the blade and can curve and control as I need to. Blades are super cheap, just get them from the dollar stores..&lt;br /&gt;Take your time with it and it will treat you right.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try an old-school safety razor and this one looked decent compared to some of the cheap ones without spending a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Well made and works much better than I thought it would.  Blades are crazy cheap compared to cartridges and have the ability buy stainless that is much better than disposable razors that degrade fast.&lt;br /&gt;I doubt Rick Harrison really uses this, but it is all I use now.</li>
            <li> I used it twice and put it in the closet to rot (rust?). It seems to be poorly crafted. Cut myself badly. It certainly doesn&#x27;t qualify as a \\&quot;safety razor.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible! Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> I bought one about 6 months ago and I dropped it on the ground. Now it will not turn to get he blade out (If it broke from one drop on the ground it goes to show how poorly and cheap they are). Contacted them to get it repaired and they said it is out of warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another flaw is when the blade goes dull and you shave with it you will cut your skin real bad. At least with the standard razor you wont cut your skin as bad when they go dull.</li>
            <li> I have an extremely tough beard on my face where I have 3 to 9 hairs coming from one hair follicle, and a wimpy, wimpy one on my neck. My favorite way to shave was the Adjustable Injector with a six pack of blades ran almost a $1 per blade that gave me about 3 to 4 shaves per blade if I showered first, no matter how long my beard was. But they have been replaced by these lame multibladed ingrown hair creators, some running $5+ per blade, and I get maybe 2 lousy, skin irritated and nicked shaves from them and can&#x27;t have more than a 2 day growth. They used to have an adjustable version of this style of razor but this will do and there in lies the reason for the 4 star rating. I saw this advertised on the guy on the packaging pawn show when in Vetrans IICU and had to have it. Once discharged I couldn&#x27;t find the show much less the razor anywhere. I thought I would do a search for razors with my buddies at Amazon and dang if they didn&#x27;t have it. I got it I love it. When I saw it I quit using the laborious Norelco electric razor I just got replacement heads for from Amazon and ordered it and wanted the first shave to be a growth, it was only five days but another three days it would have been a beard to trim. It was awsome using a real razor again, one time over and I had a babys butt finish, nothing cut below the skin to create ingrown hairs, and no nicks. This is a great shaver as the double edge versions go but if they bring back the Adjustable Injector Razor I&#x27;m there. Thank you Microtouch, Thank you so very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RickS</li>
            <li> Jokes on me! This is one of the few things I liked the commercials for and thought it would be better than my previous razor. I WAS WRONG! I kept using this for 2 weeks, to see if my face would &amp;#34;get used to it&amp;#34; like others have mentioned. No. Just, no. The blades are not good at their only job, my shaving gel is gone and my face is dry before I can even get one side of my face.&lt;br /&gt;The blades may be cheaper, but they also dull WAY faster than any other razor blade I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to give myself better shaves with a straight razor in the first few tries.....</li>
            <li> Son and Husband loves it!</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be the end all of end all of razors. guess what? it&#x27;s just a razor. Not a super duper shave, in fact I prefer the shave of a triple blade Schick. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m using now. It&#x27;s not a bad shave, just not as good as the disposable ones.</li>
            <li> This is a decent product. Its old school and like all razors of this type, it requires patience, practice, and proper technique. Definitely not for speed shaving! I would recommend a good quality shaving soap. The handle is quite short and could be longer. I was not too impressed with the blades that came with it. All in all, a decent product. Definitely more economical than cartridge razors, and a better shave I my opinion.</li>
            <li> Great Shave. If you loosen the blade a bit with the adjustment knob on the bottom of the handle, you can change the shave a bit. I keep it pretty tight, though.</li>
            <li> I forgot what it was like to shave with a single blade.  It&#x27;s awful, keep having to go over same spots in order to get a clean shave.  This is one area where progress wins hands down.</li>
            <li> Works well but just doesn&#x27;t have the weight and build quality of my other safety razors but it is an excellent choice for my shaving kit when traveling, I don&#x27;t mind loosing a $20 razor as much as I would once costing 5-6 times as much.  If your new to wet shaving this might be a good choice to see if you like it then spend some money on a nicer one for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It works great per my husband and he has always had a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> When I was kid and tought how to shave it was with a safety razor I never had any problems&lt;br /&gt;with razor burn or razor bumps than as the years went on times changed and so did the razors and went to the deposible razor and shortly after you could not  find the replasement razors for my safety razor so on the shelf it sat till my wife put in the trash after years of bs with the crapy over priced razors I seen the add on TV so I went to my local CVS and got one went home and gave it a try well I have the best shave of my life once agine the wife was so amazed how well it work and easy to clean she got one for her self and now use nothing but this completely beautiful made razor if I ever was forced to use a 5 blade razor agine it would be the worst fight of my life do your self a huge favor to your self and your walet and get one !! If not piss your money away and deal with the razor burns and bumps and think of all the skin and nasty hair that is trapped in them 5 blade razors absulotly disgusting and use it that way all week think about it its a win win for you guys and women</li>
            <li> OK, My review will be similar to another that I read before buying this... But I also used Gillette sensor and then the Mack III..... after realizing (cause the wife usually buys them) that the razors where 30 FRKN dollars! And the interest in this razor from the commercials, I decided it was time to make the purchase. (no brainer) ....... Any who, I have sensitive skin on my neck, and I am skinny so adams apple and a scare on my chin usually get the brunt of the job. .... But, I am glad to say this is a excellent razor! I was pretty skeptic, but now I am sitting at my computer after shaving and I haven&#x27;t even put my pants on yet. That is how happy I am. It&#x27;s hard to find good options for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I should add, that the wife used my last Mach III razor and I went 9 days without shaving. I did trim it with a beard trimmer before hand, but no razor touched my face for 9 days. And I just shaved it without nicks, or cuts. It is 2 sided and I used both. I also was nervous at first, but by the time I finished the first side, I was fairly comfortable using it and shaved a little faster on the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;......... I&#x27;m gonna go put my pants on now!!</li>
            <li> Nice Razor.  Very Sharp</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Is as describes 5/5</li>
            <li> yes it has worked very well and still using my first blade I use it 4 times weekly glade I bought one</li>
            <li> Awful shave. Used like it said to and could not get a clean, smooth shave. Not worth a penny if you can&#x27;t get a good shave.</li>
            <li> First, I would like to thank John Harrison. If he hadn’t introduced this razor on TV, I would be still using my Mach 3 razor. I watch my father shave with type of razor for most his of life. Now I know the reason for this, it works great. I am 57 years old and now for the first time in my life, I enjoy shaving. The razor has a good feel and weight to it. My wife told me this morning she really is please with results; my face is no longer red and irritated and incredibility smooth. After 36 years of marriage to this wonderful woman this statement was a first for her.  I would recommend this product to any person who shaves and the blades from Droco work great and are inexpensive. I just bought Dorco st301 Stainless Steel Razor Blades, 100-Count Dispenser Pack for $7.52.  The stand is a simple but elegant design and works great. The razor is simple to use and clean plus it will not slip in your hand while shaving.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend absolutely loved it</li>
            <li> Very good, thank you!</li>
            <li> wt not there. have to shave over &amp; over and can still feel stubbles. the old Gellate had a lot more feel in your hand, but would cut you.</li>
            <li> I loved the razor at first.  After using it for a couple of months it siezed up and wouldn&#x27;t open anymore to replace the razors.  I will be looking at merker for the higher quality and probably one that doesn&#x27;t twist open.</li>
            <li> I love the Safety Razor, but the &#x27;supplied with it&#x27; razor blades - not so much.  After repeatedly nicking myself with the &#x27;supplied with it&#x27; razor blades, I went and bought a supply of Wilkinson Sword razor blades over the Net,  and nary a scratch since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  James McReavey</li>
            <li> I guess somewhere along the way I became spoiled by the razors with long handles and disposible heads.  I was all for this idea but I have stubby hands and this handle is too short to shave without fear of slicing myself if it slips out of my hand.  Also, cannot control it as well due to the handle.  Would be better for men is the handle was 1 to 1 1/2 inches longer.</li>
            <li> This product did not live up to its advertised claims.  It is a razor, it came with extra blades and it is packaged well ;  but it does not produce the close quality shave that I was led to expect.</li>
            <li> So I decided to make the switch to a safety razor and ordered this razor based on reviews I read.  While I waited for the razor to arrive, I did my research by watching different videos on YouTube and going to my local Art of Shaving store and talking to the guys there.  My biggest tip to anyone thinking of making the switch is do your research!!  Shaving with a safety razor is much different than shaving with a modern-day razor.  You will also want to ditch canned shaving creams.  If you are going to make the switch do it all the way and get some shaving lather or soap and a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I recommend this razor to anyone looking to make the switch, super smooth shave but with a little bit of a learning curve.</li>
            <li> I was tired of spending $30 to $40 for modern razor blades, so I went retro with this product. The razor itself is well built and a real blast from the past. The blades that come with it are not high quality, but I just bought a package of new blades for five bucks and it works fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor at the CVS Pharmacy for $19.99. It comes with a one year supply of razor blades, the handle, and a razor holder which I don&#x27;t need and don&#x27;t use. Still, I&#x27;d buy it again. For the last month, using the same blade, I&#x27;ve had the closest shaves I&#x27;ve had in my life, I&#x27;m 51. You&#x27;ll need to get familiar using the shorter handle and let the weight of the razor do the work. I recommend that you do not shave with this razor if you are in a hurry to get to work or you&#x27;ll butcher your face. This is a pain free, close shave but, be ready for the after shave splash that will burn your face raw. I&#x27;ll no longer need to pay through the nose for blades that don&#x27;t cut the mustard or, should I say spinach.</li>
            <li> This razor was a huge fail for me and my step dad. It will only cut if I go against the hair grain and press really hard and even then it did a bad job. It doesn&#x27;t even cut going with the grain. I had to use my Axe triple blade razor just to finish the job. Also, after my step dad used the blades 2 times it rusted. The handle is not long enough too. I have an old style straight razor that does a better job than this. This razor doesn&#x27;t even deserve a 1 star.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor (not on Amazon) with the extra blades, etc. special deal. I have, like many guys out there, become feed up with the price of razor blades ($30 or more for 5 cartridges? - Really!) that give smooth shaves but wear out quickly, and are getting way too pricey. So, I thought, why not give the classic safety razor like my dad used to use, a shot. Here&#x27;s my impressions and thoughts concerning this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I like the shave. I was concerned that I might end up cutting my self up, but really, it hasn&#x27;t happened at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the kit came with 24 blades and a case, which this particular package being sold on Amazon doesn&#x27;t have, but this one here does come with a nice stand, which is something I didn&#x27;t think about - a nice extra I would have liked to let the razor air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, the blades cut nicely, individually wrapped in paper, and packed in little cardboard boxes, so reasonable, environmentally speaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, the razor grip is good, and the handle mechanism twists open nicely for cleaning and replacing blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifth, the only drawback for me is the handle length. I used to much longer handles. When I say short handle I mean at least 2&amp;#34; shorter. I have used mostly Gillette, Attra, etc.most of my life and they average 5.5&amp;#34; to 6+&#x27;&#x27; overall. This razors overall length is only 3.5&amp;#34; long. So, if you have smallish hands or, if you travel a lot, this razor will work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions: I like the old school shave. Works just fine. But, I think I will upgrade eventually to a longer handled razor.&lt;br /&gt;For the money, not a bad deal, and I&#x27;d recommend it to most guys, except if you have big, thick hands or stubby fingers - could get tricky!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wast your money on this razor! It is not worth the money and I even purchased the better blades and it still sucks.</li>
            <li> Have a little patience with this razor.  Take your time while shave.  Do a little bit at a time, small sections.  Instead of making a swipe and rinsing the razor, flip it over and shave another portion and then rinse.  Don&#x27;t get into a hurry with this.  I used to always get ingrown hairs and razor bumps and now since i&#x27;ve started using this shaving method my skin on my face is much better.  If you really want to be kind to your face and if you are finished with razor bumps and ingrown hairs then try this razor, you&#x27;ll have the desired shave and the smooth skin you want.  If you get bumps on your neck it&#x27;s because of a shaved hair getting caught under the skin because you&#x27;re shaving more than hair off.  Try this razor to recondition your skin to get rid of these conditions.</li>
            <li> Works great and saves you money on blades</li>
            <li> What a relief.  My husband loves the way this shaves and he didn&#x27;t cut his jugular!  It was an irrational fear we both had.  Clean shave and we&#x27;re looking forward to saving money on replacement blades.  Fast delivery to boot!</li>
            <li> Great shave better than the leading multi-blade razors at a fraction go the price.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment... took a few days to get the technique down- and to learn not to over tighten the blade (controls angle to frame)... closest shave I&#x27;ve had in a while and much cheaper in comparison to the previous set up I was using.</li>
            <li> bought this at walmart a couple weeks ago, have shaved with it everyday sometimes a couple times a day when I first got it, (new shiny toy and all) , not a single cut (hope I&#x27;m not jenksing myself here) the only way to cute yourself is to either not have the butterfly closed all the way, or slide it from side to side, if you pull straight down it will never cut you, I often cut myself with the multi blade disposable razers.  I wish it was a little longer, but it works great, it is also a much faster and enjoyable shave,  minute to lather up the shave soap and apply, then the shave itself only takes about 20 to 30 seconds, rinse, wipe, Alum, after shave, and done, but even though its faster, its more relaxing, no more fighting trying to get the hair to rinse out from between the multi blades, no more shave cream all over my hands, this method is a lot cleaner, plus using the brush on your face just feels good.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This razor is a good gift idea and is a well put together complete kit. However I did not like how small it was. The handle was a little too short to give you really good stability and angle control during shaving. The whisker comb part of the head could use more definition, not just a few low grooves. All in all, not a bad deal for around $20!</li>
            <li> IF you know how to use a safety razor then you should be fine. If not I recommend checking out Mantic59 on Youtube, that&#x27;s how I learned. It&#x27;s going to take a few passes to get that baby smooth feeling but it&#x27;s totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is all metal and weighty but feels like a cheap mass produced item from China (which it is) but expectable at this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with Dorco doubled edged blades included. (Dorco is a South Korean brand that manufactures the products that Dollar Shave Club sells.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is rather short and takes some getting used to. It also comes with a flimsy cheap metal stand that looks like it was welded together as a last minute add-on. It will not hold the product very well unless you leave it on at a certain angle and pray that nothing makes any slight vibration your way.</li>
            <li> Used this for one month, noticed that it was getting harder and harder to change the blade. Then one day, it simply would not open.&lt;br /&gt;tried and tried to open it. Finally, got a pliers and thought I was careful in trying to open it. The entire thing broke. Worked fine for one month. Metal was cheap.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting a real safety razor for awhile now because I have a curly beard and suffer from ingrown hairs and have tried some expensive razors along with your choosing of creams and after shaves. I just found out I have major allerigies to gluten and corn and its prob why my skin is so sensitive to the &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; razors. So I did some research and found that if I bought a aloe plant and cut the leaves, use it as my shaving cream and buy a good safety razor I prob wont break out, let alone get any cuts or irritation! And even if I did cut myself ...the aloe would take effect. The razor is not as scary as it looks. With a good amount of aloe it slided beautifully. I never even cut myself on the first try. Its a god send! No bumps or anything...to tell you the truth I didnt feel it tug on my hair either. So guys if you have a thick curly spanish beard and got sensitive skin. Try it how I did it....after you shave put cold h20 on your face and a bit of aloe again to replace for aftershave. GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> The one I bought was very poorly made.  Shortly after I bought the razor it got where it would barely open.  The design was very poor and I wasn&#x27;t able to get a very good shave with it.  Within 7 months it was no longer usable.  I replaced it with a Merkur which didn&#x27;t cost that much more and it is much heavier built and works a lot better.</li>
            <li> A very nice product. It was a little heavier than I thought it would be, but I&#x27;ve been using plastic disposables for years and didn&#x27;t have a point of reference. It&#x27;s easy to use and has no &#x27;down side&#x27; that comes to mind.</li>
            <li> Great razor - my husband loves it so much better than the multi blade razors that cost a small forture to buy blades for it.</li>
            <li> This is a good double edge razor. It gives a smooth shave. I didn&#x27;t give it a fifth star because it is not as well made as the old Gillette double edge razors. Unfortunately Gillette and Schick no longer make real razors, having chosen to go the &amp;#34;excess blade&amp;#34; route.</li>
            <li> I got this because I pitched a fit last time I had to buy modern razor blades. The razor is nice and solid. I can shave myself O.K.. The blades are 50 for $6. I don&#x27;t know how long the new blades last but I won&#x27;t be saying bad words every time I change one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about 2 weeks now.  It reminds me of my Grandfather&#x27;s razor. (That&#x27;s good!)  Really, the only thing I would say is different is the top rattles when opened/loose.  The weight is very much the same and overall quality is what you would get for $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who would like to start shaving with a real device, but, unsure it they really want to leave the realm of expensive multi-blade disposables.  Believe me, it does not take much getting used to and the shave is much closer and smooth.</li>
            <li> My husband had said to me a while ago that he really wanted a razor like this, I came to Amazon and found one :)&lt;br /&gt;I will give it to him for his Birthday next month! :)</li>
            <li> Since I am of the proper age to have used both the original Gillette double edged razor and am able to compare the old to the new, I really feel no difference between the two.  Both are slightly rough compared to todays multi  blade razors but make up the difference in the ultimate cost incurred for the shave.  The new stainless steel blades are great and should last longer than the old so, I would give the new razor a 5 out of 10 overall.</li>
            <li> Shave just as close as the 5 blade $3.00 each blades!  I got several Wlkinson Sword Blades (made by Gikkette) for pennies a blade, so even if I use 1 per shave which I don&#x27;t, it is BIG savings!!!!</li>
            <li> It works but those five blade razors give a cleaner shave.</li>
            <li> Blast from the past - but better.  I learned to shave with a safety razor back in the early 70s and switched over to the old Trac II because it shaved a little closer. However, the blades did cost more.  If I had only known that someday I would pay $2 (or more) for a cartridge, I would never have left the safety razor.  This razor shaves better than the old safety razor and the blades cost $0.10 each.  Great shave, great price, and the Gillette can no longer stick it to me with overpriced cartridges. What&#x27;s not to like?  Not one danged thing.  You will love this razor.</li>
            <li> Item not as nice as I had hoped. Fells cheap!</li>
            <li> works well, takes some practice if you are accustom to modern razors</li>
            <li> Horrible. Does not shave close.  Should have known from the cheap paper razors they send it with.</li>
            <li> My first safety razor, i love it.</li>
            <li> Shaver functions smoothly. Quality of shave is good. Blade is much easier to clean and dry than for modern multiblade shavers. Device is heavier than I am used to, but I will easily adapt.</li>
            <li> Handle is too short, you cannot get a real feel.</li>
            <li> this is a great razor for anyone!  it&#x27;s marketed toward men, but i am a woman and i love this razor!</li>
            <li> REALLY EASY TO USE AND MAINTAIN. THE CLOSEST SHAVE I EVER HAD. I LOVE MINE. GREAT BUY!!</li>
            <li> Razor is exactly as described. The handle is very durable and the razors provide a good close shave. You must be careful if you have never used this type of razor. Too much pressure and you will cut yourself.</li>
            <li> Could have given the 20 dollars to a stranger. Bought a local grocery store brand of razors and got a better shave and didn&#x27;t have to use a ton of shaving lotion and after shave to cool my burning skin. Don&#x27;t believe the middle-aged bald man in the commercial. He is right though; all he wants is your money. There is a reason why it comes with several blades, you will need them all...</li>
            <li> Great razor easy to clean</li>
            <li> Fairly good razor, inexpensive to use as replacement blades are a fraction of what you pay for those 3 or 4 bladed razors at walmart. I&#x27;m sure if I stepped up to the $40 price range for a butterfly razor I could get a closer shave but than again, This is my first few weeks in using this type of razor so maybe I don&#x27;t quite have the technique down. This will do for now as the price is perfect.</li>
            <li> I have been a DE razor user for quite a few years. I bought the Microtouch One to add to my collection. This is an OK entry level razor, but it has some good and some bad points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good: It&#x27;s inexpensive and will get you into the DE shaving experience with minimal outlay. It gives a very mild shave and even a beginner is not likely to have problems if he takes his time and uses light pressure. You&#x27;ll save a ton of money compared to Mach 3 and other multi-blade razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: It gives a VERY mild shave and you will not experience the type of closeness that a more aggressive DE razor can deliver. It may be acceptable to some men, but others will not be satisfied with the closeness of the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this is a decent entry level DE razor, I would not recommend it for an experienced DE shaver.</li>
            <li> My husband loves using it</li>
            <li> it does not give a close shave.</li>
            <li> Razor handle is too short for comfortable everyday use. I have gone back to my 5 blade razor, I have gone through 4 blades already, and the shave is not close enough for me.</li>
            <li> this razor is awesome very useful and it ,very easy to use,,,,give a great shave and i am very pleased with it..,,worth the buy..it came with extra blades which is so nice for this package,,and ,,i am very happy with what i got and how fast it arrived here to me,,very pleased..</li>
            <li> Very sharp, needs longer handle</li>
            <li> Good unit Classic look!!!</li>
            <li> Its ok but i just cant get use to it</li>
            <li> Crap, junk dont waist your money. Mine was bent right at the safty bar. Dont you need that to be straight? The butterfly door&#x27;s dont meet or alaign correctly. Cheap cheap cheap. Viet Nam Dorco&#x27;s wouldnt even scrape gum off my shoe&#x27;s with this</li>
            <li> Caution. The blades don&#x27;t come in a safety dispenser. Certainly a disposal problem. Other than that the razor works okay. Remains to be seen how long it lasts. I bought two on eBay for six bucks each figuring quantity over quality.</li>
            <li> This is great but I don&#x27;t know how to use!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything I expected. Thanks</li>
            <li> Should have read the poor reviews.  It simply is no match for the Mach3. No where near as close a shave.</li>
            <li> it take me back to my first shave</li>
            <li> I thought it was a great idea but it takes me twice as long to get a close shave like I am used to. I truly wanted it to be a great product but it wasn&#x27;t to me.</li>
            <li> Great razor.  No more buying those ultra expensive 5 bladed refills.</li>
            <li> Terrible product!  It&#x27;s like shaving with a field knife.  I can&#x27;t recall the last time I cut myself shaving, but I was bleeding like a stuffed pig after using this product.  I won&#x27;t ever use it again</li>
            <li> This razor is a great one for the price. It took some getting used too with the short handle, but it works. I won&#x27;t shave with anything other than the Micro Touch now because the blades for it are dirt cheap. You can get a pack of 100 Derby Extra blades on Amazon for about $10. Since this is my first DE safety razor it took a little bit of experimenting to keep from cutting myself repeatedly.   You will notice on this razor that there are 2 sides with different levels of blade exposure. I kept using the side with the wider gap (more blade exposure) and was cutting myself nearly every time I shaved!!!! Big mistake... You only want to use that side if you have more facial hair to cut down. It is not for the finishing strokes. Since I have switched over to the side with less blade exposure my skin gets a lot less irritated and I have not cut myself once. I usually shave in the bathtub which helps to prevent irritation and cuts since the blade is in constant contact with hot water and soap. It is a great way too. Just keep your face covered in hot water and soap with every pass and you will be fine. Highly recommended buy if you want to save money.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a mind blowing experience to avoid buying cartridges. Did not happen. I would recommend it for a one day but not for more than two days.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to return to wet shaving with a safety razor. I chose this one as a as an affordable option. The razor arrived quickly and is well made. As some others have mentioned the handle is a little short but that is not a serious problem. Beware, using one of these is not like using a disposable razor. This takes practice to use well, but once you get the hang of it, you will get an incredibly close shave.</li>
            <li> I have been a very satisfied DE blade shaver for the past 4 plus years using some well regarded equipment (Mergress and Fat Boy razors, quality badger brush, etc.). I was curious about the Micro touch one razor and have now shaved with it 5 times. It has succeeded beyond my wildest imagination and is a distinct value at its price point. Those new to this kind of shaving should be patient - it does take time to become comfortable with a &amp;#34;no pressure&amp;#34; grip on the razor. Whether you approach &amp;#34;DE&amp;#34; shaving to save money, or become a true devotee that spends many times the cost of the Micro Touch a year, it can and does (for me) bring many moments of enjoyment. It is much gentler on the skin (my reason for adopting the method in the first place) and slows life down just a bit in a nice way....</li>
            <li> Just used it for the first time - I have a heavy beard and was apprehensive about using a single blade, plus I cut my hand to shreds on one of these back in 1977 when I was 4 - wasn&#x27;t impressed after the first couple passes but I have to say by the time I was done I had as a close shave as if I&#x27;d used the 5 bladed disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No cuts, no scrapes, and my wife approves of the closeness.</li>
            <li> doesnt shave very well cuts you more than shaves wasted 20 dollars never again will i purchase anything of this matter...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good razor, have not used one of these since I was 16. Tired of plastic razors and my electric razor is pretty lame. Micro touch gives a real close shave and I get a little better at it each time I use it. Worth the money if it holds up over time.</li>
            <li> This is a great value for a safety razor. I have been using mine for hundreds of shaves, and I rarely if ever get cut. The trick is to let the weight of the razor do the work. SLOW DOWN, don&#x27;t come at your face with the edge of the razor and hack like you do with the Mach 3, instead, press the rounded top of the razor to your skin, then slowly tilt downward and use slow long smooth strokes. Again, this razor is sharp and will do a great job, but slow down and no hacking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you shave after a hot shower to soften your whiskers, Use pre shave oil, then a badger hair brush, some Cremo shave cream, and enjoy a real shave. If your one to rush through your morning, this might not be the best razor for you, but if you can slow down and allow yourself some man time in the morning, this razor will give you an amazing shave. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great razor to start out with. You will save money and you will like the razor. The next time I&#x27;m at pawn starts shop in Vegas I&#x27;m going to tell Rick Harrison he owes me a few Band-Aids.  Fallow the instructions or you could be in line right behind me...lol</li>
            <li> Had to shave the same spot over and over to get my skin smooth my 3 blade disposables work better</li>
            <li> got this at a great price, lower than tv. pleased with it all-around for the cost</li>
            <li> Husband loves it.  Hated expensive, dull triple and double edge razors, both non-disposable and disposable.  Has been using the same blade since he got it and it is still sharp.  Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I think this was the best idea to come back into marketing the old fashion razor is one of the best and most economical razors out there from the best shave to the easiest to clean.</li>
            <li> This is cuts a little better than  the double and triple blade razors that I have always used, and it is much cheaper too,</li>
            <li> The product is amazzzzing by far the best cleanest shave I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Just have to get used to it, it&#x27;s heavier than a more modern style and if you run low on shaving cream it&#x27;s a sketchy feeling but it does a slightly better job than a more traditional multi blade for less money. Use it for a few days and it&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> razor works like a charm, great</li>
            <li> Hay, guys, buy this for a great shave &amp; yes only 1 blade. That&#x27;s all you need, I rest my case.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these -- one for my husband and one for my son.  Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time. Both say it&#x27;s the best shave ever.  So happy this type of razor is available again. I won&#x27;t be buying any more of those overprices expensive Gillette Fusion razor cartridges ever again!!  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money flimsy pos broke and wasnt using it hard.save your money look for a old one at a swap meet you will get better item</li>
            <li> After using the newer razors, found that this one is VERY difficult to use. Switched back to my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; multi-bladed razor.  Not worth the money or my time that it took to use.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor.  I would definitely buy again,  great product!</li>
            <li> absolutely love the product.  Would highly recommend it.  The husband is  getting  a better shave than he has in a very long time. And the money we will be saving is a blessing. Try it. You will love it.</li>
            <li> Just not a good close shave.</li>
            <li> congrats, microtouch! Aside from the mediocrity of the build (being made in china aside, this razor is lighter than most others) this razor reeks of comprimise. The stand is sadly the best part of the eintire kit. The blades are are a close second. The very bottom of the razor handle is flimsy and seems like it was placed loosly on the bottom. I used it today about an hour ago, and I did like the shave, but the way it feels is not satisfiying to me. If you want a light and semi-decent razor then this is the one. Like others have written, spend the extra $10-$15 and buy something with crafted pride behind it, like a merkur or an Edwin. Even Parkers are better than this. Also, keep in mind, this is &amp;#34;as seen on tv&amp;#34;. Meaning, half of the cost is from the marketing, a quarter is profit, and a quarter of the cost covers the initial shipping costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, garbage. I am returning this tomorrow. I bought it at a Rite Aid. No f**king thank you, Microtouch!</li>
            <li> This thing replaced my schick quattro and my pro glide... definitely a lot easier to clean, and gives a close close shave... my girl wants one now for her legs lol.</li>
            <li> Had one many years ago, did not know that they were still around. It was good then and just as good now. Vary happy.</li>
            <li> Product arrived at the expected time and is providing service to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Great razor recommend it to anyone !</li>
            <li> Was exactly as advertised. Had a problem with the initial order,but I was promptly notified of the problem and it was solved to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m into nostalgia as much as the next person so it was on that point that I made the purchase of this single blade razor.  What a waste of time and money!  The best thing to come from the purchase is the little stand that comes in handy to use with my 6 blade razor, keeping it high and dry off the counter which is very important.  More on that point in a moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The One Razor is bulky, smallish in size and almost impossible to shave yourself without knicking the skin and causing the blood to flow.  It&#x27;s a distant reminder of how bad razors were back in the 60s and before.  Back to the high and dry comment.  You CAN use a multiple blade razor for MONTHS, the same blade, if you keep it dry after each use.  I use a towel to wipe the moisture off, then take a hair dryer to finish off the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the use of a blade that makes it dull, it&#x27;s the moisture that is allowed to remain on it after its use.  It sounds surreal but before you judge, try it yourself,  keep your multiple blade razor, and forget buying this neanderthal single blade unit.</li>
            <li> Everything is wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Not quite as good as the Gillette Proglide, but value wise, it does a pretty good job of getting a close smooth shave at a much more affordable cost. (FYI, I am a girl who uses this to shave my legs etc, not my face.) I didn&#x27;t find it hard to figure out how to hold the razor properly at all, but if you are at all worried about it, I&#x27;d suggest looking online for a you tube video or something first. To me it was just common sense and physics, and I didn&#x27;t have a single nick or cut.</li>
            <li> The dorco blades suck but I kinda like the razor. Especially with shark blades, they&#x27;re cheap gorgeous blades.</li>
            <li> My husband LOVES this razor! He uses it everyday!</li>
            <li> Would not open after three weeks of use.  If you cannot open it, you cannot change the blade.  So, it lasted much less time than a disposable razor, and I now have 24 razor blades with no razor to put them in.  STAY FAR AWAY.  I should have known better than to trust something a cheezy Pawn Shop guy claims.</li>
            <li> Excellent smooth shave</li>
            <li> There is a reason the micro touch razor is cheap. It is VERY cheaply built. Forget about those 10 blades you get. I was only able to use one before the razor failed. I had to use pliars after only a few shaves to twist open the blade holder. The Gillette, Fusion I have been using is TOO expensive in my opinion, but it is MUCH better than the micro touch one blade.</li>
            <li> Nearly cut my dick off while shaving pubes.</li>
            <li> JUST LIKE WHEN I STARTED SHAVING!!!!  GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> Another reviewer called it: this is a &amp;#34;scraper&amp;#34;. Lost of razor burn, painful to use. However, this got me interested in DE shaving, and I ended up getting a Edwin Jagger DE89bl&#x3D;much more precise. No razor burn and glides smooth with a close shave.</li>
            <li> A very smart add but once I got the razor, I was unable to shave every day without bleeding from several nicks. I stopped using it after ten days!! Anton, WI</li>
            <li> I have been using double edge razors since the 50&#x27;s, and the best one is the adjustable double edge razor. I have a Gillette double edge razor, and over the years, i&#x27;ve had to adjust it to my conditions as they will change. The non adjustable razors have one setting, and that is it. there are several different brands of razors that are adjustable, but i still have my old Gillette, and use the Gillette blue blades. I get a great, clean shave from this system. I would not reccomend the Microtouch One Razor Classic Safty Razor to anyone. It was a bad investment.  Rod.</li>
            <li> This delivers as promised.  Actually the shave is smoother than more expensive triple blade razors.  Definitely much easier to clean.</li>
            <li> Spend $5-10 and get a quality double edge safety razor.  It&#x27;s not too bad but you&#x27;ll want to upgrade really quick. Safety razors are the best shave possible.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get as close of a shave as I do with the pivoting multiple blade razors.</li>
            <li> Ok Shaver, takes some getting use to, Lather up heavy.</li>
            <li> Junk at best do not waste your money. Poorly manufactured. Thanks for nothing Rick</li>
            <li> I just bought this today at WalMart. I was there to buy some cleaning supplies, toiletries and Mach 4 blades. I couldn&#x27;t believe the price for ten Mach 4 cartridges -$26.00 !!! So I went hunting for alternatives. Disposable razors have never worked well for me. I have extremely coarse facial hair and unless I can rinse through the cartridge they get clogged easily and shave more like duct tape than a razor. To top that off I have extremely sensitive skin and am prone to bumps and irritation. I had considered a straight razor and a safety razor for some time and done my research. Obviously the higher end cut throats and safety razors can be quite expensive so I was intrigued when I saw the Microtouch advertized on television. After hunting through the aisle with shaving supplies I eventually gave up and grabbed this thing by the checkout stand. My initial impression was one of skepticism. The razor seems well made, with the construction seeming quite adequate. Installing the first blade was easier than I thought. I had three days of stubble so this was a perfect torture test for this thing. I lathered, took a deep breath, and armed only with the instructions went to town on my face. Impressive is the only word I can use to describe the performance of this entry-level, budget razor once I found the right angle of attack for the blade. It glided nicely through my tough whiskers with no pressure required. A rinse between strokes kept the razor clean and with a little skin stretching and pulling by my fingers I was able to get an awfully close shave. My neck became slightly irritated, however. I re-lathered and gave my neck a second pass as the opposing grain on my nape has always been difficult to get on one pass with any razor. I&#x27;m thinking my skin simply needs to get used to the new razor, then it will calm down. A little after shave balm soothed the minor irritation and I regarded the initial experience as a success. Overall I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the acquisition of this item and I&#x27;d definitely buy it again.of this item and I&#x27;d definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> So I got one of these for my 38th birthday recently and used it once or twice and I&#x27;d have to admit it gave me a good shave that I was looking for how ever I went to wal-mart to try and find blades for it when that time comes and couldn&#x27;t find any there.</li>
            <li> Actually better than expected. Sure, its not a $35 EJ or a $40 Merkur. But, its actually not bad comparatively, at that price point. I even purchased it at Amazon for slightly less than MSRP. Actually shaves better than any of my other $10-$20 razors. The weight and mechanics of this feel better than expected. If I was traveling, and left my Merkur behind, I would go to wally world and buy one of these again as a substitute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest getting better blades; my preference is Feather or Merkur. However, the included Dorcos may not have the best rep, but i used them and received a decent shave. Way better shave than the Lords, Concords, Astras, and Sharks I&#x27;ve tried. If the only option I had was to not shave, or shave with these, I would be happy to shave with these. Keep them in the back of your drawer in-case you run out of your favorite blades.</li>
            <li> compact double edge razor ........... nice shave ......... no nicks with my Wilkinson Sword blades .</li>
            <li> To everyone&#x27;s post that reads &amp;#34;this will cut your face&amp;#34; I used this style shaver for the first time today and after properly prepping my face with hot water and a lather cream this razor glided effortlessly over my face and gave me a barber shop shave. No nics/cuts no irritating skin. Nothing. For $20 at a department store this beats the price of the pricier mall version with the same results. For $20 you can&#x27;t beat it!!</li>
            <li> For quite some time now, I&#x27;ve been fed up with the cost of name brand &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; razors like the Gillette Fusions.  It always amazed me how expensive they were compared to how long they lasted (not very).  I would notice a decline in shave quality by 5-6 shaves, typically...however, wanting to stretch my dollar as far as possible, I would refuse to change the blade until I had used it about double that amount, and the razor was to the point I couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore.  This created an endless cycle of harsh, unsatisfying shaves, and so my search began for a better way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Dorco&#x27;s equivalent razor, not bad at all considering how much cheaper it was, but I still wasn&#x27;t totally satisfied for the same reasons I was unsatisfied with Fusions.  I was about to try a second discount brand of multi-blade cartridges, but in my quest of finding a better, more cost effective way to shave, I learned about the old school method of using a double-edge safety razor.  Almost everything I read about it told me the same thing, that once people made the switch, almost everyone found it a much better, more comfortable way to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom, being the kind hearted person she is, ordered this razor for me after I mentioned wanting to try it.  I also picked up an inexpensive Tweezerman shaving brush, and some old fashioned shaving cream in a tub.  So my journey towards a better shaving experience began.  It didn&#x27;t take long, as I was a convert after the first couple of shaves.  The razor itself is very comfortable to hold, easy to load blades into, and in general is very forgiving if you&#x27;re new to DE shaving, as I was.  There is definitely a learning curve, and the first few shaves are typically not the best, however the real payoff comes from sticking with it and taking the extra time needed to learn proper technique and blade angle when shaving.  Once you have that down, you&#x27;ll be rewarded with a great, comfortable shave.  If you get this, I highly recommend you go for the full &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; shaving setup with a shaving brush and traditional shaving cream or soap in order to get the most out of this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I only gave it 4 stars, ironically, is the same reason why it&#x27;s great for beginners.  This razor has a very small blade exposure, and while it makes it a forgiving razor, it&#x27;s a little too mild for my beard.  I have thick, course facial hair and I have to often go over the same spot multiple times to get the level of closeness I want (I usually do the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; 3-pass method, and then touch-ups).  I can usually get baby smooth on my cheeks, but the neck area still leaves something to be desired.  Again, this is just a matter of how the razor pairs with my beard; it might be perfect for someone with lighter hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very satisfied with this razor and would recommend it to anyone looking for a better shave experience.  I do plan to eventually upgrade to a more aggressive safety razor, but I feel this was an excellent starting point while I learned the new techniques.  Don&#x27;t be alarmed by the initial investment cost (razor, brush, cream), as this will actually save money in the long run since traditional shaving cream lasts for ages (a fingernail-sized amount will make enough lather for a full shave) and the replacement DE blades typically cost 1/10 or less than a multi-blade cartridge.  Your face will definitely thank you.</li>
            <li> hubby loves it ,will be saving a lot of money on this.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the quality for the price. This is my first safety razor and I think I made the right choice for my first one.</li>
            <li> The razor dulls very quickly and it is not a very close shave.  Also the handle is very short and awkward to use.  I am very disappointed I spent the money on it.</li>
            <li> alright Rick Harrison you got me. After the constant barrage of advertisements I decided to give it a try.at $20 it was a cheap investment and the results showed just that. Does not give me a close shave regardless of how I hold the razor, how much pressure I apply or going with or against the grain. Also for men that have sharp edges or prefer clean crisp lines on their beards this product will not do that</li>
            <li> Just the price I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> I guess there&#x27;s a sucker born every minute I&#x27;ve lost all respect for Rick Harrison I thought he was a standup guy but I guess he can be bought also</li>
            <li> When seeking product reviews, I always read the worst reviews first thus giving me the hypeless product lowdown.  Based on many (but not all) of the Microtouch One negative reviews, I suspect possible quality control issues at the root of some consumer dissatisfaction as will be the case with any mass produced product from abroad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  That said, I am very surprised at this razor&#x27;s quality, esthetics and ease of use.  I am in my 50s and have been using single blade style safety razors since I was 19.  Over the years I&#x27;ve used Gillette and many Gillette knockoffs as well as various style antique razors and my grandfather was a barber for about 45 years so I&#x27;ve come to appreciate all the techniques which go into a proper shave.  My main shavers are fancy (and expensive) Edwin Jagger ($45.00) and The Art of Shaving ($95.00) handles using the Merkur German blades.  So, gentle readers, I ask you this:  How in hell did this $20.00 Microtouch razor shave me as good (if not better) that the aforementioned?  Perhaps because the Microtouch is the perfect weight with the perfect length handle and perfect razor edge angling?  I&#x27;ve never heard of Dorco blades but the ones which came with my razor shave me every bit as good as the expensive Merkur blades.  I&#x27;m going out to purchase a second Microtouch as a backup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  To all of you neophytes wanting to try a manly style shave I say this:  Be patient.  As with any new, tricky endeavor, it takes practice to shave with this style razor.  Shaving is not something you want to rush.  If you are in a hurry, I suggest your favorite disposable (I use them when I must shave quickly).  This may sound weird, but I look forward to shaving because I make it a fun event.  I properly hydrate my face (hot water, towels) and use a quality shave mug and brush to whop up a proper lather.  You shouldn&#x27;t make the razor do all the work and expect good results.  You need to marry this razor with proper face hydration and a good shavingsoap.  I assure you, if you make shaving a fun event, your Microtouch will be the best investment you ever made.  My face is smooth with no nicks or cuts.  This product totally surprised me.</li>
            <li> Nice shave, I like that you can change the blades very fast so it only takes a couple of twist to open. So every couple days I can have a fresh blade that and great shave!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have liked the handle to be a bit longer, but after shaving with it 3 times It felt nice, so  I&#x27;ll stick with this type of shaving vs store purchased shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RHB</li>
            <li> Fair, but you really shouldn&#x27;t buy. I bought to use as a trial for using a safety razor. I found that a safety razors gives a great shave once you learn how to use them. After that I began my search for a higher quality razor, and I realised my mistake. You can find a very high quality German or English made razor for about $10 more here on Amazon. The quality and weight difference between this razor and the Edwin Jagger that bought is night and day. The extra money is worth it.</li>
            <li> The blades don&#x27;t last like the commercial says. One blade lasts about....on shave. Not a whole month. The blades that it comes with are Dorco&#x27;s(100 for 8 bucks) that they try to sell you for 8 for 12 blades.  Handle is nice but the blades are what make a razor.</li>
            <li> My husband was looking for a razor that would give him a  ice close shave.  He really likes this razor.  It is very sharp and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Was really hoping this would work for my husband, however he cant use as the handle is way too short and uncomfortable in his hand to use.... We passed it on to a friend &amp; he too says the handle is too short in his hand</li>
            <li> Personally I absolutely loved it the very first time using it! I have been using the Mack 3 vibrate razor for 10+ years, to me this single blade felt even smoother. I followed instructions the first time, hot shower, then thick shave cream and left on for 1-2 minutes, I thought it wasn&#x27;t working at first because I couldn&#x27;t feel a thing, and I was scruffy as hell. No nick, cut, scrape, scratch, or hack! Just bee careful</li>
            <li> Nice single blade shaver but not for me. The shaver is extremely small for my hands. So many razor cuts had my head looking a crime scene.</li>
            <li> Not a bad razor! I&#x27;ve cut myself a couple of times with it because I&#x27;m not quite use to using it yet as it&#x27;s only my 2nd time using it. I&#x27;ve been using Gillette for about 8 years but I&#x27;m tired of paying almost 20 dollars for only 5 blades per pack, ridiculous! Easy to use, simple to clean I think I made a good choice overall.</li>
            <li> I tryed it for one shave and threw it away.  The handle is too small and not a close shave at all. Take my advise and buy the more expense blades. Do not buy this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Definitely not the best shave</li>
            <li> My husband likes the razor but finds the razors handle to be a little to short for comfortable use. It does a good job for removing hair fix the handle length and it would be a really good product.</li>
            <li> Too sharp and awkward to my liking.</li>
            <li> This is a thinking mans Razor! If your and idiot, have no mechanically comprehension, or less then stellar dexterity you should use disposables. Because you&#x27;ll definetly fu€k this up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to write a review after the first shave, but to avoid comformation bias I waited two weeks and shaved seven times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll tell ya what I didn&#x27;t like first, the handle is a bit short. However, I found this to be a non issue. After experimenting with it I found I prefer to choke up on the short handle and hold it similar to how I would hold a pencil. This allowed for the greatest degree of dexterity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ignore the naysayers, the blades provided are quite sharp! And the build quality seems to be fairly solid. This type of razor requires a different style of shaving, I found some excellent tutorials on google, and when done correctly is the closest shave I have ever had!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying microtouch is the best out there, for all I know the Mekur is a superior unit. However the unit does work as advertised, it shaves close and is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Price, Quality, Performance&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Short handle</li>
            <li> My husband decided to try this because he was getting tired of the electric and then tried the hand held with multi razors. Which everyone knows is expensive to replace the heads, but also it can irritate skin. He has been using it for about two months now and it shaves just as well and there is less irritation.</li>
            <li> Finally used this today. Saves at 90% the closeness of my Fusion for 90% less cost on blades. No nicks first time out, so I&#x27;m sold on this one.</li>
            <li> Handle is too short, blades are dull - had to buy Wilkinson. Made in China. Do not recommend!</li>
            <li> Good solid razor but does not give a good shave.  It will not let the blade get close enough to the skin.  I do recommend it for beginners but not seasoned shavers.</li>
            <li> Grew up with this type of razor, first shaving with one as a 19 year-old Marine.  After I got my new one, when I first used it I had to remember to hold the business end at a 45 degree angle, since it&#x27;d been so long since I used one.  After getting a good shave with it, I was thinking about it and wondering, &amp;#34;Why did they stop selling these razors?&amp;#34;  Then I realized it comes down to anything being sold:  M-O-N-E-Y (yours that you spend and the company&#x27;s that use a huge mark-up on anything with steel in it).  A set of refills for the razors they sell at grocery stores have gotten SUPER expensive.  $22 to $50 for a set of refill blades depending on the razor and number of blades being sold is just completely ridiculous.  I get sick of going to the store and buying $100 worth of stuff that used to cost about $35 a few years ago.  So basically, this razor paid for itself almost immediately.  Although I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard, it&#x27;s heavy enough for me to look like a bum when I don&#x27;t shave daily.  I guess I could use an electric razor and set it so that it only cuts to a certain depth like a lot of younger guys do nowadays.  But personally, I hate that look!  Whenever I see someone who does that I always think, &amp;#34;Grow a beard or shave your face clean but make up your friggin&#x27; mind!&amp;#34;.  I guess they think it makes them look tough or sexy or something but to me it just it just makes them look homeless.  To each his own, I guess.  Anyway, great razor at a great price and the refills (gotta order them online) are dirt cheap compared to store-bought blades.  Outstanding seller who ships immediately without waiting for funds to clear unlike some sellers (Hello, it&#x27;s a Pay-Pal account payment so the money&#x27;s in there!!!)</li>
            <li> This razor worked OK at first, but it is cheaply made and you have to be very careful because the angle of the blade is not quite correct and it will bloody you up pretty good. It is not the well made razor I used years ago. It is a Chinese made toy. It will no longer open or close without the help of pliers and the blade will no longer seat without holding it down with something while you try to wrestle it closed which usually results in some more blood letting.... I liked the idea however and found an old model Gillette made in the USA with one of those cups and brushes. It works great and will probably last another lifetime or two.</li>
            <li> bought for boyfriend,  absolutely loves it.  his favorite gift</li>
            <li> Worked well at first them broke. There are better razors out there for a little more money</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my boyfriend because he wanted to try it. He absolutely loves it. He gets a very smooth shave and says it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; when his hair is a bit longer like the multi-blade razors did. He cut himself a few times on the first couple uses but seems to have the hang of it now.</li>
            <li> Not as good as advertised !</li>
            <li> I just got this razor as a gift works better then any of my 3 or 6 blade exspensive razors. Just gotta be careful I did not cut my self at all. Over all woul buy as a gift.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband and he absolutely LOVED it.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This was purchased fir my husband and he is very pleased with the quality and price.</li>
            <li> Good shave with this blade</li>
            <li> Pretty fair shave, reasonably smooth but impossible to get the area right under your nose. Reasonably good value with the included blades.  I still prefer my gillette mach 3, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; as much on your whiskers.</li>
            <li> Commercial hype, does not shave as close as described. For the money you get a fair shave.&lt;br /&gt;Schick hydro triple blade shaves much closer.</li>
            <li> I USED THIS TYPE OF RAZOR WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER! CLOSE SHAVES, LONG LASTING BLADES.....LIFE IS GOOD!</li>
            <li> Best thing I ever bought! No More expensive disposable razors old school ROCKS! Such a deal don&#x27;t waste money on those over priced plastic razors ever again!</li>
            <li> This is piece of junk!</li>
            <li> This razor is a revival of those that were commonplace a half-century ago.  It delivers an excellent shave when used with the proper touch.  Blades, and replacements, are far less expensive than the multi-type widely advertised to appeal to the sports car and lite&lt;br /&gt;beer generation.  The razor provides an easy way to remove the grubby unshaven look that surfaced in the fashion magazines. It is highly recommended for any man who wishes to avoid the &amp;#34;drunk-tank&amp;#34; graduate appearance.  Try one, you&#x27;ll like the results and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> good handle but the blades need to be sharper,going with Wilkinson blades when i need more</li>
            <li> I have two safety razors- an old style one piece head and a butterfly opening ( this one). I thought I would prefer the butterfly opening for cleaning, I have found only 2 things: 1. The handle has broken after less than 2 weeks of use.  2. I have more nicks and cute than with my traditional heavier razor. I am using the same technique so I thought it was the blades that came with the kit ( blades SO make the difference) but now with the broken handle, I have to assume a poor product.</li>
            <li> I purchased it about a month ago and it works great, it does take some getting used to but once you get the hang of it it cuts well.  I used a Mach 3 for years and the blades where crazy expensive.  I can honestly I will never go back, I am highly impressed with this single blade razor, I would recommend it for anyone wanting to back to the old school razors.</li>
            <li> My husband was very happy as he got a close shave which he couldn&#x27;t get before.  I think the stand is cute.</li>
            <li> Gives a great, close shave that will save you a lot of cash in razors. I recommend this for people such as myself who don&#x27;t grow a lot of facial hair and just need to shave weekly, or for the person who shaves often to keep their hair short. This is not good for those who grow a full on beard, it will not cut it all off in one go.</li>
            <li> This Razor is top of the line. I have bought the most expensive razors i could find and none could compare to this razor. As i shave i feel as if I&#x27;m not. Very smooth and unlike the multi blade razors that feel like they are pulling your hair instead of shaving it and little hairs that get stuck in between the blades and poke your face then becomes hard to clean. Not the Micro touch one. The only problem i see with this Razor is that the handle is to short. Other than that I&#x27;m amazed at why this razor isn&#x27;t the standard that is used.</li>
            <li> Will not completely close.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. No complaints. Getting tired of expensive multi-blade razors. Get this and a 100 count of blades for about $10 and your in about $30 bucks for the next few YEARS!!!! Real talk. That alone makes it worth it. I have researched double-edged razors and accessories and this is the route to go. Sometimes &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; does not go out of style. These razors worked for our grandfathers and they can work for us now too. Trust...you will not regret this investement. Only thing, the handle is a bit short. I have big hands but that is minor.</li>
            <li> best razor ever would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> Clean, close shave with no irritation. Great product!!</li>
            <li> Get it for 10 bucks. It&#x27;s still cheesy pot metal/ tin. Nothing like your fathers, or grandfathers Gillette. So beware. Blades are cheap crap too. If you must go this way at least put a decent blade in it. That will help. If you are new to real shaving this is an okay try out. If you are in a hurry forget it. That&#x27;s not what shaving with these is all about. Once you learn and have the right equipment it puts all the multi razors to shame.</li>
            <li> Son-in-law wanted it. Knew he wouldn&#x27;t like it, but got him what he wanted. He didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Being my first safety razor, I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect. I like the concept of the &amp;#34;Microtouch;&amp;#34; however, the handle is just too small for my hands. It seems that I am constantly trying to find a better grip to shave my face. Other than that, the system works greats and comes with a good amount of blades.</li>
            <li> I ordered it thinking it will be better than the other store brands, but is does not cut at is says. I ended up with bumps all over my face</li>
            <li> Excellent use all the time.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband.  He was skeptical at first,  but says it&#x27;s the best razor/shave he&#x27;s ever had.</li>
            <li> handle is a little to short</li>
            <li> My son loves this...much more economical and effective than the other fancy, shmancy razors out there.</li>
            <li> This is junk, I used it for about a month or two and I have to open it with pliers. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one. Pay a little extra a get the better quality. I am going to purchase a better one now on Amazon.</li>
            <li> great buy and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> bought this as a gift. my husband has one and really likes it</li>
            <li> to me, not as good as advertisement.</li>
            <li> Cuts my face way too easy very uncomfortable and ruggided. Better off with the galette 4 blade much more comfortable and smooth, this product is not smooth</li>
            <li> Used it 4 or 5 times felt like I never shaved</li>
            <li> Worst ever.  If you have a thick beard, this is not for u. I knew the price is too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Great razor! Requires a slightly different technique, but really worth the adjustment. This thing may put the Mach 3 out of business.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor. I enjoy shaving with it razor burn is a little issue but I would credit that to operator failure rather than the razor. Good buy for cheap alternative.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to try and save money on razor blades. Although I cut myself the first time using it (I didn&#x27;t know how much pressure was needed to apply without cutting myself) The second time using it I did just fine.  I didnt get as close of a shave as what I used to, but after using it for awhile I think that will change. The blades that come with it are a slightly cheaper blade then you can purchase I&#x27;m sure, and that might affect the quality of the shave.  I&#x27;m sure with more practice I will have a better quality shave, and my time frame will shorten also.</li>
            <li> excellant will order again</li>
            <li> I bought this yesterday because I almost never see de razors for sale. I was not expecting much from the blades that came with it and was correct. I was very disappointed with the razor itself to. It feels cheaply made and does a terrible job even with good blades. It was hands down the worst razor I have used to date. The Lord Premium Safety Razor Model LP1822L was better than this razor. The best part is the stand looks nice. If this is your first de razor please try anything else.</li>
            <li> Used this 4 times and it broke, it is a total piece of junk! The double edge razor is a great way to shave but spend the money on a top of the line razor not this crap!!</li>
            <li> After getting the razor and using it a few times I was very pleased with how well it worked. My wife also enjoyed it since i was shaving almost every morning because of how well I thought it worked. seeing as our anniversary was coming up I figured I would use it to... surprise her... Well I was in the shower on the morning of our anniversary, cleaning up when she thought I was taking to long in the shower (which I was as i was shaving a very un-shaved area). So she thought it would be funny to sneak in with a large cup of freezing cold water stand on the toilet and dumb the seemingly arctic water on to my head. The shock made me jump cutting myself with the what I am now describing as a Hellish razor that only the devil would use to cut his victims. I fell through the shower curtain knocking her off the toilet. Needless to say we both spent the morning of our anniversary in the hospital. Me for a slice in my manhood that needed  six stitches, and her for a concision. But all-in-all the razor works well.. On your face anyways.</li>
            <li> The razor was adequate, good buy for the price of razor blades.</li>
            <li> Saw this on TV . It costs less on Amazon. Best shave I&#x27;ve got in years. Far better than multi blade razors. Buy one &amp; see!</li>
            <li> Just got this razor and I have used it several times.  It&#x27;s a decent razor, but it&#x27;s difficult to compare it to current multi-blade razors because it works and shaves differently.  I debated whether to give this three or four stars, and I ended going with four because the product is exactly what is advertised - a decent and economical shave when compared to more expensive razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main pro to the razor is that in the long run, it will end up being significantly cheaper than multi-blade razors that are common now.  The blades can easily be swapped out with a very easy twist design for the top.&lt;br /&gt;The only real cons I have is that I didn&#x27;t like the length of the handle (shorter than conventional razors), and it seemed like the blades that came with the razor were not great quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, here&#x27;s what else you need to realize about the razor:&lt;br /&gt;- In my opinion, it will not give you a closer shave than multi-blade razors.  I have used a Gillette Mach 3 for about 10 years and love it.  I don&#x27;t think there is much of a difference between the quality of shave between the two products, BUT you can feel the difference while you&#x27;re shaving (the multi-blades seem to move more smoothly over the face).&lt;br /&gt;- You CANNOT shave the same way as with multi-blade razors.  You have to hold it at an angle, and you can&#x27;t run it over the &amp;#34;edges&amp;#34; of your face without risking cuts.  I didn&#x27;t experience any irritation, but I noticed after my first couple shaves that I had a few nicks, mostly on my neck.  There&#x27;s a good YouTube video called &amp;#34;Micro Touch One Razor&amp;#34; that describes how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;- If you are cutting yourself, it&#x27;s not because of the product, it&#x27;s either because of how you are shaving, or the blades you are using.  As mentioned, I think the blades that come with the product are not the best quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I don&#x27;t think thinks provides a closer or more comfortable shave, but if you figure out how to use it correctly, you&#x27;ll save money in the long run.  If you currently use the multi-blade razors and are happy with those, this may not appeal to you.</li>
            <li> cut the skin nicely.  as for whiskers- that was a different story.  Did not like and gave it a toss.</li>
            <li> If you need to shave quickly this razor may not be for you. It requires proper prep, procedure and patience. This is old school and well worth it. Take your time and learn proper techniques and you will achieve the best shave of your life.There are a few good videos on  how-to shave with safety razor on youtube.  Your first shave will totally suck, but hang in there and you will be rewarded.</li>
            <li> Horrible.  Received the item and the handle is chipped.  does not affect the use of the time but it was a birthday gift for my brother and I am not allowed to return it for whatever reason.  My brother says the shaver itself is fine but if you order something brand new it should look brand new.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought this from Amazon then it would be a hassle free return. Tried it out today and was very excited. Looks nice but very cheap. Made in China to light too short and it was the worse shave I have ever had in my life. Buyer beware I&#x27;m going back to my very expensive over priced Mach 3 at least its a good shave.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.  It took me about a week to get used to it and only one nick!  The blades last 2-3 shaves before getting dull, but at .20 cents a blade, you can&#x27;t beat this.  It&#x27;s actually very efficient and shaves pretty close and it&#x27;s safer than what I initially thought.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I&#x27;m a girl. I use this to shave my body. I have skin that&#x27;s susceptible to ingrown hair so a close shave is absolutely required. After trying two, three, four and five bladed razors with less than sterling results I figured I&#x27;d try something with more weight and just one sharp and precise blade. It works great, it&#x27;s easy to clean and feels like a quality product. I love it, it takes regular blades and it&#x27;s simple. Best shave ever, effortless maintenance.</li>
            <li> garbage, tossed it out</li>
            <li> Good razor.  I was using the more expensive razors in the past thought I would give it a shot.  The price is right and the blades are sharp.  It took me 3 shaves to get used to the razor without beating up my face.  That was all user error to be honest. I could not be happier with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I guess I got caught up in all the hype of single old style safety razors.  I see why we have evolved away from these things.  I get cut all the time, even when I put in a new razor blade.  Been shaving 35 years, so I know it&#x27;s not me.  I will try some better blades when these run out but if that doesn&#x27;t work, this thing is going in the trash.</li>
            <li> My husband is quite happy with this razor.  The quality is nice and he loves just rinsing it clean and letting it dry.  The blades are lasting a while for each one.  He just touches up a beard every couple of days and it is working great for him.  He is now looking for an antique one but will keep using this one for his normal touch-ups.  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Lame.  It was broken as soon as I locked in the first blade.  The hinge parted on one side.  No heft.  No meat.  Felt like imported Chinese junk.  I got a long handled Murker.  Much better.</li>
            <li> My husband has been looking for a good straight razor and this one is great.  Only &#x27;problem&#x27; is that the handle is a bit short</li>
            <li> Cheap made in china...I would not put my name on this product.  CHEAP CHEAP</li>
            <li> Awesome if you want a new age old school razor</li>
            <li> Love it, works well, is light weight and does a good job. I&#x27;d this razor if you&#x27;re looking for a single edge blade</li>
            <li> Shave not as clean as with multiple blade razor.</li>
            <li> GREAT BUY FOR ANY MAN WHO WANTS A CLASSIC,CLEAN SHAVE IN THE CLASSIC STYLE. ALREADY SAVING BEAUCOUP BUCKS BECAUSE DISPOSABLE RAZORS ARE A THING OF THE PAST.</li>
            <li> Total piece of junk.Mine broke 5 minutes after I received it.Buyer Beware!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor and was not super fond of it, till I discovered the problem. Dorco, the manufacturer of the DE razors that are used in the kit are not sharp enough for my chin whiskers. So I went to a local store and bought new blades. The shave was awesome after replacing the stock blades.&lt;br /&gt;My father taught me how to use safety razors as a kid. I loved safety razors for years and have missed them on super market shelves. This razor is well balanced, it has a sleek feel and is constructed well. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Also I would recommend that you read the instructions before use and follow them, or else it could be a bloody experience. Also look at youtube or check out the art of manliness prior to using a safety razor. These are not your typical 21st century shave. If you have no technique behind the blade it is not a good shave at all.&lt;br /&gt;The other factor  that is involved with how good of a shave do you want involves prep time, and shave lotion. I would suggest any of the Burt&#x27;s Bees Shaving products. Also experiment with hot and cold water shaves. The cold water shave leaves less of a razor burn, and ice also stops any irritation, versus the hot water shave is relaxing, but can leave you with rash or razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;This razor is a great buy, and most of the reviews I have seen that are negative sound like people who did not use proper technique and punished themselves with cuts!&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say anything but positive remarks about this razor and hope to see a come back of DE razors!</li>
            <li> This is the second micro touch safety razor I have purchased for my husband. Within weeks both razors stopped opening and closing. They are useless.</li>
            <li> I would have sent it back if there would be a money back guarantee</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the size of the handle. It is almost an inch shorter than another razor I&#x27;ve been using, which makes it a little uncomfortable to hold. The shave itself is OK, but not great. When the blades are all used up, I&#x27;ll be looking for another razor.</li>
            <li> This one blade is better than any shave I ever gotten from the Gillette Fusion blades I used for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is it a great shave, it is somehow much more pleasing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is something about that one blade slicing through your whiskers.  You can feel it as it cuts but there is so little drag that it cuts better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those 3-blade razors have at least 3 times the drag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular brand razor worked just great for me straight out of the box with the standard blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this item to anyone who shaves.</li>
            <li> Good product to use with care.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item after watching the comercial. Thats a simple aproach to shaving, and it washes better than a multiblade system.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the comeback</li>
            <li> Made my hubby&#x27;s face burn</li>
            <li> Rough shave for me. It cut my face in several places. Short handle which makes it difficult for me because of my hand size.</li>
            <li> This is the &#x27;el cheapo&#x27; razor you see the bald guy advertise on TV. Mine does not hold the blade firmly in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get the smoothest, best shaves you ever had from a DE straight razor. But, you have to pay enough to get a quality product and watch YouTube videos on how to use one if you don&#x27;t know or are new to one.</li>
            <li> This razor is the best</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good.  It shaves close.  What I expected to be.  My husband says all this since it was a Christmas gift to him from me.</li>
            <li> Blades werecheap, nicked my face all up</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as my original razor.</li>
            <li> Does not work better than conventional triple blades, was disappointed with product and Rick from Pawn Stars :(</li>
            <li> This is the only razor my husband will use. He shaves his head and beard everyday because his hair grows so fast and thick, and this has been the only way he&#x27;s gotten a good, clean shave with a blade that&#x27;s lasted a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> Love this razor.... Highly recommended</li>
            <li> not thrilled with shave</li>
            <li> Shaves 1/2 as good as a twin blade disposable but extremely heavier.</li>
            <li> Only used once but seems to be a great razor. On two nicks! Appears to be good quality and blades are sharp!</li>
            <li> Use the BIC cheap razors instead. Cheaper than this and if u use an old toothbrush to brush the blades carefully they will last forever. This blade is a scam. Sliced myself so bad and i was being careful. Stupid and a waste of time/money. Go with bic cheap razors instead folks..</li>
            <li> Got this for my father in law it was something he was asking for he was all excited when he got it reminded him of the old time razors.  First time he used it he cut himself up several times he has been afraid to use it since.  Not sure if it takes some getting use to but know it was not what he expected.</li>
            <li> tried it ,ripped my face up. It must work better on bold heads.</li>
            <li> This is the best deal for a shave. I paid $20 and it included 12 Dorco blades. I was a scared of shaving the  first time but then you get used to. The key is to maintain the razor at 45 degrees, don&#x27;t press the razor against your skin and slide it in short distances (2.5&amp;#34; max).Also, no shaving against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;I have not cut myself, no irritation, nothing, nada in a week (I am a beginner). I use regular soap.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to cartridge multi-blades, you need additional 30 seconds to rinse the blade and the razor... but considering that you pay around $5 per cartridge that normally last a month (for me) versus 4 blades@10 cents each.... is up to you if you want to waste your dollars with Gillete.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I have bought many items off amazon and this the first review I&#x27;ve given. I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 20 years with cartridge razors and like most men the idea of spending $20 to $40 for blades is sickening. So I bought disposables about a month ago and they destroyed my face. I saw the as seen on TV  ad for this and got curious. I did hours of boring research on safety razors and read literally hundreds of reviews. I didn&#x27;t want to spend $100 on a kit to find out the horror stories of slicing my face open was true. So I ran across this last week at Walgreens and spent the $20. I also bought the boar brush having soap and mug for $12. After using for approx 15-20 shaves I love it. The boar brush and wet shave is great. I have a thick beard and shave nightly which typically gives me irratation along my neck and jaw line.I watched a few YouTube videos on shaving technique and gave it a go. I recommend going slow to at first. The most important thing is not to apply much pressure and let the blade do the work. One video recommended going over your face three times which is kind of a pain in the ass but its the cleanest and smoothest shave I&#x27;ve had. I truly thought the extra time to shave would be the down fall but I really enjoy shaving now. And I despised it before. A lot of reviews say to spend the extra money for a merkur or any other more expensive model but like I said I didn&#x27;t want to invest in it if I didn&#x27;t like it. I have under $40 for everything and I&#x27;m going to eventually buy a nicer set but this one does what its supposed to. It even comes with a small chrome stand for the razor. You can buy the brush soap and mug on amazon for $8-$9. Its worth getting compared to the multi blade rip off. I look forward to trying different types if blades and soaps. In summary try it. Its the same as buying 10 multi blades. I&#x27;m still using the original blade weeks later. Hope that helps.</li>
            <li> This is the type of razor I learned to shave with. Much cheaper than 5 blade systems. It Could Be A Little heavier.</li>
            <li> Works just like my old one!!!  Nice to return to the original again.&lt;br /&gt;Just like old dad taught me to shave with.</li>
            <li> On this item you should follow the old ancient Chinese Proverb,  You Get Want You Pay For.  I wet shaved for years but got lazy and in always in a hurry.  After retiring I figured I&#x27;d go back to the great way of shaving and decided I&#x27;d try something cheap to see if I was really going to get back into it all.&lt;br /&gt;  This razor is just poorly engineered...  The hole idea of Wet Shaving is to shave while being wet right?  We&#x27;ll have to keep go over and over and over (tried 4 dif blade brands) until there&#x27;s no more lather on you face.</li>
            <li> not worth the money charged it is not as quality as the old razors used to be does the job but you can get the same job done cheaper with a different brand of razor same type. I would not recommend spending $20. for this to anyone</li>
            <li> My husband loves this. It gives him a closer cleaner shave than any disposable razor. And if you know what you are doing you won&#x27;t cut yourself as one of the other reviews said.</li>
            <li> I gave this product this rating because there were no choices in the negative (below zero) category.&lt;br /&gt;The blades were hideously dull, the razor was difficult to use, and it was the most inefficient and uncomfortable system I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product except to Hitler, Atilla the Hun, or Jeffrey Dahmer.  Certainly not to anyone living.&lt;br /&gt;It was a complete waste of time and money.  I was dumb and dumber to fall for the slick TV commercial.&lt;br /&gt;Any questions?</li>
            <li> Old school baby. Excelent product. Did&#x27;nt care much for the blades it came with so i got the Wilkenson blades 100 for 17.95. Highly recomend this razor.</li>
            <li> Have been using safety razors for many years and I have to say that this razor gives me a shave equal to my Merkur and Jagger razors. Seems decently made and holds the blades in alignment and tightly. Take it from an old hand with these type of razors, get yourself a good badger hair brush and a nicely scented cake soap. Don&#x27;t use canned shave cream with these razors, they will dry out your skin and will not give you a comfortable experience. The cake type soaps will lubricate your face and makes the razor literally glide over the skin. Also get yourself a variety pack of blades here on Amazon, not all blades are created equal and you&#x27;ll end up finding the brand that works best for you. Using a safety razor had become almost a lost art form, but they seem to be making a comeback, probably due to the cost of quality disposables. I won&#x27;t ever trade my safety razors for anything else.&lt;br /&gt;  I have noticed many reviews on not only this but other DE razors from folks saying how badly they have gotten cut up. There is a trick to using a DE razor and getting the best shave from them. Since they have no swiveling or tilting head you will need to learn to hold the razor at the proper angle that is best for your type of beard thru out the stroke. Also, use multiple short strokes instead of long ones like you would with the new multi-blades. Also if your older or have looser skin on your neck, you need to pull or stretch the skin a little in order for the razor to get as close as possible. Shave in the direction of the hair growth first, rinse and re-lather, then shave again against the grain. Don&#x27;t think you can pull a DE razor out and just start swiping away, BIG mistake. When you load the blade into the razor, especially if it&#x27;s a butterfly style, watch  when you close the head against the blade. The blade will shift slightly. Close the razor until the doors just start to apply a little pressure on the blade, then adjust the blade in all directions so you have equal blade edge exposed on both sides then tighten the rest of the way. Take your time and you will learn to get a very nice shave at a fraction of the cost of the multi-blades.edge exposed on both sides then tighten the rest of the way. Take your time and you will learn to get a very nice shave at a fraction of the cost of the multi-blades.</li>
            <li> Razor was ok but the blades that came with it did not do the job, according to my husband. We threw them out.</li>
            <li> The razor did not perform as advertised. The handel is too short and blade not out far enough from razor edgeThe</li>
            <li> The blades are great but the razor is crap.  Nothing precision about the mechinism.  I had two problems with two different razors.  The blades do not seat straignt from one side of the razor edge to the other on both sides.  One side closer to the shaving edge of the razor then the other.  That is dangerous.  I was unaware of this and the blades are so sharp that I did myself some real damage on my bald head before I realized it was happening.  It took several weeks for that to heal.  Also, the blade become wavy over the length of the edge when the mechenism was locked in place.  By the time I got to try these the warrantee period was over.  I sent a email but received no response.  And for a product that should be  readily available, it took all 6 weeks stated for mine to be delivered.  Order this product and use it at your own risk.  I wouldn&#x27;t even give this to an enemy.  I respect the spokesman for this product which is why I bought it.  I advise him to look further into the quality control for this product before advertising further.</li>
            <li> Love this razor. Just like the one I learned on many years ago. I like the way it fits in my hand as well as it being a little heavier than my old razor. And a very close shave.</li>
            <li> An extremely good value for the price. This, combined with a good shaving soap and a bottle of Old Spice, will bring you back to the days of yesteryear and leave you clean shaved and refreshed. It gives a smooth shave and unless you&#x27;re Michael J. Fox, you shouldn&#x27;t suffer any nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> My husband loves using this shaver and we had to buy a second one cause the children over twisted the handle and broke the piece that holds the blade housing on.</li>
            <li> I guess its fine but to me it takes longer and shave is not as close as multi blade razors</li>
            <li> He was thrilled.  Thank you</li>
            <li> The razor isnt to bad but it is not built out of quality products. The first time that I tried to change the blade I could not open the clam shell to get the old blade out. The mechanism that allows you to open the clam shell and change out the blade had corroded closed and could not be loosened. I actually ended up twisting the thing until it broke and yes I was turning it the right way. If you are looking for a good razor go ahead and spend a little more money on a german or english brand.</li>
            <li> Lasted about 6 months.  Butterfly fails to open any more.  So it was worth $20.00 bucks to me to reintroduce me to Double Edged shaving again.  And clearly you can get a good shave with a Double Edge razor for a whole lot less ongoing expense than with the stuff being sold by the big boys now.    Bought a Gillette Slim Adjustable from 1967 off of Ebay for $35.00.  I will see how that works out...    Clearly I expected this to last more than 6 months though.</li>
            <li> Shaves great, but disappointed with short length of handle.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband. It is a piece of junk. Flimsy and poor shave. Sorry I wasted my money on it.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves this, says one of his favorite gifts ever.</li>
            <li> was needing to get another razor and had used the double edge razors before so decided to go back to using.  the blades for it are a lot cheaper.  the tv ads attracted me to get one again.</li>
            <li> Nice razor. Like a straight edge shave.</li>
            <li> Well it is what it is a single blade after about four shaves it did a number on my head first four was great now not sure if it was the blade on not but it hurt sorry</li>
            <li> Not a close shave, the handle is heavy and makes maneuvering the razor awkward.</li>
            <li> Loved this razor . Always wanted one</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS CHEAP RAZOR OLD SCHOOL SUCKED.</li>
            <li> My husband finally has a razor he likes!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know personally, because I ordered this product for my brother. he did not like it.</li>
            <li> very harsh on my face and left more bumps than usual.</li>
            <li> I will not return using gillette. The micro touch cut smooth and let your skin fresh and feeling.</li>
            <li> For the average person the might be thinking this is cool and a good way to get into wet shaving but honestly for $15 you&#x27;d be better off just throwing it directly into the trash can. The blade exposure is terrible and you can never get it aligned. I&#x27;ve had it for 1 month now and the beginning is already starting to rust. Save your money and look elsewhere</li>
            <li> My husband a razor like this when he was in the Marine Corp and has used one ever since.  This one is worth the money.</li>
            <li> When I first began shaving 53 years ago, my dad taught me to shave using a double edged safety razor. Over the years I have tried a number of different style of razors, primarily because I have a rather heavy coarse beard. I have used multiple blade razors with much success over the last few years, but the blade replacements are rather expensive. I purchased the Microtouch One Safety Razor believing that I would give it a try. I followed the instructions for shaving with the razor. I watched YouTube videos on shaving with a safety razor and I went to website promoting safety razors. I tried several times shaving with the razor and found that it does not produce a close shave without irritation, even though I used the best shaving soaps that were recommended. Additionally, I really don&#x27;t like having to spend fifteen to twenty minutes every morning trying to get a close shave. By the bye, if you use this razor, you have better keep styptic pencil nearby!</li>
            <li> my husband loved it, had no complaints</li>
            <li> Great razor, Weishi for sure. Cant beat it for the money and its a butterfly DE. Rick must be making a boatload on the product endorsements, but it actually is a nice DE razor. Don&#x27;t expect the quality of the ones from &#x27;back in the day&#x27;, but this one is certainly passable.</li>
            <li> Not the right choice for shaving ones head...ouch!</li>
            <li> Got mine for $10 and worth every cent.  I used two double edge plastic razors to one blade in this Microtouch One Razor Classic Safety Razor. Not to mention it shaves closer.  My face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s keister.  I have spent allot of cash for the plastic throw aways and only get one side of my face shaved to one double edge plastic razor. My beard is so course and thick.  Any time I shaved it took two...sometimes three razors.  Now I pop in one single blade into my  Microtouch One Razor Classic Safety Razor and I can shave both sides of my face and back of my neck.  I gave ten USD for mine and it was worth my time and hard earned money.  Recommend this 100%</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but I would not trade in my double blades for it.</li>
            <li> it works but its very light, which isn&#x27;t the greatest thing in a double edge. Also little hairs get stuck in the razor after each razor pass. Very mild cut. As an introduction to a double edge it might work, but wouldn&#x27;t recommend otherwise. Many cheaper alternatives on amazon. Go with those</li>
            <li> These guys that cut themselves and get a lousy shave just don&#x27;t know how to shave. When you use a DE you have to use a good quality Shaving Soap and brush, a sharp blade and a light touch. I take my time to pamper my face, therefore I get no razor burn or cuts. When I finish, I use my shaving brush and apply some soap on my face(all good shaving soaps have moisturizers), I then let it set for a moment and then I rinse lightly then towel dry. Happy Shaving.........</li>
            <li> To hard to use and very rough against your skin.</li>
            <li> Never used a safety razor before.  Like the ones my Dad used.  I love this. Good shave, will not be going back to cheap plastic ones in store.</li>
            <li> I love it!! Will never need to buy another razor.</li>
            <li> The handle is a great starter razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaged razors performed underwhelmingly, I had better luck with others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chrome stand rusts everywhere.</li>
            <li> Works OK, have to be careful how much blade one cranks into it. Have to make several passes to get a good shave. In all fairness, this was the standard for most of the 20th century. It does do what it is supposed to and if you learn to use it, will give you a good shave.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t believe Rick endorses this thing. it&#x27;s OK if your the type of person who barely grows hair. Cause even on light fuzz it barely does the job. handles too short as well and m hands are by no means big. So you&#x27;d be better off with the real deal or a low cost modern razor.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the purchase of this item, very good quality, really easy to handle, good presentation and accessory to save is very good, the only thing I&#x27;m not contemto is size, as it is a bit small, and should in be a little longer, but you adapt, I recommend it 100%.</li>
            <li> too bulky and doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I thought it would, maybe it was the blades</li>
            <li> This razor sucks!  It&#x27;s not worth it to send it back so I bought a MERKUR Bakelite which I love.</li>
            <li> A dependable sturdy razor with high quality performance!</li>
            <li> It worked okay, but only lasted for a few months before it became increasing difficult to open and then just fell apart. The single blade razor does save money as long as the razor doesn&#x27;t need to be constantly replaced. It&#x27;s sold as if its durability was on par with similar razors of previous generations, but sadly its just mass produced junk....</li>
            <li> My husband had trouble using it.</li>
            <li> Middle of the road. I&#x27;ve had better. (Used to have a Gillette Fat Boy)</li>
            <li> this razor is not for the kids Dad knew how to use one if you think you can just go to shaving you will be sorry I will assure you if you fail to read how to use one well you will find out why they put in the order a booklet how to shave with there razor.Tough beards it will not work trust me on that but for men with simple beards it will do ok I wish I had someone to give it to but my family have tough beards good luck</li>
            <li> Awesome razor.  Will never you another multiblade razor again.  I can get 12 replacement blades for the cost of 3 of the others.</li>
            <li> yes it works almost as well as those three bladed over priced razor blades very happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> I kind of expected a little better quality of razor, but it works and that&#x27;s the important thing.  I recommend it to people who have never had the experience of a double edged razor shave.  It&#x27;s a different experience than you are used to.</li>
            <li> The safety razor beats both disposable and straight edge razors hands down. I don&#x27;t know about other brands of safety razors but I enjoy shaving now.</li>
            <li> My teenage son saw this on an infomercial and asked me to buy him one but I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay what they wanted.  This is EXACTLY the same thing and was less money!</li>
            <li> Junk would never buy it again</li>
            <li> this is the best part of my shave, knowing I have a bad a$$ razor but didn&#x27;t break the bank for it. close and clean shave.</li>
            <li> First I thought it was just a commercial thing, but then I tried and to be honest it&#x27;s not easy in the beginning because it&#x27;s sharp and dangerous if you don&#x27;t know how to use but I got used to it and its my favorite blade ever...no matter how long is my beard it shaves real good without taking half an hour with the regular one.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time it is okay I think I get a better shave with the multi blade and my electric.  Only thing I like is if I don&#x27;t shave for like a week it cuts the hairs and not pulls them less of a &amp;#34;tug&amp;#34;.  The blades rust also I have never had a razor blade rust on me.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product at all. I&#x27;ve used just about every type of razor out there, multi blade, single and electric. This razor with the single thin blade does just as well as any of the others, and the replacement cost of the blades is a fraction of Gillette and similar razors. The only downside is that I&#x27;m not real comfortable going against the grain on my upper lip area. Other than that, good investment.</li>
            <li> This thing is garbage. Causes razor burn, better to get a multi blade</li>
            <li> love it works awesome</li>
            <li> Works Good. I thought I would cut myself but I never did. I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Father in law loves it. Didn&#x27;t come with a case like the ones on tv though. I personally uses the Murker long handle one myself but these seems to be almost as well made.</li>
            <li> For Christmas, I was given a Norelco rechargeable shaver. It seemed to work okay but I found myself still using the disposable razors. I kept seeing the commercials for my father&#x27;s type butterfly razor and decided after the barber shaved me with a single edge blade to try it. On my first shave, I was very pleased. I&#x27;ve already recommended it to several friends and relatives.      UPDATED REVIEW: After using for several months, I find the shaver harder to open and closed. At first I opened after each use to clean blade. Now I struggle to open only to change blade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all you need. I have been using the same blade for a month now. Some reviews make it sound like you have to learn how to shave all over again but I just shave like I always have. I&#x27;m gunna save a lot of money using this.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the razors out there and this one by far does the job every time at a great price.  I have a really tough beard and this one causes a minimal amount of irritation especially on my neck.  My only issue is the length of the handle but you get use to it after a few shaves.  Another plus is that it comes with replacement blades.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking to save money on razors and want a great shave!</li>
            <li> My wife bought me this razor and I love it.  I started shaving many decades ago using a razor very similar to this.  I later switched to the multi blade razors when they came out.  I guess I got caught up in the hype.  This razor gives me a close clean shave with less irritation than a multi blade.  It takes skill to use a razor like this without cutting yourself.  It has some heft to it letting you know you have something solid in your hand.  And best of all, the blades last and are a lot cheaper than multi blade razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dump the plastic, fill your hand with some steel.</li>
            <li> Seems fine to me,appreciate them bringing it back. Double edge blades give a close shave. 5plus blades are not needed.Double edge blades are still available I think its a given make the change and keep the change.</li>
            <li> nice looking product, highly polished chrome with a nice soild weight to it.  twisting the handle stem opens top for razor replacement. comes with 12 razors if i counted right.  dropped one in and got straight edge quality shave.  I didn&#x27;t rush as a little nervous about nicks but made it out ok. $20 bucks for a razor which will seemingly last a decade seems like a good value to me, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Works great! Was a little hesitant at first but it was a breeze to use and does a fantastic job!</li>
            <li> Very simple and economical.  Used an electric razor all my life until now.</li>
            <li> Bought it because I was tired of spending a ton of money on those multi-blade razors. Thought &amp;#34;hey it worked for my Grand Dad and my Dad why not me.&lt;br /&gt;Some traditions should be left to die. My barber uses a Straight razor but this isnt that. He uses a multiblade razor on his face. These things are dangerous and not very ergonomic. They dont even give a real close shave. I got a huge divot in my lip to remember this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It got one star for sentimental value.</li>
            <li> Works well and I think most of criticisms Ive seen are from people who are not used to using this type of a razor. I was &amp;#34;taught&amp;#34; on one in the 60s. This works well if used right.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my son. He says it&#x27;s the best shave he&#x27;s ever had.</li>
            <li> I wanted the razor advertised on TV by Brett--This is not it!</li>
            <li> I finally got a genuine Micro Touch One and am very pleased.  It weighs about 60 grams, without packaging or accessories. It&#x27;s sturdy, well-built, has a nice finish, and provides a reliable shave.&lt;br /&gt;Tried ordering a couple of these from a popular online auction site, and got bit hard!&lt;br /&gt;I have never been sold short by Amazon.  The price Amazon is charging for these is good, and they are the genuine article.</li>
            <li> It was more than I thought it would be works great so happy I got this I will no longer be wasting my money on cheap razors that cost so much and just don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Years ago I used a safety razor like this.  Then the companies started telling me the more blades the better.  Well it&#x27;s true.  There is a sucker born every minute.  I have finally returned to a safety razor and it works just as good as a razor with multiple blades.  I also have more money to  spend on things besides razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;Bought this razor in October of 2014.  Today is February 4 2016.  It is broken and have to buy another one.  This razor is too light weight and the part that flips down to tighten the blade is too thin and  comes out of the hole it is supposed to fit in. Wished I hadn&#x27;t bought this razor.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying this razor on a whim. I had recently been to Sam&#x27;s Club to buy refils for my gillett fusion that I had been using. However when i saw the price of $50 for a pack of twelve, I just couldn&#x27;t do it. I figured i would just pay the $15 dollars for the pack of 4 at walmart. Then on the way home my wife wanted to stop at Ross and i saw this razor for $10 with extra blades so i figured what the heck I&#x27;ll try it. I watched some videos online on how to wet shave and i set off. I&#x27;m never going back to cartrages again. This is by far the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;m going to grab a sampler of different blades from Amazon just to see if there are any that work better for me, but the Dorcos that came with mine already work great.</li>
            <li> I am a prime member and order frequently from Amazon.  This is the first review I&#x27;ve written and hopefully won&#x27;t have to do many more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally loved this product.  So much so that I ordered one for 4 other family members for Christmas.  Then my issues came.  My original razor I purchased fell apart.  I thought it was something I did.  I liked the product so much that I reordered a new one for myself in February.  Within 1 week of use this one fell apart.  I never asked for money back or for a new product.  I did take pictures and send to the manufacturer.  They said they couldn&#x27;t do anything for me because they didn&#x27;t have order information.  I told them I didn&#x27;t want anything, but hopefully picture would help them fix the quality of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would think twice about buying.</li>
            <li> Going to be a gift for my dad&#x27;s birthday.</li>
            <li> not as good as the razor above but still good,just a little small.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great result for the price. This is the perfect starters razor if you&#x27;re  considering trying out DE shaving.  I will add, this product is identical to the Weishi safety razor so if you can find weishi cheaper I would go for it. The weight is very nice so you don&#x27;t have to add any extra pressure when shaving yet you still get a perfect result. The razor blades that come in this however (Dorco st300) leave a lot to be desired. I would suggest adding some better blades to your order right away since you will be needing them in the future anyway. There are some great sample packs so you can find out which razor blade works best for you. (Just bought another one of these for my dads birthday it&#x27;s a nice gift for someone who might be willing to make the switch over from cartridges)</li>
            <li> Never had one before so cannot compare but is working well for me</li>
            <li> The husband loves this one.  He didn&#x27;t think he would after becoming used to what&#x27;s on the market in general.  He says you do have to pay more attention and be more careful because cuts and nicks are easier with this razor, but at the same time, this razor provides a much better shave and lasts longer than the disposables on the market now...it also works out to be much cheaper.  This razor is well made and comes with a small stand allowing you to hang it upright for storage and drying plus it protects the blade currently in the razor.  The husband&#x27;s facial hair is very coarse and thick and he could use shaving almost twice daily and with this razor he gets a closer, cleaner shave than the disposables can provide.  This purchase was a definite winner and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Learning to shave all over again.  Finally about there.  Blades at $0.08 cents apiece rather than $4.00 makes this a smoking deal and worth the time to re-learn the process.  Don&#x27;t know what took me so long to make this change.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my husband, who has a stubborn beard that easily clogs multi-blade razors. He can&#x27;t get over how well this product works and how easy it is to clean. Product as advertised!</li>
            <li> It gives a excellent shave! I first used my Fathers when I was young. And the price is right for something that will last forever...except for blades...but many more shaves for the price!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a safety razor for a while, and saw this one on the shelf at WalMart. I tried it out, and managed to get some good shaves, but not for long. After about 2 months the mechanism siezed up so badly I had to use pliers to open the butterfly. A week later the screw inside broke completely. A good safety razor should last 50 years, this one barely made it past 50 days.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for $20, including 12 blades and a chrome stand, and I must say that I am very satisfied with it.  After years of trying Braun, Norelco, Remington and Panasonic electric razors, I have used disposable twin blade razors for the last few years, anything without a lubricating strip (that irritates my skin and takes away the traction that I personally need to get a good, close shave).  I saw the infomercial and thought I would give this a try, remembering the old Gillette twist-to-open DE razor that my Dad used when I was very little (1970&#x27;s).  While everyone&#x27;s face and beard growth/density is different, this works great for me.  I prefer to use Shave Secret shaving oil (or sometimes even just hot water), rather than the soap, brush, and mug that most DE shavers use.  A lot of reviewers mention the proper shave method (vital if you are going to enjoy this razor), build quality of the razor, sharpness of the blades, etc.  I am going to cover a few things that I have not seen mentioned (or coverd in detail).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. A lot of folks are surprised that an old-fashioned DE razor can shave as close (or closer) than a multi-blade disposable razor (or cartridge).  I believe one of the reasons is the double-bevel edge of a DE razor blade.  All three types of disposable razors in our household (under magnification) clearly have only a single-bevel edge (from the top).  I am not sure whether DE (double edge) blades are called that because they have two cutting edges (where you spin your razor around 180 degrees and use the other edge) or because they are sharpened/honed from the top and bottom of the blade.  I do know that it makes for a sharper edge, and that is why you can get such a close shave with DE blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The thing that dulls a blade the most is actually oxidation of the cutting edge.  For this reason, when I took out my first blade (that I am still on after 7 shaves), I carefully smeared a tiny drop of Shave Secret oil on the top andbottom of it before letting it touch any water (NOT smearing in the direction to get cut).  I also do the same as I clean up after each shave, using Shave Secret as an aftershave too.  As far as I can tell, my blade is still just as sharp as when I started using it.  I am sure that mineral oil would work just as well for preventing oxidation of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Cleanup is SO much easier with this style of razor.  There are actually openings all underneath the blade to allow for easy cleaning, and I have noticed that a fast pumping up and down in hot water cleans the blade very well.  I saw another reviewer who said they have often broken their plastic razors while tapping them firmly against the sink, and I have had the exact same experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. While this is not an adjustable DE razor, (using CAUTION) you can make it shave a little closer for your final pass (or make it shave a little more aggressively all the time).  If you look through the side of the razor as you tighten a blade in, you can see how it &amp;#34;bows&amp;#34; the blade up into a curve right as it starts to max out, setting up the angle at which this razor was meant to shave at.  If it is tightened all the way, then backed off even a TINY amount, it will set the blade at a more aggressive angle for shaving (but use caution and make sure you still see it bowed from the side).  I have found that if I loosen it until the blade is seen to be bowed halfway, it makes for a closer shave (and easier cuts if you are not careful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving!  And remember to give it a few shaves and learn the proper technique for shaving this way.  You will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Thank you Rick Harrison.</li>
            <li> use it every day, perfect</li>
            <li> Awesome razor, I use 1blade a month.</li>
            <li> Used for two weeks and then went back to a modern razor. If you want to go back to B&amp;W 19&amp;#34;. TV from your LCD model then this is the razor for you. Never got a shave I was satisfied with and it felt clunky. Lots of technology between when this was invented and today&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a stocking stuffer for my husband last Christmas.  He absolutely LOVES it.  Nice it has the stand too.</li>
            <li> Had it for less than 2 weeks and the top would not close.  Appears to be cheaply made.  Would Not purchase another one.</li>
            <li> Too sharp a blade, must be very very careful.</li>
            <li> Short handle, made for women.</li>
            <li> Great Product, my husband loved it.</li>
            <li> good old school razor</li>
            <li> Its a toy don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> Not a good purchase for me. If on an infomercial it&#x27;s last resort sale. I went back to a four blade and they last a month or more. Just keep the blades cleaned with an old tooth brush. I kept the blades and tossed the razor.</li>
            <li> taped on the sink and it came apart. No tapping</li>
            <li> It works great.  I also love how easy it is to clean.  Just open the head and rinse..then put the blade back in.  Way better then crappy multiblades...no more hitting them against the tile to get hair out.</li>
            <li> this was a gift for my dad. He seems to really enjoy it. Good size handle and seems well constructed. It actually seems like the rebuilt a classic Gillette butterfly razor. Side by side they are similar in the head, but the handle is a slightly more modern version on this.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my son who loves it. He really likes the stand it came with. It looks nice sitting on the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 99% sure he does not shave his head with this product. That&#x27;s what I bought it for. Face shaves ok. Could not get good angle on my head and ended up with lots of cuts</li>
            <li> This ok. Not much better as others here on amazon. A little more weight, and heavyier. WOULD make a lot better. Now her feelings to Dorco and Amazon. Thanks.</li>
            <li> so many years wasting money on razors this thing works great after you get used to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 66 and have been shaving since I was about 14. I started shaving with this type of razor and thought I would buy this razor in case I had forgot how great shaving with a double edge safety razor was. One shave and I was reaching for the disposable razor again. The multiple blades in the new razors are to prevent you from having to go over the same area over and over to get a close shave. The Microtouch One took three times longer than a cheap disposable razor to get a close shave and the multiple passes created much more razor burn. Thanks but no thanks.</li>
            <li> Looks appealing, but doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; it. Razor handle length is short, the actual razor blades are thin, flimsy and are not structured to give a close, smooth shave. To get a closer shave you may have to apply more pressure to the blade, risking a cut. Don&#x27;t throw away your Gillette just yet, see https://www.harrys.com/.</li>
            <li> My wife got me this fpr my birthday. I had always taken her into the store Art of Shaving. But the prices were retarded. Ladies this is a great gift. Easy to use. My first shave with no cuts and no razor burns. A little hard to navigate the chin but worth every penny. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. I&#x27;m tired of paying for over priced and over marketed razor blades. Great way to save money and have a better shave.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box it shaves good.  I never experienced any of the nicks or cuts that some have been, but I&#x27;m guessing they&#x27;re inexperienced shavers.</li>
            <li> I have this razor and it is very... Odd... It shaves too aggressively in some areas and too mild in others... I think the best thing you get in this package is the stand... That being said, the razor is not worth 15-20$ by any means... Sorry</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t particularly like the blades that are supplied with the razor.  Be prepared t buy better blades, I prefer Wilkinson myself.&lt;br /&gt;And there is learning curve to using the razor again and handling the blades. (I haven&#x27;t used this type of razor since I was in the Army 40 yrs. ago)&lt;br /&gt;But once you learn  or relearn it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, it was a real step back.</li>
            <li> I would like to start by saying that I rarely write reviews on products unless I have a reason to. Which brings me to the point that this razor is not what the description tells you. Multiple cuts on my face and neck, very loose pieces on item, poor construction, overall lack of a decent product. I do not recommend this to anybody. Purchase if you would like just be forewarned it is not what you think</li>
            <li> Been using it for 2 weeks straight. So far really happy with it. Have not change the blade yet. Still cutting well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the weight I wo prefer. Now I can cut myself just like my daddy did.</li>
            <li> The razor is ok, needs a better blade for better satisfaction</li>
            <li> Well , this razor takes me back to when my Dad taught me how to shave. I had forgotten what a good shave really is. This razor will give anyone a truly close shave.</li>
            <li> Would be a 5 star - if the handle were longer ! - It is just too short - too hard to hold on to - very disappointing...</li>
            <li> My husband was excited to try this, after they had disappeared from the market for so long.  I would have given it 5 stars, but he said that the blade seems dull, and pulled his beard.  I will look for some better blades--dang it.</li>
            <li> good old fashioned razor handle needs to be longer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. the handle should be longer.</li>
            <li> The first time. I cut myself. Learned real quick, now I love it. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I got tired of buying a 4-pack of Gillette multi-blade razor cartridges for $20 which consumed a good portion of my disposable income and was getting tired of it.  Even disposable razors have no less than 2 blades each these days.  Then I heard about the Microtouch One and bought it as soon as it was available at Showcase.  I tried it and although using it effectively took some finesse and I get some cuts, it did the job just as well as those insipidly overpriced multi-blade razor cartridges that dull easily and don&#x27;t last long, like a 4-pack of multi-blade cartridges will only last a month at best.  Whereas with the Microtouch One, a single blade, when treated properly, can last a month, maybe more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes down to it, the only reason Gillette is making its razors fancier is so that they can charge you more money.  Rick Harrison is right; you only need one blade to get the job done.  Nothing more.  I&#x27;m never going back to those overpriced razors again.  Thanks, Microtouch One.  I can now get a close shave without shaving my wallet.</li>
            <li> I get a great shave and don&#x27;t have to spend a lot on razor blades anymore.</li>
            <li> I do not get a close shave with this product as I was led to believe I would.  The single blade does not even  compare to my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; double edge blade so unfortunately I am stuck with a razor and 100+ extra blades</li>
            <li> My husband and son love this product.  They were both sick of paying through the nose for replacement blades for other razors and now they can go to our local grocery store and buy replacement blades for $2.19!  It may not be for every man, but my two men would recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> I had forgotten how well the &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; safety/butterfly razors work! If you&#x27;re tired of the huge prices of the multiple blade razors I can HIGHLY recommend these razors.</li>
            <li> Low quality product made in China.</li>
            <li> TALKING ABOUT A SMOOTH SHAVE!</li>
            <li> How anyone could give this more than two stars, I do not know. What are they shaving off their face, peach fuzz?  I tried sharper blades, but the bottom line is this razor doesn&#x27;t have enough weight to push through the stubble. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Buy a good double edge razor for 10 or 20 dollars more, and definitely don&#x27;t judge a de razor based off of this one. This is the bottom of the line, worst razor ever.</li>
            <li> Way better then expected, received on time!</li>
            <li> After only six (6) months the handle locked up and would not open. when i tried to get it to open to change the blade the whole thing came apart. The actual company refused to stand behind their product...is made from garbage metal.  I recall my grandfather had a model like this. His lasted years...Not worth the money.  Amazon stood behind it though and refunded the cost...GO Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;.  Microtouch...drop dead !</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this razor. I purchased it at CVS but had to get extra blades at WalMart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it and discovered that the blades did not give me a close enough shave for my liking.  So I went and bought normal size razor blades only to find that the Microtouch razor is smaller and will not take normal sized blades.  It is also too short for my comfort - I need a 4&amp;#34; handle to avoid cramping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I returned it and CVS was nice enough to accept the return.  I also returned all the blades I had bought.  I will say that the stand is very nice but that&#x27;s about it.  I would not recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
            <li> You get what you paid for. Very Poor Quality. The butterfly wings, don&#x27;t open smoothly and worse yet, don&#x27;t close symmetrically. The stand came bent down, and the razor kept falling off it. I had to use my vise to fix it.  The razor blade sides stick out too much making it a very aggressive shave.  You have to be extremely careful not to get cut, which unfortunately I did. Definitely not for the novice. Bought it as a curiosity, but I will keep the blades and trash the razor.</li>
            <li> Item as described Fast Shipping  A+++++</li>
            <li> It is not easy to shave with it, but if you do it right you get less irritation</li>
            <li> Razor blades dont fit in razor, wont shave correctly, not enough razor sticks out to properly shave with.&lt;br /&gt;the mechanism broke during first shaving session and now wont open at all, i wish i could rate a 0 star</li>
            <li> If you are buying it to shave your head don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice well made razor that is near identical in all respects to the classic Gillette superspeeds, of which millions were produced. The advantage here is a nice new razor.&lt;br /&gt;The razor would be classified as medium aggressive, meaning that it is neither aggressive or nonaggressive. It provides a smooth shave that anyone would be proud of. Double edge shaving does require a little practice to obtain the proper angle of the blade to the skin which is about 30 degrees. After a little practice and your skin gets used to this razor, you&#x27;ll obtain super close shaves every time. I would suggest someone unfamiliar with DE shaving to watch a few Youtube videos to learn the proper technique.&lt;br /&gt;If you are one of those who uses a cartridge for $4.00 a pop with 6 build in blades, and want a shave in 60 seconds, this is probably not the razor for you. This is a razor for a man, who realized the importance of that quiet time of reflection every morning while he exercises the manly art of shaving with a real razor.</li>
            <li> product sticks ( will not open) when I try to change blades. Had to use plyers last several time to get the thign to open up. Not good quality.</li>
            <li> I love this razor!  I have had it and been using it for about 6 months now and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I&#x27;ve saved a ton of money and get a great shave.  I only have to shave every other day since I started using this razor and quit using my 4 &amp; 5 blade razors.  I see all these bad reviews and can&#x27;t imagine their troubles because this is a great razor!!</li>
            <li> Dangerously sharp! Be careful!</li>
            <li> My son said it is the best razor he has ever used! He would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Bad product.  Cheapest safety razor I&#x27;ve ever seen.  Cheap blades lasted two shaves.  Nearly scalped my head.  I&#x27;ve shaved with everything from a straight blade to a safety razors to gas station twins to vibrating 5 blades.  This was the worst.&lt;br /&gt;I could have gotten a better shave with my pocket knife.</li>
            <li> This thing is horrible...my husband got sucked in my the commercial for it and had me order one for him.  He used it twice and then brought it to me to use for shaving my legs.  Said he couldnt figure out how to use it without cutting himself...haha.  Soooo I used it...I also cut a chunk out of my leg.  I think part of it is the fact that we are so used to using those throw away razors that we forget how to use this old school one.  I WILL say...I did get a VERY smooth shave on my legs with this, but I had to be very cautious and go very slow.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong its easy and cheap because you don&#x27;t throw them away.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was wondering about single blade shaving but I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much. It takes a few tries to get the hang of it but now I&#x27;m sold. I could never justify spending 18 bucks on fusion blades when I can get an awesome shave for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> hard to handle. used one time and trashed it. don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Great purchase. Extremely satisfied!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped!</li>
            <li> Terrible would not buy.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews often but because of the VERY POOR QUILITY and Customer service from FBrand I was compelled to write this so other can avoid the run around I got. When I reported this razor fell apart after my very first shave (when I opened it to clean the blade after the shave) it would not close properly and in fact one of the four connecting nubs that fit into the doors that open had broken. I took a magnifying glass and discovered pot metal construction not steel. I informed FB, they said take a picture and sent to us. I said no I will sent it back to you after you replace it. Again they demanded a picture, NO I insisted send a pre-paid box and I will return to you the defective razor. They insisted a 3rd time for a pictures and I have given up. They are reluctant to replace a 16 dollar razor, demanding pictures. BEWARE of Beauty&lt;br /&gt;Legends&amp;#34; and FBrand POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. I will never&lt;br /&gt;order from them again (any of their products) and suggest other Amazon customers BEWARE of Beauty&lt;br /&gt;Plus it takes 21 days to come from China, I gave up and ordered a different model from different company made of stainless steel not pot medal.</li>
            <li> Shaves terrible! The Blades Are DULL DULL and you can not get the razor at the right angle for shaving.. Beware, you may and probably will cut yourself.</li>
            <li> Worse product on the market!!!!😠</li>
            <li> The razor is great but the blades that come with it are a little flimsy.  I will buy better blades and keep the razor.  It&#x27;s a great shave!</li>
            <li> I used this razor 3 times. Then the side bracket, which opens and closes the butterfly doors, completely came apart. After taking a closer look at the bracket it looks like it belongs on a matchbox car. Its very generic looking and seems to have been pinched on with a pair of needle nose pliers or something. The makers claim that the razor is made of chrome plated solid brass, and the handle may very well be, but the rest of the razor seems to be made of cheap chrome plated diecast or pot metal. This POS is definitely going back to Walmart. I would recommend to anyone thinking of buying one to spend the extra 10 bucks and get a Merkur instead.</li>
            <li> THis product is just like 1960 all over it is not better safer or gives you a close clean shave.  Hurts pulls cut my head shaving it.  it is JUST LIKE 1960 all over not any improvement.  5 blades is better.</li>
            <li> My Husband loves his new razor. He is sick of the disposable ones . A good buy. He&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Husband had been looking for razor like this for a while loves it will probably have to buy another one as a gift</li>
            <li> I understand that learning the proper technique can take time, however, after my first go around I look like I have been in the ring with Abdullah the Butcher. Don&#x27;t have the time nor the patience to get cut up like this ever again. Back to the expensive Shick Hydro Blades for me. Think twice if you shave your head!!!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor. He&#x27;s very happy that he won&#x27;t be wasting money on the disposable ones anymore. Thank you.</li>
            <li> It is the best razor by far.  You get a really close shave. Hands down it out shines any razor you buy at the store.</li>
            <li> Quality of the razor is fine; reminds my husband of his own father&#x27;s razor. He is very happy with the quality of the razor and the smoothness of the shave. The design is makes it very easy to use and to change and secure blades.  He also likes the stand that comes with the razor.</li>
            <li> Bad design Its so short handled that it makes me feel like I should be 6 years old to fit in my hand. My husband says he feels like he&#x27;s playing with grandsons toys... I want to return it. I am going to check and see if I can.  Get the long handle one here on Amazon its worth it.</li>
            <li> What can i say? I love it! Find the right Blade for your skin type and learn the proper method for the best shave ever! I think the problem some folks are having, is that using a safety razor is a bit of a lost art these days! Learn how to do it right for the best shave ever!!</li>
            <li> Blade was dull.  Hubby had to substitute with another brand.  Comfortable handling. But would not purchase again.  Expected better from Rick</li>
            <li> The perfect shave.&lt;br /&gt;You feel no sensation when shaving and the Razor allow you to give a diferent angul to the blade.</li>
            <li> Razor  Razor is junk and the blades that came with are too. The stand with it is bent so bad it will not even hold the razor. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this junk!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this razor, but Rick Harrison&#x27;s endorsement and the low price made it worth the gamble.  In my opinion, it gives a closer facial shave than the multi-blade razors once you get used to it.  Where it falls short for me is if you shave your head.  For this task, I think it&#x27;s too cumbersome and difficult to use.  For this reason, only four stars.</li>
            <li> It was the best technology in the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s......but today&#x27;s razors are safer and &amp;#34;blood&amp;#34; free....This is one piece of &amp;#34;nostalgia&amp;#34; that is left behind for a reason.  If you are on an &amp;#34;aspirin&amp;#34; a day regement or blood thinner&#x27;s.....You might to want to avoid using.....it shaves close....really close....!!</li>
            <li> I love the thought of using antiques and have used a true straight razor before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continie to use the Schick Hydro as well as the Gillette Pro glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me to get the closest shave, swipe down and then carefully swipe up(against grain) for a baby smooth skin shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this razor 4 different times w/a new blade each time. Horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less hair taken from a down swipe and not much more for up swipes...gave me razor bumps/cuts/etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was truly hoping this would do a good job, fan of Pawn Shop was a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I make it out to Vegas I bet Mr. Harrison will not give me one dollar for the razor that was used four (4) times and still has 20 of the 24 blades remaining from the kit that I spent $20 on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps somebody and/or the product is improved.</li>
            <li> Razor great no more expensive blades.</li>
            <li> My husband only used this twice and hated it! He said it pulled at hi skin and didn&#x27;t give a good shave. I didn&#x27;t know how to make returns using Amazon at the time, so now it jus sits in the bottom of our cabinet.</li>
            <li> Good razor leaves skin smooth used mine for 7 months before it fell apart</li>
            <li> this is the most shitiest thing ever the blades are not even sharp in anyway instead of cutting the hair it cut his head bad! id be ashamed to be the one to have my name on it in anyway. we have tried many of the blades and they are all bad and one top of it I cant even send it back well, bs</li>
            <li> It was great while it lasted. I have had two razors break on me. They sent me one replacment then said my warrentee was done. I will not spend the money to get another one. I will look for a better quality one. It is very cheaply made. Do not waist your money.</li>
            <li> I hate this razor, the handle short and hard to hang on to, It takes twice as long as my Gillette sensor and is a worse shave.&lt;br /&gt;save your time and money and do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> i bought this on a whim and I get a perfect, close shave every time.  I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with the razor yet but I am still using the same blade after 3 weeks.  Someone even complemented me on my sHave one day.&lt;br /&gt;You need to follow instructions or it WILL eat your face up</li>
            <li> Husband really likes this razor and got van der Hagen shave kit to go with it. He says it is a good clean shave.</li>
            <li> First time ever used a razor like this. Great shave right out of the box.  Had no issues with blade quality or length of handle.  Glad I didn&#x27;t listen to the nay sayers.  Overall good product!</li>
            <li> Micro Touch One,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased two of your razors from Amazon and they were delivered 16 Sept 2014.  I bought one for myself and the second for my son.  We used them exactly two blades and then the dial  knob on the bottom to open them locked up..  It happened to both at the same time.  I tried every normal way to get the dial or knob to turn to open the razor.  I then used a pliers to hold the handle and turn the dial knob .  My approach was with light pressure at first and it simply would not move.  With more pressure my sons razor dial knob just crushed to pieces… In my frustration I discarded his in the trash.  I was as delicate as I could be with mine and still the plastic knob damaged the razor is unusable to open and close with ease.  All efforts to follow the instructions failed.  This product does not meet the expectation and do not understand how Rick Harrison could endorse it..  Just a month’s use would have shown lack of quality.  I would like a refund for both or replacements that are the quality level advertised.  If you are unable to do that I would at least like you to acknowledge the poor quality of this product and have Rick Harrison stop endorsing it and take it off the market.</li>
            <li> Hard to tell that I have shaved after I finish</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. Nicely made. However, it still doesn&#x27;t cut as close as my Fusion. I have to go back and finish my beard w/ my Fusion razor. Sorry, that&#x27;s just telling it like it is.</li>
            <li> Best shave that I had in many years, still using my first blade. Brings back memories.</li>
            <li> My husband and son love it!</li>
            <li> I remember Therese from my dad abd grandfather days. Really fit in with today&#x27;s situation of saving money. I don&#x27;t need to spend money on fancy handles and more blades just to get a good shave</li>
            <li> Great product works perfect</li>
            <li> Switching to a single blade safety razor has been fantastic.  It has saved me hundreds of dollars on blades, and provides a nice, smooth, close shave.</li>
            <li> Worked great at first. After a month it would not open to replace the blade. Contacted customer service but currently still waiting for a response. Could not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Love it worth every penny. Best shave I&#x27;ve gotten and it&#x27;s nice to have a razor that the refill blades are affordable. Takes a little getting used to at first but works great after that. One blade is definitely better than 3.</li>
            <li> Zero Stars!! This is absolutely the worst razor ever!  Do not buy it!  I bought this for my husband for Christmas because he shaves his head.  He used it one time and it took the skin clear off his head in spots.  He said it didn&#x27;t feel like it was cutting so he didn&#x27;t realize until he was done and it started bleeding all over.  It bleed for over an hour.  His head is now in shambles, embarrassed to go to work and will have to wear a hat whenever possible!</li>
            <li> I tried this model for several days and think that it’s very good in relation to weight and size of the razor, but the razor blades didn&#x27;t last long , so I had to change those very frequently.</li>
            <li> This razor does not shave as advertised.  It takes multiple passes just to get the slightest amount of stubble shaved off of your face.  The blades that come with the razor are flimsy and seem dull right out of the package.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Too short handle and light weight make for one of the terrible purchases I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li> Very good razor love lt WORKING GRATE</li>
            <li> He loves this razor. I light andgives a smooth shave</li>
            <li> works great have not used one for years but glad I tried it</li>
            <li> Safety Razors are the Best Way to get a clean smooth shave. Here is how I get the best shave:&lt;br /&gt;Wet the face with warm water, make sure your face is feeling warm. A warm wash cloth works best. While you have the warm water running close the drain slightly so you have some hot water in the sink. Place your razor in the warm water to heat the blade. Having the blade warm is a huge part of getting a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Place a few drops of Shave Secret in your palm and rub your hand slightly to get it even then apply to your warm face. Work the oil in and be ready to shave. I start at my left temple and move down in small strokes with the grain of my beard. Be sure to swish the razor in the sinks warm water to clean the blade. I hold the end of the handle to let the shavers weight set the pressure against my skin. Keep the shaver at a 45 degree to the skin. Pull your skin tight for the closest shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel for areas you may have missed but be sure to press hard with the shaver or it will cut you.&lt;br /&gt;I find I get about two shaves out of one side of the razor blade before I flip it or switch it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never go back to disposables! Try it, all you have to loose it a little blood.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheaply made piece of junk with a dull blade</li>
            <li> I bought one off Amazon it fell apart when I took it out of the package and is a lot lighter weight than the same exact one I bought at Walgreen and have had for half a year now the one off Amazon weighed 33 grams or so the one I bought at Walgreen weighs 59 grams so what the hell</li>
            <li> awesome deal works great!</li>
            <li> I grew up using this type of razor and after seeing it advertised on TV I had to ask why I never went back to it. I purchased this and was sorta excited about shaving with this style razor again. What a disappointment! I can get the same shave using a cheap plastic disposable. I figured I could get over the short handle and light weight but the closeness if the shave just wasn&#x27;t there. Perhaps I will try a name brand blade and repost my findings if there is any improvement.</li>
            <li> my  husband cant stop raven about the razor he say it leave his face soft and smooth.and  the one blade last him a while.</li>
            <li> Great starting razor.  High quality and stainless steel.  If you want to get into shaving with a traditional safety razor, I doubt you&#x27;d get much better for the price.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how they can make such junk, this razor combined with the Derby blades were a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> The razor was too small for my hands so I did not like it.</li>
            <li> So far shave is no better than previous 3-5 blade razors, as they advertise, but the blades are a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> I found it to be good product with one drawback. If you travel you can&#x27;t take it through TSA checkpoint. I lost all my blades!</li>
            <li> Try to avoid buying this  . . . bought for my husband - it worked great - he loved it - due to cheap manufacturing it broke after 6 months!!!!  Just barely got my money’s worth . . . had switched to this from disposable blades to try and save a dime not to buy a new razor every 6 months.  My granddad had an old school razor “like” this that probably lasted his lifetime. . .</li>
            <li> Cheaper than in stores and husband loves it</li>
            <li> I received it as a gift and wanted it as an inexpensive way to try shaving with a safety razor before spending a lot of money on a more upscale model. DE shaving is a skill that must be learned and it took me about a week to match my old 6 blade cartridge razors. It still takes slightly longer after two weeks, but the shave from this razor is much closer than I could ever get before and with much less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the reviews here say the razor will break earlier than expected. I can live with that because I plan on sticking with this type of shaving now that I know that it is superior to the cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made. The top flap came off completely and it nicked and scarred my face.</li>
            <li> I really like the razor.  Problem is it fell apart after two months.  The head of the razor won&#x27;t close all the way.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, not very well made just cheap junk in my opinion .</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave like advertised. My Mach 3 blows this out the water any day. You have to shave the same spot several times in order for it to shave off all the hair. At least I didn&#x27;t buy it off the tv and pay 2x as much for this garbage.</li>
            <li> Grandson&#x27;s love the razors.  Good product and in the long run a great value.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe anyone could rate this piece of garbage as even satisfactory. and the guy from pawn stars giving a testimonial leads one to think it does great and that is just false.  It is worthless as a shaver but nice case...</li>
            <li> I like it, but don&#x27;t like it as much</li>
            <li> My husband has been noticing thsi razor for some time now and has been wnating to try it, so, I ended up getting it for him this past V-Day and he loves it. All though, he was very nervous when he first tried it - it is pretty scary looking, a stright razor and all, but he loves it and finds that it gives him a closer shave. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> handle way to short, still not use to useing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Micro Touch Safety Razor for about three months now. I almost gave this product three stars, but just before writing this review, I decided to inspect my razor closer and noticed I could no longer open the top anymore (by twisting the handle) to replace the blades, which are all a little dull and rough by the way. I&#x27;m guessing this is due to rust build up on the inside. I had to use a pair of pliers to twist the top lids open (and cut myself twice doing it). I had read in the reviews where other customers complained about the same thing. I was hoping that was a rare fluke, but I guess not. Also, when this razor first arrived in the mail, I noticed a small chip in the silver plating on the neck, which was a little disappointing. I also noticed on the first day that one of the butterfly flaps (that&#x27;s what I call them), where the blade is installed, wouldn&#x27;t go all the way down. I sort of didn&#x27;t mind that, though, because it always helped me to know what side I had been using. After using one side for a long while, I would switch to the other freshly sharpened side. I had never used a safety razor before, other than playing with my dad&#x27;s safety razor when I was a boy, but I got the hang of it very quickly. You just have to be a little more gentle and careful. I think I nicked myself only about 3 or 4 times, since I&#x27;ve had it. I should also add that many have complained about the short handle, but I like the shorter handle because I was able to quickly switch the angle of the razor and move it around within my hand without a long handle getting in my way. Again, I wanted to give this razor three stars, but just couldn&#x27;t and can&#x27;t in good conscience recommend it to anyone. I will probably be looking for a slightly higher priced razor soon.</li>
            <li> I was looking to save on razors, I usually use the Mach 3 which gives good results, and never irritates my skin, after using this one blade razor, I felt like it took much more effort to shave, I wasn&#x27;t really sure if it was cutting anything, and it irritated the crap out of my skin after using it, I now feel that all the extra blades on Razors really do make a difference.</li>
            <li> I had to go back to my 5 blade razor. The TV commercial had me convinced I would get a better shave and save money but I cut myself badly several times. Maybe I needed more practice. Aint no body got time for that.</li>
            <li> I was tired of spending a lot of money for razor blades that have two or more blades. They do not shave any closer than a single blade razor like the one my Dad used.</li>
            <li> Go old school &amp; save money down the road .. What razors cost today the money you&#x27;ll save down road is well worth it</li>
            <li> works great i just wish the handle was longer  i think its kinda short 4 most guys</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only usedach 3&#x27;s, stuff like them prior to this. I picked it up on a clearance and love it.  So compared to your typical razors this is night and day better. I had one blade that right away wasn&#x27;t very good, not sure if it was in wrong or something but every other has been super sharp. I don&#x27;t get razor but, shave is faster, easy to rinse and clear the blade. I love it and would totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought one thinking I was updating,( from my 1945 Gillette). I have had it 10 months. It never really felt like it closed right from the start, and the guard was a bit off causing the blade to scrape.  Well I went to replace the blade and the butterfly controll broke, now it won&#x27;t stay closed. I found a way to contact the maker and the said tough try to find the person you bought it from.. Long story short not good quality, customer support of the maker is terrible! Don&#x27;t waste your money, spend the extra and buy a good one.</li>
            <li> ive been using this for over a month. its a great alternative to electric razors and cartridge disposables. the blades ive found for 8$ per 100. that&#x27;s 8 cents a refill and a great shave. no turning back after realizing this is the best shaving method ive ever found. didn&#x27;t hurt that this product was endorsed by a pawn star with a bald head. good buy I recommend it!</li>
            <li> works great and hopefully saves me money in the long run. blades seem to much cheaper than what i was using</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. This razor shaves close enough, but not close enough to leave me ingrown hairs like the multiple blade ones out there. I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews over the durability, it seems okay to me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through all of the normal razors: electric shavers, disposables, the Gillette cartridge razors, and this is the winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electric shavers didn&#x27;t get close and left a lot behind because of how my whiskers lay down. The disposables cut me to shreds. The Gillette cartridge razors did okay but cut me up and gave me in grown hairs. So I just didn&#x27;t shave very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor allows me to be detailed while using really minimal pressure so I I get the tricky whiskers without using extra force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also my wife approves, and she&#x27;s the picky one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t use it like a regular Gillette cartridge razor. If you just hack and slash, you&#x27;ll pay for it.</li>
            <li> Glad I finally broke down and tried it. I got tired of spending tons of money on the multiple blade replacements. I get about 10 to 15 shaves per blade. I had give a little blood when I first got the razor, but after about 2 weeks of sticking to it, it doesn&#x27;t take me any longer in the morning and I get a great shave at a great price. Just for the record I use a shave lotion that is water activated and not a lather. I noticed this razor gets so close I needed to re-apply the lather after a first pass, much better with the lotion.</li>
            <li> This razor is good looking and the blades are very sharp.  As soon as I learn what amount of pressure to use to keep from cutting myself and still get a good shave, I might be happier.  I also don&#x27;t think that the handle is long enough.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor!  He was tired of paying for the disposable&lt;br /&gt;razors or the inflated prices of replacement blades.  This gives him the&lt;br /&gt;closest shave he has ever had, short of a visit to the barber.  The razor&lt;br /&gt;is weighted well, the blades are easy to replace and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a safety razor because the refills on the 4 to 5 razor blades are really expensive. This model is nice, easy to load &amp; clean, &amp; the blades are really sharp. They are much sharper than the blades I have been using. With this razor, I just take my time when shaving &amp; let the weight of the razor do the work. I am not getting cuts &amp; scrapes like I was when I first started using it. Razor blades are so much cheaper with these models &amp; last a lot longer. They are well made &amp; good quality steel that will last a long time. So if you are looking for a better shave, at a much lower cost, try a safety razor. Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I now shave as close as my dad did! You don&#x27;t need 5 blades...men need to know how to shave with just one!</li>
            <li> First of all the stand won&#x27;t hold the razor.It keeps falling out.i&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the blades that came with the razor,but i have not gotten a smooth shave yet. when,i shave my neck,i have too go over,and over,and i still don&#x27;t get a clean shave. i went back to my old razor,and it made a world of difference on my face.Before i deep six it,i&#x27;m going to buy other blades,and see if that helps.if not it will go into the drawer with all the other razors,i bought over the years.i was looking forward to having a razor that would give me a clean shave.i guess it&#x27;s like all the other things,i purchased over the years,sight unseen.They just don&#x27;t work,i should have asked around to see if anyone else has had the same results as,i have.&amp;#34; Have a nice shave &amp;#34; dh</li>
            <li> Nice safety razor but does not give a very close shave.</li>
            <li> I debated whether to give this product three or four stars. It&#x27;s a fine DE safety razor. However, for a few dollars more you can get a good safety razor-- and good is always better than fine. My primary complaint is that the razor is so unaggressive. You wouldn&#x27;t expect a mass-marketed razor to be Muhle r41 aggressive, but this razor is incapable of giving a truly close shave (even with three or four passes.)    I appreciate MicroTouch bringing this razor to the market and helping revitalize DE shaving. However, I would ultimately steer a buyer toward a Merkur 34c, an Edwin Jagger DE89, or for the value conscious, a Maggard MR8.    I&#x27;m still glad to own this razor, but you can purchase a vastly superior DE safety razor for mere dollars more.</li>
            <li> The razor is cheaply made, scratches your face, and has a tendency to cut you. You can get a close shave, but only at the price of  damaging your skin. I used one of these years ago when I first started shaving and it did a much better job. This particular one is a cheaply made knock off of the original, and I do not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> my husband did not like,said it did&#x27;t cut well.was shipped on time</li>
            <li> Product works well, easy to use and keep clean and for the money I love it. Blades that came with it are good and the razor stand is a nice plus.</li>
            <li> It is what it is. I assumed the shaving head would be smaller. Just the handle is shorter.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these razors from my local grocery - it was on their &amp;#34;As Seen on TV&amp;#34; stand with other &amp;#34;TV&amp;#34; products. I was hoping for a good, close shave, but what I got was shear disappointment.The shave from this razor is not even as good as the cheap generic 2-blade disposable (the blue ones that you&#x27;ve all seen).Even with proper moisturizing, lathering and DE techniques I learned from watching Youtube videos, my face is still scraped, nicked and razor burned. So, I&#x27;m done with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since ordered a Merkur 34C, which I&#x27;m hoping will yield good results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit cheaply made but it works. I like the way the cut off whiskers or hairs move under the blade without getting stuck. It rinses easily. This package doesn&#x27;t have the travel case that the one on TV has. That was a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> Blades are not very sharp, so the shave is not close like what one is used to at a much higher cost, which leads me to believe the old adage, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;  ! :) Love the handle, blades are not sharp :(</li>
            <li> May work well on Rick Harrison&#x27;s head but I could shave better with a butter knife.</li>
            <li> not as good as advertised</li>
            <li> simplicity as it should be to get a shave.......the whole package including 100 blades was cheaper than buying the replacement blades (5) for the razor I was using..........should have thought of this sooner....!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product off of onerazor.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a total scam. The mechanism is poorly crafted, the knob that you turn to open and close the compartment gets rusty and there is no way to detach or clean device that controls the top part which opens and closes. You can clean the razor, but the device to hold the razor is poorly designed. On top of that, the shave takes triple the amount of time. So, you might think you save money, but you waste more time. Just use a multi-blade razor or a gillette alta II and clean and dry the razors really well. You can use a toothbrush to stroop the razor, mine have lasted months doing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the company charged me over $40 dollars between the product and shipping cost. To receive the item is $13.00 and to send back the item is $6.00. I spent almost $20 in shipping cost, all which is non-refundable. I have to dispute the charge with the credit card company I used to purchase the product. So, save your money and buy gillette and clean the razor, or buy into the dollar shave club or use dorco&#x27;s website to buy razors. This product is pure crap and the company that sells it is a total scam. They sell your credit card information to other companies, who try to send you gas cards and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even off amazon, this product is not worth 17.00 bucks.</li>
            <li> I have not purchased this exact product, but I have owned the same razor. It is an old Gillette patented design, but these days they are not made by Gillette.  What you see today are Chinese-made with cheap materials.  Mine broke in less than a year.  Do your homework, spend a few more dollars and buy a better razor.</li>
            <li> the razor works fine and the addition of the stand was an additional bonus.... the clamping mechanism for the blades seems a bit poorly designed since it does not close properly. nice tips on shaving techniques providing in brochure</li>
            <li> When I got it out of the package there was a little, round, silver tab that fell out of the packaging at first I couldn&#x27;t figure out what it was but I realized it was broken off from the bottom of the razor. No big deal. I used it anyway, it took some time to get used to but I liked it aside from a little razor burn. I used it for about 6 weeks before the head just fell off! I&#x27;m a little bummed but I guess you get what you pay for $15. It is true &amp;#34;they don&#x27;t make&#x27;em like they used too&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve seen some that lasted 30+ years. I don&#x27;t want to give it one star but I can&#x27;t give it 3 or 4 either. I&#x27;ll probably buy another one but a different brand as I wouldn&#x27;t feel confident in the quality or craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> The price of everything is getting higher. We&#x27;ve decided to cut back in all areas including researching new car insurance and many other areas. After trying this item I&#x27;m 100% satisfied and with the extra 50 blades I bought I&#x27;m shaving now for pennies a week. I always suggest just putting a little layer of personal oil on the blade. It makes the blades go much further. Can&#x27;t find a better deal and no you don&#x27;t need a razor with 4 or 5 blades.</li>
            <li> Just remember you&#x27;re not use a &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; blade razor so you need to be careful how you hold it. A couple tries and you&#x27;ll adjust. wish it were a little heavier. Way better than paying $17 for 3 razors!</li>
            <li> Blade is not adjustable, and the blade is fixed at an aggressive angle. Be careful.</li>
            <li> Great product, and work very well I would definitely recommend this product to all my friends and I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> You can buy a nice sturdy single blade razors from any beauty store like sallys etc. For about $10. I&#x27;ve had one for over a year and it&#x27;s great.  Also the blades are about $1.50 for a 12 pack... This is a scam. Not to mention you gotta pay shipping and handling. I saw the commercial and felt like telling you people the truth. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li> I only had mine for about 2 weeks and so far no probs. I bought mine going off of no reviews. And the first thing I notice when I open it was how it open and it should be oiled every so offten, so i put a couple drops down the top of the barrel. So with that said. For those who had it where it binds on them, what did y&#x27;all expect. If metal is exposed to water it rust. That&#x27;s a no brainer. And for those who cut them self obviously don&#x27;t know how to shave. I have used just one blade about 5 times and no nicks or cuts and that on my head. The razor is a lower end for safety razors but still better than cartridges. People need to understand that it take more finesse to use a DE or straight razor. I hope this is useful for some and that it does take take some know how to shave regardless if you are 20 or 65 yrs old. One tip, know how your hair grows. Every man should be able to shave without a mirror.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money is locked up after two weeks</li>
            <li> Microtouch One&#x27;s marketing makes a big deal about not needing more than one blade and how you&#x27;re throwing money away; it&#x27;s just bunk.  Modern razors are here for a reason - they work well.  The Microtouch One is 100 year old technology and it shaves like it.  It does not shave as close as my Mach 3 in the same amount of time - you can get there with the Microtouch if you&#x27;re willing to spend twice the time taking little tiny strokes, and I was a lot bloodier with the Microtouch than I&#x27;ve ever been with the Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Mach 3 for many years now and I get about 30 shaves out of each blade, shaving after I shower and using Pacific Shave Oil instead of cream/gel, bringing my grand total for blades per year to a whopping $24.00.  The delta between this and what I&#x27;d save with the Microtouch One is negligible, and the Mach 3 shaves closer, faster, and cleans easier, and is MUCH easier to dispose of the used bade assemblies than the Microtouch One.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference is like driving a 100 year old car versus a modern car.  The modern razor is economical enough, especially given the performance and convenience.  You can get there in Microtouch, eventually, and with a lot more fussing around and discomfort; if you&#x27;re into that, then the Microtouch is the razor for you.</li>
            <li> The best shave I have had in a long time. Easy to use safely. It is fun to shave again. Really. Far better than anything that I have tried with multiple blades. Also, very well made.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this razor at a local department store for my husband to use.  He really likes Pawn Stars and I thought it would be cool.  He tried it and did not care for it.  He said it did not give him as smooth a shave as a regular multi-bladed razor.  I was disappointed but decided to try it on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I approached the razor with some trepidation.  You see, as a child, I had an accident with my mother&#x27;s &amp;#34;safety razor.&amp;#34;  I nearly cut off one of my toes in an attempt to emulate my mother shaving.  I still have the scar 45 years later.  However, I tried to forget that and started shaving.  After I was done I was amazed!  This is possibly the closest smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this razor for two months now and have noted an added benefit.  My legs are usually full of scars and very itchy.  So I get scars from shaving and from scratching.  This has not happened with this razor.  My legs look and feel healthy.  I&#x27;m actually proud of my legs now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could I get the same result with another razor like it?  Maybe.  But I&#x27;m sticking with this one.  Also, I love the little stand it comes with.  Keeps the razor high and dry off the tub surface.  I would recommend this razor to my friends if they want a close, smooth, and scar free shave.</li>
            <li> The handle is very short and little, not like a normal long handle razor. Works thou</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these, one for my husband and another for one of my son. Since they were given to them as gifts they didn&#x27;t want to tell me the razors are a terrible product. I found out because I offered to buy one for another son and he told me his dad and brother hated them. It would seem they don&#x27;t work. You have to tug hard to get any kind of shave. They described it as the razor blades seem too narrow for the razor, almost like it didn&#x27;t overlap so there was no blade to shave with. They could not get a close or even shave with this product. I thought maybe it was the blade itself but they put the blade into a razor from the 1940&#x27;s and it worked wonderfully. I&#x27;m really disappointed and I wish they had been honest with me while I still had the packaging. I would have sent them back. They look good, appear to be made well, but they give a terrible shave. Both my husband and son went back to using disposable razors. I would look for a different razor if I were buying one today.</li>
            <li> Great razor, takes little practice but once you have the style of shaving down... You&#x27;ll do fine!</li>
            <li> Great product. Works as advertised</li>
            <li> It is a fake. 1/2 the weight of the real one. Fell apart loading the razor blade. JUNK, DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!😫😫😫</li>
            <li> Great shave fast shipping</li>
            <li> This is a decent razor at best. The construction is cheap. You get what you pay for. Overall it is a mild DE razor it gets the job done but if you pay a little more you can get a much better razor and a much better shave.</li>
            <li> Quality product with a great price!</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> I love this razor, I was so tired of paying the high prices for replacement blades for what ever multiblade razor I had. 3 blades, 4 blade, 5 blades, this one shaves better than anyone of those. My wife bought this one for me as a gift, I had mentioned that I had a razor like this when I was younger and really liked that one. The stand that comes with this is also nice to keep the razor on beside the sink.</li>
            <li> Not a very good item, does not do what it was advertised to do. I do not like it, would not advise anyone to buy it.</li>
            <li> This item is very poorly made of cheap materials. The blades on mine did not seat properly into the razor body and the mechanism that secures the blade was difficult to get closed. When closed, the blade did not seat properly and was unsafe to use. I returned the razor. I can&#x27;t believe Rick Harrison would endorse this. I would not put my name on this product, for any amount of money.</li>
            <li> I bought one. And it rusted so bad...so I bought another one and cant change out blades the head is broken in side......</li>
            <li> Cheaply made - too small. Returned it.</li>
            <li> Bought for my dad and he really like it, says it works great. Bought another for my son and he loves it too and razor blades are easier to find and cheaper. Will save you tons of money. Be careful when using though as they are VERY Sharp..never use sideways only up and down</li>
            <li> Very good quality and easy to use. Shave closer than any other razor I have ever used. Easy to clean. I read some bad reviews before buying it but more positive review so I bought this razor and I am happy with it so far..&lt;br /&gt;I am using it to shave my head and face. Works good on both.</li>
            <li> Good shave.  No need for expensive 6-blade razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently gone back to a safety razor after a long time using a multi blade razor. I&#x27;m happy so far, but I am still not sure about the quality of this razor, sorry Rick! It seems to be fairly well made, but as I inspect closely, I see some variations in the thickness of the blade bed arms. This shouldn&#x27;t be a problem as long as they are flat on the blade support surface. That would keep the blade &#x27;flat&#x27; against the inner side of the top. Not really flat, but in a plane, without twist or warp, which could cause the blade to nick or cut possibly. I was a little surprised that the handle seemed shorter than I remember on my old safety razor too, but again, it has been years since I used one, and maybe I have just forgotten. It does shave pretty well, and it will take several shaves for my face and my hands to adapt to a safety razor again.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for the cost.</li>
            <li> looking forward to use this razor, shave ok but to many nicks, waste my money, don&#x27;t buy, unless u want to cut yourself every shave</li>
            <li> I have used Gillette Sensor (and later, Mach 3) blades since I started shaving, 23 years ago.  They both do a great job, but the price of the Mach 3 blades has gotten out of control.  You&#x27;ll pay roughly $10.00 for 4 cartridges.  Disposable razors, such as Bics or Gillette Good News weren&#x27;t an option for me, as they always were rough on my face and caused a lot of irritation, afterwards.  So, I began to consider an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally, I was going to try a straight razor, but after realizing the maintanence (sharpening, stroping, etc.) they would require, I ruled them out.  Then I saw a commercial for this razor.  I saw it several times before I ordered it.  Finally, I took the plunge.  They had a special going on where you got the razor and 24 blades for $19.99.  Talk about a no-brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first shaving experience did not go so well.  I can really whip around and do a quick shave with the Mach 3, but not so with this razor.  I paid for it.  Razor bumps, nicks, and overall irritation for about 3 days.  Of course, I am used to shaving against the grain with the Mach 3, so that made it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, today, I tried it again, and I love it.  I can&#x27;t see myself going back to the Mach 3 or any other type of razor.  The trick with this razor is to take your time and don&#x27;t use very much pressure.  Shave with the grain, first, and then if you have to shave against the grain, re-lather and use short, gentle, upstrokes.  It takes some practice, but you will get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only gripe I have is that the handle is extremely short.  Not good for someone like me that has bigger hands.  A small inconvenience, though, for the quality of the shave you get.  If you are tired of paying out the whazzoo for cartridges and want a cost-effective alternative, this is your ticket.  It will take some getting used to, but it is worth it, trust me.</li>
            <li> It works almost as well as the expensive multi razor.  It might get better as my face gets used to it.  But it won&#x27;t take long before I&#x27;m saving loads of money by not buying those quintuple fancy-pants razors blade cartridges.</li>
            <li> I learned to shave using my dads schick razor years ago. I have never been happy with the throw away razors both the shave and having so much material to throw out. My wife says that since i started using this razor she&#x27;s noticed the difference. She says my skin looks smoother. One recomendation, don&#x27;t skimp and buy the cheap blades. They don&#x27;t last and might cause discomfort. Get the better blades.</li>
            <li> The quality of this razor is  much more than I expected.</li>
            <li> Only effective on low stubble &amp; difficult to control w/constant risk of slicing skin. I guess ok for those that shave everyday, but nowhere near what billed as.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor and so far i&#x27;m very pleased.  I&#x27;m not sure how other razors would be different, but this one gets the job done well.</li>
            <li> Very good razor for either beginners or novice shavers. Gets the job done and has your face feeling smooth as a fishes belly with in minutes.  Well built the blades that come with it will get you by. If you want a better shave with it go out and get some Feather blades to go alone with it. O do not forget a nick stick till you get use to those feathers they are sharp as sharp can be and they give this razor a new meaning to fresh clean shave</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband.  He has had trouble with so many of the disposable razors.  He is very satisfied with this razor.  I recommend it to anyone wanting a smooth close shave.</li>
            <li> Ever looking for the safest and most comfortable way to shave, I ordered a Microtouch One razor when I saw it advertised on TV. I should have done some research first because it turned out to be a mistake. My first observation has to do with quality. At the price of $19.95 and up I&#x27;d expect it to be at least good if not excellent. But close inspection of the item reveals a cheap rehash of an old classic, probably manufactured in China at bargain rates to the distributor (who no doubt is making a killing in the spread). My second point is that the bulky design makes it a difficult item to handle in some parts of the face, such us under the nose or where the neck joins the jaw. (These are places that a modern disposable easily navigates.) But the most dissatisfying issue with this product is the &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; factor. These types of razors were probably dubbed &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; razors when compared to a barber&#x27;s super sharp open switch blade, but they are not all that safe compared to today&#x27;s modern disposables or not so disposables. I shaved with the Microtouch three times (twice more than I really wanted to but wanted to give it a fair try) and finally conceded that I had been duped (ripped off). All three shaves were uncomfortable, worrisome (it always felt like there was too much razor blade exposed to the skin) and, in fact, I did cut myself once despite being careful not to. In short, there was nothing comfortable to using a Microtouch and I really do get much closer and more comfortable shaves from my disposables. I do not recommend the Microtouch product. Only those who are married to the idea of using a classic design, despite the discomfort and safety concerns, could enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> I have saved hundreds by using this</li>
            <li> I decided to try a safety razor for two reasons:  First, I thought I would get a closer shave and I would save money over time by using this razor instead of disposable razor, which is what I had been using for the last ten years.  This specific type of safety razor is not good.  I did not get a close shave at all.  The blade just does not get close enough to the skin to get rid of all my facial hair.  Maybe, I was not using the razor correctly, but it just was not working.  They say not to shave against the grain, but I needed to do that to get a closer shave.  Once I did all I could with the safety razor I finished the job by using a disposable razor, which gave me the close shave I had been use to.  Maybe its because I have a very heavy beard.  Maybe this razor only works for men with lighter facial hair.  Now, I am thinking about using a different brand of blade in the razor.  I am pretty sure that this razor is not representative of all safety razors, but this one did not do the job advertised.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to compromise quality when you purchase this wallet friendly Razor. Takes a few shaves to get used to using these classic razors, but once your comfortable, they provide a great shave at a fraction of the cost. Highly recommend to any budget conscious individual! Thanks</li>
            <li> I LIKE IT SHAVES CLEAN AND EASY TO CLEAN THE BLADES ARE CHEAPER THAN MACH 111S MY OLD DOUBLE EDGE IS 44 YRS OLD</li>
            <li> I guess there is a reason why they don&#x27;t shave with single blades anymore. Used it once and went back to my Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t recommend unless i want to see you bleeding.</li>
            <li> Works as promised does not really take much getting used to save lots of money will last a long time...</li>
            <li> Very nice razor never thought I would prefer one blade compared to 5 like I had on my Gillette razor</li>
            <li> I feel misled about this razor.  I felt I had no true control.  I cut my face up every time I used it.  I remembered my grandfather walking around with toilet paper stuck to his face after shaving to stop the bleeding.  I am not able to use this razor for the same reason.</li>
            <li> The razor is fine, but the blades need improving.  I&#x27;m afraid that I honestly couldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.  I am somewhat surprised, because I have always been  perfectly well satisfied with your merchandise.</li>
            <li> It had been many years since I used a single blade razor and it all came flooding back to me as to why I switched to the multiblade razors. It is so easy to cut yourself with this classic razor and the sharper the blade the more sevre the cut. The short handle is extremely difficult to hold and use. I was annoyed that the details in the advertizment did not mention blades included so I separately purchased a pack of blades, which are not returnable. To add insult to injury, they charged me over $5 to return the razor which I used only twice for very uncomfortable shaves. please do not buy this product, I strongly recommend against it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 64 and this is all we had as I grew up.&lt;br /&gt;I thought there might be a new twist but alas, it is the same old safety razor from the 1950&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to only use in a downward motion.&lt;br /&gt;Now who exactly only shaves in a downward motion. If you don&#x27;t use the razor in an upwards motion after the initial downward motion, then you miss a good portion of your beard.&lt;br /&gt;It is sharp! It is almost impossible to not nick yourself; especially when you ignore the instructions and use the razor in an upward motion to get to the difficult area of your face...like your chin, upper lip and lower lip.&lt;br /&gt;I belong to the Dollar Shave Club. And I had hoped I&#x27;d get a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;But I didn&#x27;t. The four or five blade cartridges are just fine and cheap. I pay $9 a month for four new blades shipped free.&lt;br /&gt;So I switched back to my Dollar Shave Club razor this morning and got a much easier, and quicker, shave than this anachronism of a thing.&lt;br /&gt;You can go into any pharmacy or Walmart and get the same safety razor for less than half what they are asking here.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a moderately difficult beard and lots of nooks and crannies, forget this and dial in the Dollar Shave Club.&lt;br /&gt;I have no affiliation with the DSC. It&#x27;s just a good product that is inexpensive and works.</li>
            <li> I love the close shave. No hair clogging the blade. Face is smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt. Excellent product for the money.</li>
            <li> Not bad I think most of the problems people are having is the blades that came with it aren&#x27;t good but no a big deal their lot of good blades you can buy on Amazon for a good price.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband, and he loves it.  He has a heavy beard and the disposable ones get clogged up and no way to clean, and he goes thru a ton of them.  THis razor you can open up and clean each time, and the blades stay sharp for a long time.  He loves it.</li>
            <li> I use to own one years ago and then everybody went to plastic razors. This type is much more superior&lt;br /&gt;than the plastic crap. I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> seems like a good shave when a person gets used to how much pressure one puts on the blade when closing the handle. To much pressure it doesn&#x27;t shave close enough, to little it strips your skin off like skinning a salmon wish it had a stop for the perfect tension on the blade. Will surely take some getting used to.4th shave and still workin at it.</li>
            <li> I love it. It is just what I need. Nothing like the closeness of a single edge shave, just like the old days, the way it should be and the way it should stay.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it.  Blades are inexpensive and easy to find.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Was skeptical  because &amp;#34;as-seen-on-tv&amp;#34;, but build is quality and nicely weighted.  Had a week with the best shaves using Van Der Hagen soap. Also used to shave my head with great results. .. Good bye Proglide!!!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how much my hubby loves this razor.  He only cut himself once, and got the hang of it pretty quickly.  He said it works better than any other razor he has tried, and would never go back.  So great, I was nervous about getting him something like this because men are so particular about these types of things... And they have every right to be, since they have to use it every day... on their face ;-)  So glad I grabbed this for a Father&#x27;s Day gift....</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my husband, and he loves it!</li>
            <li> Good quality razor. It is everything and more than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I like, but trying to give it a chance.</li>
            <li> This seems like a decently made DE razor. This is my first attempt at using these types of razor. I have nothing to compare it to but it seems to be ok so far. it is a better shave though compared to traditional razors</li>
            <li> I bought this razor due to I was looking for a better alternative to expensive multiblade razors. Overall the experience with this razor is enjoyable. The only negative is the Dorco brand blades that come with it. I found I get a far better shave using the Wilkinson blades. They are far superior! Also it pays to use a high quality shave soap like Blades Grim. Overall I love the solid weight and ease of blade change with this razor. I get a very close shave with this razor; but you must take your time. Go with the grain first then go against the grain. Your first few shaves may not be as smooth as you are used to with multiblade razors. This is due to a combination of learning the proper technique and allowing your face to &amp;#34;adjust&amp;#34; to the single blade shave. Over time your skin will become more accustomed to the single blade. Happy shaving!</li>
            <li> Junk razor. They screw you on the delivery charge.</li>
            <li> Got a very close comfortable shave, I would recommend it for anyone that needs to shave.</li>
            <li> Since I was use to using modern razors shaving my face and head.  Switching to this was a mistake.  It is heavy, causing me to make mistakes and cutting my face and head.  I switched back to my high price razor so I wouldn&#x27;t bleed to death.  I toss it and ate the loss.</li>
            <li> I have this piece of crap for 7 mouth it was working good until this morning when I had a hard time turning the handle to replace the blade the shaft inside sheared off and the head fell off. I called the company they said that they can&#x27;t do anything. Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive to normal skin, I used the Fushion 5 for a long time, then switched to the Hydro 5.  I loved the Hyrdo, but $30 a month is crazy for 4 blades.  I then when to Dollar Shave club and got their top of the line for $9 shipped to my door.  After 4 months my face began to get use to the lotion strict and break out.  I then bought the micro touch. Does a decent job. I switched my shave club to every other month.  I shave 2 a week with the shave club razor and 5 days with the micro touch.  In 4 months of shaving, I&#x27;ve only spent $35.  Great savings.    Edit, don&#x27;t keep this razor in the shower, it will corrode and break.</li>
            <li> Figured I&#x27;d shave this evening in case I nicked myself. Took a shower then immediately lathered up with a bar of moisturizing soap. Shaved carefully, slowly. Closest shave I&#x27;ve had in months and it removed my thicker neck stubble in one pass. Rubbed on some Brut aloe aftershave lotion and my face feels tingly clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this didn&#x27;t take longer, ultimately, than using a multi-blade disposable. Why? Because I wasn&#x27;t tapping it rigorously against the edge of the sink basin to dislodge the gunk after every stroke. That also means no gunk to rinse off the sink edge, no gunk splattered on the wall behind the sink by the tapping, and no more of the occasional disposable snapping off at the neck due to my vigorous attempts to dislodge the gunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product. Bought mine at a Walgreen down the street. Not going back to disposables.</li>
            <li> Great product. It is a little small but you do get a great shave from it.</li>
            <li> Did not do as well as Gillette throwaway I am going back to throwaway</li>
            <li> Blades were real cheaply made razor it self  seems work fine I would buy new ones</li>
            <li> I learned to shave with a razor like this . It does a good job and gives a shave as good as the Fusion I was using. I need to try some other blades as the ones included (Dorco) are of minimal quality and only give me about four uses. My old Gillette adjustable was better, but they are now collectables.</li>
            <li> I would just buy the bic single blade razors... 2 stars is because it is packaged nice, and looks cool in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very difficult to use as well, and not a smooth shave unless you cut yourself shaving...</li>
            <li> I never buy things off TV, but after suffering from male pattern baldness and having to shave my head every other day, I decided I would give this a shot. With the modern razors I had to go through about 2 every month and then to buy a new package cost me about 15 bucks! I will admit, I cut my head a few times (minor nicks), but after about 3 times shaving with this it got a lot better. I can honestly say, I am getting a better shave from this razor than the newer, more expensive models. Highly Recommend this.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor thinking I could save some money from not buying expensive Gillette Fusion Proglide blades.  I also thought that I could get a very close shave.  I used it for two weeks and didn&#x27;t have any issue with getting cuts or anything like that.  What I didn&#x27;t like was that I could not get a close shave.  And with not even getting a close shave I did seem to get the dreaded razor burn.  I&#x27;ll pony up the dough for the Proglide blades based on this and Dollar Shave club blades being mediocre as well.  I think the use of Dorco blades in both the Safety Razor and the Dollar Shave Club razors might be the common denominator here.</li>
            <li> Took a little get used to but wow it gives a close shave!</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and even though i hold it at a 45 degree angle, It still pulls and gets stuck on the hairs, I think it actually plucks more hairs than it shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would be better off trying to shave with a plastic spoon than with the one razor.</li>
            <li> An adjustment in shaving is needed (how you hold the razor and the weight) but it does the job well. I (female) have to be extra careful around knees and ankles, but it is a very smooth shave. I went this route because I wanted less waste...throwing away a small blade versus a large blade or whole disposable razor. I expect to use this for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a very good razor for the money. I have seen these sell for twice or more at other stores, websites.</li>
            <li> This is not like other \\&quot;celebrity\\&quot; endorsed products, this one really is as awesome as it&#x27;s claimed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin, so bad that I have to use Skintimate female shaving gel &amp; ladies razors. Anything below 4 blades tears my my skin up. I typically have too get 5 blades or 6 when I can find them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot, the endorsement did not influence my decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very shocked &amp; pleasantly surprised to say that this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will NOT regret this purchase!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of advice, although the razor does come with 12 replacement blades (a quick rinse after use is all you need. The blades last for multiple shaves) go ahead &amp; get the extra blades. I just bought 100 platinum coated blades for $8.50.</li>
            <li> This is my new &#x27;at home&#x27; shaver. After the first week, I tossed the junk &#x27;5 blade&#x27; disposable razors. The cost of feeding this is far less than $25+ for refills that only last a week. I only get 3-4 shave per blade, but at .10 per blade it&#x27;s still a vast drop in cost.  ..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money !!!!!</li>
            <li> its okay. hard for me to use</li>
            <li> I love this razor. I&#x27;ve used throwaway razors for years and never had a shave this close.  I&#x27;m sending one to my son for his 32nd birthday this weekend.</li>
            <li> Complete garbage. Hinge broke very first time I used it. Can&#x27;t believe Rick would put his name on this thing.</li>
            <li> Not like the safety razors of old. BIG disappointment!!!</li>
            <li> This is not something I would use or ever buy again. Definitely spend your money elsewhere. I have used disposables that work much better.</li>
            <li> It took a while to get used to. As others have pointed out you have to get out of the habit of pressing the razor against your skin. Once I figured that out I was fine with it. Unfortunately, one day I tried to open it to change the blade and the handle wouldn&#x27;t turn to open the top. I tried everything I could think of, including spraying some WD40 into the head of the razor, but it wouldn&#x27;t budge. I finally had to get two pair of pliers, one to grip the razor handle and one to turn the knob on the bottom, and the rod that runs through handle snapped when I tried turning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no clue what caused it to lock up like that. I kept the razor clean and up to that point I had only turned the knob with my finger tips. But now it&#x27;s totally useless.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this razor because it is the right size and the “heft” is nice.....&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the Chrome has bubbles in it and now the “clamshell” has distorted after a couple of weeks....&lt;br /&gt;The Vietnamese razor blades that came with it are very good, however.</li>
            <li> I like it, but I don&#x27;t love it. does not get as close as I thought it would, tried different blades, all seem to work the same.</li>
            <li> This razor was endorsed by Rick Harrison of Pawn Stars fame.  It is a piece of junk.  It is cheaply made and the opening-closing mechanism arrived non-operative. I would not recommend this razor for any reason.  Made in China, and I am extremely disappointed in it.  That said, the seller was very responsive in immediately refunding my money.  I just wonder if the seller has ever tried to use the products sold.</li>
            <li> Great......has a nice stand with it....has extra blades which is a plus..........</li>
            <li> I am not the only one reviewing this poorly, this cheap thing will rust or seize shut on you after just a month or two of use making it impossible to remove the blade, and it is impossible to use this thing without getting multiple nicks and cuts. save your money and buy something that actually works and lasts.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned.  As advertised.  Precise, close shave.  Let the razor do the shaving.  You just hold it.</li>
            <li> Just received the Micro Touch Clasdic Safety Razor, Chrome stand. .....but I have not used it because the 12 Precision Blades were not shipped with the Razor as described.. ..I will post later after I receive the razor blades and have used it : (</li>
            <li> good too get back old school shaving</li>
            <li> We figured for $20 why not try it? My Husband says its a pretty good razor, he has been using it for about a month and really likes it. Gets a good close shave but just has to be careful he doesn&#x27;t cut himself. Because it&#x27;s more of a involved process he uses it at home and a disposable at work. Might buy another so he can use it at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it works and is gonna save us some cash since the refills are cheap as heck.</li>
            <li> Woefully underwhelming shave - to put about as much of a positive spin on it as I can. With, across, or against the grain - didn&#x27;t matter. I ran my hands over my face after shaving and it felt like it did before I shaved. I had to check to see if there was a blade in side.</li>
            <li> When I read these Amazon reviews, I was skeptical and apprehensive. I decided to give it a try anyway, because the experience I had with my previous razor had not been great. That was because it took a long time to clean the old one. Usually I had to allow myself at least 30 minutes to clean it, running water and my fingers to get debris out. Cleaning the razor is very important to get a good shave and throwing it away just because it&#x27;s dirty is wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the Microtouch today from their website, so I was able to get the case with mirror. I just tried it and I can honestly say I love it! I read the instructions and took my time slowly. The length of the handle didn&#x27;t bother me, and the razor itself is steady and sturdy. Even though I took my time, it saved my shaving time by about 50%. Cleaning was fast and that is the best part of all. This is my first time using a traditional razor. It may be hard to believe, but I didn&#x27;t cut myself at all. The trick is to have patience and do it slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who has had a professional shave can appreciate this razor. I have had a traditional shave done by a barber and those kind of shaves were the best I ever had. Having had that, I gained a feel of the flow of shaving and I think that helped because I could feel it done right. Again this was my first time shaving with this razor and I didn&#x27;t cut myself.</li>
            <li> nice razor just wish the handle was a little bit longer put happy with it.the razor last longer than fusion</li>
            <li> Love the razor, I have bought others similar to it, just not at all the quality this one is.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed before the first shave with the other single edge razors, that the blade once put in, was not lined up the way it should be, not &amp;#34;equal&amp;#34; on both sides.&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the box with the new razor, that was the first thing I looked at.&lt;br /&gt;(Great) right out of the box and it is a quality razor.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t have to rush out to the emergency room with wads of toilet paper all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;Bought two!&lt;br /&gt;What kind of fool would keep buying the expensive razors with six or eight blades when you only need one.&lt;br /&gt;Great price also.........</li>
            <li> It is about the size of a disposable razor. The blades are only good if you shave everyday, If you don&#x27;t shave for a few days the blades don&#x27;t cut the hair very good.</li>
            <li> The the only way to go save you money and get a closer shave</li>
            <li> I gave this gift to my father for christmas, He has had some close calls with facial wounds due to the sharpness of the blade, but still screams praises from the rooftops about it.  Guess it does the trick, He loves it!</li>
            <li> Has saved me on blades.</li>
            <li> The razor works better then I thought it would. I have sensitive skin and it does a great job for me. I also can save on razor blades now.</li>
            <li> This razor is all it promised - it shaves smoother than any 4, 5, (or 12?) bladed razor. My husband is really happy with it, although he reports it takes a little practice to get the knack! It&#x27;s definitely a good choice!</li>
            <li> It does not work to good. Does not give a close shave. You have to go over and over same spot 5 times with a lot of pressure to make it cut. I am certain if you use this you will prove that the new style blades are worth the expensive price . This shaver is like a ford escort with a flat. New expensive razors are like Lotus racecar......The are a very good looking antique one that my dad taught me to shave with 50 years ago so I keep I keep it in the corner like industrial art. good luck</li>
            <li> Great starter set for those who want to get a closer shave</li>
            <li> Boyfriend loved it. He even thought it was so great he got one for his dad.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dad and he loves it. His only complaint is razors are so sharp bit likes n or much better than typical disposable razor. He likes the close shave.</li>
            <li> This product was great.  It is advertised as a single edged razor and that is exactly what it is.  Very old school and it works great.  Goodbye Mach3 replacement heads for 25$.</li>
            <li> Shaves as well as any other razor and it doesn&#x27;t cost as much as a full tank of gas every month.</li>
            <li> I used the 5 blade deal for years - so much wasted money. I love the quick release action so I can empty clumps easily and often.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shaves pretty close, very cost effective.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  So smooth! Worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> Works great just had to learn how to get back to the basics of shaving with a single blade, I don&#x27;t think I would ever go back to a specialty razor again. ! blade is all you really need.</li>
            <li> Excelente Product!! Just as described by seller!</li>
            <li> This was my first DE razor and I do kind of regret the purchase.  I don&#x27;t really care for the blades that come with it.  I bought some Feathers and like them a lot more.  I also bought the Edwin Jagger DE89 for like 13 dollars more than I paid for this one and it is twice if not three times the razor that this one is.      I like the 3 piece way better than the butterfly.  I guess for the chineese thing this is its fine but do yourself a favor and spend a few more dollars on a much higher quality product.  I would particularly recommend the EJ that I got or a Merkur HD.</li>
            <li> So I bought FOUR MICRO TOUCH ONE razors because their was a huge sale going on and I was excited. This product reminded me of my grandfather and how he always used the same metal razor. So I gave one to my man and I gave another to my Dad. Then I kept two for myself because I didn&#x27;t have anymore men in my life to give them to. I haven&#x27;t even had them three months and I went to change the blades, not one, but BOTH of the razors twist handles to open the top part of the razor, were stuck! I could not turn either one to open them. How is that possible?! I&#x27;m not even strong enough to close them tight enough to not be able to open them again! I was so frustrated in my own strength, thinking I can&#x27;t possibly be this weak that I decided to use my teeth. Big mistake. Now I have TWO chipped teeth. Thanks Micro Touch. I thought I&#x27;d finally have a razor I would not have to throw away every week. I was very wrong. I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this razor, works well, easy to clean, and best of all, cheap to use. Blades are pennies. Compare that to the multi-blade 4 dollars a change models!</li>
            <li> Very Good Razor.  Handle should be longer.</li>
            <li> Its a piece of junk! It does not give shape cleans. You try and try to go over spot and doesn&#x27;t shave clean. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone your better off with dollar shavers no lie!!! give you bumps on face and just horrible!! Don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> The razor is great but takes awhile to get used to, may have to go over already shaven areas to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with product quality and delivery.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with an electric for over 20 years, and just got tired of shaves which left me feeling like I hadn&#x27;t finished. So, I made the leap and went for the blade. Very happy that I did. I can not believe how close this shaves me. My girlfriend feels my face in the morning before I have shaved and says it feels like back when I used the electric razor AFTER I had shaved. Not difficult to learn to use. Have had it a week and no nicks yet. Just take your time and let the weight of the shaver do the work. Very happy I made the purchase. Also included are a dozen Dorco stainless steel blades. I am on my third and very satisfied with them.     I also bought the[[ASIN:B001A3HPT0 Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set (Soap, Bowl, Brush)]] to use with the razor. It is just great. Lots of fun lathering up each morning with the boar bristle brush and cup of shaving soap. It provides a nice lather that did a great job in softening my beard. I recommend this as an adjunct purchase.</li>
            <li> Used this for a few months. Worked ok while it did. Kept it clean and dry. Then one day it got hard to open it up. Then the next time i tried it was impossible. Ended up having to try and use some pliers to gently open it, that didnt work well, whole thing is busted. Called it but the warranty is only 30 days. I&#x27;m opting to go with a better made safety razor. Good as an introductory product, but not made to last.</li>
            <li> Poorly made safety razor, spend a little more money and get a Merkur.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for 60 years. I speak with experience. They say things were better in the old days. Well if you prefer the 1938 Willys over the present day cars, you&#x27;ll love this razor. The ergonomics of the modern day razor, in my hands, is so far superior to this razor that it outweighs&lt;br /&gt;the benefit of low cost.  I&#x27;m using this &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; razor as a knick knack on a display shelf.</li>
            <li> According to a few video reviews of the Microtouch One safety razor. It was described as a good beginner safety razor, with decent weight and quality to it. The one I got must of been an imitation because it didn&#x27;t come with the case the original Microtouch One is suppose to come with. It was light, flimsy and just felt cheap all around, not like described on video by different reviewers. I guess that is what you get for $20.  Do yourself a favor and get a Merkur 34C or something a little more expensive.</li>
            <li> love it.  cuts great. best type of razor made.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this! It took a few times of getting used to it, basically he says you use less pressure than the ones he used to use, but now he wouldn&#x27;t go back to the expensive ones he used to use, because this is much better. I also think it is the smoothest his face has ever been.</li>
            <li> Good old-fashioned razor.</li>
            <li> It does give a very clean shave, after my cuts heal up I have to get used to using it,but like I said once i heal up my face is very smooth!</li>
            <li> i will be returning this product ASAP. it is made very poorly. the holder fell off as soon as i went to put the blade in.  i know its under 20 dollars but this is unacceptable</li>
            <li> nice to go back to the old style razor. cuts real well</li>
            <li> Not as good as expected.</li>
            <li> needs to be more precision,each side cuts differently</li>
            <li> price was great.  still learning to use the product</li>
            <li> Dad loves it, very sharp.</li>
            <li> bought this for my husband and he loves it</li>
            <li> this was something my husband had seen and was requesting. When it arrived he used it the very next morning, declaring when he was done &amp;#34;now that&#x27;s what a smooth shave is suppose to be&amp;#34; So from his point of view it&#x27;s a winner</li>
            <li> Excellent. I&#x27;ll buy this again!</li>
            <li> After watching a TV commercial exposing the merits of the old fashion double edge razor as I had grown up shaving with, I decided to shun the expensive Gillette Mach razors and go back to the basics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now I know it has been 45 years since I had used a DE razor so I had to reeducate myself in my shaving techniques such as softening the bearded area by using soap and hot water.  Also shaving lightly with the grain letting the weight of the razor to glide down and capture all the bearded areas.  Also a light second shaving lightly against the grain was needed for a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; However due to the cheapness of this product several problems emerged to prevent a close, clean and bloodless shave.&lt;br /&gt;1. This razor is not an exact precision instrument.  It is not built on a slight angle to capture the beard without scraping.  Angled at 45 degrees it is a scrapper and with this razor being so light the blade drags against the skin and will cause nicks and cuts.  It is a bleeding razor.&lt;br /&gt;2. The razor after being used for about a month became hard to open and in fact I had to use pliers to open the butterfly blade opening.  Very cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;3. I gave this razor a good 2 months trial, but between the razor scraping and burns along with the use of a styptic pencil I could no longer stand the pain.  The shave was not that close!  Very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not easily giving up, I pursued my quest for a perfect shave and found it in purchasing the Merkur 34C which is quality built with a good weight and has a slight 30 degree angle and feels like a feather crossing your face and gives the closest shave that I have ever experienced.  For a few dollars more with German precision. you can have that perfect shave also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Micro Touch One is just a cheap imitation of a classic DE razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how people can review this piece of garbage favorably.  It simply doesn&#x27;t work worth a darn.  Stubble before you shave and stubble after!!  More, you CANNOT return it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go get a Harry&#x27;s razor.  They are inexpensive and work very well!!</li>
            <li> Great razor, just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Works well after you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember my father using one of these and after buying several multi blade razors only to find the blades discontinued at my local store I tried this and highly recommend it. You need to adjust to a learning curve as you need not apply as much pressure as with multi blade razors. Go slow and careful and you may need to shave twice but defiantly a good buy and the blades have been made forever. Happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great price -- Great Service !!!</li>
            <li> It does not give me a close shave. I will go back to my Gillette Sensor Excel. I am 71 years old. So, I have used this type of razor before.</li>
            <li> A great investment over the old disposable. I recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> ok if you want to shave twice in the morning. My my twin razor blows this old tech. away</li>
            <li> it was really inexpensive so what do you expect?</li>
            <li> Simple to use inexpensive razor.  Takes some getting used to, though, well worth the change from Mach razors.</li>
            <li> Works as Advertised !  I love a clean razor shave.  I&#x27;ve missed shaving this way like I  learned in the Navy!  Been using an electric shaver too long!</li>
            <li> Good but, no better than the one I had in the 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Terrible....frequent cuts...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get pulled in by Rick Harrison&#x27;s testimonial - I did and regret believing him!  Based on the TV ad I was excited to get what I believed would be the instrument for a very good, close, smooth shave.  WRONG!  I used the razor one time, according to directions, and threw it out.  The shave was rough, not uniform, not close yet I cut my neck which I never do with my multi blade razors.  My first razor ~50 years ago was the same type/style as the Microtouch. I didn&#x27;t realize until now how far razor technology has evolved - the Microtouch is an example of the primitive, painful, heavy, relatively ineffective early version.  If you like pain and want to live in the past, then buy this razor.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it. was a waste of money  sorry. Its does not do the job right  I cut my self every time</li>
            <li> Great shave, clean and smooth.  I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Added value is the cost savings, I won&#x27;t have to buy a blade for a year.</li>
            <li> I have brought this product a few weeks ago and I am thrilled by the quality of the shave that I have received.  What drew me to using this product was that I wanted to find a low cost solution to shaving.  I wanted to try it out and if it did not work out then I can always go back to disposible razors.  I did admit to getting a few small nicks when I first started using Micro Touch One but once I learned about shaving  while holding the blade in a 45 degree angle and to heat the blade just by running hot water on it then the many challenges I had at the beginning disappeared.  I was able to get  a close and confortable shave without nicks or scrapes moving forward.  I was able to get a free sample of the 5 blade razor called Hydro  when I bought Edge shaving  gel and I ended up throwing it out after one use because the Micro Touch One was that great in comparison.  Do not give up to soon after a few challenges because you could be missing out!</li>
            <li> Great to shave with just like old times</li>
            <li> I have this razor and used a few times but never really fell in love with it. If anyone would like to buy it off me, make me an offer.</li>
            <li> As described and works like a charm. My dad is in love with this thing.  Lol he is even trying to convince my brothers to buy it.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed, as the handle is too short.  I learned to shave with a razor like this many years ago. I ended up making a wooden extension for this product with made it more useable, but rendered the holder useless.</li>
            <li> learning curve to use it. not exactly like safety razor.</li>
            <li> Rick is correct.  1 blade gives a smoother shave</li>
            <li> The razor is fine, but the blades could stand much improvement.</li>
            <li> great product razor is very high quality shipping was faster than another site I sometimes use.Overall this is a great product only negative is the blades that came with the razor was not good I would recommend buying the persona 100 ct. blades they are the best in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Complete junk don&#x27;t wast your money</li>
            <li> Great Item my husband loves it. Price was Great!</li>
            <li> It is exactly what my husband has been looking for.</li>
            <li> Razor not adjustable...and blades are not the best</li>
            <li> razor blades were to cheap to shave my stepson very disappointing</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my dad.. it took forever to get. I could have spent the same amount of money and bought it at Walmart. But my dad loves it, so I&#x27;m happy with the order.</li>
            <li> Cheap piece of crap. Honestly speaking. Too short and made out of an old beer can. Go buy a original vintage one for $20 on eBay.</li>
            <li> Returned, did not think  quality was for me..</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He loves it! The disposables clog so quickly. With this one  open, rinse, store slightly open to dry. Simple!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m a female . I bought my husband a  Van Der Hagen razor a few months back, I tried it and loved it!!! This was slightly less expensive so I bought it and I feel like it&#x27;s harder to shave my legs with. I don&#x27;t think I could cut myself with it if I tried. Now a close shave for me.</li>
            <li> Use it for shaving my head and it&#x27;s great for that!</li>
            <li> Why five stars? This is to warn those of you who only read 5-star reviews! You&#x27;ll find a consistent pattern if you read the 1-star reviews first - which is, starts out great but then turns to crap. This razor isn&#x27;t worth your money or your time. I bought one for myself, used it for 5 months, and now the twist-to-open mechanism has locked up and I can&#x27;t replace razors. I bought one for my son a couple months after I bought mine because I really liked the whole wet shave thing. His completely fell apart. I still like DE razors, so after spending a little more time researching I decided to buy the Merkur 34C (just ordered today so no review). The pawn star should disassociate himself from this product. In closing I&#x27;d like to quote a line from a song by Neil Young: &amp;#34;Saw it on the tube, Bought it on the phone, Now you&#x27;re home alone, It&#x27;s a piece of crap!!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this razor; the head fell off when I first opened it to insert a razor.  Husband was able to get it back together; it does shave okay, but it pulls a lot.  We later bought a Van Der Hagen razor that was less expensive, sturdier, and gives a much better shave.</li>
            <li> handled very short hard to handle</li>
            <li> I got this razor for my boyfriend. So far he says it works well.</li>
            <li> Love it! Beats disposable razors!</li>
            <li> So, looking to change up my shaving routine, I thought I&#x27;d try a safety razor. I got this one because of it&#x27;s price, I&#x27;ve used other micro-touch products with success before, and because Rick Harrison is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave itself was great. I only got to use one blade however as the mechanism for locking the blade seized and I couldn&#x27;t open the razor for a replacement. This happened after about 6-7 shaves... two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll look into another safety razor as the shave, as I said, was quite good.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this razor. I like the stand too.</li>
            <li> Great cost-benefit,it was my first time with a safety razor and didn&#x27;t cut myself, ! nice finish and the razor stand are very handy and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this razor, I prefer the single blade setup over the overly priced blades with the unnecessary number of blades in them, because the blades rinse out so much easier and they&#x27;re like $7 for 100 blades. But this thing is very cheap,and apparently you can&#x27;t get it wet. It worked great for about 3 months, but then it rusted shut. I soaked the whole thing in wd-40 for a couple days, then was able to free it up with pliers. Than a week later one of the hinges broke while was shaving and it sliced up my face pretty good, so now it&#x27;s unusable.</li>
            <li> Did not shave close enough</li>
            <li> Hum. Rusted and is heaver than my $0.25 bic razors. Made me shave different. This may not apply to you, but the rust will.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dad for Father&#x27;s Day because he really wanted it. Turns out, it&#x27;s awesome! It&#x27;s sturdy, well-built, well-crafted, works great, and the shave is close and comfortable. Dad loves it! I was surprised because, well, look at it. Pawn Stars? As Seen On TV? But it&#x27;s actually a great buy!</li>
            <li> Husband did not feel it was a very good razor and it lays in the drawer.</li>
            <li> Its a nice looking razor but i get razor burns from it all the time. i keep going back to my 2 blade razor or my 4 blade razor. now its just a decoration in my Bathroom.LOL</li>
            <li> This is a good starter safety razor for beginners to wet shaving. There isn&#x27;t as much blade exposure as I&#x27;d like, but this definitely gets the job done. I got a very nice, close shave off of this one razor versus the three and four blade setups from other companies that way overcharge for blades (which is why I was drawn to safety razor shaving in the first place).</li>
            <li> the shaver dose&#x27;t work as they said it would no</li>
            <li> Not for those with soft/sensitive skin (my youngest boy had more toilet paper corners on his face after using product for the first time).</li>
            <li> Still getting use 2 it. Always used disposable razors. This is a big improvement over disposables. Still using the 1st. blade that&lt;br /&gt;came w/the package.</li>
            <li> Cheap but not as good as I would have expected from Amazon. This product is far below your standard. Shame</li>
            <li> Took a little bit longer than I expected to figure out how to use it, but now I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Love it! Solid design and does not nick or cut! Buy it!</li>
            <li> Best Christmas present ever!  My husband loves it!  Uses it daily. Blade is really good too. In 3 months ever only on his 2nd blade!</li>
            <li> Works great but the blades it comes worh are cheap I recommend buying some nice blades if your an experienced shaver.</li>
            <li> For the money, this is a very good razor. I was skeptical but it works great</li>
            <li> Have only used it 3-4 days - still haven&#x27;t found it all as good as advertised. In fact, i am very disappointed with the product - sure glad I didn&#x27;t order any extra blades as they might have been a waste of addition dollars!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as nice as the advertised pitch</li>
            <li> Boy, is this nice.  Great appearance and saving on blades.  I was surprised at how thin those blades are.  It works great.</li>
            <li> Awesome I save about $100 a month by using this razor shave is just as close as the 3-5 blade rip offs out there.</li>
            <li> Good razor bad advertising rick harrison also known as homer Simpson and the whole family looks like the Simpson family</li>
            <li> I think I like it.  I&#x27;m not really sure yet.  Better than the disposables I&#x27;ve been using.  Came early which was nice.</li>
            <li> Wanted something that would give me a great shave and that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank. Multi blade shavers way too expensive. This shaves as good as anything ive used before. With the platinum double edged blades I get a super close shave. I shave dry and ive had no issues with nicking or shaving bumps after. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking to save money and not compromise on close shave.</li>
            <li> I wanted the old version of razors like my dad used to use.  These new razors require you to shave every day to be effective but don&#x27;t do so well with a longer, thick growth.  I found this razor not only gave me a clean shave, it was nice and easy on my face.  It did not nick the skin like the old version used to do on my face. I would recommend this to anyone tired of the new high priced multi blade razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this razor a few times since my first review.  I would like to point out that it will nick the face but just a little.  It&#x27;s still a very good razor and a clean shave.  I would still recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend had wanted a safety razor for a long time but while the blades are easy to find in stores the handle itself was not. This was the only one I could find in stores so I looked it up here, found it at a much better price and bought it. My boyfriend LOVES it! He&#x27;s never had such a close shave and his skin is baby soft after use. I was a bit leary about buying something put out by the Pawn Stars but to my surprise it&#x27;s actually very well built and looks nice in its stand. Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> It takes some time to learn how to use it but works really well</li>
            <li> Not the quality I expected, not a good close shave,,,,,  disappointed</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH 5 CENTS!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. He loves it. He did buy other blades to test out what he likes best but this is built well and easy to clean. It&#x27;s still super shinny and my favorite part is that when he shaves it lasts longer than the other store razors.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it - he says it doesn&#x27;t pull when shaving and left his face baby bottom smooth.  Although some reviews said it was easier to cut yourself, he was careful and had no issues - happy husband, happy wife!</li>
            <li> Got it for my husband. He always complained about the multi blade disposables. Seems to like it!</li>
            <li> poorly made,not a quality product.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Glad I tried a single razor, I love it</li>
            <li> It took some getting use to a single blade razor again. The shave was very smooth compared to the multi-blade razors I had been using. The only downside I noticed was when I went to clean the razor. The covers on top were loose and did not want to close easily after I had cleaned the blade.</li>
            <li> Love the old razor, Shaving made easy nice close shaves</li>
            <li> I kept trying to get my boyfriend to shave on a consistent basis and it was this razor that did the trick! he loves it and we travel a lot so it is small and easy to pack</li>
            <li> it was a present for my husband, he wanted one since the first time he had seen it advertised.&lt;br /&gt;He just loves it, he never complains about the close shave he gets.</li>
            <li> My wife got this for me for my birthday.  It is phenomonal!  I have never had a better shave with any razor.  I love my wife for this one!!</li>
            <li> So nice to get a really close shave. I almost forgot what a decent razor is supposed to perform like. My only suggestion would be for  the handle to be longer.that&#x27;</li>
            <li> It has only one side that is sharp, So to use one blade, you have to open it up and turn the blade around. The angle is not right for the best shave. Get the Feather Safety Razor; it is outstanding</li>
            <li> All I can say is don&#x27;t do it. It&#x27;s a waste of money. The blades are cheap and rust quickly. I was only able to get a few shaves out of one blade, and when I did I would nick myself more often than not. This was after 6 months of trying to use it. So I just went back to the trusty old gillett sensor. Simple, two blades, long lasting, just all around better than the single blade setup. I now feel I know the reason the industry went away from shavers like this, they are old technology and really don&#x27;t work all that well.</li>
            <li> I love this Classic shaver!!!  The blades are very reasonable &amp; last for many shaves.  It takes a little getting use to as I was used to the mach 3 with rotating head.  I find that I need to lather twice to get as close a shave as the mach 3 does but for the savings of the blades I am very pleased with the purchase.  Should have bought one years ago!!!</li>
            <li> the blade extends past side of razor cover leaving a sharp edge that will cut you-like lower part of ear-my husband cut himself twice before we sent it back-bad design</li>
            <li> Wish this was made with higher quality stainless instead of plastic. Hopefully it will hold up to repeated use.</li>
            <li> My husband has such sensitive skin so buying him a very good razor is important!  He said this razor gives a better result them any razor he has bought to date and it doesn&#x27;t cause his skin to get terribly red like all the others he has tried.  We both love the fact that it is a hell of a lot cheaper to get the blades then it is to buy disposable razors!</li>
            <li> Right up to my expatiations of the product. I might hint a design change. As you know it is a double edge shaver. One side should be marked. That way you can shave with one side on the even days, and then you can shave on the unmarked side ion the even days. This way you would have an even balanced way of wearing both sides of the blade evenly. As soon as I find my diamond stales, I will mark one side of the double sided blade...</li>
            <li> Anyone that says this old single-blade &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; razor will give you a shave as good as a multi-blade razor is full of baloney! We could only hope:(</li>
            <li> Not very well designed closing flaps hang and blade does not seat well</li>
            <li> I thought this razor would be great, but it&#x27;s not. Dont&#x27; waste your money. It was not smooth, cut up my husbands face terribly. We would not recommend this razor to anyone. It&#x27;s too bad cause we really expected more.</li>
            <li> I personally didn&#x27;t get any cuts or scrapes, which I think is an issue with the speed in which you shave, but these razors just don&#x27;t get close enough for me.  I will not be using them again in the future.</li>
            <li> great shave, very sharp blades</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband and he looked bed it. It saves so much money monthly and it does a clean shave.</li>
            <li> My husband got this razor as a Christmas gift. He already had purchased a Edwin Jagger safety razor about 6 months earlier and has for quite some time been familiar with the technique. This razor was a disappointment. Using the same blades that he used in the EJ, this razor was much rougher on his face and left numerous lacerations, where the EJ did not. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more for one of the German models before you give up on the idea of double edged shaving. With the right razor and blades, plus some learning time, the results are everything people claim. This is neither the right razor nor blades.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my husband so actually he&#x27;s the one who doesn&#x27;t like it. He took his time to get comfortable with the razor as the instructions direct but he&#x27;s not loving it as the instructions said he would. He does not get as close a shave as he&#x27;s used to getting. Each shave produces half a dozen nicks and cuts. He is a traditionalist so he liked the idea of using a retro razor and really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> It reminds me why I switched from the single edge razor 50 years ago  The shaver has no flexibility the newer ones have.  It does not give a close shave because of it.</li>
            <li> this razor was awesome and very affordable to use</li>
            <li> Great item! Husband loves it</li>
            <li> like it, your face may need to get used to it after a while.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my dad for Christmas and h likd it but I don&#x27;t know much about razors.</li>
            <li> This razor was received as a gift. I have wet-shaved for years, beginning with a similar unit which was lost. Throw away&#x27;s were then used, but I was desirous of another early style safety razor. First, order some Personna or other quality blades when you order the razor. You will not like the shave from the blades included. I also find, for me, the shaving brush and soap combination are preferable to the aerosol canned variety. As others have said, let the blade do the work, these are sharp and do not need much if any pressure. Take your time. Rushing a shave with these can cause a nick or two. My razor centers the blades well, and rinses cleanly. I noticed complaints of misalignment, but this one shaves as well on one side as the other. Time will tell, but so far, I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> This is a good shaver and a great alternative to expensive disposables. The trick is to shave slowly and carefully and use good shaving cream/gel. I get as good a shave, if not better. I wish it wasn&#x27;t made in China though.</li>
            <li> it don&#x27;t shave close enough</li>
            <li> A litte bit small in my large hands, but it provides a great shave! Good quality build, and extremely cheap! I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now and I&#x27;ve only used a couple blades. I used to use Mach III and believe me, I never will again. This razor will pay for it&#x27;s self in a couple months with how cheap the blades are and the shave is just as good. I can&#x27;t imagine that it won&#x27;t last for years considering how it&#x27;s built so for me it&#x27;s a no brainer. A little advice though, shave slow and thoughtfully until you are used to it. It will cut the **** out of your face if you are careless and have no experience with one of these:P However now that I&#x27;ve had some practice, I can now shave almost as fast as with the Mach. I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> just like old fashion ones. Easy to nick  your skin.</li>
            <li> Honestly not bad!  I was skeptical from the low price, but these actually work very well and are extremely easy to clean out in the sink.  Has a very expensive feel to them and blade refills are cheap</li>
            <li> My husband really loves this razor and we are saving money not buying disposable razors!</li>
            <li> My husband wanted this and this was the best price.</li>
            <li> This product does not work I entered up throwing in the trash.  Don&#x27;t order this unless you have a very very light beard. Medium to heavy beards you have to shave three times to get the hair off your neck and your cheeks.</li>
            <li> Got some learning to due with this one</li>
            <li> razor works great, a must buy if your tired of being ripped off by purchasing expensive razor blades.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband.  He didn&#x27;t like it at all.  It was not a smooth shave.  He had to repeatedly shave the same area, leaving him with razor burn.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I originally gave this a 5 STAR review, but now after 5 months I need to change it to 1 STAR.  The handle has been difficult to turn for over a month now... and this morning part of the handle fell off.  Too bad, because I really liked it... gave me a good shave.  But the construction quality just isn&#x27;t there.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> not sharp enoght it will cut you</li>
            <li> Love it, gives a better shave than a 4blade disposable,  refill blades are cheap . Win win</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because he had been wanting to try it. He hates it. It doesn&#x27;t give a good shave and he says it&#x27;s awkward to use.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these the other day at the local pharmacy and was a little skeptical and hesitant.  I&#x27;m ugly enough as it is and I was afraid I would be adding insult to injury...or perhaps injury to insult with this razor. But, alas, I was enthralled with the ease of use and the closeness of the shave.  I&#x27;m able to shave closely around my pencil thin mustache for that tailored nostalgic look.  I feel like I could give George Clooney a run for his money in the good looks department (I was going to say Clark Gable but he&#x27;s no longer shaving).  I loved this package so much I just bought another one to be shipped to my brother in Missouri.  You definitely have to take your time and practice with this little piece.  If you are rushing to beat the clock when shaving this is NOT the razor for you, but on the other hand when you arrive late for work your boss will say, &amp;#34;Hey, you are late!  But man, what a nice shave!!&amp;#34; Seriously,  Great product and I&#x27;m glad I own it!</li>
            <li> Great razor and I&#x27;m 21. They advertise this as a grandpa razor but I bought it because of how simple and easy it is to clean and I love it.</li>
            <li> Will like it fine once I get use to it. Have used disposable razors for a long time.</li>
            <li> like it, don&#x27;t love it. make nicks in my skin every few times I use it. still getting use to it, but when all the blades are used up, I will inevitably switch back to store bought multiple blades. single blade is not for everyone</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as advertised wouldn&#x27;t buy again !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Whatever attraction the ritualistic acts of classical shaving used to hold for me, after a few months scalping myself with this razor, those feelings of spiritual unification with times past are long gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe Rick Harrison has developed a methodology for shaving his head but as far as I’m concerned once I get to the area where I kind of remember having a widow’s peak (when I didn’t get a nice sharp line) it’s time to put this thing on the sink and get a useful mach type razor out of the cabinet. Some users might prefer the cost savings associated with using double edge blades in lieu of the purchase of extremely over- priced multi-blade cartridges required by most modern razors. My dalliances with this razor confirmed I’m not one of them, nor am I willing to allocate the time required to use this one as compared to zipping along with the higher priced cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the bearded surface areas are concerned, this system works okay although I find I have to make several more passes than I ever have to with the cartridge type razor. The handle of this model is also much shorter than I would prefer, obligating me to hold it just under the head to get both the amount of pressure and angle right. For head shaving, the shorter length of the handle has proven to be entirely unacceptable.</li>
            <li> I liked the price and the fact that it&#x27;s not disposable, but it tears up my legs!!!  Be wary, ladies-- this one might just have to be for the guys.</li>
