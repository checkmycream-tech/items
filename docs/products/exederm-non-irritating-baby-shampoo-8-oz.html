            <li>It suds nicely.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for two of my babies so far and it has been great!  </li>

            <li>It rinses easily which I love and is very gentle!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to purchase this shampoo because it wasn&#x27;t tear free, but my son&#x27;s eczema was getting out of control.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the money!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even started using the Exederm soap because I have been so dry this winter, and it has worked great for me.    </li>
            <li>All the other products sold at large retail stores have sodium lauryl sulfate which my skin is incredibly allergic to.</li>
            <li>For this condition, I&#x27;ve found Exederm to be a better solution than the usual (and perfectly good) brands of baby shampoo.</li>
            <li>Hair is soft, clean, and flake free.</li>
            <li>I have discovered that this shampoo is as good as Free and Clear and a tad better than California Baby Shampoo for delicate skin and hypersensitive skin conditions.</li>
            <li>this was the first winter he had it in his hair.  </li>
            <li>Thanks seller/God bless!</li>
            <li>It really calms an itchy scalp for a baby!</li>
            <li>As a shampoo it certainly cleaned my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered a second bottle of this shampoo because it seems to be gentle, is easy to rinse out of her hair and does not irritate my daughter&#x27;s skin/aggravate her eczema.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It works very well for cleaning and lacks a fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shampoo cleans her hair very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Since I started using this product, she doesn&#x27;t scratch as much.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping this would help with my irritated scalp (never diagnosed) but really didn&#x27;t make any difference.  </li>
            <li>Now, I am beginning to see a real improvement in his scalp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update, update again:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using almost the whole bottle now, my son&#x27;s eczema on his scalp is not improving.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really helped him reduce the irritation to his scalp.  </li>
            <li>He still scratches his head, but he no longer digs his nail into his scalp and he is a much happier baby.</li>
            <li>All other sensitive shampoos have just not worked for my daughter who has eczema, but this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Am switching to a Mustela product as other reviewers seem to love that.</li>
            <li>The product is more liquid-like than commercial shampoos so be prepared to use a lot (a good palm sized amount) to get a good lather if you have been especially dirty the day you are washing your hair with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>My babies have pretty sensitive skin early on and this wash stopped the break outs and redness.  </li>
            <li>Not only is he not scratching as much, but the rash has all but&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised stores like Walmart or Target don&#x27;t carry it...</li>
            <li>and we really haven&#x27;t had a big breakout since that time.</li>
            <li>My son developed it when he was 4 months old, everything we tried didn&#x27;t help his flare ups.</li>
            <li>It did not work as well for my sensitive skin as I had hoped but</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than the higher price, I totally love this shampoo because it doesn&#x27;t have chemical ingredients that negatively over dries my skin!!</li>
            <li>It is mild with limited extra chemicals.</li>
            <li>If I had known that the list was incomplete, I would have purchased the larger adult size.</li>
            <li>I bought this specifically for the short ingredients list to treat scalp eczema on my 6 year old niece and to find that they are misrepresenting themselves will effect my choices in the future.</li>

            <li> I couldn&#x27;t order off of amazon because i live in Alaska, which is ridiculous because i live closer to Seattle!</li>
            <li> Left my scalp feeling very dry.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the product is that it leaves her scaple very dry after so you must apply some oil to keep mositure on the scaple and hair.</li>
            <li> Anyway, his scalp is dry and flaky -- severe dandruff -- and he scratches scabs into it.</li>
            <li> I actually wrote a review on this product rating it at 3 stars having only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> a few have come back thanking me.    </li>
            <li> And not much seemed to have worked, so I ordered a lot of the&lt;br /&gt;Exederm products.</li>
            <li> not much has lived up to my needs.  </li>
            <li> ever since we started using this shampoo, no more dry, flaky scalp!!</li>
            <li> Wish it was a bit cheaper, but at least a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Soothing and less harsh on skin.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate little ones skin1</li>
            <li> Everything was making my little one&#x27;s eczema flare up</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a little upset that the ingredients list is sorely incomplete.</li>
            <li> 4 stars only because the price for this is very expensive relative to the bottle size given.</li>
            <li> It has no real scent and is thin in texture so you can have a tendency to use a lot.</li>
            <li> The main eczema place is still there, but his eczema is quite vicious and requires steroid cream year round...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything to treat the eczema that exists but perhaps it does prevent it from getting worse.</li>
            <li> There must be something wrong here.  </li>
            <li> WORST EXPERIENCE EVER</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> love this product! It actually does what it says. Does not irritate little ones skin1 Wonderful product</li>
            <li> I have discovered that this shampoo is as good as Free and Clear and a tad better than California Baby Shampoo for delicate skin and hypersensitive skin conditions.</li>
            <li> 4 stars only because the price for this is very expensive relative to the bottle size given. The product is more liquid-like than commercial shampoos so be prepared to use a lot (a good palm sized amount) to get a good lather if you have been especially dirty the day you are washing your hair with this shampoo. Otherwise a simple two teaspoon amount would suffice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the higher price, I totally love this shampoo because it doesn&#x27;t have chemical ingredients that negatively over dries my skin!! All the other products sold at large retail stores have sodium lauryl sulfate which my skin is incredibly allergic to. It also doesn&#x27;t have paraben, fragrance, no dyes, no colors, etc.! The list goes on as shown on their bottle and website. I have been using this shampoo for 6 months now and my scalp skin and body skin has been happier and better ever since!!</li>
            <li> Has worked great to clear up my toddler&#x27;s scalp.</li>
            <li> *WARNING*  this product burned both my son and I.    When I tried to contact their customer service at their location in Basking Ridge, NJ (973) 615-1739 no one answered after repeated calls after 9:30 on a Tuesday morning and no one returned my calls.      I&#x27;ve used many many creams and lotions for eczema and I have NEVER had any sort of reaction like this.  There must be something wrong here.  It literally is still burning after I washed myself and my son off.    WORST EXPERIENCE EVER</li>
            <li> Everything was making my little one&#x27;s eczema flare up and she was scratching all the time.  I discovered Exederm and it stopped.  I&#x27;ve told all my friends with children about it and a few have come back thanking me.    I&#x27;ve even started using the Exederm soap because I have been so dry this winter, and it has worked great for me.    I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Been suffering from eczema for most of my life. As a lifeguard, I spend a lot of time around the pool and chlorine/chemicals flares my eczema symptoms. I have always struggled to find shampoo product that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and this was the solution. It works very well for cleaning and lacks a fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue was it left my hair feeling frizzy, but the solution is the conditioner which also worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for two of my babies so far and it has been great!  My babies have pretty sensitive skin early on and this wash stopped the break outs and redness.  It rinses easily which I love and is very gentle!</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking baby shampoo would be the gentlest possible.  No so for me.  Left my scalp feeling very dry.</li>
            <li> My daughter has ezcema and helped alleviate her itchy scalp. The shampoo cleans her hair very well. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> For my persistent grown-up sebborheic dermatitis, my doctor recommended alternating prescription strength Nizoral with baby shampoo.  Exederm is perfect for this.  I find that it is truly non-irritating, non-drying and leaves my hair looking and feeling nice.  For this condition, I&#x27;ve found Exederm to be a better solution than the usual (and perfectly good) brands of baby shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a second bottle of this shampoo because it seems to be gentle, is easy to rinse out of her hair and does not irritate my daughter&#x27;s skin/aggravate her eczema.  So far so good!  Wish it was a bit cheaper, but at least a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My daughter has had dry, flaky scalp issues since she was about 8 months old...chunks of skin would get combed out of her hair every time she had a bath...ever since we started using this shampoo, no more dry, flaky scalp!! This shampoo has been a true, healing God-send!</li>
            <li> my son has battled eczema for years. this was the first winter he had it in his hair.  it&#x27;s gone, but now we just use this all the time. see no reason not to.  good stuff</li>
            <li> Soothing and less harsh on skin. Works as described. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Excellent for infant with moderate eczema.  Hair is soft, clean, and flake free.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good shampoo for my daughter&#x27;s excema and this product is great! She has ezcema in her hair and scratches a lot.  Since I started using this product, she doesn&#x27;t scratch as much.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the product is that it leaves her scaple very dry after so you must apply some oil to keep mositure on the scaple and hair.</li>
            <li> My grandson has dermatitis, from head to toe. And not much seemed to have worked, so I ordered a lot of the&lt;br /&gt;Exederm products. She was so &amp;#34;ecstatic&amp;#34;, she cried! Not only is he not scratching as much, but the rash has all but&lt;br /&gt;DISAPPEARED! Thanks seller/God bless!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would help with my irritated scalp (never diagnosed) but really didn&#x27;t make any difference.  As a shampoo it certainly cleaned my hair.</li>
            <li> It really calms an itchy scalp for a baby! Absolutely worth the money! I&#x27;m surprised stores like Walmart or Target don&#x27;t carry it...</li>
            <li> I actually wrote a review on this product rating it at 3 stars having only used it a few times. Now, I am beginning to see a real improvement in his scalp. The main eczema place is still there, but his eczema is quite vicious and requires steroid cream year round... I started using this as his bath soap too for his skin and we really haven&#x27;t had a big breakout since that time. We pair with Johnson&#x27;s baby oil which seems to help keep the moisture in quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, update again:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using almost the whole bottle now, my son&#x27;s eczema on his scalp is not improving. I thought it was for a bit, but I don&#x27;t think that had anything to do with this product. It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything to treat the eczema that exists but perhaps it does prevent it from getting worse. Anyway, his scalp is dry and flaky -- severe dandruff -- and he scratches scabs into it. Am switching to a Mustela product as other reviewers seem to love that.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product for those who suffer with eczema. My son developed it when he was 4 months old, everything we tried didn&#x27;t help his flare ups. Even the oinment the doctor gave us didn&#x27;t help any. Only thing that sucked was that it took almost a month to get here! I couldn&#x27;t order off of amazon because i live in Alaska, which is ridiculous because i live closer to Seattle! Amazing product, but snail mail for me</li>
            <li> All other sensitive shampoos have just not worked for my daughter who has eczema, but this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I had no probloms with my daughter&#x27;s excema using this shampoo. It has no real scent and is thin in texture so you can have a tendency to use a lot. It suds nicely.</li>
            <li> Excellent service as well as the product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten to use it yet but I&#x27;m a little upset that the ingredients list is sorely incomplete. I bought this specifically for the short ingredients list to treat scalp eczema on my 6 year old niece and to find that they are misrepresenting themselves will effect my choices in the future. If I had known that the list was incomplete, I would have purchased the larger adult size.</li>
            <li> Works great for my 2 year old daughter who has ezcema</li>
            <li> It did not work as well for my sensitive skin as I had hoped but not much has lived up to my needs.  It is mild with limited extra chemicals.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this shampoo because it wasn&#x27;t tear free, but my son&#x27;s eczema was getting out of control.  This shampoo really helped him reduce the irritation to his scalp.  This along with the medication his dermatologist prescribed to him have made him stop drawing blood on his scalp.  He still scratches his head, but he no longer digs his nail into his scalp and he is a much happier baby.</li>
