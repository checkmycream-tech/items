    <ol>
            <li>Great stuff!</li>
            <li>Awesome for under eye discoloration!</li>
            <li>Feels good on under eye skin but as yet I see no difference!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great under eye boost</li>
            <li>this feels great putting it on.</li>
            <li>so maybe it&#x27;s working great</li>
            <li>Product is great.</li>
            <li>Great product, great price</li>
            <li>Simply amazing!</li>
            <li>this might just be the perfect and easy to use fixer.  </li>
            <li>the roll on its good, but no &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; my  eyes and</li>
            <li>Nivea&#x27;s Eye Cream for Men originally came out with a dispenser than placed an appropriate amount on the perfect applicator - - a man&#x27;s FINGER!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked nivea.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly effective.  </li>
            <li>Feels nice going on, the ball-bearing applicator is kind of cool, but also can plug up.</li>
            <li>As always, on time &amp; accurate !</li>
            <li>I sure wish I didn&#x27;t have this reaction because I&#x27;m showing a lot of age around my eyes.</li>
            <li>have not seen any visible difference, but ift feels 100% better.  </li>
            <li>You can do WAY better than this product.</li>
            <li>sure what to expect</li>
            <li>I wish they had more men&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>It can leave skin looking shiny which draws more attention if you ask me.  </li>
            <li>but I guess I was expecting more in terms of the darkness.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>However, it looked more like I got punched in the eye.  </li>
            <li>I just have a couple of weeks using it, but I really have noted some changes, great product</li>
            <li>either, the other ones are great, can&#x27;t say I recommend the eye roller, good idea, just needs stronger shrinking stuff</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been very happy with other Nivea Men</li>
            <li>The roll-on application is easy but also easy to over-apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ball applicator makes it easy to apply and I don&#x27;t get it in my eyes like when I use my finger.</li>
            <li>Product could be applied by feel - uniformly - comfortably - reliably - EVERY time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s way, way too smooth to gain any traction on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I received it quickly and the packaging was fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kept my eyes looking fresh and wrinkle free.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it as much as the Nivea brand eye cream for men that I used to purchase, but it is an ok substitute.</li>
            <li>Keep in pocket like a Chapstick for a quick pick up.</li>
            <li>For me it works great and kind of wakes up tired eyes in the morning</li>
            <li>My eyes do look clear and energetic, so I am going to take that.</li>
            <li>Not an overpowering fragrance but a light version of classic Nivea.  </li>
            <li>It works for me and the product was exactly as it is presented.</li>
            <li>I used this for a month on one eye only, so I could better compare the results.  </li>
            <li>biggest problem with this particular roller is that the roller does not work as good as some other once I have tried.</li>
            <li>I really like the convenience of a roll on.</li>
            <li>The jury is still out whether these rollers really do anything?</li>
            <li>This really helps.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed that this product does much of anything.  </li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t feel energized and puffiness under the eyes</li>
            <li>Great idea but poorly designed.</li>
            <li>This product really works for me.</li>
            <li>Cooling, soothing and good at instantly diminishing both puffiness and dark rings under eyes</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I found it to be the more economical solution compared to other similar products.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the old formula, but this works reasonably well.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the roller mechanism does not roll against the skin and that can irritate a bit since it is designed for the very sensitive skin under the eyes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time trying specific cream for my eyes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain only to add some heft to the container -</li>
            <li>Either you get nothing - or you get twice as much as you could possibly need - - and you end up using your finger anyway - an aggravating experience</li>
            <li>this product, I simply shake it gently and roll underneath each eye as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>no results so far and its been over a month</li>
            <li>This maybe overtime could do some good, not really instant results, or close to it, the tube ones usually work better from almost any brand, I have used it quite a few times and still the same, doesn&#x27;t have the shrinking tight effect, but then again I don&#x27;t really like the nivea skin cream with Q10</li>
            <li>After trying so many similar products for several years due my under eye \\&quot;sunken\\&quot; and darker \\&quot;crescent\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The new and improved formula comes in a convenient smaller size, while maintaining the old price.</li>
            <li>The instant effect seems to really work, especially on those morning afterwards.</li>
            <li>The cold ball does feel good.</li>
            <li>so far like this because it seems to reduce the visible under eye bags and provides a refreshing cooling sensation that isn&#x27;t overpowering or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the results are not astonishing or anything, it does seem to be effective as I described above, at least enough for me to buy a second one.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have tried lots of these products over the years and this one is definitely the best-designed one I have used in a long time.  </li>
            <li> But the steel ball roller is one of the more cynical product packaging ploys I&#x27;ve seen in quite a while.</li>
            <li> I am a in my mid 30th, and have been using a different type of eye rollers over few years.</li>
            <li> I initially thought this item was a bit expensive, but just one .33 ounce tube has lasted well over one month, so I think it is worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This may be a small bottle, but if used as directed it will last a long time before one has to order again.</li>
            <li> - - substantially!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve notified Nivea of my opinions - but this &amp;#34;world wide corporation&amp;#34; hasn&#x27;t even offered the courtesy of a response.</li>

            <li> Not sure what is in here that I am allergic to, but after a couple of days trying this product I ended up with puffier bags under my eyes that were red and began to peel.  </li>
            <li> Not that I was expecting a miracle in the morning, but I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen any improvement to my dark circles and eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> I always have dark circles under my eyes, so I thought I&#x27;d try this product to see if there was any improvement.</li>

            <li> Other than a Very little soothing around eyes...</li>
            <li> - the price has gone UP while the amount of product in the package has gone DOWN!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone who would like to reduce tired looking eyes due to dark circles.</li>

            <li> I used to use the same product that came out in a lotion, but that is difficult to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if it worked well, but talked to the doctor who recommended I try over the counter allergy meds like clariton which did the trick.</li>

            <li> any difference noticed in reduction of puffiness or tired eyes.  </li>

            <li> Eh, I&#x27;m not impressed.  </li>
            <li> After about a week, my daughter asked why the circles under my eyes were especially bad lately.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like the convenience of a roll on. It&#x27;s a great under eye boost and I get visible effects. Keep in pocket like a Chapstick for a quick pick up.</li>
            <li> Just as promised.  Son uses it every day.  He likes it...we always trust NIVEA products.</li>
            <li> I am a in my mid 30th, and have been using a different type of eye rollers over few years. The jury is still out whether these rollers really do anything? My eyes do look clear and energetic, so I am going to take that. However, there is no certainty this is actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest problem with this particular roller is that the roller does not work as good as some other once I have tried. But it does the trick, so still giving the product 3 stars</li>
            <li> I bought 1 bottle of this. I have sensitive skin and started getting dry, rough patches under my eyes after 4 days of use. I had to discontinue using it. I sure wish I didn&#x27;t have this reaction because I&#x27;m showing a lot of age around my eyes. Going to keep searching for alternative.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Does what it promises and then some!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it changes anything.</li>
            <li> As you age, the feeling of your skin under your eyes is uncomfortable.  This really helps.  have not seen any visible difference, but ift feels 100% better.  i would purchase again</li>

            <li> Nivea&#x27;s Eye Cream for Men originally came out with a dispenser than placed an appropriate amount on the perfect applicator - - a man&#x27;s FINGER! Product could be applied by feel - uniformly - comfortably - reliably - EVERY time. Then, they came out with the half-baked idea of a &amp;#34;roller ball&amp;#34;. Simply put - it doesn&#x27;t work! Either you get nothing - or you get twice as much as you could possibly need - - and you end up using your finger anyway - an aggravating experience however it works out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND - the price has gone UP while the amount of product in the package has gone DOWN! - - substantially!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve notified Nivea of my opinions - but this &amp;#34;world wide corporation&amp;#34; hasn&#x27;t even offered the courtesy of a response. For MY money, I&#x27;m going to &amp;#34;vote with my wallet&amp;#34;. You can do WAY better than this product.</li>
            <li> Been using different variations of this product for 11 years. It&#x27;s kept my eyes looking fresh and wrinkle free.</li>
            <li> I initially thought this item was a bit expensive, but just one .33 ounce tube has lasted well over one month, so I think it is worth the cost.  I don&#x27;t like it as much as the Nivea brand eye cream for men that I used to purchase, but it is an ok substitute.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend said my eyes looked tired (which they probably did, busy season at work, I was tired) - suggested I buy something like this. Feels nice going on, the ball-bearing applicator is kind of cool, but also can plug up. I can&#x27;t say I notice any difference in how I look after using it. I notice my skin is clearer after using the retinol lotion at night (fewer bumps), but I&#x27;m not sure about the effectiveness on this one.</li>
            <li> Eh, I&#x27;m not impressed.  Really didn&#x27;t feel energized and puffiness under the eyes didn&#x27;t go away any quicker.</li>
            <li> Cant tell if it works or not really. I mean i out it on and still look old...lol&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what to expect</li>
            <li> Item image is a bit misleading.. this package is smaller (10ml) than the one sold in the groceries(15ml) for the same price .</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of these products over the years and this one is definitely the best-designed one I have used in a long time.  I used to use the same product that came out in a lotion, but that is difficult to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product, I simply shake it gently and roll underneath each eye as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers claim it doesn&#x27;t help the dark look or the puffiness, however, I don&#x27;t care about my looks and simply want some relief of dryness under the eye and this product does deliver in that regard.  I use it when I wake up and just before retiring for bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be a small bottle, but if used as directed it will last a long time before one has to order again.</li>
            <li> I works at least to me.</li>
            <li> I used this for a month on one eye only, so I could better compare the results.  I saw nothing</li>
            <li> Not really sure why others posted a negative on this product. For me it works great and kind of wakes up tired eyes in the morning</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell that it does anything. The cold ball does feel good. I haven&#x27;t noticed it ever clogging as others have. Lasts for ever. Seems to moisturize.</li>
            <li> It does what it should be doing</li>
            <li> This cream has become part of my morning routine. Moisturizing my face every day helps keep the wrinkles to a minimum.</li>
            <li> This product seems to reduce the bags under my eyes when I use it.  I received it quickly and the packaging was fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked nivea. I wish they had more men&#x27;s products. The instant effect seems to really work, especially on those morning afterwards.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I found it to be the more economical solution compared to other similar products.  No difference noticed in darkness under eyes.  Minimal, if any difference noticed in reduction of puffiness or tired eyes.  It can leave skin looking shiny which draws more attention if you ask me.  I recommend spending your money elsewhere.</li>
            <li> no results so far and its been over a month</li>
            <li> Surprisingly effective.  For men with puffy eyes this might just be the perfect and easy to use fixer.  Cooling, soothing and good at instantly diminishing both puffiness and dark rings under eyes</li>
            <li> Seems to make a difference in terms of lightening the darkness under the eyes.  I didn&#x27;t buy it with the idea it would do anything for puffiness because I don&#x27;t see how a topical solution could.  The steel ball roller is there I&#x27;m certain only to add some heft to the container - it&#x27;s way, way too smooth to gain any traction on the skin.  I just put some on my fingertip and apply that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the results are not astonishing or anything, it does seem to be effective as I described above, at least enough for me to buy a second one.  But the steel ball roller is one of the more cynical product packaging ploys I&#x27;ve seen in quite a while.</li>
            <li> Great idea but poorly designed.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I work overnights and I&#x27;ve begun to look like my late night counterpart, the raccoon. I was looking to find something to help this and I&#x27;ve been very happy with other Nivea Men products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I so far like this because it seems to reduce the visible under eye bags and provides a refreshing cooling sensation that isn&#x27;t overpowering or uncomfortable. The roll-on application is easy but also easy to over-apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I&#x27;d recommend this to any men that want a eye pick-me-up but don&#x27;t want to go to the ladies make-up counter.</li>
            <li> Awesome for under eye discoloration!</li>
            <li> This maybe overtime could do some good, not really instant results, or close to it, the tube ones usually work better from almost any brand, I have used it quite a few times and still the same, doesn&#x27;t have the shrinking tight effect, but then again I don&#x27;t really like the nivea skin cream with Q10 either, the other ones are great, can&#x27;t say I recommend the eye roller, good idea, just needs stronger shrinking stuff</li>
            <li> Not sure if it worked well, but talked to the doctor who recommended I try over the counter allergy meds like clariton which did the trick.</li>
            <li> this feels great putting it on. The ball applicator makes it easy to apply and I don&#x27;t get it in my eyes like when I use my finger. My under eye area was looking baggy and dark, after a few weeks they look less baggy but I guess I was expecting more in terms of the darkness. It&#x27;s my first time trying specific cream for my eyes so maybe it&#x27;s working great and I&#x27;m just to sun damaged to repair</li>
            <li> This product really works for me. Too bad Nivea has decided to stop making this product.</li>
            <li> Love it... Keeps my under eye area hydrated and minimizes circles...</li>
            <li> Product is great. Refreshes skin under the eyes. Not an overpowering fragrance but a light version of classic Nivea.  Sometimes the roller mechanism does not roll against the skin and that can irritate a bit since it is designed for the very sensitive skin under the eyes.  Would recommend but not a \\&quot;must have\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing! After trying so many similar products for several years due my under eye \\&quot;sunken\\&quot; and darker \\&quot;crescent\\&quot; (not circles) problem, I gave up on such products. Last week I got this at CVS. Oh my, did I become a NOVEA believer again. Grew up using Nivea products, and I think that&#x27;s what made me to give it a try. Fuller, firmer and younger looking in literally one day! Three days later, I&#x27;m sold! It&#x27;s a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot;! You miss a day? The prev-day effect still holds! It won&#x27;t be greasy or flaky like other Night Creams, say Neutrogena. Hope it helps!&lt;br /&gt;Does any one know where to buy Nivea Men Night Renewal xyz? I think it&#x27;s sold in the East Africa or Africa mainly.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;TL</li>
            <li> Great product, great price</li>
            <li> Feels good on under eye skin but as yet I see no difference! I&#x27;ll keep,using though.</li>
            <li> I prefer the old formula, but this works reasonably well. The new and improved formula comes in a convenient smaller size, while maintaining the old price.</li>
            <li> Not sure what is in here that I am allergic to, but after a couple of days trying this product I ended up with puffier bags under my eyes that were red and began to peel.  Almost like eczema.  However, it looked more like I got punched in the eye.  Whatever it is, it wasn&#x27;t for me, but might be for you?  I also have issue with their moisturizer drying out my skin after a couple days of use.</li>
            <li> Other than a Very little soothing around eyes...I Still have puffiness and Dark Circles. .So It Really Only fulfills 25% of what it lists. Will Stick to Loreal products for this. Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this stuff really does anything.</li>
            <li> Same as lotion...feels soothing though</li>
            <li> the roll on its good, but no &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; my  eyes and</li>
            <li> I just have a couple of weeks using it, but I really have noted some changes, great product</li>
            <li> small quantity. Not like I had before.</li>
            <li> I do not really think that this product does what say MANUFACTURER. I have used it for over 3 weeks and my eyelids are still the same.</li>
