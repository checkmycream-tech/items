            <li>and it smells great!</li>
            <li>However, Kuro Naturals is one of the best vendors with which to do business</li>
            <li>It might work perfectly for those in the 30-40&#x27;s range</li>
            <li>wonderful night cream</li>
            <li>VERY HAPPY WITH IT!!!</li>
            <li>this way.&lt;br /&gt;The cream&#x27;s fragrance is delicious and feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li>Makeup goes on over this beautifully.</li>
            <li>OMG my skin wasn&#x27;t this beautiful when I was 25.  </li>
            <li>it isnt a miracle or anything, but I have tried EVERYTHING, and this has quality ingredients and is great price point.</li>
            <li>Everything about it is wonderful, from the rich texture, to the way it absorbs without leaving my skin feeling greasy, to the delicious honey smell.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it a particularly good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, this is still a good product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s my favorite!</li>
            <li>Love all their products!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this and the Skin Creme for years now and am so impressed by its positive effects on my skin.  </li>
            <li>The product did not work effectively</li>
            <li>It soaks in nicely.  </li>
            <li>I used  squalane, rose hip oil and moon creme by NZ Fusion Botanicals in combination.  </li>
            <li>It has a light honey scent that&#x27;s pleasant.</li>
            <li>The smell is really light and good.</li>
            <li>so often it is coated with an oily coffee residue, so I have   many needs.</li>
            <li>and this cream was my favorite.</li>
            <li>but I am 51 and need more moisture these days.</li>
            <li>I will buy more and try the rest of their products.  </li>
            <li>I Love this cream.</li>
            <li>I do love the smell of it, and the texture is creamy</li>
            <li>I noticed that the cream was good at first, but then with exposure to the air I wondered if it affected the potency.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Quick shipping, great new packaging, easier to travel with.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>I am a faithful customer of Koru Naturals (quick shipping, excellent products)  and have been ordering a different day/night/eye cream every time to try them all.  </li>
            <li>Koru was the best at half the price.  </li>
            <li>I believe they have changed the formula along with the new packaging though and to me it is not quite as good as the original formula, which was creamier and so efficient that I would wake in the morning with moist, dewy skin.</li>
            <li>but it is great with the above mentioned items that I used and it took about 10 days</li>
            <li>After using the Skin Clear Cream and Sun Cream from NZ Fusion, which I loved,  I tried this</li>
            <li>It is healing too - good for the cursed adult acne I still get.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 37 caucasian blond hair (fair skin), with sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>Love the results, helped diminish wrinkles and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I just wish they would change it back to the old formula that I loved so well!</li>
            <li>Cynergy TK (Pure Source), Kiri, Wild Ferns,  and now my favorite, NZ Fusion!</li>
            <li>I have gotten many comments about my young looking skin, and for 2 years have used  nothing but manuka honey products...</li>
            <li>It also had a different scent which I liked.</li>
            <li>So, I like the cream, but will never know if it could have been better for me because what I received was old packaging...</li>
            <li>Sorry, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed at all with this product; no benefits; nothing special about the rosehip oil, in my opinion</li>
            <li>Love this stuff--I have gone through one jar and am halfway through the new airless pump package, which I personally really like.</li>
            <li>It is a fantastic product manufactured in New Zealand.  </li>
            <li>It works so much better than much more expensive moisturizers that I have purchased from better known manufacturers.</li>
            <li>I first started using NZ Fusion products about 2 years ago</li>
            <li>So...what I do is step it up a notch by first applying 4-5 drops of rosehip oil and/or argan oil to my face before applying this cream.</li>
            <li>No complaints about this one and the price is reasonable, too !</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>heavier face moisturizer, and this was exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>The scent of this one is not bad by any means but the other scent was more to my liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that this cream is in a dispenser instead of a jar.&lt;br /&gt;The sensitive natural ingredients will keep their potency</li>
            <li>So it is a good moisturizer for those who have a bit of dry skin and acne at the same time.</li>
            <li>It went straight in the garbage.</li>
            <li>Moon Cream is really silky and not oily or greasy.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon for a reasonably priced squalane.</li>
            <li>After a hard day&#x27;s work outside it is a very nice part of my nighttime ablutions.</li>
            <li>That way I still wake up in the morning with fresh skin, and my skin does look younger than my 51 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my new favoorite night cream.  </li>
            <li>if I order again would I get it in the new dispenser?  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and very dry because of the acne wash I use.</li>
            <li>Try it, you can&#x27;t beat the price compared to the  selection of natural products at your local Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>This and their &#x27;skin clear cream&#x27; are what I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li>If you have acne issues and are not allergic to tea tree oil, I would give the skin clear cream a try too.</li>
            <li>Wild Ferns</li>
            <li>I am 41 years old with normal/dry skin, also I  work at Starbucks</li>
            <li>I am 65 yrs young</li>
            <li>wow.  </li>
            <li>And it is all Natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I received it in the old &#x27;</li>
            <li>- it sinks right in and feels &#x27;dewey&#x27; and moist.</li>
            <li>New Zealand lanolin facial moisturizer with collagen.  </li>
            <li>You do not have to use very much compared to other creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d received this cream in the new vacuum pump dispenser for maximum preservation of the cream effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>This product is rich (judging by the amount I am using it will last a  few months) and just smells divine, like honey butter.</li>
            <li>I was looking for natural skin care that actually works.</li>
            <li>(Although I think there is less product in the airless pump package, I imagine that the product remains much fresher and I generally prefer the airless package.)</li>
            <li>Do I want dry, itchy, clear skin or moisturized, un-itchy, broken-out skin?</li>
            <li>Plus a very small dollop will easily cover the entire face, so it goes a long way.</li>

            <li> cream is not the least bit irritating and indeed feels quite soothing and cooling upon application at night.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say, this Moon Cream smelled so bad that there was no way I could use it anywhere near my face.</li>
            <li> (I would recommend just getting this instead of the day cream as well, I find the day cream too thin for my skin.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but decided to give it a try.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I received the product just days after ordering! I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use the product yet but opened it up and it smells great! Can&#x27;t wait to try it out tonight! (ordered a night cream)</li>
            <li> I was surprised by all the great reviews.  I didn&#x27;t find it a particularly good moisturizer.  I will keep it and use on my neck and chest.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.  The ingredients in the product separated and they were dispensed as a greasy concoction.  I tried mixing them together to correct the problem.  The product did not work effectively and so I discontinued use of it.  However, Kuro Naturals is one of the best vendors with which to do business and I would recommend a different product that it sells --- Wild Ferns New Zealand lanolin facial moisturizer with collagen.  It is a fantastic product manufactured in New Zealand.  It works so much better than much more expensive moisturizers that I have purchased from better known manufacturers.</li>
            <li> I am a faithful customer of Koru Naturals (quick shipping, excellent products)  and have been ordering a different day/night/eye cream every time to try them all.  After using the Skin Clear Cream and Sun Cream from NZ Fusion, which I loved,  I tried this and it&#x27;s my favorite!

            <li> Love all their products! I have super sensitive skin and very dry because of the acne wash I use. This and their &#x27;skin clear cream&#x27; are what I&#x27;ve used for years. They don&#x27;t break me out, and keep my skin well moisturized without harsh chemicals!</li>

So...what I do is step it up a notch by first applying 4-5 drops of rosehip oil and/or argan oil to my face before applying this cream. That way I still wake up in the morning with fresh skin, and my skin does look younger than my 51 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is not the least bit irritating and indeed feels quite soothing and cooling upon application at night. After a hard day&#x27;s work outside it is a very nice part of my nighttime ablutions. It is healing too - good for the cursed adult acne I still get.

I just wish they would change it back to the old formula that I loved so well!</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed at all with this product; no benefits; nothing special about the rosehip oil, in my opinion</li>
            <li> Wow! I bought this based on the reviews because I have XXX dry skin. I mean sandpaper dry. I also ordered a $40 face cream. Koru was the best at half the price.  I will buy more and try the rest of their products.  This is a must have for me. Please. ..just make a bigger size.</li>
            <li> This is my new favoorite night cream.  It feels so silky going on, my skin loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipping, great new packaging, easier to travel with.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but decided to give it a try. Moon Cream is really silky and not oily or greasy. My skin just loves it ! It has a light honey scent that&#x27;s pleasant. And I&#x27;m picky about smells. I have old, very dark acne scars that I know might take longer to heal. But I do see them fading. I was looking for natural skin care that actually works. No complaints about this one and the price is reasonable, too !</li>
            <li> wonderful night cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this and the Skin Creme for years now and am so impressed by its positive effects on my skin.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Looked ahead of time for that winter weather (YUCK!!) heavier face moisturizer, and this was exactly what I was hoping for. I used last year Carols Daughter,and was going to again til I heard about this. One of the FEW that you put on before bed, and you can still seriously feel on your face the next day. Others soak in, these are different. VERY HAPPY WITH IT!!!</li>
            <li> I am over 40, but I still have to choose every winter: Do I want dry, itchy, clear skin or moisturized, un-itchy, broken-out skin? Until this moon cream, that is. Everything about it is wonderful, from the rich texture, to the way it absorbs without leaving my skin feeling greasy, to the delicious honey smell. Plus a very small dollop will easily cover the entire face, so it goes a long way. I&#x27;ve also worn it during the daytime on ultra-cold days this winter, when I&#x27;ve felt like I needed an extra layer of protection. Makeup goes on over this beautifully. I definitely recommend it for anyone with dry skin; it has saved my face this winter! No embarrassing zits, yay! It&#x27;s about time!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff--I have gone through one jar and am halfway through the new airless pump package, which I personally really like. (Although I think there is less product in the airless pump package, I imagine that the product remains much fresher and I generally prefer the airless package.) it isnt a miracle or anything, but I have tried EVERYTHING, and this has quality ingredients and is great price point. I will continue to use it. (I would recommend just getting this instead of the day cream as well, I find the day cream too thin for my skin. I need something thicker. I&#x27;m 37 caucasian blond hair (fair skin), with sensitive, acne-prone skin. If you have acne issues and are not allergic to tea tree oil, I would give the skin clear cream a try too.</li>
            <li> I love that this cream is in a dispenser instead of a jar.&lt;br /&gt;The sensitive natural ingredients will keep their potency this way.&lt;br /&gt;The cream&#x27;s fragrance is delicious and feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love the results, helped diminish wrinkles and very moisturizing. You do not have to use very much compared to other creams I&#x27;ve used. The smell is really light and good. I Love this cream.</li>
            <li> I am 65 yrs young I used  squalane, rose hip oil and moon creme by NZ Fusion Botanicals in combination.  OMG my skin wasn&#x27;t this beautiful when I was 25.  I don&#x27;t know how it works alone but it is great with the above mentioned items that I used and it took about 10 days and wow.  Thanks amazon for a reasonably priced squalane. And it is all Natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d received this cream in the new vacuum pump dispenser for maximum preservation of the cream effectiveness.  I received it in the old &#x27;an open to the air&#x27; screw cap jar instead.  That disappoints me a bit.  I noticed that the cream was good at first, but then with exposure to the air I wondered if it affected the potency.  So, I like the cream, but will never know if it could have been better for me because what I received was old packaging...if I order again would I get it in the new dispenser?  I do love the smell of it, and the texture is creamy - it sinks right in and feels &#x27;dewey&#x27; and moist.</li>
