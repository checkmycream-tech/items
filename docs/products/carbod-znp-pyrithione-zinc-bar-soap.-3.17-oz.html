            <li>Been buying from this wonderful seller for several years.  </li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t work and cost more.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad that someone decided to make this product.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be better off buying DermaZinc.</li>

            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>It gives  a nice lather and rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>Love this soap, your skin feels clean and healthy after using</li>
            <li>It has a very clean feel/hand and has a clean scent.  </li>
            <li>There was some relief, but  good  old Epson Salt cleared it all up!</li>
            <li>I tried this soap because origial ZNP Bar is no longer available...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would be great if the was a US domestic distributor</li>
            <li>It does not irritate my skin and as a person in 70&#x27;s that is important.</li>
            <li>This product is no longer available in the US.</li>
            <li>Seems nutty having to get it shipped from South America, since it&#x27;s such a good product and so many people want it...</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>This product is as good as the old ZNP.</li>
            <li>Not at all like the original ZNP bar.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried this soap, it is definitely worth your time, money, and effort!</li>
            <li>By far the best ZNP soap bar on the current market.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it regularly, but seems like a good soap for dermatitis.</li>
            <li>The scent is pretty strong, but that&#x27;s what I like about it.  </li>
            <li>For years and years I was a loyal user of the ZNP pyrithion zinc soap.</li>
            <li>It makes you your skin feel clean but is very gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>it makes it that much easier to know that this is a no brainer!!</li>
            <li>I have used all of them that are available for purchase and this soap and seller are the real deal.</li>
            <li>This soap lasts and is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Takes a while to get to you, but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>It was worth the wait for us.</li>
            <li>Worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>It took awhile to get them since they came from South America, but it was worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but well worth the wait in 4 days</li>
            <li>2nd order was more quickly will order again....</li>
            <li>The soap was very gentle on his skin.</li>
            <li>First order took a while to get but still received within estimated time.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it is not sold in the US.</li>
            <li>I beginning to wonder what is exactly in this soap and why you can&#x27;t buy it anywhere in the us....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>If you are looking at this product, you are most likely looking for something to replace the no-longer-available ZNP bar from Stiefel Laboratories.  </li>
            <li>I find it to be superior to origial ZNP bar for controlling Seborrhea &amp; the accumulation of dried, flaky skin around my nose &amp; eyebrows...</li>
            <li>forget the drandruff shampoos they don&#x27;t work on certain types of dandruff.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really give a review</li>
            <li>really...</li>
            <li>this soap works to stop itch on skin very well in areas that are needed.  </li>
            <li>Very drying, not for me but</li>
            <li>My husband has a skin problem and he really like these bars.  </li>
            <li>Thanks amazon this soap</li>
            <li>this one really works.</li>
            <li>but I really wish they&#x27;d bring back the nice blue ZNP Bar.  </li>
            <li>This is as close to the real deal as it gets.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got another order of it in my basket ready to be placed</li>
            <li>I really miss the original, the one and only ZNP.  </li>
            <li>However, in the past my husband has used ZNP (Pyrithione Zinc) bar soap with satisfactory results, which is why we ordered this and the Noble Formula.</li>
            <li>But the price is high and it takes time for the soap to get to me.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this soap</li>
            <li>On another note worth mentioning... I have since stumbled upon a hair care product - Head&amp;Shoulders \\&quot;extra strength\\&quot; with 2% Pyrithione Zinc.</li>
            <li>This soap really took care of my acne quickly after a lot of other soaps did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>Delivery takes a bit of time because it is shipped from outside the US, but I was aware of this when I ordered it and the seller is reliable and your delivery will come.</li>
            <li>just wet the affected area with a little water first, add a dab of the shampoo and rub it in (kind of like a lotion) and shower it off later.</li>
            <li>at 8 years old.  </li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>For those who are sensitive to fragrance, I would not use this.  </li>
            <li>thank you arrived as described, however it was not for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Only thing I don&#x27;t like is shipping cost 10.99 per item just as much as soap for 12.99 per bar.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin unbelievably soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of weird having to order soap from so far away, but it got here</li>
            <li>This is the only place I can get a replacement for the old ZNP bars that were discontinued!  </li>
            <li>That product may, or may not, work, but it was much too rough on my skin</li>
            <li>Terrific Carbod ZNP Pyrithione Zinc Bar Soap, the REAL DEAL, thank you so much to Amazon for bringing us this out of country seller who delivers hard to find item.  </li>
            <li>i usually get this other zinc soap, but this was the only one available it took a while to get here.</li>

            <li> Terrific Carbod ZNP Pyrithione Zinc Bar Soap, the REAL DEAL, thank you so much to Amazon for bringing us this out of country seller who delivers hard to find item.  </li>
            <li> i usually get this other zinc soap, but this was the only one available it took a while to get here.</li>
            <li> I do hope that it becomes available soon as other soaps are not nearly as effective</li>
            <li> derm.&lt;br /&gt;It comes from a land locked country in South America so it does take a long time to actually receive.</li>
            <li> The antibiotics helped some, but you can only take them for so long before it messes with your liver.</li>
            <li> that I see the cost has gone down considerably from when I bought them...</li>
            <li> only complaint I have is that, since it took so long to receive this item, we may just stay with Nobel Formula , which has a much faster delivery time.  </li>
            <li> It takes a long, long time to receive but it will come in time.  </li>
            <li> but man it was a long wait.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to get.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used on to years and all these other soap that claim to work the same are Lying.</li>
            <li> I have tried various other ones from Amazon as well as others I found via the interwebs.</li>
            <li> The Bad Took way too long to receive, therefore was glad I had ordered 2 bars.  </li>
            <li> Above rating is based on previous ZNP usage, since my husband has not yet used this item.  </li>
            <li> Pretty expensive, but lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> and this was expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Soap bar does not last very long and has an excessive ship time you need to plan ahead</li>

            <li> Prefer the soaps with less fragrance. This soap lasts and is worth the money. My preference is one with less scent.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really give a review cuz I never received it (at least not yet) order was placed back in May and it is now almost July. I may update this review if I ever receive the product. Paraguay ??? really... the pony express and carrier pidgeons had faster mail delivery. On another note worth mentioning... I have since stumbled upon a hair care product - Head&amp;Shoulders \\&quot;extra strength\\&quot; with 2% Pyrithione Zinc. I ordered the ZNP bar for tinea versicolor which I tend to get this time of year. The H&amp;S worked GREAT... just wet the affected area with a little water first, add a dab of the shampoo and rub it in (kind of like a lotion) and shower it off later. Did this every other day, and after a couple of weeks... all cleared up. Now just use it once every week or so to keep it at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** UPDATE *** July 25th and still have NOT received the product. Sent an email to the seller, we&#x27;ll see...</li>
            <li> Did not work in my treatment for Seborrheic dermatitis</li>
            <li> Great replacement for ZNP.  Takes a while to get to you, but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Above rating is based on previous ZNP usage, since my husband has not yet used this item.  However, in the past my husband has used ZNP (Pyrithione Zinc) bar soap with satisfactory results, which is why we ordered this and the Noble Formula. After utlilizing the two bars of Nobel Formula, he will use the Carbod ZNP; we expect it to be satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that, since it took so long to receive this item, we may just stay with Nobel Formula , which has a much faster delivery time.  Yet, we won&#x27;t know for sure until he uses this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Amazon team, for all you do for us.  I hope you have a  great year!</li>
            <li> I tried the Noble Formula but found that this soap is much better for taking care of sub derm.&lt;br /&gt;It comes from a land locked country in South America so it does take a long time to actually receive.</li>
            <li> There was some relief, but  good  old Epson Salt cleared it all up!</li>
            <li> We love this soap so happy we found it on Amazon, we will reorder again</li>
            <li> This soap really took care of my acne quickly after a lot of other soaps did nothing for me. But the price is high and it takes time for the soap to get to me. But I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It is the only thing that works on my husbands dandruff problems. It gives  a nice lather and rinses clean.  I do not know why they quit making it in the USA .  I&#x27;ll buy it,  even though it  ends up costing  over $18 a bar because of the shipping charge.  forget the drandruff shampoos they don&#x27;t work on certain types of dandruff. The other zinc bar has oatmeal in it. yuck!. Not a great thing for washing hair.</li>
            <li> Our son had really bad case of cradle cap... at 8 years old.  Nothing helped. Our dermatologist finally recommended this zinc bar.  We expected to use it for at least 4 weeks to see the results.  We only had to use it once.  Cradle cap is gone.  The soap was very gentle on his skin. Wow.  It was worth the wait for us.</li>
            <li> The good:  have used ZNP soap for my hair for years &amp; works great once a week.  The Bad Took way too long to receive, therefore was glad I had ordered 2 bars.  Would tell my friends about it just order way before you need it.</li>
            <li> this soap works to stop itch on skin very well in areas that are needed.  The smell is just wonderful, very spa-like and refreshing.  The scent is pretty strong, but that&#x27;s what I like about it.  For those who are sensitive to fragrance, I would not use this.  This really is a good product and will purchase again.  Pretty expensive, but lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> I really miss the original, the one and only ZNP.  This is the same color but&lt;br /&gt;I think it smells awful (unscented would be good).  We use zinc bars because&lt;br /&gt;we have skin problems.  So why compound the problems with this&lt;br /&gt;fake scent?  Please, please - make this in an unscented variety.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this product. Not at all like the original ZNP bar. Face does not feel clean after using!!! Not worth the price at all.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Worth the wait.  Come by way of Uraguay.</li>
            <li> great soap for great skin and complexion. zinc is a good&lt;br /&gt;vitamin for skin and this was expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Very drying, not for me but thank you arrived as described, however it was not for my sensitive skin. Husband used it in the garage to remove heavy dirt.</li>
            <li> I am glad i found this product unable to do so from the USA as they stopped producing at this time.  First order took a while to get but still received within estimated time.  2nd order was more quickly will order again....</li>
            <li> My husband has a skin problem and he really like these bars.  He says it helps and I will be keeping this in stock for him.  It takes a long, long time to receive but it will come in time.  Update:  It has been 3 years and he is still using this soap for his psoriasis and it is still working well for him.  We buy 4 at a time.</li>
            <li> i usually get this other zinc soap, but this was the only one available it took a while to get here. but worked in a jiffy! i&#x27;d probably but this again whenever i need it again</li>
            <li> Best soap that can&#x27;t be bought on the United States. Thanks amazon this soap I have been trying to find for years &amp; no pharmacy in the U.S sale it because it&#x27;s off the market. This is the only soap that clears my rash. I haven&#x27;t used on to years and all these other soap that claim to work the same are Lying. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is shipping cost 10.99 per item just as much as soap for 12.99 per bar. The price I have to pay.</li>
            <li> I tried this soap because origial ZNP Bar is no longer available... I find it to be superior to origial ZNP bar for controlling Seborrhea &amp; the accumulation of dried, flaky skin around my nose &amp; eyebrows... I do hope that it becomes available soon as other soaps are not nearly as effective</li>
            <li> This is one of the better zinc soaps out there. I wish it were easier to get. Seems nutty having to get it shipped from South America, since it&#x27;s such a good product and so many people want it...</li>
            <li> Was prescribed samples of the ZNP bar a few years ago to treat my Seborrhic Dermatitis .&lt;br /&gt;Worked great but then the company stopped making it.&lt;br /&gt;Bought this as a replacement and seems to be working great, I think this is going to work !!&lt;br /&gt;finally.&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback was it took a few weeks to receive it once i ordered since the manufacturer is on Portugal or something.&lt;br /&gt;Would be great if the was a US domestic distributor ..hint.hint..</li>
            <li> This is the only place I can get a replacement for the old ZNP bars that were discontinued!  This works just as well.</li>
            <li> I had a bout of fungal folliculitis. My chest and back looked like I had Chicken Pox. The Dermatologist gave me some antibiotics and some shampoo to use on my body. The antibiotics helped some, but you can only take them for so long before it messes with your liver. The shampoo was of no help. She mentioned the ZNP bar. Unfortunately, it is not sold in the US. I ordered two of these bars. It took awhile to get them since they came from South America, but it was worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I see the cost has gone down considerably from when I bought them... it makes it that much easier to know that this is a no brainer!!</li>
            <li> So far, so good. Much better than the Noble brand of ZNP soap.</li>
            <li> what the doctor ordered. no more itching..</li>
            <li> It works  well for me.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from Tinea Versacolor you need this product its the best on the market. Please remeber that the seller is in Paraguay so it takes 3-6 weeks but well worth the wait in 4 days my Tinea symptoms have shown a dramatic improvement !!!! Good luck to all that have this issue with summer coming up I am oredering two more bars to keep in stock for those humid Georgia days</li>
            <li> Works  great. I think it&#x27;s better than the orginal Znp bar soap I use to use. I have tried several different soaps that say they work like Znp this one really works.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  Been buying from this wonderful seller for several years.  Great for skin allergies. Have tried other &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; soaps but they don&#x27;t work and cost more.  Always keep several on hand.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find this soap anywhere.  It made it all the way from Paraguay, so i am pleased!</li>
            <li> I am so glad that someone decided to make this product.  I used ZNP before the company decided to stop manufacturing it.  This product is as good as the old ZNP.</li>
            <li> Great soap , cleared up my SD into days. Soap bar does not last very long and has an excessive ship time you need to plan ahead</li>
            <li> I like this product. I bought it because I couldn&#x27;t buy ZNP anymore. I use it for boils on my skin. It just takes forever to come from Paraguay-about 3 weeks. You&#x27;d be better off buying DermaZinc.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to replace ZNP Bar Soap which has been discontinued by the American manufacturer.  I am very pleased with the results from using this product to control dermatitis.</li>
            <li> Terrific Carbod ZNP Pyrithione Zinc Bar Soap, the REAL DEAL, thank you so much to Amazon for bringing us this out of country seller who delivers hard to find item.  Wonderful!</li>
            <li> By far the best ZNP soap bar on the current market. I have used all of them that are available for purchase and this soap and seller are the real deal. It does take a little while to receive but that is understandable considering it is coming from Paraguay. The Steifel ZNP was the best at one time but no longer in production. If you haven&#x27;t tried this soap, it is definitely worth your time, money, and effort!</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  It does not irritate my skin and as a person in 70&#x27;s that is important.</li>
            <li> I cant really be mad at shipment, it does state that it will take 4 week but man it was a long wait. I had high expectations for this soap but it did not deliver. Does not work as well as ZNP which is sad to say. Im not sure why ZNP was discontinued but i will forever miss it. Until then my search for seb derm treatment will never end....</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Couldn&#x27;t find the ZNP bar any where. This came from Peru so expect to wait like a month to receive it. Works better than my steroid cream for psoriosis.I beginning to wonder what is exactly in this soap and why you can&#x27;t buy it anywhere in the us....</li>
            <li> This product is no longer available in the US. Product is only slightly different - shape. It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It works ok I guess but I really wish they&#x27;d bring back the nice blue ZNP Bar.  It smelled great and worked great. This stuff smells weird and I don&#x27;t see where it out performs its predecessor.</li>
            <li> I used ZNP bar for decades, then it disappeared.  This soap is very similar to ZNP and seems to work just the same.  It&#x27;s kind of weird having to order soap from so far away, but it got here okay.  Seemed like it came via slow boat, though it came on the outer edge of the prescribed arrival time.</li>
            <li> With ZNP bars no longer being produced, this is by far the best alternative in the market. I have tried various other ones from Amazon as well as others I found via the interwebs. This is as close to the real deal as it gets. Shipping to my home (Metro Atlanta) was 18 calendar days from day of order. Not too bad compared to others and what I was told to expect.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it regularly, but seems like a good soap for dermatitis.</li>
            <li> If you are looking at this product, you are most likely looking for something to replace the no-longer-available ZNP bar from Stiefel Laboratories.  I tried the Noble Formula 2% Pyrithione Zinc Bar Soap.  That product may, or may not, work, but it was much too rough on my skin and I just could not use it.  I ordered the Carbod ZNP Pyrithione Zinc Bar Soap and have been using it for a few months now and I am completely satisfied with it.  Delivery takes a bit of time because it is shipped from outside the US, but I was aware of this when I ordered it and the seller is reliable and your delivery will come.</li>
            <li> I. LOVE. THIS. SOAP.  For years and years I was a loyal user of the ZNP pyrithion zinc soap. Then it became unavailable in the United States. I have horrid allergies and take a lot of steroids and antihistamines daily. This soap takes care of a myriad of issues for me. It&#x27;s fantastic for the dry itchy skin I have from taking an awful lot of antihistamines. It leaves my skin unbelievably soft. But best of all- the steroids can leave you prone to issues with yeast- and this soap nips that problem in the bud. If I have to wait 2-3 months to get the product from Paraguay, so be it. Frankly, I&#x27;d ride an unsaddled donkey all the way there to get it if that&#x27;s what was necessary. I&#x27;ve got another order of it in my basket ready to be placed soon- I&#x27;m ordering a dozen of them because I don&#x27;t want to go without it again.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to get.  Slow boat to china or some other slower type of conveyance!  But I finally got it.  It seems to do the job ok.  I don&#x27;t need it all the time</li>
            <li> A very excellent soap!!!  It has a very clean feel/hand and has a clean scent.  It makes you your skin feel clean but is very gentle on your skin. I would buy the soap again at twice the price!</li>
            <li> Love this soap, your skin feels clean and healthy after using</li>
