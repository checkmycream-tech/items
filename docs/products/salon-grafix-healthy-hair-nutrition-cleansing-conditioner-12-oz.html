    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a great feeling!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very happy with Salon Grafix.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is the best.  </li>
            <li>I have ever done but this is the best stuff I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is not the greatest; it smells like&#x27;&#x27;old-lady&#x27; perfume.  </li>
            <li>How wonderful it was to find this product!</li>
            <li>My hair feels great, not greasy,  lots of movement!!  </li>
            <li>, I was impressed!</li>
            <li>And you can&#x27;t beat the awesome price!</li>
            <li>That was perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li>It sounded great, promised the moon but guess what it did not deliver.  </li>
            <li>Possibly a great product if cleansing conditioners work for you</li>
            <li>It worked great on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m happy to report that it did; for one day.</li>
            <li>I tried this stuff on day two of my no shampoo cycle, and I was so happy when I awakened with silky, luxurious, wavy locks.</li>
            <li>Smells great too.</li>
            <li>It detangled my hair and had a great scent to it.</li>
            <li>: Smells great, noticed immediate results (split ends almost gone)</li>
            <li>great price.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>the smell is great leaves hair and scalp smelling great</li>
            <li>I used SG shampooing twice that day and my hair smelled great, looked shiny and conditioned.  </li>
            <li>I might try the Loreal conditioning cleanser or WEN, but I&#x27;m really happy with this product</li>
            <li>All in all its a great lower cost substitute for Wen.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s color-treated hair looks great</li>
            <li>but I heard great things about using conditioner shampoo</li>
            <li>This version, as well as, the formula for find/oily hair are AMAZING!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very happy with this and am glad there is an affordable alternative to Wen.</li>
            <li>My hair has never been this healthy or smelled this great!!  </li>
            <li>Great product at a good price.</li>
            <li>best scent - so clean - very nice and great price for the product</li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t add volume, I&#x27;m so happy with how it feels and moves - amazing.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s good though for 12oz. of product.</li>
            <li>They all smell good but are not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does smell really good, though.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve always heard good things.</li>
            <li>You do have to use a fair amount, I use between 8-10 pumps.</li>
            <li>They were all about 60% as good as Wen.  </li>
            <li>this stuff makes hair look good without even trying.  </li>
            <li>Works just as good as wen, without the wen price</li>
            <li>Believe how beautiful and soft and wonderful smelling my hair is.</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked better!</li>
            <li>It is BETTER than WEN!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, scent and all!</li>
            <li>I also love the smell!</li>
            <li>I have tried Wen, and Salon Grafix works much better!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li>I found with Salon Graphix, I can use it 2-3 days in a row and my hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li>It is simply amazing.  </li>
            <li>(it just came today and it smells amazing, btw).  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t notice any smell once you rinse it out of your hair which is nice for those of us who don&#x27;t like a lot of fragrance.</li>
            <li>and it is ok but doesn&#x27;t smell as good.</li>
            <li>I had to use conditioning oil and a separate conditioner to get any kind of shine before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It still kept its nice shine.</li>
            <li>For example, Aussie for mending split ends (great shampoo), Aveeno Moisturizing (okay shampoo) and many others.</li>
            <li>there were so many reviews claiming it was as good as wen.</li>
            <li>Good results whether letting hair mostly air-dry, or taking the time to style and blow-dry</li>
            <li>I loved the idea of this product and the price was better than Wen</li>
            <li>I used to be like this, but I loved the smell of this product that I started using it every day and haven&#x27;t regretted it yet. :-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite!!!</li>
            <li>this is really great shampoo, it is a great value and leaves your hair shiny and soft, I love it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really more effective in the shower than out.</li>
            <li>I was always a shampoo and conditioner girl, I&#x27;m making a switch because of how wonderful my hair feels and how soft it is.  </li>
            <li>(My hair happens to be very fine and always tangles after washing</li>
            <li>No matter how many pumps you use</li>
            <li>/&gt;You will absolutely LOVE your hair.</li>
            <li>I used it because I saw a review that said it got rid of dandruff, and it does EVEN MORE than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although this product does leave my hair feeling like it&#x27;s in better condition than it was.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also like to ad that I tried the Loreal cleansing conditioner also to see if it was better.</li>
            <li>Just saying...stick with Salon Grafix &amp; you&#x27;ll be pleased</li>
            <li>and I must say WEN is still more moisturizing and leaves hair more shiny than this product.</li>
            <li>i also tried loreal cleansing conditioners and even the smell of this product is better and softer nd not as overpowering as the loreal the loreal does condition mutch better than this product.</li>
            <li>And I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One did ok,  but was more money</li>
            <li>I just need to be able to get my hands on it</li>
            <li>You use about 2 healthy heaping spoons of this stuff to get the job done.</li>
            <li>can blowdry if I want without going,  ok this will cause split ends.</li>
            <li>I always had a feeling there should be something better then shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have color treated hair and needed a conditioner on top of this product to get a comb through it after showering.</li>
            <li>If you are prone to oily hair rather than dryness, this may be a better choice for you.</li>
            <li>a try at the suggestion of my stylist, and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t strip my hair</li>
            <li>I love creme cleansers for my relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>I still love it.</li>
            <li>I just bought this product today because of a co worker telling me about how great it was and works as well or better than Wen, and at a much lower price.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m so happy and am curious to see if I&#x27;m still this happy after a week or two of use.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>This is a gift, but I have some and love it.</li>
            <li>Bottles and glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>I fell in  love with WEN.</li>
            <li>However, I could not keep forking out 50 t0 60 dollars every time i needed to buy some more WEN.</li>
            <li>I noticed my ends looked better.</li>
            <li>Cheaper, smells better, and does a better job.</li>
            <li>and it never got better.</li>
            <li>I love cleansing conditioner and wanted to try something else.</li>
            <li>I love this product and when I&#x27;m finished w/</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bragged about how much I love my hair now (</li>
            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>but I noticed that when I use it continuously I see more results.</li>
            <li>Better than regular shampoo, but still not the best.</li>
            <li>You may love it or you may not</li>
            <li>I wanted to try Wen but this product is much more affordable and does the job.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It was a much better result than \\&quot;washing\\&quot; my hair with conditioner alone which never quite seemed to do the trick.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I suppose this will suffice if you are OK with off brands and their difference in output.  </li>
            <li>Because I use it weekly I am able to go longer between relaxers.  </li>
            <li>This is a better deal for the money than L&#x27;oreal Evercreme, and much more affordable than Wen.</li>
            <li>Kind of wishing that I could give you a before and after picture of my hair; this really is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I love my hair, it really is lovely, but my scalp is another story.</li>
            <li>hair feels greasy and cant go more then 2 days without washing it again.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ive been using Fekkai for about a year and really love it</li>
            <li>Works like Wen for sure but the smell of this won&#x27;t keep me using it.</li>
            <li>They all,  but the Revlon, rinsed well with warm to cool water and didn&#x27;t strip the hair.</li>
            <li>This product cleansn and conditions my brushes like nothin&#x27; else and keeps my hair smelling pretty darn good all day.  </li>
            <li>but first I tried SG and loved it.  </li>
            <li>for now, it&#x27;s just beautiful and soft.</li>
            <li>Hence, price point and ease of finding the stuff became even more important to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li>The smell is great and it leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>but it is still a good product i would recommend leaving it on much longer than directed tho.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t just pick it up as easily.</li>
            <li>The Deva No Poo leaves my hair and scalp clean, my hair feels silky and healthy, and calms the frizz.  </li>
            <li>The pump swivels too easily...  </li>
            <li>I use this on a dailey basis and my hair is easy to comb through afterwards.</li>
            <li>Hair combs easily.  </li>
            <li>has a strong perfume scent instead of a softer lavender or tea-tree oil scent.</li>
            <li>My hair feels completely clean, but so soft, and it smells great.  </li>
            <li>It shines even though I have fine hair and wash often.</li>
            <li>If I use it once a week and was with shampoo the rest of the week, it works fine and my hair seems sillier than just using shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and wavy andvu was hoping this was my frizz solution.  </li>
            <li>My hair is curly, brown, fine, frizzy, and not color treated.</li>
            <li>I just hope I don&#x27;t run through it too quickly!  </li>
            <li>This is the first cleansing conditioner I have tried and I&#x27;m glad it is because I&#x27;m really happy with this product so far.</li>
            <li>Has taken care of my scalp issue, and is so gentle and effective that my hair is full and lovely again.</li>
            <li>You would think a Cleansing Conditioner would make your hair soft, tangle free (or close to it), manageable and bright.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product yesterday at walgreens, buy one get one free</li>
            <li>SG makes my curls even and smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;During the 5 minutes the directions said to leave it on, I occasionally massaged it into my scalp and hair, noting how great it smells.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really important to RINSE RINSE RINSE.</li>
            <li>if I used a cheap .99 cent bottle of V05.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found this at Target a while back and loved it and have not been able to find it since so I look on Amazon</li>
            <li>but to my surprise it really is good and leaves my hair feeling moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased to to find a good clensing conditioner that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune, emit fumes while it sits on my hair, or make my skin burn and turn red.</li>
            <li>It was easy to wash the product out, and easy to comb my hair out right after I got out of the shower.</li>
            <li>After first use I noticed more friz and flyaways which I never experience with WEN</li>
            <li>I have pretty healthy hair</li>
            <li>But I love this product so much!</li>
            <li>I love the smell and after 2 weeks my hair is much smoother and shiner than it has been in years!  </li>
            <li>When I first tried this shampoo, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I cared for the scent.</li>
            <li>but Im pretty sure it wont impress me</li>
            <li>If it continues that way, I will be a happy customer for a very long time.</li>
            <li>Revlon didn&#x27;t really clean well,  </li>
            <li>My hair had no body and did not feel like it was clean.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a no-soap solution for keeping my hair clean and not greasy.</li>
            <li>and my hair felt clean</li>
            <li>and yes I did the squeak test too to see if it was clean.  </li>
            <li>It is light but does go away quickly.</li>
            <li>Plus it never felt or looked clean.  </li>
            <li>I give this product 1 star for the pleasant fragrance only.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Those I still have to try:  Hair One Cleansing Conditioner, Nada Poo Co-Wash Conditioner, Blue Magic Gentle Conditioning Cleanser, Macadamia Natural Oil Flawless Cleansing Conditioner, Hair N Now Cleansing Conditioner, Renpure Solutions Ren Cleansing Conditioner, Palmer&#x27;s Olive Oil Formula Cleansing Conditioner and Mizani Co-Wash Conditioning Cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have a friend who has GORGEOUS hair and told me she never, ever washes it, and only uses cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Scent reminds me of old decorative bath soaps that my grandmother kept in the bathroom (the kind you didn&#x27;t DARE use).  </li>
            <li>And I really like the scent better too.</li>
            <li>And did not achieve the beautiful hair that other products provided!  </li>
            <li>I dont have to do anything else to my hair but air dry and its truely soft and beautiful!</li>
            <li>It left my hair silky soft, smelling great and wonderfully clean!</li>
            <li>THis product is great and comparable to other products like it.</li>
            <li>I am now using Loreal sulfate free shampoo, and so far I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>It smells great and doesn&#x27;t take as much product to do the same job as WEN, what a savings!</li>
            <li>I just wanted to give a review as I really wasn&#x27;t expecting such great results.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff if for no other</li>
            <li>It may work better for normal hair that is not color-treated.</li>
            <li>For me, the product makes my hair more oily than normal at the scalp.</li>
            <li>Mine is stick straight, super fine and basically just used to hang on my head...</li>
            <li>RECOMMEND HIGHLY!!!</li>
            <li>My hair did feel soft and healthy but not any more than a normal shampoo/conditioner that works on my hair.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It smells good is about the only positive thing I can say for it.</li>
            <li>So much so that brushing my hair is a huge hassle.</li>
            <li>One thing I really like about it is that the scent is extremely light.</li>
            <li>I found this product by chance at my local grocery store for around 7 dollars, and after one wash, it felt amazing.  </li>
            <li>Although this product made my hair smell really great, it completely dried out my hair.</li>
            <li>The SG product made the brown color in my hair more prominent than it had with shampoo,  so the occasional gray hair I have doesn&#x27;t show up as much.  </li>
            <li>: No dandruff control, need to wash hair more frequently</li>
            <li>I would do a free commercial for them: -)</li>
            <li>My hair was clean soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>It was nice for traveling because I only had to bring one thing</li>
            <li>Welcome back my old friend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ill</li>
            <li>All but one time, I was very pleased with the results and the way my hair was once dry.  </li>
            <li>I used Wen for a year because people were saying that was the only product that they used for there hair that made it look healthy, well it didn&#x27;t do much for mine after I wasted all those bucks, so I started searching around and ran across this product and its the best for the price no frizz made my hair feel so soft and didn&#x27;t shed my hair when washing it, also I left it in for 5 minutes as well and still looks good if your hair tangle like mine</li>
            <li>The reviews were right...</li>
            <li>Best $5 I have spent in a long time!</li>
            <li>I have very fine and fragile hair and have been using Wen for a couple of years.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s certainly nothing like the routine I used to have!</li>
            <li>I do add another conditioner to my own hair, which tends to be on the dry side.</li>
            <li>Once dry, it looked clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>I very much wanted to like this shampoo/cleanser.  </li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable at 4.00 a bottle.</li>
            <li>My hair is baby fine with some natural curl and prone to frizz.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a trial and error kind of person who wants stiff that works and is easy to deal with.  </li>
            <li>own hair,  which is about 12 or so inches long all around, starting to gray just was left clean,  smooth,  my semi-Straight texture brought out, and strong.  </li>
            <li>I would spend the $$ on a better shampoo from your local store - not this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have a different type of hair then maybe it will be ok for you</li>
            <li>I used to condition, deep condition, detangle, and use a frizz control product just to get through my morning routine and have OK hair.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what my hair needed.</li>
            <li>I had been researching the Deva Curl product line, which is pretty pricey.  </li>
            <li>First off, I would first off like to describe the type of hair that I have.</li>
            <li>Most of the people writhing these reviews claimed that this product was very similar to WEN.</li>
            <li>Is the first review.</li>
            <li>Also, now that I know I can get it at my local CVS, I won&#x27;t have to pay for shipping anymore :)</li>
            <li>That was my first tip that this was what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased that I have to buy only one thing</li>
            <li>Also, the product does say you can use it as a leave-in conditioner but compared to my current favorite ([[ASIN:B008CC4FPY Herbal Essences</li>
            <li>It actually cleans my hair better than Wen but may not condition quite as well.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it smell better, but the peppermint makes your scalp tingly &amp; it doesn&#x27;t leave oily residue after either.</li>
            <li>more then Fekkai has over the last year.</li>
            <li>However, it rinses easily, detangles decently, &amp; leaves your hair feeling soft &amp; not greasy.</li>
            <li>how well I liked them, are:  WEN, Lisa Rachel Conditioner &amp; Cleanser, Pantene Pro-V Truly Natural Co-Wash Cleansing Conditioner, L&#x27;Oreal EverCreme Conditioning Cleanser, Burt&#x27;s Bees Gud Red Ruby Groovy Shampoo (which is not a co-wash nor conditioning cleanser) and</li>
            <li>As I was blow drying, my hair literally felt silky, smooth, and healthy, without feeling heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li>My hair also tangles very easily when wet.  </li>
            <li>At first the fact that there is no lather is very strange but the scent was pleasant enough to press forward.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical when I bought this from a local drugstore at first, but I love, love, LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I use it every other day and my hair is super soft and shiny and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as good if not better than WEN.</li>
            <li>I even used my daughters fine toothed comb on my wet hair and it slid right through!  </li>
            <li>If I have to spend a little more, you know what they say you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate so it is great for adding moisture back in.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected. :)</li>
            <li>It made my hair so silky soft and super shiny.</li>
            <li>(like it was with my last attempt at CO-washing), and was easy to comb/brush/dry.</li>
            <li>this stuff makes your hair super soft.  </li>
            <li>I wish it came in a large size for purchase.</li>
            <li>It smells great, but unlike wen I had a very hard time combing the product through my hair in the shower</li>
            <li>Salon Grafix cleansing conditioner had pretty high reviews.</li>
            <li>I found all of these clean better if you let it sit for an additional minute or so, just long enough to wash your body and face.</li>
            <li>It even keeps my new growth soft, easy to comb thru and the new growth lays well with heat from an iron or tension from rollers.  </li>
            <li>This is something you can&#x27;t really tell by just opening the bottle &amp; giving it a sniff either.</li>
            <li>SG was in the middle in terms of price point and available at a drug store like Revlon,  just in case you don&#x27;t have Prime or just need a bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not buying wen and discounted it from my trials, too much drama..</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used sulfate free shampoo/conditioner for years,  deep conditioned 2 times</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ladies, be careful of boastful reviews, that most probably are manufacturers trying to sell their product.</li>
            <li>From the reviews I can see this works for a lot of people, but for me it absolutely did not.  </li>
            <li>Everyone wants the hair they don&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t out much money.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t looking to expect much from it</li>
            <li>When it said the product works for all hair types, I didn&#x27;t really believe it.  </li>
            <li>Though it does go fast.</li>
            <li>I have been using WEN for a year now and really like how my hair feels, but I just can&#x27;t afford it anymore.</li>
            <li>so this is too much for me to use as a conditioning shampoo</li>
            <li>I much prefer Loreal EverCreme Cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>I saw this and decided to try it since I&#x27;ve really been wanting to try Wen but don&#x27;t want to spend the money.</li>
            <li>The texture and the color of the shampoo really do feel satin.</li>
            <li>well I think that was a bit much conditioning.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cleans and conditions hair very well.  </li>
            <li>If you use this on those condition days, it might work out very well.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>This cleansing conditioner works very well on my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me, it rinsed out very well</li>
            <li>and I can wear my hair straight for three days after washing with using baby powder in the mornings at the root.</li>
            <li>- really makes the color &#x27;pop&#x27;.</li>
            <li>as much breakage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didnt really care for this brand</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m switching back to my old, cheap shampoo with no gimmicks!</li>
            <li>so psychologically you feel like you&#x27;re not getting the hair clean</li>
            <li>But no, very clean hair and feels healthy.</li>
            <li>It makes it super easy to brush out my long hair when it&#x27;s damp after washing, which has been a challenge with regular shampoos before.</li>
            <li>Pretty much the exact opposite of Wen.</li>
            <li>Think I&#x27;ve found a new product for washing my hair!</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t feel as smooth and soft when wet, and it had more frizz when dry.  </li>
            <li>You have to use a good amount to cover your hair and make it thick and creamy like Wen, and my hair feels soft and conditioned every time.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised!  </li>
            <li>So for me, it wasn&#x27;t a miracle product than tamed frizz and left my hair more low maintenance than normal.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It leaves me clean just as long as shampoo did, but without the damage, hair shed, snap/weakness, etc.</li>
            <li>I picked up two more bottles of the Salon Grafix tonight at Walgreens for less than here, but if I couldn&#x27;t get it where I live, I&#x27;d buy it here at this price, which is today nine and thirty nine.</li>
            <li>My hair actually felt soft and clean.</li>
            <li>It works great keeps down my frizz  and adds a little umpf to my hair however i have a greasy scalp</li>
            <li>The one downside is that it really is meant to be used frequently</li>
            <li>and WOW I really notice a difference.</li>
            <li>and then I would use my normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>Nothing really satisfied me until I started using this cleansing conditioner a few days ago.  </li>
            <li>one more thing dont waste your money on Wen at all</li>
            <li>Worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>I had the thin hair one, and loved it.</li>
            <li>It does ok on the first day, but on the second day I felt like my hair had a waxy, slightly coated feel to it.  </li>
            <li>First let me give you the scoop: I have baby fine that is thining and has never grown past my sholder blades.</li>
            <li>have fine,  limp, semi - straight hair.  </li>
            <li>When I came out of the shower, my wet hair even felt clean, not sticky or oily</li>
            <li>I finally found it online at Walgreens.com (was only available in one store in my area).</li>
            <li>My hair is oily at the roots and super dry on the ends.  </li>
            <li>And on my very fine blonde hair, it weighs it down.  </li>
            <li>Using it daily will cause your hair to pretty oily by the end of the day though.</li>
            <li>Currently the weather here is hot,  humid</li>
            <li>The first time I used it left my hair in knots and snapped some of my hair off.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need a detangler to comb out my hair, needed nothing to control frizzies and my hair is sooooooo soft!  </li>
            <li>I have long, fine, wavy/curly hair and it takes about 20 pumps per wash, so one bottle last me about 2 weeks</li>
            <li>After a few weeks, I am a true fan!</li>
            <li>and I have to be super careful</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just too heavy for fine hair, I believe.  </li>
            <li>Even after blowing it dry every hair was right where I wanted it, soft, manageable and SHINY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only comments are: The pump bottle is a little more work than I&#x27;d like in the shower</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t pull out too much hair when combing it wet, but this product really minimizes this significantly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it does not leave your hair soft and conditioned.  </li>
            <li>It nearly scared me off &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>But it is no where near Wen.  </li>
            <li>Of the six products I have tried so far, this is the worst!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The products I have tried so far, listed by</li>
            <li>and I have started using it on my 5-year old boy&#x27;s curly mane</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair shiney and soft.</li>
            <li>and I wear my hair natural.  </li>
            <li>My hair was so soft and shiny</li>
            <li>The next night I used this product again, and much to my dismay I awakened with hair that looked, and felt, like it belonged on a scarecrow.</li>
            <li>natural curly and problem with frizz.</li>
            <li>I tried WEN and was looking for a less expensive way to get a good clean and soft result.  </li>
            <li>Surprised this is not being mentioned in the reviews.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and somehow tames flyaways.  </li>
            <li>The first time, I went by the instructions on the bottle and it ended up being too much product, left on for too long.</li>
            <li>I saw this at the drugstore and wanted to try it since the price was reasonable (cheaper than a bottle of regular shampoo).  </li>
            <li>I have not found anything else to make it soft like this product does.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it is my hair type, (long, straight, medium thickness), but it did not cleanse, nor did it condition!  </li>
            <li>John Frieda Hair serum &amp; a setting lotion gives me the desired affects without frequent trips to my stylist.</li>
            <li>My hair is not as dry and after the first wash</li>
            <li>I love the Wen products but am tired of paying the high price.  </li>
            <li>so i either have to wash everyday or make sure i have dry shampoo near by.</li>
            <li>I first bought this product thinking it was wen in a local cvs, later finding out it wasn&#x27;t wen</li>
            <li>Because of my hair length (waist-length), I really needed to use around 9 pumps, instead of the 7 it indicates on the bottle for long hair.  </li>
            <li>Let me say, from the first time I&#x27;ve used it, my hair is shiny, soft and my wide tooth comb barely hits any snags.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>Using a pump so many times is also a little odd in the shower and it does not feel like that amount of product will go very far.</li>
            <li>It does not lather at all, so it&#x27;s like putting straight conditioner on dirty hair (which honestly, I&#x27;m still getting used to).</li>
            <li>At first I was hesitant to use so much, due to the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>When I stumbled upon this Healthy Hair Nutrition for a third of the price I was anxious to try it!</li>
            <li>I have fine, thick, curly hair that I wear curly and straighten (with products).</li>
            <li>Over the past year, I&#x27;ve gotten my natural hair color back and have gotten it to a pretty decent length.  </li>
            <li>I have a fine soft long hair that is over two and a half foot long</li>
            <li>I had been wanting to try Wen for a long time, but refuse to pay that much for a hair product that would not last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I am finding it really difficult getting used to the fact that it is a lotion and does not have the normal surfactant sudsing properties most shampoos have.  </li>
            <li>long story short, it&#x27;s a real pain in the butt.</li>
            <li>, so apparently they both work for her.</li>
            <li>and I chose not to damage but using natural products as much as possible.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft and easier to manage than traditional shampoos.  </li>
            <li>After frying it into oblivion, I finally decided to get it back to normal.  </li>
            <li>All hair types are different regardless of similarities so keep in mind that this cleanser combined with other desired products &amp; even your water type can contribute to your individual success or lack there of.</li>
            <li>My hair tangled easily, had fly-aways, was dull, lifeless and did not style well!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After a few days of using it I noticed my husband&#x27;s hair color looked less gray and more red than it had on shampoo.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought no, but I went and purchased this a few days ago.  </li>
            <li>This Salon Grafix version really calms down my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>With normal shampoo/conditioner I wash every other day and did the same with the SG product.</li>
            <li>A win-win for me since 3 other people live in my house.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not worth paying twice as much and waiting who knows how long to actually get it.</li>

            <li> All in all its a great lower cost substitute for Wen.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s color-treated hair looks great</li>
            <li> but I heard great things about using conditioner shampoo</li>
            <li> This version, as well as, the formula for find/oily hair are AMAZING!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very happy with this and am glad there is an affordable alternative to Wen.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been this healthy or smelled this great!!  </li>
            <li> Great product at a good price.</li>
            <li> best scent - so clean - very nice and great price for the product</li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t add volume, I&#x27;m so happy with how it feels and moves - amazing.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s good though for 12oz. of product.</li>
            <li> They all smell good but are not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does smell really good, though.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve always heard good things.</li>
            <li> You do have to use a fair amount, I use between 8-10 pumps.</li>
            <li> They were all about 60% as good as Wen.  </li>
            <li> this stuff makes hair look good without even trying.  </li>
            <li> Works just as good as wen, without the wen price</li>
            <li> Believe how beautiful and soft and wonderful smelling my hair is.</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked better!</li>
            <li> It is BETTER than WEN!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, scent and all!</li>
            <li> I also love the smell!</li>
            <li> I have tried Wen, and Salon Grafix works much better!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> I found with Salon Graphix, I can use it 2-3 days in a row and my hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li> It is simply amazing.  </li>
            <li> (it just came today and it smells amazing, btw).  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t notice any smell once you rinse it out of your hair which is nice for those of us who don&#x27;t like a lot of fragrance.</li>
            <li> and it is ok but doesn&#x27;t smell as good.</li>
            <li> I had to use conditioning oil and a separate conditioner to get any kind of shine before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It still kept its nice shine.</li>
            <li> For example, Aussie for mending split ends (great shampoo), Aveeno Moisturizing (okay shampoo) and many others.</li>
            <li> there were so many reviews claiming it was as good as wen.</li>
            <li> Good results whether letting hair mostly air-dry, or taking the time to style and blow-dry</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of this product and the price was better than Wen</li>
            <li> I used to be like this, but I loved the smell of this product that I started using it every day and haven&#x27;t regretted it yet. :-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new favorite!!!</li>
            <li> this is really great shampoo, it is a great value and leaves your hair shiny and soft, I love it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really more effective in the shower than out.</li>
            <li> I was always a shampoo and conditioner girl, I&#x27;m making a switch because of how wonderful my hair feels and how soft it is.  </li>
            <li> (My hair happens to be very fine and always tangles after washing</li>
            <li> No matter how many pumps you use</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will absolutely LOVE your hair.</li>
            <li> I used it because I saw a review that said it got rid of dandruff, and it does EVEN MORE than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although this product does leave my hair feeling like it&#x27;s in better condition than it was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also like to ad that I tried the Loreal cleansing conditioner also to see if it was better.</li>
            <li> Just saying...stick with Salon Grafix &amp; you&#x27;ll be pleased</li>
            <li> and I must say WEN is still more moisturizing and leaves hair more shiny than this product.</li>
            <li> i also tried loreal cleansing conditioners and even the smell of this product is better and softer nd not as overpowering as the loreal the loreal does condition mutch better than this product.</li>
            <li> And I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One did ok,  but was more money</li>
            <li> I just need to be able to get my hands on it</li>
            <li> You use about 2 healthy heaping spoons of this stuff to get the job done.</li>
            <li> can blowdry if I want without going,  ok this will cause split ends.</li>
            <li> I always had a feeling there should be something better then shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair and needed a conditioner on top of this product to get a comb through it after showering.</li>
            <li> If you are prone to oily hair rather than dryness, this may be a better choice for you.</li>
            <li> a try at the suggestion of my stylist, and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t strip my hair</li>
            <li> I love creme cleansers for my relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> I still love it.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product today because of a co worker telling me about how great it was and works as well or better than Wen, and at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy and am curious to see if I&#x27;m still this happy after a week or two of use.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> This is a gift, but I have some and love it.</li>
            <li> Bottles and glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love it and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I fell in  love with WEN.</li>
            <li> However, I could not keep forking out 50 t0 60 dollars every time i needed to buy some more WEN.</li>
            <li> I noticed my ends looked better.</li>
            <li> Cheaper, smells better, and does a better job.</li>
            <li> and it never got better.</li>
            <li> I love cleansing conditioner and wanted to try something else.</li>
            <li> I love this product and when I&#x27;m finished w/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bragged about how much I love my hair now (</li>
            <li> Just ok.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> but I noticed that when I use it continuously I see more results.</li>
            <li> Better than regular shampoo, but still not the best.</li>
            <li> You may love it or you may not</li>
            <li> I wanted to try Wen but this product is much more affordable and does the job.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It was a much better result than \\&quot;washing\\&quot; my hair with conditioner alone which never quite seemed to do the trick.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I suppose this will suffice if you are OK with off brands and their difference in output.  </li>
            <li> Because I use it weekly I am able to go longer between relaxers.  </li>
            <li> This is a better deal for the money than L&#x27;oreal Evercreme, and much more affordable than Wen.</li>
            <li> Kind of wishing that I could give you a before and after picture of my hair; this really is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I love my hair, it really is lovely, but my scalp is another story.</li>
            <li> hair feels greasy and cant go more then 2 days without washing it again.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ive been using Fekkai for about a year and really love it</li>
            <li> Works like Wen for sure but the smell of this won&#x27;t keep me using it.</li>
            <li> They all,  but the Revlon, rinsed well with warm to cool water and didn&#x27;t strip the hair.</li>
            <li> This product cleansn and conditions my brushes like nothin&#x27; else and keeps my hair smelling pretty darn good all day.  </li>
            <li> but first I tried SG and loved it.  </li>
            <li> for now, it&#x27;s just beautiful and soft.</li>
            <li> Hence, price point and ease of finding the stuff became even more important to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks for such a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and it leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> but it is still a good product i would recommend leaving it on much longer than directed tho.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t just pick it up as easily.</li>
            <li> The Deva No Poo leaves my hair and scalp clean, my hair feels silky and healthy, and calms the frizz.  </li>
            <li> The pump swivels too easily...  </li>
            <li> I use this on a dailey basis and my hair is easy to comb through afterwards.</li>
            <li> Hair combs easily.  </li>
            <li> has a strong perfume scent instead of a softer lavender or tea-tree oil scent.</li>
            <li> My hair feels completely clean, but so soft, and it smells great.  </li>
            <li> It shines even though I have fine hair and wash often.</li>
            <li> If I use it once a week and was with shampoo the rest of the week, it works fine and my hair seems sillier than just using shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and wavy andvu was hoping this was my frizz solution.  </li>
            <li> My hair is curly, brown, fine, frizzy, and not color treated.</li>
            <li> I just hope I don&#x27;t run through it too quickly!  </li>
            <li> This is the first cleansing conditioner I have tried and I&#x27;m glad it is because I&#x27;m really happy with this product so far.</li>
            <li> Has taken care of my scalp issue, and is so gentle and effective that my hair is full and lovely again.</li>
            <li> You would think a Cleansing Conditioner would make your hair soft, tangle free (or close to it), manageable and bright.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product yesterday at walgreens, buy one get one free</li>
            <li> SG makes my curls even and smooth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;During the 5 minutes the directions said to leave it on, I occasionally massaged it into my scalp and hair, noting how great it smells.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really important to RINSE RINSE RINSE.</li>
            <li> if I used a cheap .99 cent bottle of V05.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found this at Target a while back and loved it and have not been able to find it since so I look on Amazon</li>
            <li> but to my surprise it really is good and leaves my hair feeling moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased to to find a good clensing conditioner that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune, emit fumes while it sits on my hair, or make my skin burn and turn red.</li>
            <li> It was easy to wash the product out, and easy to comb my hair out right after I got out of the shower.</li>
            <li> After first use I noticed more friz and flyaways which I never experience with WEN</li>
            <li> I have pretty healthy hair</li>
            <li> But I love this product so much!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and after 2 weeks my hair is much smoother and shiner than it has been in years!  </li>
            <li> When I first tried this shampoo, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I cared for the scent.</li>
            <li> but Im pretty sure it wont impress me</li>
            <li> If it continues that way, I will be a happy customer for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Revlon didn&#x27;t really clean well,  </li>
            <li> My hair had no body and did not feel like it was clean.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a no-soap solution for keeping my hair clean and not greasy.</li>
            <li> and my hair felt clean</li>
            <li> and yes I did the squeak test too to see if it was clean.  </li>
            <li> It is light but does go away quickly.</li>
            <li> Plus it never felt or looked clean.  </li>
            <li> I give this product 1 star for the pleasant fragrance only.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Those I still have to try:  Hair One Cleansing Conditioner, Nada Poo Co-Wash Conditioner, Blue Magic Gentle Conditioning Cleanser, Macadamia Natural Oil Flawless Cleansing Conditioner, Hair N Now Cleansing Conditioner, Renpure Solutions Ren Cleansing Conditioner, Palmer&#x27;s Olive Oil Formula Cleansing Conditioner and Mizani Co-Wash Conditioning Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who has GORGEOUS hair and told me she never, ever washes it, and only uses cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Scent reminds me of old decorative bath soaps that my grandmother kept in the bathroom (the kind you didn&#x27;t DARE use).  </li>
            <li> And I really like the scent better too.</li>
            <li> And did not achieve the beautiful hair that other products provided!  </li>
            <li> I dont have to do anything else to my hair but air dry and its truely soft and beautiful!</li>
            <li> It left my hair silky soft, smelling great and wonderfully clean!</li>
            <li> THis product is great and comparable to other products like it.</li>
            <li> I am now using Loreal sulfate free shampoo, and so far I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> It smells great and doesn&#x27;t take as much product to do the same job as WEN, what a savings!</li>
            <li> I just wanted to give a review as I really wasn&#x27;t expecting such great results.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff if for no other</li>
            <li> It may work better for normal hair that is not color-treated.</li>
            <li> For me, the product makes my hair more oily than normal at the scalp.</li>
            <li> Mine is stick straight, super fine and basically just used to hang on my head...</li>
            <li> RECOMMEND HIGHLY!!!</li>
            <li> My hair did feel soft and healthy but not any more than a normal shampoo/conditioner that works on my hair.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It smells good is about the only positive thing I can say for it.</li>
            <li> So much so that brushing my hair is a huge hassle.</li>
            <li> One thing I really like about it is that the scent is extremely light.</li>
            <li> I found this product by chance at my local grocery store for around 7 dollars, and after one wash, it felt amazing.  </li>
            <li> Although this product made my hair smell really great, it completely dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> The SG product made the brown color in my hair more prominent than it had with shampoo,  so the occasional gray hair I have doesn&#x27;t show up as much.  </li>
            <li> : No dandruff control, need to wash hair more frequently</li>
            <li> I would do a free commercial for them: -)</li>
            <li> My hair was clean soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> It was nice for traveling because I only had to bring one thing</li>
            <li> Welcome back my old friend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ill</li>
            <li> All but one time, I was very pleased with the results and the way my hair was once dry.  </li>
            <li> I used Wen for a year because people were saying that was the only product that they used for there hair that made it look healthy, well it didn&#x27;t do much for mine after I wasted all those bucks, so I started searching around and ran across this product and its the best for the price no frizz made my hair feel so soft and didn&#x27;t shed my hair when washing it, also I left it in for 5 minutes as well and still looks good if your hair tangle like mine</li>
            <li> The reviews were right...</li>
            <li> Best $5 I have spent in a long time!</li>
            <li> I have very fine and fragile hair and have been using Wen for a couple of years.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s certainly nothing like the routine I used to have!</li>
            <li> I do add another conditioner to my own hair, which tends to be on the dry side.</li>
            <li> Once dry, it looked clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> I very much wanted to like this shampoo/cleanser.  </li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable at 4.00 a bottle.</li>
            <li> My hair is baby fine with some natural curl and prone to frizz.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a trial and error kind of person who wants stiff that works and is easy to deal with.  </li>
            <li> own hair,  which is about 12 or so inches long all around, starting to gray just was left clean,  smooth,  my semi-Straight texture brought out, and strong.  </li>
            <li> I would spend the $$ on a better shampoo from your local store - not this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have a different type of hair then maybe it will be ok for you</li>
            <li> I used to condition, deep condition, detangle, and use a frizz control product just to get through my morning routine and have OK hair.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what my hair needed.</li>
            <li> I had been researching the Deva Curl product line, which is pretty pricey.  </li>
            <li> First off, I would first off like to describe the type of hair that I have.</li>
            <li> Most of the people writhing these reviews claimed that this product was very similar to WEN.</li>
            <li> Is the first review.</li>
            <li> Also, now that I know I can get it at my local CVS, I won&#x27;t have to pay for shipping anymore :)</li>
            <li> That was my first tip that this was what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased that I have to buy only one thing</li>
            <li> Also, the product does say you can use it as a leave-in conditioner but compared to my current favorite ([[ASIN:B008CC4FPY Herbal Essences</li>
            <li> It actually cleans my hair better than Wen but may not condition quite as well.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it smell better, but the peppermint makes your scalp tingly &amp; it doesn&#x27;t leave oily residue after either.</li>
            <li> more then Fekkai has over the last year.</li>
            <li> However, it rinses easily, detangles decently, &amp; leaves your hair feeling soft &amp; not greasy.</li>
            <li> how well I liked them, are:  WEN, Lisa Rachel Conditioner &amp; Cleanser, Pantene Pro-V Truly Natural Co-Wash Cleansing Conditioner, L&#x27;Oreal EverCreme Conditioning Cleanser, Burt&#x27;s Bees Gud Red Ruby Groovy Shampoo (which is not a co-wash nor conditioning cleanser) and</li>
            <li> As I was blow drying, my hair literally felt silky, smooth, and healthy, without feeling heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> My hair also tangles very easily when wet.  </li>
            <li> At first the fact that there is no lather is very strange but the scent was pleasant enough to press forward.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought this from a local drugstore at first, but I love, love, LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I use it every other day and my hair is super soft and shiny and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good if not better than WEN.</li>
            <li> I even used my daughters fine toothed comb on my wet hair and it slid right through!  </li>
            <li> If I have to spend a little more, you know what they say you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate so it is great for adding moisture back in.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. :)</li>
            <li> It made my hair so silky soft and super shiny.</li>
            <li> (like it was with my last attempt at CO-washing), and was easy to comb/brush/dry.</li>
            <li> this stuff makes your hair super soft.  </li>
            <li> I wish it came in a large size for purchase.</li>
            <li> It smells great, but unlike wen I had a very hard time combing the product through my hair in the shower</li>
            <li> Salon Grafix cleansing conditioner had pretty high reviews.</li>
            <li> I found all of these clean better if you let it sit for an additional minute or so, just long enough to wash your body and face.</li>
            <li> It even keeps my new growth soft, easy to comb thru and the new growth lays well with heat from an iron or tension from rollers.  </li>
            <li> This is something you can&#x27;t really tell by just opening the bottle &amp; giving it a sniff either.</li>
            <li> SG was in the middle in terms of price point and available at a drug store like Revlon,  just in case you don&#x27;t have Prime or just need a bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not buying wen and discounted it from my trials, too much drama..</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used sulfate free shampoo/conditioner for years,  deep conditioned 2 times</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ladies, be careful of boastful reviews, that most probably are manufacturers trying to sell their product.</li>
            <li> From the reviews I can see this works for a lot of people, but for me it absolutely did not.  </li>
            <li> Everyone wants the hair they don&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t out much money.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking to expect much from it</li>
            <li> When it said the product works for all hair types, I didn&#x27;t really believe it.  </li>
            <li> Though it does go fast.</li>
            <li> I have been using WEN for a year now and really like how my hair feels, but I just can&#x27;t afford it anymore.</li>
            <li> so this is too much for me to use as a conditioning shampoo</li>
            <li> I much prefer Loreal EverCreme Cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> I saw this and decided to try it since I&#x27;ve really been wanting to try Wen but don&#x27;t want to spend the money.</li>
            <li> The texture and the color of the shampoo really do feel satin.</li>
            <li> well I think that was a bit much conditioning.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cleans and conditions hair very well.  </li>
            <li> If you use this on those condition days, it might work out very well.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> This cleansing conditioner works very well on my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me, it rinsed out very well</li>
            <li> and I can wear my hair straight for three days after washing with using baby powder in the mornings at the root.</li>
            <li> - really makes the color &#x27;pop&#x27;.</li>
            <li> as much breakage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didnt really care for this brand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m switching back to my old, cheap shampoo with no gimmicks!</li>
            <li> so psychologically you feel like you&#x27;re not getting the hair clean</li>
            <li> But no, very clean hair and feels healthy.</li>
            <li> It makes it super easy to brush out my long hair when it&#x27;s damp after washing, which has been a challenge with regular shampoos before.</li>
            <li> Pretty much the exact opposite of Wen.</li>
            <li> Think I&#x27;ve found a new product for washing my hair!</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t feel as smooth and soft when wet, and it had more frizz when dry.  </li>
            <li> You have to use a good amount to cover your hair and make it thick and creamy like Wen, and my hair feels soft and conditioned every time.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised!  </li>
            <li> So for me, it wasn&#x27;t a miracle product than tamed frizz and left my hair more low maintenance than normal.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It leaves me clean just as long as shampoo did, but without the damage, hair shed, snap/weakness, etc.</li>
            <li> I picked up two more bottles of the Salon Grafix tonight at Walgreens for less than here, but if I couldn&#x27;t get it where I live, I&#x27;d buy it here at this price, which is today nine and thirty nine.</li>
            <li> My hair actually felt soft and clean.</li>
            <li> It works great keeps down my frizz  and adds a little umpf to my hair however i have a greasy scalp</li>
            <li> The one downside is that it really is meant to be used frequently</li>
            <li> and WOW I really notice a difference.</li>
            <li> and then I would use my normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> Nothing really satisfied me until I started using this cleansing conditioner a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> one more thing dont waste your money on Wen at all</li>
            <li> Worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li> I had the thin hair one, and loved it.</li>
            <li> It does ok on the first day, but on the second day I felt like my hair had a waxy, slightly coated feel to it.  </li>
            <li> First let me give you the scoop: I have baby fine that is thining and has never grown past my sholder blades.</li>
            <li> have fine,  limp, semi - straight hair.  </li>
            <li> When I came out of the shower, my wet hair even felt clean, not sticky or oily</li>
            <li> I finally found it online at Walgreens.com (was only available in one store in my area).</li>
            <li> My hair is oily at the roots and super dry on the ends.  </li>
            <li> And on my very fine blonde hair, it weighs it down.  </li>
            <li> Using it daily will cause your hair to pretty oily by the end of the day though.</li>
            <li> Currently the weather here is hot,  humid</li>
            <li> The first time I used it left my hair in knots and snapped some of my hair off.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need a detangler to comb out my hair, needed nothing to control frizzies and my hair is sooooooo soft!  </li>
            <li> I have long, fine, wavy/curly hair and it takes about 20 pumps per wash, so one bottle last me about 2 weeks</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I am a true fan!</li>
            <li> and I have to be super careful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too heavy for fine hair, I believe.  </li>
            <li> Even after blowing it dry every hair was right where I wanted it, soft, manageable and SHINY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only comments are: The pump bottle is a little more work than I&#x27;d like in the shower</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t pull out too much hair when combing it wet, but this product really minimizes this significantly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it does not leave your hair soft and conditioned.  </li>
            <li> It nearly scared me off &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> But it is no where near Wen.  </li>
            <li> Of the six products I have tried so far, this is the worst!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The products I have tried so far, listed by</li>
            <li> and I have started using it on my 5-year old boy&#x27;s curly mane</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair shiney and soft.</li>
            <li> and I wear my hair natural.  </li>
            <li> My hair was so soft and shiny</li>
            <li> The next night I used this product again, and much to my dismay I awakened with hair that looked, and felt, like it belonged on a scarecrow.</li>
            <li> natural curly and problem with frizz.</li>
            <li> I tried WEN and was looking for a less expensive way to get a good clean and soft result.  </li>
            <li> Surprised this is not being mentioned in the reviews.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and somehow tames flyaways.  </li>
            <li> The first time, I went by the instructions on the bottle and it ended up being too much product, left on for too long.</li>
            <li> I saw this at the drugstore and wanted to try it since the price was reasonable (cheaper than a bottle of regular shampoo).  </li>
            <li> I have not found anything else to make it soft like this product does.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it is my hair type, (long, straight, medium thickness), but it did not cleanse, nor did it condition!  </li>
            <li> John Frieda Hair serum &amp; a setting lotion gives me the desired affects without frequent trips to my stylist.</li>
            <li> My hair is not as dry and after the first wash</li>
            <li> I love the Wen products but am tired of paying the high price.  </li>
            <li> so i either have to wash everyday or make sure i have dry shampoo near by.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product thinking it was wen in a local cvs, later finding out it wasn&#x27;t wen</li>
            <li> Because of my hair length (waist-length), I really needed to use around 9 pumps, instead of the 7 it indicates on the bottle for long hair.  </li>
            <li> Let me say, from the first time I&#x27;ve used it, my hair is shiny, soft and my wide tooth comb barely hits any snags.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> Using a pump so many times is also a little odd in the shower and it does not feel like that amount of product will go very far.</li>
            <li> It does not lather at all, so it&#x27;s like putting straight conditioner on dirty hair (which honestly, I&#x27;m still getting used to).</li>
            <li> At first I was hesitant to use so much, due to the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> When I stumbled upon this Healthy Hair Nutrition for a third of the price I was anxious to try it!</li>
            <li> I have fine, thick, curly hair that I wear curly and straighten (with products).</li>
            <li> Over the past year, I&#x27;ve gotten my natural hair color back and have gotten it to a pretty decent length.  </li>
            <li> I have a fine soft long hair that is over two and a half foot long</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to try Wen for a long time, but refuse to pay that much for a hair product that would not last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I am finding it really difficult getting used to the fact that it is a lotion and does not have the normal surfactant sudsing properties most shampoos have.  </li>
            <li> long story short, it&#x27;s a real pain in the butt.</li>
            <li> , so apparently they both work for her.</li>
            <li> and I chose not to damage but using natural products as much as possible.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft and easier to manage than traditional shampoos.  </li>
            <li> After frying it into oblivion, I finally decided to get it back to normal.  </li>
            <li> All hair types are different regardless of similarities so keep in mind that this cleanser combined with other desired products &amp; even your water type can contribute to your individual success or lack there of.</li>
            <li> My hair tangled easily, had fly-aways, was dull, lifeless and did not style well!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few days of using it I noticed my husband&#x27;s hair color looked less gray and more red than it had on shampoo.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought no, but I went and purchased this a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> This Salon Grafix version really calms down my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> With normal shampoo/conditioner I wash every other day and did the same with the SG product.</li>
            <li> A win-win for me since 3 other people live in my house.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth paying twice as much and waiting who knows how long to actually get it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve now decided that using it frequently means over-conditioning the hair, and it ends up getting greasy looking faster than with other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> The next day, I tried one squirt left on just long enough to wash my face.  </li>
            <li> This gets the conditioner that has bound to the dirt all rinsed out, leaving behind clean conditioned hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft and shiny and not weighed down.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it daily for a long time though, so I can&#x27;t say if continued use will cause a buildup or make your scalp area feel greasy or not.</li>
            <li> Not nearly the same as Wen.</li>
            <li> I saw a commercial for Wen and was reminded that I had wanted to try it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I tried this cleansing conditioner, used it directly as said in the directions, and I felt as if it weighed my hair down, flattened it, stole all of its body, and just made it feel stringy as well.</li>
            <li> So far, the itching has calmed down to almost nothing.  </li>
            <li> Also left my hair feeling very dry which is the opposite of why I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> This cleans but my hair felt dry after rinsing and not a big fan of the scent.</li>
            <li> In any case, my hair is dry and short.</li>
            <li> It left my hair dry and feeling like a clump of tangled wool, even after a month of using it at directed.</li>
            <li> My hair is left lifeless and dry.  </li>
            <li> This left my hair dry and course feeling.  </li>
            <li> In fact, after giving it multiple tries, I am ready to throw it away; what a waste!</li>
            <li> My hair is dark blond, a few inches below my shoulders, very fine but also very thick and graying, I&#x27;m approaching 50!  </li>
            <li> I usually use high quality salon shampoos but wanted to reduce the amount I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair like me</li>
            <li> the meantime, I was looking for something less harsh (something that did not lather) and to eliminate my previous steps for washing my hair (shampoo, deep conditioning, hot oil treatment, drying and styling).</li>
            <li> My hair is color treated and dry because of the grey, which never holds color very long.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and usually very dry with highlights and shampoo is not part of my everyday routine because of the dryness.</li>
            <li> , my scalp couldn&#x27;t decide if it was oily or dry...  </li>
            <li> but it can be on the dry side sometimes.</li>
            <li> But it still always manages to be greasy at the roots and incredibly dry at the ends.  </li>
            <li> Relaxing does dry out the hair</li>
            <li> This stuff made my hair look thicker, but felt dry and still frizzy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thinking it would help me like my hair seemed like it was dry as ever.</li>
            <li> so I have to wash my hair every day, but my ends aren&#x27;t dry and bushy anymore</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind because I have a product that takes away the oiliness when I blow dry</li>
            <li> It was as dry as straw after it did dry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy and seriously, my hair has volume, flips up at the ends and even looks like I used a curling iron, even though I&#x27;m way too lazy for that!</li>
            <li> I bought this product in hopes of finding a single product that could detangle and condition my hair.</li>
            <li> Initially I was worried it would weigh down my hair or make it greasy-it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I bought this after using wen and it made my hair feel so gross weighed down and oily</li>
            <li> The only down side is this one compared to wen</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker considering the product cuts down on shower time overall.</li>
            <li> Actually a bit less because I&#x27;m using fewer</li>
            <li> I have a friend that swears by the cleansing conditioners, and says that is the secret to how she grew her hair long so fast.</li>
            <li> I saw this product advertised in a magazine and thought I would give it a try and find it very similar to Wen, but the price is much less.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I was left with a tangled unclean mess of wet hair that I could not get a comb thru.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions and tweaked a little bit but got the same results.</li>
            <li> You can use a wide comb to get in any of these products if you want.</li>
            <li> I can braid or put it in a ponytail holder wet and not think it could break my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only a few days after I ordered it I saw that it was sold at walmart for a lot cheaper</li>
            <li> so I dismissed the idea of trying Wen and a few weeks later I ran across an article about Salon Grafix cleaner conditioner.</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t frizzy but still thick &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> I have long brown hair that is slightly on the thick side with lose natural waves.</li>
            <li> Also his dry itchy scalp and frizzy texture calmed down.</li>
            <li> I used Wen for about 2 years; I am no longer working full time, and unfortunately economics forced me to cut back on splurges.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try Wen to see if it would calm down my bushy ends, but it is too expensive.  </li>
            <li> so I would like to use an alternative every other day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been having issues with other lathering shampoos...</li>
            <li> If you have tried it and are not satisfied, try a different version of it.</li>
            <li> I used salon grafix every other day for a week and my hair was greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> A big waste of money!</li>
            <li> I  wanted to throw out any other hair product I have ever bought and replace it with WEN.</li>
            <li> I got it at Harmon Face Value  for $ 5.99 and thought ti was like the other brand Lisa Rachel they sell..</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t use any other product on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I tried this and three other alternatives.  </li>
            <li> My hair was dull, dry and flat while using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very careful about that now.  </li>
            <li> My hair was really dry and kinda felt like straw after using this a few times.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy and didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling dry</li>
            <li> As I mentioned earlier, the one time that I was not happy with it, I think I might have not rinsed it out thoroughly enough, and also using it back-to-back four washings in a row...</li>
            <li> It is not fun to chase that swiveling pump whilst wet!  </li>
            <li> Of course I would be interested in a less expensive version.  </li>
            <li> I typically need to wash my hair daily to not get a \\&quot;slick look.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it left my hair feeling dull and frizzy ..</li>
            <li> It just left my hair feeling dull and frizzy</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical that it would work because it&#x27;s so much cheaper, but it does everything that Wen does!</li>
            <li> I will continue using this cleanser until it&#x27;s gone because I&#x27;m cheap like that, but if my bad hair decade continues I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> your average supermarket perfumed one&lt;br /&gt;Ends</li>
            <li> for about the same price &amp; number two-Loreal&#x27;s scent is HORRIBLE &amp; so strong it stays on your hair long afterwards.</li>
            <li> The only thing these previous shampoos had in common were they were all moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was nervous about using this type of product for fear it would weigh my hair down or leave it looking greasy.</li>
            <li> Hair has body and is not weighed down like you&#x27;d think it might be.  </li>
            <li> I was so let down</li>
            <li> but this conditioner works well to keep the frizz down.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t way down my hair but also didn&#x27;t take away any frizz.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it as a leave in since it can weigh down my hair but combining it with</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, thick, tightly curled afro textured hair.  </li>
            <li> I have also tried renpure, hairone and a few other products</li>
            <li> This was the second (and last) time I tried to buy something less expensive than the Wen I have been using.  </li>
            <li> have jet black hair and it works well</li>
            <li> xa week,  vitamins,  slept on satin,  leave ins, babied my  hair,  avoided styling, rinsed in cold water ... and now this product,  the same old vitamins,  </li>
            <li> This stuff eliminates half of my products.</li>
            <li> And so now it has been about a year and a half that I have been using this on and off.</li>
            <li> I almost threw it out, but after purchasing a different shampoo and conditioner and using them a couple of times with only mediocre results, I was reminded just how well this cleans and conditions the hair.  </li>
            <li> I figured it would end up a greasy mess...</li>
            <li> Not to mention it became a tangled mess.</li>
            <li> BUT, this product costs much less than Wen and does not contain propylene glycol( which is a harsh skin irritant) like Hair One.  </li>
            <li> and it did not clean my hair well.</li>
            <li> After washing my hair, it looks a little oily.</li>
            <li> My hair was a greasy, tangled mess that only got worse.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately I&#x27;ve stopped using it because it causes my scalp to become extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> I try each one for a few days.  </li>
            <li> As with WEN, I gave this product a few washings to see if it would perform.  </li>
            <li> dried out my hair and made me itch.</li>
            <li> My hair is waste length</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I have been using this hair cleanser for a few months now.</li>
            <li> WEN makes my hair fluffy and 1/2 curly.  </li>
            <li> use a round brush when drying my hair, and it goes through a lot smoother now.</li>
            <li> I am expecting it to start making my hair limp...</li>
            <li> and I had to use a leave in conditioner to comb through my hair after it was towel dried.</li>
            <li> I have used Wen, and I like it, but after a few times using it, my hair is limp.  </li>
            <li> I bought this from a grocery store a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> My hair was heavy.</li>
            <li> This will make your hair look limp.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money&lt;</li>
            <li> I have thick very long and  frizzy hair and it is hard to brush out after washing with reg shampoo and cond.</li>
            <li> I have fairly thick, slightly wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Feels really weird applying it directly on the scalp (and all over) with its thick lotion consistency.  </li>
            <li> Took a chance, but not a good as I hoped for based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> Not sure how others think this is even comparable to Wen.</li>
            <li> And actually stripped my hair to the point where it was difficult to style.</li>
            <li> I usually use 6 - 8 pumps of Wen, I used 12 - 16 of this.  </li>
            <li> Just apply, massage around, clip hair up for a few minutes, then rinse!</li>
            <li> I have been growing my hair out for the past 6 months.</li>
            <li> In fact, I usually wash my hair once to twice a week.  </li>
            <li> The product is quite thin compared to all the other products.  </li>
            <li> If so, I will NEVER go back to traditional shampoo and conditioner - in my mind it is completely worthless compared to this product.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, and almost down to my waist.</li>
            <li> I purchased and tried the product since wen is so expensive I was trying to find alternate products that are much less expensive.</li>
            <li> I can hardly wait to try the formula fornoily hair.</li>
            <li> Hard to describe.  </li>
            <li> it was hard to come through</li>
            <li> I must say that the smell is hard to deal with, but I found a way to get around</li>
            <li> But folks with thick hair might appreciate this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I have really thick longish hair, and I know when it&#x27;s not conditioned.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s like a thick conditioner, not at all like a</li>
            <li> I had gotten this on a lark, and I am one of those women that have thick, wavy hair that is always frizzy.  </li>
            <li> And for no more money!..</li>
            <li> but I was left a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> With Wen I usually washed my hair every 3-4 days, but with this product I felt like I had to wash every day!</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time replacing it because I don&#x27;t like sulfates, parabens, and the other unsavory things that are put into a lot of products.  </li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY recommend it, for even the strongest of skeptics.</li>
            <li> Thought I would try a less expensive cleansing conditioner than Wen (which works well for me).  </li>
            <li> I usually use Bain de Terre from my salon but it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> but, on a slow Saturday, I just went for it and couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I am a &amp;#34;brand name&amp;#34; user, and I tried this product and am very disappointed in how my hair felt after I showered - both wet and dry.  </li>
            <li> thin hair felt thicker.&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try because I can&#x27;t afford to by WEN at it&#x27;s ridiculous prices!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after giving it a few trys I threw it away :(</li>
            <li> So now that I&#x27;ve been twice bitten and twice shy, I&#x27;m going to stay with what I know</li>
            <li> is expensive</li>
            <li> Sorry to report, not even close to performing like the WEN product.  </li>
            <li> I tried the Oily hair formula too, but had the same nasty results.  </li>
            <li> Because of how troublesome my hair can be, I was skeptical, but decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, but this product is not a replacement for Wen.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to give a review as I was skeptical when I bought this product.</li>
            <li> Totally Twisted Curl Silkening Detangler Hair Care 8.5 Fl Oz]]</li>
            <li> afraid I gonna have greasy hair.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant when I felt it because I dont use conditioner, and shampoo every day because I can&#x27;t stand the dirty feel.</li>
            <li> Dried my hair out horribly</li>
            <li> and my hair seems to get dirty the morning after I wash it.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> Tangly hair, bad texture</li>
            <li> I have been having a bad hair decade, and after reading these reviews, I was hopeful that this product would end my streak.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was the second (and last) time I tried to buy something less expensive than the Wen I have been using.  It sounded great, promised the moon but guess what it did not deliver.  No matter how many pumps you use it does not leave your hair soft and conditioned.  So now that I&#x27;ve been twice bitten and twice shy, I&#x27;m going to stay with what I know, I&#x27;m a Wen girl and staying that way!  If I have to spend a little more, you know what they say you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this on Amazon. This is $5.47 at Walmart and you don&#x27;t pay shipping. It&#x27;s not worth paying twice as much and waiting who knows how long to actually get it. Just do yourself a favor and go to Walmart and save money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will absolutely LOVE your hair. I used it because I saw a review that said it got rid of dandruff, and it does EVEN MORE than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will replace your shampoo, conditioner, leave in conditioner, detangler, AND dandruff shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have jet black hair and it works well, it doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of color or necessary oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used Wen. Although this product does leave my hair feeling like it&#x27;s in better condition than it was. Using it daily will cause your hair to pretty oily by the end of the day though. I&#x27;ve almost used it all but unfortunately I&#x27;ve stopped using it because it causes my scalp to become extremely sensitive. So much so that brushing my hair is a huge hassle. Possibly a great product if cleansing conditioners work for you but everyone is different I guess. As for me, I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try because I can&#x27;t afford to by WEN at it&#x27;s ridiculous prices! I have to say that it seems to work quite well! One thing I really like about it is that the scent is extremely light. You don&#x27;t notice any smell once you rinse it out of your hair which is nice for those of us who don&#x27;t like a lot of fragrance. It does not lather at all, so it&#x27;s like putting straight conditioner on dirty hair (which honestly, I&#x27;m still getting used to). However, it rinses easily, detangles decently, &amp; leaves your hair feeling soft &amp; not greasy. I haven&#x27;t used it daily for a long time though, so I can&#x27;t say if continued use will cause a buildup or make your scalp area feel greasy or not. We&#x27;ll see. For the price it&#x27;s good though for 12oz. of product. I&#x27;d also like to ad that I tried the Loreal cleansing conditioner also to see if it was better. Number one, you only get 8oz. for about the same price &amp; number two-Loreal&#x27;s scent is HORRIBLE &amp; so strong it stays on your hair long afterwards. It&#x27;s almost intolerable in my opinion. This is something you can&#x27;t really tell by just opening the bottle &amp; giving it a sniff either. I have to say if you&#x27;re thinking of trying Loreal&#x27;s version, you might not want to bother. Just saying...stick with Salon Grafix &amp; you&#x27;ll be pleased w/the result I think!</li>
            <li> Well I been using WEN for a month now and I must say WEN is still more moisturizing and leaves hair more shiny than this product. After first use I noticed more friz and flyaways which I never experience with WEN but it is still a good product i would recommend leaving it on much longer than directed tho. i also tried loreal cleansing conditioners and even the smell of this product is better and softer nd not as overpowering as the loreal the loreal does condition mutch better than this product. I rank WEN #1 Loreal #2 and this 3 but i still plan to continue using it for wen is expensive so I would like to use an alternative every other day</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t review things.  I&#x27;m a trial and error kind of person who wants stiff that works and is easy to deal with.  And I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine,  limp, semi - straight hair.  Currently the weather here is hot,  humid and I want to wash my hair twice a day sometimes because I don&#x27;t like my hair greasy. I also don&#x27;t want to cut too often so I&#x27;m looking for products to  let me grow hair  and  avoid split ends... but leave it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I try this class of product- the cleansing conditioners. I get this stuff I&#x27;m reviewing SG, the Revlon stuff, and the One stuff. I try each one for a few days.  Revlon didn&#x27;t really clean well,  One did ok,  but was more money and I couldn&#x27;t just pick it up as easily. SG was in the middle in terms of price point and available at a drug store like Revlon,  just in case you don&#x27;t have Prime or just need a bottle. I&#x27;m not buying wen and discounted it from my trials, too much drama..I just need to be able to get my hands on it so I can use it and not have it cost a pair of HD movie tickets per bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; To use it you need to understand it is a different beast. You use about 2 healthy heaping spoons of this stuff to get the job done. Yes, a lot of product compared to shampoos.  Hence, price point and ease of finding the stuff became even more important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used an SOP with each of my trial products.  I used one blob at the crown,  another at the back,  a bit at the temples and hairline. You massage it in for 2 minutes,  put on a plastic shower cap and let the product do it&#x27;s thing as you wash the rest of you. I found all of these clean better if you let it sit for an additional minute or so, just long enough to wash your body and face. They all,  but the Revlon, rinsed well with warm to cool water and didn&#x27;t strip the hair. The Revlon felt greasy by day three.  You can use a wide comb to get in any of these products if you want. I don&#x27;t need to. But folks with thick hair might appreciate this.  You can take a pea sized amount and put it on the ends as leave in. They all smell good but are not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can blowdry if I want without going,  ok this will cause split ends. I can braid or put it in a ponytail holder wet and not think it could break my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days of using it I noticed my husband&#x27;s hair color looked less gray and more red than it had on shampoo.  Also his dry itchy scalp and frizzy texture calmed down. It also stayed cleaner for longer. Amazing stuff if for no other results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My own hair,  which is about 12 or so inches long all around, starting to gray just was left clean,  smooth,  my semi-Straight texture brought out, and strong.  I&#x27;ve gone from a bit of hair coming out in the shower each time with shampoo to none or the occasional hair with this class of product,  especially the SG stuff. The SG product made the brown color in my hair more prominent than it had with shampoo,  so the occasional gray hair I have doesn&#x27;t show up as much.  It shines even though I have fine hair and wash often. It leaves me clean just as long as shampoo did, but without the damage, hair shed, snap/weakness, etc. And for no more money!.. Actually a bit less because I&#x27;m using fewer products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used sulfate free shampoo/conditioner for years,  deep conditioned 2 times xa week,  vitamins,  slept on satin,  leave ins, babied my  hair,  avoided styling, rinsed in cold water ... and now this product,  the same old vitamins,  and it just seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the results as my hair continues to grow and I would recommend cleansing conditioners,  starting with SG, to my friends.</li>
            <li> I always had a feeling there should be something better then shampoo. When I saw this bottle in a store I thought \\&quot; it&#x27;s sounds like what I was looking for.\\&quot; And it was. It feels like putting a lotion on your hair so I wad afraid I gonna have greasy hair. But no, very clean hair and feels healthy. So my only concern - I bought the last bottle in the store...</li>
            <li> I felt like this cleansing conditioner cleansed well, but was too drying for me. I have color treated hair and needed a conditioner on top of this product to get a comb through it after showering. I feel like this defeated the purpose of a co-wash. If you are prone to oily hair rather than dryness, this may be a better choice for you.</li>
            <li> Not nearly the same as Wen. Not sure how others think this is even comparable to Wen. My hair was really dry and kinda felt like straw after using this a few times. Pretty much the exact opposite of Wen. It does smell really good, though.</li>
            <li> I very much wanted to like this shampoo/cleanser.  I have been using WEN for over 10 years. Of course I would be interested in a less expensive version.  I give this product 1 star for the pleasant fragrance only.  As with WEN, I gave this product a few washings to see if it would perform.  Sorry to report, not even close to performing like the WEN product.  And actually stripped my hair to the point where it was difficult to style. You definitely get what you pay for. I would spend the $$ on a better shampoo from your local store - not this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, be careful of boastful reviews, that most probably are manufacturers trying to sell their product.</li>
            <li> This was not for me. As some others said, I found the smell to be annoying. Had a lotion &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; smell to it. Also left my hair feeling very dry which is the opposite of why I purchased this product. (color treated hair) Unfortunately after giving it a few trys I threw it away :(</li>
            <li> From the reviews I can see this works for a lot of people, but for me it absolutely did not.  My hair was a greasy, tangled mess that only got worse.  I tried the Oily hair formula too, but had the same nasty results.  It nearly scared me off &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave DevaCurl No Poo a try at the suggestion of my stylist, and I absolutely love it.  It worked great on my hair.  I&#x27;d been having issues with other lathering shampoos... brand after brand.  Tangly hair, bad texture, my scalp couldn&#x27;t decide if it was oily or dry...  My hair is baby fine with some natural curl and prone to frizz.  The Deva No Poo leaves my hair and scalp clean, my hair feels silky and healthy, and calms the frizz.  You don&#x27;t have to have curly hair to use it either, it works on all types.  And it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this doesn&#x27;t work for you, Deva Curl might.  Personally I can&#x27;t say anything about Wen because I haven&#x27;t tried it, but my stylist&#x27;s sister, also a stylist, loves Wen and uses it religiously.  She uses Deva Curl No Poo if she runs out of Wen between shipments, so apparently they both work for her.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in hopes of finding a single product that could detangle and condition my hair. I have pretty healthy hair but it can be on the dry side sometimes. I&#x27;ve never tried wen but I&#x27;ve always heard good things. I bought this product hoping I could get similar results my friends have gotten from wen. Boy was I wrong! After using the shampoo for a month now it feels close to straw. I actually have needed to use a leave in condition after using this shampoo. My hair is constantly getting tangled to the point of appearing like dreads on the underneath part of my hair. I&#x27;m switching back to my old, cheap shampoo with no gimmicks!</li>
            <li> I tried this cleansing conditioner, used it directly as said in the directions, and I felt as if it weighed my hair down, flattened it, stole all of its body, and just made it feel stringy as well.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for alternatives to WEN...  At this point, I have tried six products that Google Search indicated were similar.  This is bottled the same way, looks and feels similar...  But it is no where near Wen.  My hair is dark blond, a few inches below my shoulders, very fine but also very thick and graying, I&#x27;m approaching 50!  Of the six products I have tried so far, this is the worst!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salon Grafix is bottled in a 12 oz. size pump bottle.  The pump swivels too easily...  It is not fun to chase that swiveling pump whilst wet!  The product is quite thin compared to all the other products.  I usually use 6 - 8 pumps of Wen, I used 12 - 16 of this.  And did not achieve the beautiful hair that other products provided!  You would think a Cleansing Conditioner would make your hair soft, tangle free (or close to it), manageable and bright.  This product does non, NON of these things.  My hair tangled easily, had fly-aways, was dull, lifeless and did not style well!  I would not recommend this to anyone looking for an alternative to Wen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products I have tried so far, listed by how well I liked them, are:  WEN, Lisa Rachel Conditioner &amp; Cleanser, Pantene Pro-V Truly Natural Co-Wash Cleansing Conditioner, L&#x27;Oreal EverCreme Conditioning Cleanser, Burt&#x27;s Bees Gud Red Ruby Groovy Shampoo (which is not a co-wash nor conditioning cleanser) and then Salon Grafix!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those I still have to try:  Hair One Cleansing Conditioner, Nada Poo Co-Wash Conditioner, Blue Magic Gentle Conditioning Cleanser, Macadamia Natural Oil Flawless Cleansing Conditioner, Hair N Now Cleansing Conditioner, Renpure Solutions Ren Cleansing Conditioner, Palmer&#x27;s Olive Oil Formula Cleansing Conditioner and Mizani Co-Wash Conditioning Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have treated my hair for years; every hair color under the sun, blow-dry, straighten, curl, you name it, I&#x27;ve done it.  After frying it into oblivion, I finally decided to get it back to normal.  Over the past year, I&#x27;ve gotten my natural hair color back and have gotten it to a pretty decent length.  But it still always manages to be greasy at the roots and incredibly dry at the ends.  I have a friend who has GORGEOUS hair and told me she never, ever washes it, and only uses cleansing conditioner.  Because of how troublesome my hair can be, I was skeptical, but decided to try it.  I found this product by chance at my local grocery store for around 7 dollars, and after one wash, it felt amazing.  My hair feels completely clean, but so soft, and it smells great.  Because of my hair length (waist-length), I really needed to use around 9 pumps, instead of the 7 it indicates on the bottle for long hair.  I just hope I don&#x27;t run through it too quickly!  SERIOUSLY recommend it, for even the strongest of skeptics.</li>
            <li> this is really great shampoo, it is a great value and leaves your hair shiny and soft, I love it</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, I&#x27;m hooked. I love that it doesn&#x27;t strip my hair and I have started using it on my 5-year old boy&#x27;s curly mane and he loves the smell. I comb it through with a wide-toothed comb and rinse a bit and he doesn&#x27;t even need an extra conditioner. I do add another conditioner to my own hair, which tends to be on the dry side.</li>
            <li> Everyone wants the hair they don&#x27;t have. Mine is stick straight, super fine and basically just used to hang on my head... until I discovered Salon Grafix. This version, as well as, the formula for find/oily hair are AMAZING! My hair has never looked better! You do have to use a fair amount, I use between 8-10 pumps. At first I was hesitant to use so much, due to the texture of my hair. I figured it would end up a greasy mess... but, on a slow Saturday, I just went for it and couldn&#x27;t be happier! Just apply, massage around, clip hair up for a few minutes, then rinse! It&#x27;s easy and seriously, my hair has volume, flips up at the ends and even looks like I used a curling iron, even though I&#x27;m way too lazy for that! Try it!</li>
            <li> dried out my hair and made me itch. dont recommend. If you tried this instead of WEN. I would go back to WEN. (In fact I did)</li>
            <li> I found this at Target a while back and loved it and have not been able to find it since so I look on Amazon and there it was! Initially I was worried it would weigh down my hair or make it greasy-it doesn&#x27;t. I use it every other day and my hair is super soft and shiny and smells amazing. I live in a dry climate so it is great for adding moisture back in.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair in the morning and by 6:00 that evening it looks like I didn&#x27;t was my hair for 2 days. My daughter tried it same results would not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walgreens, going out on a limb. I usually use Bain de Terre from my salon but it is so expensive. I was hesitant when I felt it because I dont use conditioner, and shampoo every day because I can&#x27;t stand the dirty feel. But I love this product so much!</li>
            <li> I purchased and tried the product since wen is so expensive I was trying to find alternate products that are much less expensive. The first time I used it left my hair in knots and snapped some of my hair off. I have a fine soft long hair that is over two and a half foot long and I chose not to damage but using natural products as much as possible. I even use henna to color my hair so it won&#x27;t damage it. I do not recommend this product to anyone with my type of hair. I have also tried renpure, hairone and a few other products but this one had the worst results. If you have a different type of hair then maybe it will be ok for you but I will never try it again.&lt;br /&gt;Fire</li>
            <li> I love creme cleansers for my relaxed hair.Relaxing does dry out the hair so I&#x27;m always adding oils and moisturizers to it.This stuff eliminates half of my products.It leaves my hair soft and bouncy.My hair is waste length so that&#x27;s a great feeling!</li>
            <li> I got this at the grocery because it was on the clearance table, so I thought if I didn&#x27;t like it I wasn&#x27;t out much money. I have a friend that swears by the cleansing conditioners, and says that is the secret to how she grew her hair long so fast. First let me give you the scoop: I have baby fine that is thining and has never grown past my sholder blades. My hair is color treated and dry because of the grey, which never holds color very long. I use this on a dailey basis and my hair is easy to comb through afterwards. This makes my hair shiney and soft. I love this stuff!!! I will come back and let you know in 3 months if it helped with growing my hair out in length like my friend says it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have been using this hair cleanser for a few months now. I am on my second bottle. I still love it. If you have tried it and are not satisfied, try a different version of it. I had the thin hair one, and loved it. Now I am on the color treated one and it is ok but doesn&#x27;t smell as good.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product today because of a co worker telling me about how great it was and works as well or better than Wen, and at a much lower price. I&#x27;d been putting it off, but decided today I&#x27;d try it.  I wasn&#x27;t looking to expect much from it but to my surprise it really is good and leaves my hair feeling moisturized and soft.  I&#x27;m African American and I wear my hair natural.  I have very coarse, thick, tightly curled afro textured hair.  When it said the product works for all hair types, I didn&#x27;t really believe it.  But it does!  I was very surprised!  Think I&#x27;ve found a new product for washing my hair!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Though it does go fast. I have long, fine, wavy/curly hair and it takes about 20 pumps per wash, so one bottle last me about 2 weeks (I wash my hair with it 3 times a week). If you have long hair like me I recommend getting it at walmart for about $5. My local grocery store also carries it for about $6.</li>
            <li> I used salon grafix every other day for a week and my hair was greasy feeling.  If I use it once a week and was with shampoo the rest of the week, it works fine and my hair seems sillier than just using shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have been using WEN for a year now and really like how my hair feels, but I just can&#x27;t afford it anymore. I saw this product and thought I would give it a try. It is BETTER than WEN! It left my hair soft and shiny and not weighed down. I have fine hair so I could only use WEN once a week and then I would use my normal shampoo. I found with Salon Graphix, I can use it 2-3 days in a row and my hair looks amazing. I will definitely make the switch permanently.</li>
            <li> I had no idea I was suffering all these years - even with salon shampoos and conditioners!  I used to condition, deep condition, detangle, and use a frizz control product just to get through my morning routine and have OK hair.  Even after all of that my hair still wasn&#x27;t shiny like I thought it should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WELL.  This product changed all that!  I had been considering trying the WEN system, but just hadn&#x27;t gotten around to it.  I saw this at the drug store and decided to give it a try.  It is simply amazing.  I didn&#x27;t need a detangler to comb out my hair, needed nothing to control frizzies and my hair is sooooooo soft!  I even used my daughters fine toothed comb on my wet hair and it slid right through!  Even after blowing it dry every hair was right where I wanted it, soft, manageable and SHINY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy and am curious to see if I&#x27;m still this happy after a week or two of use.  If so, I will NEVER go back to traditional shampoo and conditioner - in my mind it is completely worthless compared to this product.  It was exactly what my hair needed.</li>
            <li> Took a chance, but not a good as I hoped for based on other reviews. I still prefer my WEN. This cleans but my hair felt dry after rinsing and not a big fan of the scent. It may work better for normal hair that is not color-treated.</li>
            <li> best scent - so clean - very nice and great price for the product</li>
            <li> This left my roots oily and the rest of my hair feeling like straw. My hair is fine and wavy andvu was hoping this was my frizz solution.  It wasn&#x27;t.  A big waste of money!</li>
            <li> I had been researching the Deva Curl product line, which is pretty pricey.  I came across this stuff the next day and bought a bottle.  Now, I never bought the Deva Curl no-poo shampoo, so I cannot make the comparison.  I used the Salon Grafix in the same manner that someone would no-poo their curls.  I was pleased with the results.  I did spring for the Deva Curl gel, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet (it just came today and it smells amazing, btw).  I picked up two more bottles of the Salon Grafix tonight at Walgreens for less than here, but if I couldn&#x27;t get it where I live, I&#x27;d buy it here at this price, which is today nine and thirty nine.</li>
            <li> I have been having a bad hair decade, and after reading these reviews, I was hopeful that this product would end my streak. Well, I&#x27;m happy to report that it did; for one day. I shampoo my hair every three days, just conditioning in between shampoos. I tried this stuff on day two of my no shampoo cycle, and I was so happy when I awakened with silky, luxurious, wavy locks. My hair was so soft and shiny I couldn&#x27;t stop playing with it. The next night I used this product again, and much to my dismay I awakened with hair that looked, and felt, like it belonged on a scarecrow. I will continue using this cleanser until it&#x27;s gone because I&#x27;m cheap like that, but if my bad hair decade continues I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Compares to Wen and Hair One in terms of cleaning and conditioning. BUT, this product costs much less than Wen and does not contain propylene glycol( which is a harsh skin irritant) like Hair One.  I&#x27;m so pleased to to find a good clensing conditioner that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune, emit fumes while it sits on my hair, or make my skin burn and turn red.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to try Wen for a long time, but refuse to pay that much for a hair product that would not last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with Salon Grafix.  I love the smell and after 2 weeks my hair is much smoother and shiner than it has been in years!  I had to use conditioning oil and a separate conditioner to get any kind of shine before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this and am glad there is an affordable alternative to Wen.</li>
            <li> I received this item the day after purchase. Exactly what I expected. :)</li>
            <li> I believed the reviews that said it was like a W E N shampoo/conditioner.  I used it one time.  My hair had no body and did not feel like it was clean.  If I had bought this at a local store, I would have returned it.</li>
            <li> This is a gift, but I have some and love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product yesterday at walgreens, buy one get one free and they were on sale for four dollars, so I paid 4 bucks for two 12oz. Bottles and glad I did. I have thick very long and  frizzy hair and it is hard to brush out after washing with reg shampoo and cond. But with this cleanser it was like brushing silk. I love it and will continue to buy it. RECOMMEND HIGHLY!!! Smells great too.</li>
            <li> This is the first cleansing conditioner I have tried and I&#x27;m glad it is because I&#x27;m really happy with this product so far. It left my hair silky soft, smelling great and wonderfully clean! Only a few days after I ordered it I saw that it was sold at walmart for a lot cheaper so I wouldnt bother ordering it again, I will just purchase it from walmart now.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair so this is too much for me to use as a conditioning shampoo but Ive been using up the bottle on cleaning my makeup brushes daily and using this also as a leave-in-conditioner.  This product cleansn and conditions my brushes like nothin&#x27; else and keeps my hair smelling pretty darn good all day.  I can hardly wait to try the formula fornoily hair.</li>
            <li> First off, I would first off like to describe the type of hair that I have. I have long brown hair that is slightly on the thick side with lose natural waves. I usually use high quality salon shampoos but wanted to reduce the amount I wash my hair. So I bought WEN. I fell in  love with WEN. It made my hair so silky soft and super shiny. I  wanted to throw out any other hair product I have ever bought and replace it with WEN. However, I could not keep forking out 50 t0 60 dollars every time i needed to buy some more WEN. I I decided to switch to a cheaper brand. Salon Grafix cleansing conditioner had pretty high reviews. Most of the people writhing these reviews claimed that this product was very similar to WEN. However, I have not had the same experience. Although this product made my hair smell really great, it completely dried out my hair. It still kept its nice shine. I was really disappointed. I had only used this product a week and I think I will just try another brand of cleanser conditioner.</li>
            <li> Please note that I&#x27;m African American and wanted to specify that because when I was checking reviews for this product that info would have been helpful to me.  In any case, my hair is dry and short. I have been growing my hair out for the past 6 months. And within that time I have \\&quot;experimented\\&quot; with a lot of shampoos. For example, Aussie for mending split ends (great shampoo), Aveeno Moisturizing (okay shampoo) and many others. The only thing these previous shampoos had in common were they were all moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, I was looking for something less harsh (something that did not lather) and to eliminate my previous steps for washing my hair (shampoo, deep conditioning, hot oil treatment, drying and styling). I performed this regimen every week. I wanted to try Wen but 30.00 bucks per month was too pricy for me so I dismissed the idea of trying Wen and a few weeks later I ran across an article about Salon Grafix cleaner conditioner. I finally found it online at Walgreens.com (was only available in one store in my area). The price was very reasonable at 4.00 a bottle. A win-win for me since 3 other people live in my house. If it didnt work for me at 4.00 bucks it may work for another family member.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got the product I read the instructions dilligently and washed my hair. It detangled my hair and had a great scent to it. However, this product does not do anything for dandraff and I&#x27;ve found that I have to wash my hair twice a week now instead of just once to keep the dandruff under control. However, I am seeing improvment. My hair is not as dry and after the first wash I noticed my ends looked better. I will continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Smells great, noticed immediate results (split ends almost gone), detangles, hair is softer, great price.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: No dandruff control, need to wash hair more frequently</li>
            <li> This stuff made my hair look thicker, but felt dry and still frizzy. Hair had no shine at all. I much prefer Loreal EverCreme Cleansing conditioner. Cheaper, smells better, and does a better job.</li>
            <li> I saw this and decided to try it since I&#x27;ve really been wanting to try Wen but don&#x27;t want to spend the money. This stuff is awful. I gave it two weeks and it never got better. My hair was dull, dry and flat while using this. I couldn&#x27;t believe how something supposed to be conditioning could do this. Not to mention it became a tangled mess. Yuck. I tossed this stuff.</li>
            <li> it left my hair feeling dull and frizzy .. I love cleansing conditioner and wanted to try something else. the smell is great leaves hair and scalp smelling great It just left my hair feeling dull and frizzy</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best.  My hair has never been this healthy or smelled this great!!  My wife and I swear by this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used WEN for a while but first I tried SG and loved it.  In fact, I usually wash my hair once to twice a week.  I used SG shampooing twice that day and my hair smelled great, looked shiny and conditioned.  I love this product and when I&#x27;m finished w/my WEN, I&#x27;m going to use Salon Grafix from now on.  WEN makes my hair fluffy and 1/2 curly.  SG makes my curls even and smooth.  Thanks for such a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Dried my hair out horribly I got it at Harmon Face Value  for $ 5.99 and thought ti was like the other brand Lisa Rachel they sell..It made my hair like straw for some reason..REALLY bad..Never again..Trying L&#x27;oreal now</li>
            <li> I saw a commercial for Wen and was reminded that I had wanted to try it a long time ago. I hate ordering anything from television so I never pursued it. This Salon Grafix version really calms down my itchy scalp. I have used it 2 days now and noticed that my scalp just doesn&#x27;t itch. I guess I&#x27;m allergic to something in shampoo...never knew the extent of it until I didn&#x27;t experience the itching. Weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a round brush when drying my hair, and it goes through a lot smoother now. No tangles. I am expecting it to start making my hair limp...for now, it&#x27;s just beautiful and soft. I hope this turns out to be something I can use permanently.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this shampoo, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I cared for the scent. The texture and the color of the shampoo really do feel satin. After a few weeks, I am a true fan! I love this shampoo, scent and all! It&#x27;s my new favorite!!!</li>
            <li> This. Is the first review. I have ever done but this is the best stuff I have ever used. I ccan&#x27;t. Believe how beautiful and soft and wonderful smelling my hair is. I will never use anything else again. I&#x27;ve bragged about how much I love my hair now ( natural curly and problem with frizz. All my life),and I just can&#x27;t say enough. I dont have to do anything else to my hair but air dry and its truely soft and beautiful! I would do a free commercial for them: -)</li>
            <li> Just ok. I thought I would try this product bc there were so many reviews claiming it was as good as wen. I disagree. It smells great, but unlike wen I had a very hard time combing the product through my hair in the shower and I had to use a leave in conditioner to comb through my hair after it was towel dried. It didn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy and didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling dry but I was left a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  The smell is great and it leaves my hair soft and shiny.  I have used Wen, and I like it, but after a few times using it, my hair is limp.  Not so with this product.  For the price it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product thinking it was wen in a local cvs, later finding out it wasn&#x27;t wen I was disappointed but still wanted to try it out. And so now it has been about a year and a half that I have been using this on and off. My hair is curly, brown, fine, frizzy, and not color treated. I still have bad hair days but I noticed that when I use it continuously I see more results. Better than regular shampoo, but still not the best.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the raving reviews I read on here. Tisk  tisk on me. It left my hair dry and feeling like a clump of tangled wool, even after a month of using it at directed. Often times I would have to use a deep conditioner just to try to try to restore some moisture. The smell kinda is medicine like, I would not use again or recommend this product.</li>
            <li> my hair never felt nicer</li>
            <li> I tried WEN and was looking for a less expensive way to get a good clean and soft result.  I tried 2 different brands and this is what I will be using for now on.</li>
            <li> I have fairly thick, slightly wavy hair.  I used Wen for about 2 years; I am no longer working full time, and unfortunately economics forced me to cut back on splurges. I decided to give Salon Graphix a try. Sorry, but this product is not a replacement for Wen. It does ok on the first day, but on the second day I felt like my hair had a waxy, slightly coated feel to it.  With Wen I usually washed my hair every 3-4 days, but with this product I felt like I had to wash every day! The fragrance is not the greatest; it smells like&#x27;&#x27;old-lady&#x27; perfume.  I am now using Loreal sulfate free shampoo, and so far I am pleased with the results. I hope to return to Wen when my finances allow, but I won&#x27;t replace it with Salon Graphix.</li>
            <li> This product makes it affordable to go no-poo. It&#x27;s as good if not better than WEN. It smells great and doesn&#x27;t take as much product to do the same job as WEN, what a savings! Also, now that I know I can get it at my local CVS, I won&#x27;t have to pay for shipping anymore :)</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair. I was nervous about using this type of product for fear it would weigh my hair down or leave it looking greasy. How wonderful it was to find this product! My hair feels great, not greasy,  lots of movement!!  While it doesn&#x27;t add volume, I&#x27;m so happy with how it feels and moves - amazing. Currently using daily.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a local drugstore. I was looking for a while for a conditioning cleanser \\&quot;like Wen\\&quot; but not a $50 a bottle solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioning cleanser does not provide soapy lather. That was my first tip that this was what I was looking for. I wanted a no-soap solution for keeping my hair clean and not greasy. I typically need to wash my hair daily to not get a \\&quot;slick look.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the 5 minutes the directions said to leave it on, I occasionally massaged it into my scalp and hair, noting how great it smells. It&#x27;s really important to RINSE RINSE RINSE. This gets the conditioner that has bound to the dirt all rinsed out, leaving behind clean conditioned hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really thick longish hair, and I know when it&#x27;s not conditioned. When I came out of the shower, my wet hair even felt clean, not sticky or oily (like it was with my last attempt at CO-washing), and was easy to comb/brush/dry. Once dry, it looked clean and healthy. Not frizzy or too flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use this product again. I might try the Loreal conditioning cleanser or WEN, but I&#x27;m really happy with this product so I likely won&#x27;t make a permanant switch.</li>
            <li> I bought this from a grocery store a few weeks ago.  I&#x27;ve used it several times.  All but one time, I was very pleased with the results and the way my hair was once dry.  But I am finding it really difficult getting used to the fact that it is a lotion and does not have the normal surfactant sudsing properties most shampoos have.  Surprised this is not being mentioned in the reviews.  I almost threw it out, but after purchasing a different shampoo and conditioner and using them a couple of times with only mediocre results, I was reminded just how well this cleans and conditions the hair.  I think I&#x27;ll hang onto it, but use it intermittently.  As I mentioned earlier, the one time that I was not happy with it, I think I might have not rinsed it out thoroughly enough, and also using it back-to-back four washings in a row... well I think that was a bit much conditioning.  So...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cleans and conditions hair very well.  Leaves hair soft and somehow tames flyaways.  Hair has body and is not weighed down like you&#x27;d think it might be.  Good results whether letting hair mostly air-dry, or taking the time to style and blow-dry&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent.  Hard to describe.  Smells like a salon brand shampoo, not your average supermarket perfumed one&lt;br /&gt;Ends the need for spray detanglers/leave-in conditioners.  Hair combs easily.  (My hair happens to be very fine and always tangles after washing and I have to be super careful I don&#x27;t pull out too much hair when combing it wet, but this product really minimizes this significantly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Feels really weird applying it directly on the scalp (and all over) with its thick lotion consistency.  Doesn&#x27;t foam up at all, so psychologically you feel like you&#x27;re not getting the hair clean (it&#x27;s like a thick conditioner, not at all like a shampoo)&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it day after day, every wash.  It can leave hair with a bit of build-up and if not properly washed out, can be greasy looking&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve now decided that using it frequently means over-conditioning the hair, and it ends up getting greasy looking faster than with other shampoos.  And on my very fine blonde hair, it weighs it down.  It&#x27;s not because of lack of rinsing.  I&#x27;m very careful about that now.  It&#x27;s just too heavy for fine hair, I believe.  I still think it might work for those who don&#x27;t want to condition their hair every time they wash.  If you use this on those condition days, it might work out very well.  But not for every use.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to give a review as I was skeptical when I bought this product. I just used it this evening, I was impressed! My hair is very thick, and almost down to my waist. It was easy to wash the product out, and easy to comb my hair out right after I got out of the shower. As I was blow drying, my hair literally felt silky, smooth, and healthy, without feeling heavy and greasy.I also love the smell! No, I don&#x27;t work for this company. I just wanted to give a review as I really wasn&#x27;t expecting such great results. I have never tried any of the Wen products, but as of now, I see no point. Best $5 I have spent in a long time! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this after using wen and it made my hair feel so gross weighed down and oily it was hard to come through and it did not clean my hair well. I was so let down but you do get what you pay for. You may love it or you may not but in my opinion i&#x27;d rather use suave 2 in 1 . I think i&#x27;ll just stick to wen for cleansing conditioners.</li>
            <li> Cleansing conditioner, did not like..&lt;br /&gt;Thinking it would help me like my hair seemed like it was dry as ever.</li>
            <li> would&#x27;ve given it NO STARS but that is not an option.  Thought I would try a less expensive cleansing conditioner than Wen (which works well for me).  Scent reminds me of old decorative bath soaps that my grandmother kept in the bathroom (the kind you didn&#x27;t DARE use).  Ewwww.  I had gotten used to the lotion-like feel of Wen but this product seems thicker, JUST like lotion.  My hair is left lifeless and dry.  I HATE IT!  In fact, after giving it multiple tries, I am ready to throw it away; what a waste!</li>
            <li> THis product is great and comparable to other products like it. The only down side is this one compared to wen has a strong perfume scent instead of a softer lavender or tea-tree oil scent. It works great keeps down my frizz  and adds a little umpf to my hair however i have a greasy scalp so i either have to wash everyday or make sure i have dry shampoo near by.</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected. My hair was clean soft and easy to manage.I wanted to try Wen but this product is much more affordable and does the job.Great product at a good price.</li>
            <li> I have tried Wen, and Salon Grafix works much better! I love it. And you can&#x27;t beat the awesome price!</li>
            <li> I suffer from itchy scalp in winter months.  I had been using Burt&#x27;s Bees for a while with satisfaction, but this winter I noticed I was itching a lot, so I stopped using it.  I had a difficult time replacing it because I don&#x27;t like sulfates, parabens, and the other unsavory things that are put into a lot of products.  Since Burt&#x27;s Bees, I&#x27;ve washed my hair with everything from Aveeno shampoo/conditioner for babies to locally-made goat&#x27;s milk soap.  Nothing really satisfied me until I started using this cleansing conditioner a few days ago.  The first time, I went by the instructions on the bottle and it ended up being too much product, left on for too long. My hair was heavy. The next day, I tried one squirt left on just long enough to wash my face.  That was perfect for me.  I have a very short cut and I don&#x27;t use any other product on my hair.  I think each person has to experiment with the amount used and the length of time left in before rinsing.  I&#x27;m pleased that I have to buy only one thing and it&#x27;s very inexpensive.  So far, the itching has calmed down to almost nothing.  If it continues that way, I will be a happy customer for a very long time.</li>
            <li> This cleansing conditioner works very well on my hair. I have very dry frizzy hair but this conditioner works well to keep the frizz down. I would recommend this to everyone &amp; it is also cheaper than another brand name that I have used.</li>
            <li> My hair is oily at the roots and super dry on the ends.  I wanted to try Wen to see if it would calm down my bushy ends, but it is too expensive.  I saw this at the drugstore and wanted to try it since the price was reasonable (cheaper than a bottle of regular shampoo).  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to regular shampoo!  I work out daily so I have to wash my hair every day, but my ends aren&#x27;t dry and bushy anymore and my roots aren&#x27;t oily like I thought they would be.  It even saves lots of time in the shower because I don&#x27;t have to condition my hair, and that also saves money!  I still use a bit of anti-frizz on my ends but it&#x27;s certainly nothing like the routine I used to have!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and usually very dry with highlights and shampoo is not part of my everyday routine because of the dryness. At first the fact that there is no lather is very strange but the scent was pleasant enough to press forward. Using a pump so many times is also a little odd in the shower and it does not feel like that amount of product will go very far. The results, however, speak for themselves. The conditioning cleanser cleaned both hair and scalp thoroughly leaving no styling product residue. My hair actually felt soft and clean. It was a much better result than \\&quot;washing\\&quot; my hair with conditioner alone which never quite seemed to do the trick. I&#x27;m really impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only comments are: The pump bottle is a little more work than I&#x27;d like in the shower but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker considering the product cuts down on shower time overall. Also, the product does say you can use it as a leave-in conditioner but compared to my current favorite ([[ASIN:B008CC4FPY Herbal Essences Totally Twisted Curl Silkening Detangler Hair Care 8.5 Fl Oz]]) it&#x27;s really more effective in the shower than out.</li>
            <li> I used Wen for a year because people were saying that was the only product that they used for there hair that made it look healthy, well it didn&#x27;t do much for mine after I wasted all those bucks, so I started searching around and ran across this product and its the best for the price no frizz made my hair feel so soft and didn&#x27;t shed my hair when washing it, also I left it in for 5 minutes as well and still looks good if your hair tangle like mine well once you try this and comb it through like myself I wont consider going back to another product out there one more thing dont waste your money on Wen at all you will be disappointed like I was.  I actually gave it away.</li>
            <li> I had gotten this on a lark, and I am one of those women that have thick, wavy hair that is always frizzy.  At first I thought no, but I went and purchased this a few days ago.  Let me say, from the first time I&#x27;ve used it, my hair is shiny, soft and my wide tooth comb barely hits any snags.  I was always a shampoo and conditioner girl, I&#x27;m making a switch because of how wonderful my hair feels and how soft it is.  For me, it rinsed out very well and my hair felt clean and yes I did the squeak test too to see if it was clean.  Overall, this was the product I was looking for as its not as costly as the Wen system as one of my friends use and I can go to my local drugstore to pick it up.</li>
            <li> Stick with Wen.  Worth the extra money.  I tried this and three other alternatives.  They were all about 60% as good as Wen.  This will make your hair look limp.  wen doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have very fine and fragile hair and have been using Wen for a couple of years.  My hair also tangles very easily when wet.  I love the Wen products but am tired of paying the high price.  I saw this product advertised in a magazine and thought I would give it a try and find it very similar to Wen, but the price is much less.  It actually cleans my hair better than Wen but may not condition quite as well.  All in all its a great lower cost substitute for Wen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wen for a while and I love it, but it&#x27;s so expensive. When I stumbled upon this Healthy Hair Nutrition for a third of the price I was anxious to try it! I was a little skeptical that it would work because it&#x27;s so much cheaper, but it does everything that Wen does! And I really like the scent better too. I follow the same procedures that I would do with Wen. You have to use a good amount to cover your hair and make it thick and creamy like Wen, and my hair feels soft and conditioned every time. It makes it super easy to brush out my long hair when it&#x27;s damp after washing, which has been a challenge with regular shampoos before. I&#x27;ve recommended this product to my friends and family and everyone loves it!</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of this product and the price was better than Wen so I have been using it for a couple of months. I have fine, thick, curly hair that I wear curly and straighten (with products). With normal shampoo/conditioner I wash every other day and did the same with the SG product. I followed the directions and tweaked a little bit but got the same results. I like the smell. It is light but does go away quickly. For me, the product makes my hair more oily than normal at the scalp. After washing my hair, it looks a little oily. I didn&#x27;t mind because I have a product that takes away the oiliness when I blow dry and I can wear my hair straight for three days after washing with using baby powder in the mornings at the root. My hair did feel soft and healthy but not any more than a normal shampoo/conditioner that works on my hair. It didn&#x27;t way down my hair but also didn&#x27;t take away any frizz. I felt like it wasn&#x27;t any different than a regular shampoo. So for me, it wasn&#x27;t a miracle product than tamed frizz and left my hair more low maintenance than normal. It was nice for traveling because I only had to bring one thing but I won&#x27;t continue buying it when I&#x27;m done with the bottle.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed it has made my hair feel so oily and dirty. I will be going back to shampoo and conditioner!!!</li>
            <li> this stuff makes your hair super soft.  I have not found anything else to make it soft like this product does.  Love it</li>
            <li> This left my hair dry and course feeling.  Plus it never felt or looked clean.  Very disappointing.  This is supposed to be like Wen - what a joke!  It is nothing like Wen!!! don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I suppose this will suffice if you are OK with off brands and their difference in output.  I am a &amp;#34;brand name&amp;#34; user, and I tried this product and am very disappointed in how my hair felt after I showered - both wet and dry.  it didn&#x27;t feel as smooth and soft when wet, and it had more frizz when dry.  I&#x27;ll go back to using the name brand.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is my hair type, (long, straight, medium thickness), but it did not cleanse, nor did it condition!  I was left with a tangled unclean mess of wet hair that I could not get a comb thru.  It was as dry as straw after it did dry.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money&lt;br /&gt;It smells good is about the only positive thing I can say for it.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft and easier to manage than traditional shampoos.  Because I use it weekly I am able to go longer between relaxers.  It even keeps my new growth soft, easy to comb thru and the new growth lays well with heat from an iron or tension from rollers.  I don&#x27;t use it as a leave in since it can weigh down my hair but combining it with It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle leave in, John Frieda Hair serum &amp; a setting lotion gives me the desired affects without frequent trips to my stylist. I only visit my stylist for relaxers &amp; trims. All hair types are different regardless of similarities so keep in mind that this cleanser combined with other desired products &amp; even your water type can contribute to your individual success or lack there of.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I wish it came in a large size for purchase.</li>
            <li> The reviews were right...this stuff makes hair look good without even trying.  Just blow-dry and go.  My daughter&#x27;s color-treated hair looks great - really makes the color &#x27;pop&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This is a better deal for the money than L&#x27;oreal Evercreme, and much more affordable than Wen. I must say that the smell is hard to deal with, but I found a way to get around it- I dump the bottle &amp; mix peppermint EO into the conditioner, then rebottle it. Not only does it smell better, but the peppermint makes your scalp tingly &amp; it doesn&#x27;t leave oily residue after either. My hair isn&#x27;t frizzy but still thick &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> Kind of wishing that I could give you a before and after picture of my hair; this really is a fantastic product. I love my hair, it really is lovely, but my scalp is another story. Everything irritates it, makes it flaky or too oily... long story short, it&#x27;s a real pain in the butt. I was skeptical when I bought this from a local drugstore at first, but I love, love, LOVE it! Has taken care of my scalp issue, and is so gentle and effective that my hair is full and lovely again. The one downside is that it really is meant to be used frequently; if you prefer to wash your hair every couple days or so, this may not be the product for you. I used to be like this, but I loved the smell of this product that I started using it every day and haven&#x27;t regretted it yet. :-)</li>
            <li> I always wanted to be a &amp;#34;Wen Girl&amp;#34; but wanted to try this one after reading the reviews. I do not like the smell and my hair seems to get dirty the morning after I wash it. I had to use approx 20 to 25 pumps each time I shampooed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;One bottle wont last me more then 10 uses before Ill have to buy again.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is terrible.&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels greasy and cant go more then 2 days without washing it again.&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt almost sticky and not anymore softer then if I used a cheap .99 cent bottle of V05.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;My thin hair felt thicker.&lt;br /&gt;not as much breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive been using Fekkai for about a year and really love it but I heard great things about using conditioner shampoo so I thought I would stray away from Fekkai. I didnt really care for this brand so I went ahead and purchased Wen to see if it makes a difference. While I&#x27;m waiting for Wen to arrive, I switched back to Fekkai and WOW I really notice a difference. Welcome back my old friend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ill give Wen a try but Im pretty sure it wont impress me more then Fekkai has over the last year.</li>
            <li> Works like Wen for sure but the smell of this won&#x27;t keep me using it. Blech! Like medicinal gardenia and not for me.</li>
            <li> Works just as good as wen, without the wen price tag!&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I received it before the estimated date</li>
    </ol>
