            <li>and I love the smell of it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Still, this is my favorite deodorant and one which does all that it claims to!</li>
            <li>So glad I did!</li>
            <li>And man, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>and I liked the price.</li>

            <li>You can always appreciate an excellent deodorant, and i really like this one.</li>
            <li>I found the scent to be surprisingly nice.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth it goes on, the fact that it moisturizes, and for someone like me who epilates I find it to be incredibly soothing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a pleasant scent that&#x27;s not too strong.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant is magic and I love it!  </li>
            <li>Unlike the soothing camomile this leaves a residue and kind of cakes up throughout the day - So apply lightly!</li>
            <li>I did not mess up your clothes, just perfect</li>
            <li>And it has a mild pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>This deodorant goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not to sure if its a miracle product</li>
            <li>I love almost all Dove deodorant.</li>
            <li>i love the smell and it keeps me from getting obnoxiously sweaty.</li>
            <li>i couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more</li>
            <li>pleased to report that my rash is gone.  </li>
            <li>Toms is better for sensitivity.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be able to wear this deodorant anymore.</li>
            <li>I like degree better, but dove does the job too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Dove deodorant for years and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>So, if you don&#x27;t sweat, or its cooler weather, it would be ok.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This deodorant has the most overwhelming scent.  </li>
            <li>and I smell better.</li>
            <li>im not using it continuously :) that could be a reason .</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely a better deodorant than a lot of the others I have used before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky and it doesn&#x27;t produce more sweat.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It does work--in fact, it works better than the men&#x27;s deodarant</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to figure that out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months now and my underarms have remained smooth!  </li>
            <li>I had the chance to try this in a research study and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I just hope the price doesn&#x27;t go up because it&#x27;s a great deal for such a good product.</li>
            <li>This is a awesome deodorant,my wife and daughter like the smell and that goes on smooth and kinda clear.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>The scent is very strong, though it works fine.  </li>
            <li>Nice sweet smell.</li>
            <li>Dove is always a great choice as far as deoderant.</li>
            <li>good product, reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>but I really wish it smelled good</li>
            <li>dove deodorants actually do what they say they&#x27;ll do and go sleeveless nourished beauty smells sooo good!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product but ordered online for a better deal than supermarkets and local stores.</li>
            <li>A very mild deodorant.</li>
            <li>strong protection</li>
            <li>I love the smell very pleasant and non messy.</li>
            <li>but it works just fine.</li>
            <li>This product really does work for reducing darker pigmentation caused from underarm shaving and it has a nice, light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried a &amp;#34;go sleeveless&amp;#34; one yet until this one, and it was fabulous.</li>
            <li>I use and like this lightly scented deo.</li>
            <li>I like the smooth feel of this deodorant</li>
            <li>What else can I say it is deodorant and is the brand my wife likes and is cheap on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It gives great lasting protection and I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy to say it&#x27;s the same product that I tested...</li>
            <li>I used to buy another brand for years, until I happened to come across this one on Amazon and decided to purchase in order to meet the minimum for free shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good deodorant but didn&#x27;t clear my under arms.</li>
            <li>So far a good product&lt;</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not much to say about deodorant, but this smells good, makes your underarms feel nice, and</li>
            <li>Really smells good and fresh.</li>
            <li>great deodorant, last long, smells great, doesn&#x27;t get on my clothes, I will continue to use this</li>
            <li>Soothes under arms after shaving every day and very good odor protection, the only thing that could be better is if it were clear</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I noticed any difference under my arms that would make me feel more interested in &amp;#34;going</li>
            <li>Maybe I would get used to it in time, but I haven&#x27;t been able to wear it since the first time.</li>
            <li>It works okay the first part of the day.  </li>
            <li>This is ok if you arnt working out or getting hot..</li>
            <li>The deodorant protection was good for about 24 hour use during times of light stress and moderate heat exposure.  </li>
            <li>The smell is like soap and shower gel, so it doesn&#x27;t block your perfume, it just gives a &#x27;clean&#x27; smell beneath your perfume.</li>
            <li>but it actually is a decently sweet scent</li>
            <li>This is a good buy and easier than going to the store to purchase the same item.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t floral or super sweet</li>
            <li>The mild fragrance is also pleasing and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not greasy or quick to moisten.</li>
            <li>The product arrived very quickly, and it smells like light perfume, in addition to fulfilling its main function.</li>
            <li>highly recommended :)</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s also a scent that has the word &amp;#34;cashmere&amp;#34; in it, I can&#x27;t remember the exact name, but that one smelled fabulous, too.</li>
            <li>Long lasting, smells great!</li>
            <li>You would be better of with the Dove Clear tone!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite of the Dove collection....as far as the smell goes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried this product out today but so far I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>Keeps me fresh</li>
            <li>Smelled nice, i don&#x27;t think it made white stains, would purchase again</li>
            <li>me fresh all day</li>
            <li>It smells nice and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;No worries about sweat when you&#x27;re in public or in school around your friends.</li>
            <li>Smaller than I expected for so,e reason, but smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I am also very prone to allergies (both skin and scent) and this one has only done good for me.</li>
            <li>It only leaves a residue on my clothes if I put too much on, but other than that, it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li>I like the scent very much.</li>
            <li>but this is the first time I&#x27;ve used this scent.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>When i used this for the first time i was so amazed and happy of how it felt on my skin and how long the scent last.</li>
            <li>I never thought I&#x27;d actually like a deodorant, but I sure do now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It Really Works!  </li>
            <li>This was my first order</li>
            <li>smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave heavy residue</li>
            <li>But I do live it for smell, texture and performance as a deodorant and if my pits end up looking nice, such a plus.</li>
            <li>really delivers on making armpits razorbump free, soft and smoothe.</li>
            <li>This one has a nice light scent that&#x27;s not overpowering in the least, yet it lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, which is a definite plus!  </li>
            <li>Smells good and the smell last long.</li>
            <li>The deodorant smells really good, and it last a long time.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really creamy and glides on like butter.</li>
            <li>I used to have a problem with my deodorant not working throughout the whole day.</li>
            <li>This deodorant was gentle on my irritated skin and may have even helped to promote healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use that much deodorant</li>
            <li>I thought there was someone around me wearing too much perfume for hours before figuring out</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t perspire much and here</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t heavy or offensive, and it&#x27;s really nice.  </li>
            <li>I love and hate this deodorant at the same time I love it because my armpits feel amazing they are soft and smooth</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, lasts all day long, and my underarm skin looks much lighter and smoother...</li>
            <li>The smell was light and it didn&#x27;t feel too dry or too goopy.</li>
            <li>leaves white on your clothes, and gets clumpy.. but most solid deodorants do.</li>
            <li>Once I dropped it onto the ground, the main part crashed into pieces.</li>
            <li>Under high stress times and exposure to high heat and humidity, I felt like I was &amp;#34;not</li>
            <li>I  highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I can buy things I use everyday at a better price I am on it.</li>
            <li>I like that the smell is very soft</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had a couple of very hot days here so far this year, and I have to be pretty active during the hottest part of the day (walking my dog, climbing the stairs in my office building), but I&#x27;ve always been completely protected.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dove keeps you drier than some of the other brands and has a soft light scent.</li>
            <li>I am not sure about it making my arm pits look better</li>
            <li>I normally use Secret outlast invisible solid and decided to give this Dove Go Sleeveless a try after seeing commercials for the &amp;#34;go sleeveless&amp;#34; aspect of it, not to mention I got it for a good price on S&amp;S and a coupon.  </li>
            <li>For us non-glistening women, steer clear.</li>
            <li>It seems to make my underarms soft</li>
            <li>Before I was using Toms because my armpits itch with deodorant since they are sensitive.</li>
            <li>I am completely sold on this product, will make it</li>
            <li>I think this has been the only thing that has work for me that fast.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 14 year old daughter however ended up using it myself because I ran out of deodorant before she did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh on my skin (which is why I purchased it for my daughter as she has sensitive skin)</li>
            <li>I literally smell like an old grandma</li>
            <li>I just smell old</li>
            <li>I really love this deodorant but the only thing is my airports still aren&#x27;t sleeveless after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li>Good and not too expensive.</li>
            <li>This leaves your body feeling so smooth and soft  Cleans very well and only need use a very small amount at a time.  </li>
            <li>I work out in the heat all day long and this actually keeps me scent free and works for the entire day and not just the first few hours.</li>
            <li>But be ware, this deodorant antipersperant is no match for a super active day in temps 80 degrees and above.</li>
            <li>My husband complained about how strong it was.  </li>
            <li>I like the scent as well since it smells a little flowery and fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go back to Dove unscented for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>whitens my armpit after using it for the first 2 weeks then darkens it, so i bought a different scent (flavor) and when my armpit starts to darken from this after a week of usage, id use the other one which is also a dove go sleeveless, then i dont have to suffer a darker armpit from these..</li>
            <li>It does help my sensitive skin, but really, as long as I don&#x27;t smell</li>
            <li>I can have a busy long day</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never really cared too much before, but in the mornings, I am a little self conscious.</li>

            <li> I did not mess up your clothes, just perfect</li>
            <li> And it has a mild pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This deodorant goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not to sure if its a miracle product</li>
            <li> I love almost all Dove deodorant.</li>
            <li> i love the smell and it keeps me from getting obnoxiously sweaty.</li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more</li>
            <li> pleased to report that my rash is gone.  </li>
            <li> Toms is better for sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be able to wear this deodorant anymore.</li>
            <li> I like degree better, but dove does the job too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dove deodorant for years and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> So, if you don&#x27;t sweat, or its cooler weather, it would be ok.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This deodorant has the most overwhelming scent.  </li>
            <li> and I smell better.</li>
            <li> im not using it continuously :) that could be a reason .</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely a better deodorant than a lot of the others I have used before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky and it doesn&#x27;t produce more sweat.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> It does work--in fact, it works better than the men&#x27;s deodarant</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to figure that out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months now and my underarms have remained smooth!  </li>
            <li> I had the chance to try this in a research study and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> I just hope the price doesn&#x27;t go up because it&#x27;s a great deal for such a good product.</li>
            <li> This is a awesome deodorant,my wife and daughter like the smell and that goes on smooth and kinda clear.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this deodorant.</li>
            <li> The scent is very strong, though it works fine.  </li>
            <li> Nice sweet smell.</li>
            <li> Dove is always a great choice as far as deoderant.</li>
            <li> good product, reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> but I really wish it smelled good</li>
            <li> dove deodorants actually do what they say they&#x27;ll do and go sleeveless nourished beauty smells sooo good!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product but ordered online for a better deal than supermarkets and local stores.</li>
            <li> A very mild deodorant.</li>
            <li> strong protection</li>
            <li> I love the smell very pleasant and non messy.</li>
            <li> but it works just fine.</li>
            <li> This product really does work for reducing darker pigmentation caused from underarm shaving and it has a nice, light fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried a &amp;#34;go sleeveless&amp;#34; one yet until this one, and it was fabulous.</li>
            <li> I use and like this lightly scented deo.</li>
            <li> I like the smooth feel of this deodorant</li>
            <li> What else can I say it is deodorant and is the brand my wife likes and is cheap on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It gives great lasting protection and I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy to say it&#x27;s the same product that I tested...</li>
            <li> I used to buy another brand for years, until I happened to come across this one on Amazon and decided to purchase in order to meet the minimum for free shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good deodorant but didn&#x27;t clear my under arms.</li>
            <li> So far a good product&lt;</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about deodorant, but this smells good, makes your underarms feel nice, and</li>
            <li> Really smells good and fresh.</li>
            <li> great deodorant, last long, smells great, doesn&#x27;t get on my clothes, I will continue to use this</li>
            <li> Soothes under arms after shaving every day and very good odor protection, the only thing that could be better is if it were clear</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I noticed any difference under my arms that would make me feel more interested in &amp;#34;going</li>
            <li> Maybe I would get used to it in time, but I haven&#x27;t been able to wear it since the first time.</li>
            <li> It works okay the first part of the day.  </li>
            <li> This is ok if you arnt working out or getting hot..</li>
            <li> The deodorant protection was good for about 24 hour use during times of light stress and moderate heat exposure.  </li>
            <li> The smell is like soap and shower gel, so it doesn&#x27;t block your perfume, it just gives a &#x27;clean&#x27; smell beneath your perfume.</li>
            <li> but it actually is a decently sweet scent</li>
            <li> This is a good buy and easier than going to the store to purchase the same item.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t floral or super sweet</li>
            <li> The mild fragrance is also pleasing and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not greasy or quick to moisten.</li>
            <li> The product arrived very quickly, and it smells like light perfume, in addition to fulfilling its main function.</li>
            <li> highly recommended :)</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s also a scent that has the word &amp;#34;cashmere&amp;#34; in it, I can&#x27;t remember the exact name, but that one smelled fabulous, too.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, smells great!</li>
            <li> You would be better of with the Dove Clear tone!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite of the Dove collection....as far as the smell goes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried this product out today but so far I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Keeps me fresh</li>
            <li> Smelled nice, i don&#x27;t think it made white stains, would purchase again</li>
            <li> me fresh all day</li>
            <li> It smells nice and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;No worries about sweat when you&#x27;re in public or in school around your friends.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected for so,e reason, but smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am also very prone to allergies (both skin and scent) and this one has only done good for me.</li>
            <li> It only leaves a residue on my clothes if I put too much on, but other than that, it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> I like the scent very much.</li>
            <li> but this is the first time I&#x27;ve used this scent.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> When i used this for the first time i was so amazed and happy of how it felt on my skin and how long the scent last.</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d actually like a deodorant, but I sure do now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It Really Works!  </li>
            <li> This was my first order</li>
            <li> smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave heavy residue</li>
            <li> But I do live it for smell, texture and performance as a deodorant and if my pits end up looking nice, such a plus.</li>
            <li> really delivers on making armpits razorbump free, soft and smoothe.</li>
            <li> This one has a nice light scent that&#x27;s not overpowering in the least, yet it lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, which is a definite plus!  </li>
            <li> Smells good and the smell last long.</li>
            <li> The deodorant smells really good, and it last a long time.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really creamy and glides on like butter.</li>
            <li> I used to have a problem with my deodorant not working throughout the whole day.</li>
            <li> This deodorant was gentle on my irritated skin and may have even helped to promote healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use that much deodorant</li>
            <li> I thought there was someone around me wearing too much perfume for hours before figuring out</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t perspire much and here</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t heavy or offensive, and it&#x27;s really nice.  </li>
            <li> I love and hate this deodorant at the same time I love it because my armpits feel amazing they are soft and smooth</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, lasts all day long, and my underarm skin looks much lighter and smoother...</li>
            <li> The smell was light and it didn&#x27;t feel too dry or too goopy.</li>
            <li> leaves white on your clothes, and gets clumpy.. but most solid deodorants do.</li>
            <li> Once I dropped it onto the ground, the main part crashed into pieces.</li>
            <li> Under high stress times and exposure to high heat and humidity, I felt like I was &amp;#34;not</li>
            <li> I  highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I can buy things I use everyday at a better price I am on it.</li>
            <li> I like that the smell is very soft</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had a couple of very hot days here so far this year, and I have to be pretty active during the hottest part of the day (walking my dog, climbing the stairs in my office building), but I&#x27;ve always been completely protected.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dove keeps you drier than some of the other brands and has a soft light scent.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about it making my arm pits look better</li>
            <li> I normally use Secret outlast invisible solid and decided to give this Dove Go Sleeveless a try after seeing commercials for the &amp;#34;go sleeveless&amp;#34; aspect of it, not to mention I got it for a good price on S&amp;S and a coupon.  </li>
            <li> For us non-glistening women, steer clear.</li>
            <li> It seems to make my underarms soft</li>
            <li> Before I was using Toms because my armpits itch with deodorant since they are sensitive.</li>
            <li> I am completely sold on this product, will make it</li>
            <li> I think this has been the only thing that has work for me that fast.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 14 year old daughter however ended up using it myself because I ran out of deodorant before she did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not harsh on my skin (which is why I purchased it for my daughter as she has sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> I literally smell like an old grandma</li>
            <li> I just smell old</li>
            <li> I really love this deodorant but the only thing is my airports still aren&#x27;t sleeveless after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Good and not too expensive.</li>
            <li> This leaves your body feeling so smooth and soft  Cleans very well and only need use a very small amount at a time.  </li>
            <li> I work out in the heat all day long and this actually keeps me scent free and works for the entire day and not just the first few hours.</li>
            <li> But be ware, this deodorant antipersperant is no match for a super active day in temps 80 degrees and above.</li>
            <li> My husband complained about how strong it was.  </li>
            <li> I like the scent as well since it smells a little flowery and fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go back to Dove unscented for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> whitens my armpit after using it for the first 2 weeks then darkens it, so i bought a different scent (flavor) and when my armpit starts to darken from this after a week of usage, id use the other one which is also a dove go sleeveless, then i dont have to suffer a darker armpit from these..</li>
            <li> It does help my sensitive skin, but really, as long as I don&#x27;t smell</li>
            <li> I can have a busy long day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really cared too much before, but in the mornings, I am a little self conscious.</li>
            <li> I typically go for the cool essentials cucumber &amp; green tea scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this product works well, but the intense smell is too difficult to get past.  </li>
            <li> Within a week, my underarm bumps were nearly gone completely, and with very little effort on my part.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what why i like this so much</li>
            <li> Long lasting</li>
            <li> It stays on you for a long time.</li>
            <li> I like that the deodorant lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> This product does not last as long as other Dove deodorants.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this problem with several other deodorants I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely go back to other scents of Dove</li>
            <li> It did leave a white residue on my clothes like all other deodorants.  </li>
            <li> Helps keep me dry and doesn&#x27;t get all over my clothes.  </li>
            <li> (Got an itchy, dry, flaky rash.)  </li>
            <li> Keeps me dry all day</li>
            <li> like how well the Dove deodorants work for me keeping me dry even on workout days.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and I do feel dry through out the day,</li>
            <li> After mild work out this one failed.</li>
            <li> It does make you a little softer but does not hold up to my work out routine or the daily heat in Texas.</li>
            <li> It also made my pits really rough after i washed it off.</li>
            <li> this one did not really work for me.  </li>
            <li> However, it does not work as well as some other antiperspirants that I have used.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t protect against odor as well as their other deodorants.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with other perfumes.</li>
            <li> I will never ever use any other brand.</li>
            <li> --It&#x27;s so dry, not smooth.</li>
            <li> im using over a month , seeing slight change , not much though.</li>
            <li> With the other deodorant I used to buy, I used to sometimes feel an itch due to dryness and sometimes a slight allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not looking hard enough</li>
            <li> so i dont get a dark underarm.</li>
            <li> My underarms have always been dark, no matter how often I shave them.</li>
            <li> This gets all over black and dark colored clothing...</li>
            <li> I do not have to reapply it after a few hour&#x27;s like my other</li>
            <li> black clothing).  </li>
            <li> In my experience the non-fruity scents are typically overpowering and obnoxious with an overabundance of floral and musk but that&#x27;s not the case at all here.</li>
            <li> And, with each application,  it builds up into a goopy mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times, but the fragrance makes me a little nauseous.</li>
            <li> My underarms are one of the few places I don&#x27;t get irritation bumps post-epilation and I attribute that to my Dove deodorant.</li>
            <li> (i have a special travel deodorant) and when i got back, the deodorant was all dried out and now its useless!!!</li>
            <li> BUT unfortunately I got this one because a few reviews said they don&#x27;t get red bumps under their arms.</li>
            <li> It makes sick I&#x27;m so sad because I love the way it makes me feel</li>
            <li> I notice I get small bumps and irritation under my arms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used dove soaps and body washes all my life due to exzema, during my adolescents I always used secret until my ph balance changed.</li>
            <li> Also it is less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have seriously tried ever brand of deodorant ever created.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s tough to say.</li>
            <li> I have very thick underarm hair and this truly does help soften it.</li>
            <li> Leaves residue on clothing worse than others as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very subtle scent, and she says it works as well as move expensive deodorants.</li>
            <li> It will fail on you</li>
            <li> Unfortunately that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case for me.</li>
            <li> I was using Secret Clinical Strength deodorant and had a horrible reaction to it after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> With Toms I started to smell bad after about 6 hrs.</li>
            <li> It shouldn&#x27;t give one a bad headache.  </li>
            <li> but I hate it because the deodorant smells horrible</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s horrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> works well but there are several holes in my knit shirts now. I&#x27;ll go back to Dove unscented for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very thick underarm hair and this truly does help soften it. It also smells great and lasts through the day!!!</li>
            <li> I like this product however I can smell it all day!!  It seems to make my underarms soft but I think I need to find a different scent.</li>
            <li> Dove go sleeveless beauty finish deodorant really delivers on making armpits razorbump free, soft and smoothe. The mild fragrance is also pleasing and lasts all day. But be ware, this deodorant antipersperant is no match for a super active day in temps 80 degrees and above. In such a case be prepared to reapply.</li>
            <li> This product really does work for reducing darker pigmentation caused from underarm shaving and it has a nice, light fragrance.  However, it does not work as well as some other antiperspirants that I have used.  Nevertheless, I like it enough to continue using it in the future.</li>
            <li> I love all Doves product keep up the Excellent work yall the very best company evenT mom even buys them we love them please don&#x27;t stop selling them Thank You.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used dove soaps and body washes all my life due to exzema, during my adolescents I always used secret until my ph balance changed. It took me a while to get use to it, but now its the only deodrant I use. The subscriber price is better then retail!</li>
            <li> I normally use Secret outlast invisible solid and decided to give this Dove Go Sleeveless a try after seeing commercials for the &amp;#34;go sleeveless&amp;#34; aspect of it, not to mention I got it for a good price on S&amp;S and a coupon.  The container was a bit smaller than I anticipated.  The smell was light and it didn&#x27;t feel too dry or too goopy. The deodorant protection was good for about 24 hour use during times of light stress and moderate heat exposure.  Under high stress times and exposure to high heat and humidity, I felt like I was &amp;#34;not so fresh&amp;#34; and felt the urge to touch up.  I can&#x27;t say I noticed any difference under my arms that would make me feel more interested in &amp;#34;going sleeveless&amp;#34;.  I used it for about 6 weeks and didn&#x27;t notice any difference in that area.</li>
            <li> This deodorant goes on very smooth. I&#x27;m not to sure if its a miracle product but it works just fine.</li>
            <li> This leaves your body feeling so smooth and soft  Cleans very well and only need use a very small amount at a time.  Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I like this brand, and I was basically looking for items to take on vacation.  I saw this and I liked the price.</li>
            <li> I love Dove deodorant! I&#x27;ve used it for years but this is the first time I&#x27;ve used this scent. It smells great and works well.</li>
            <li> Smells really good despite some reviewers saying it has an &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; scent. It isn&#x27;t floral or super sweet but it actually is a decently sweet scent and it&#x27;s really creamy and glides on like butter. Doesn&#x27;t last all day, but it kinda does?</li>
            <li> I love almost all Dove deodorant. I haven&#x27;t tried a &amp;#34;go sleeveless&amp;#34; one yet until this one, and it was fabulous.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite of the Dove collection....as far as the smell goes. Unlike the soothing camomile this leaves a residue and kind of cakes up throughout the day - So apply lightly! It is great to use after shaving. Dove is always a great choice as far as deoderant.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, which is a definite plus!  Helps keep me dry and doesn&#x27;t get all over my clothes.  Also, I haven&#x27;t experienced any sting after shaving my underarms.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I used to have a problem with my deodorant not working throughout the whole day. but with dove, even though i work a laborous job outdoors all day, i still smell like a lady at the end of the day. i love the smell and it keeps me from getting obnoxiously sweaty. i couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say it actually does anything for &amp;#34;going sleeveless&amp;#34;. It smells great, though! leaves white on your clothes, and gets clumpy.. but most solid deodorants do.</li>
            <li> I use and like this lightly scented deo. It&#x27;s a great product but ordered online for a better deal than supermarkets and local stores.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is great! I use it daily and it has helped my underarm skin to be smoother. I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> It hurts when I use it. And I don&#x27;t like the design of the product--It&#x27;s so dry, not smooth. Once I dropped it onto the ground, the main part crashed into pieces. I have no idea why this product seemed so fragile.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good deodorant but didn&#x27;t clear my under arms. Get the job done though. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks. Smells good and the smell last long.</li>
            <li> smells awesome and I never have pit stains with it, it  smells good and does the job don&#x27;t know what else to say!</li>
            <li> i love the smell and feel of it! strong protection and it does help with skin discoloration! highly recommended :)</li>
            <li> I was using Secret Clinical Strength deodorant and had a horrible reaction to it after a few weeks.  (Got an itchy, dry, flaky rash.)  I got rid of that and tried using Dove Go Sleeveless instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased to report that my rash is gone.  This deodorant was gentle on my irritated skin and may have even helped to promote healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant scent that&#x27;s not too strong.  I think it&#x27;s effective as both an anti-perspirant and a deodorant.  We&#x27;ve had a couple of very hot days here so far this year, and I have to be pretty active during the hottest part of the day (walking my dog, climbing the stairs in my office building), but I&#x27;ve always been completely protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely a fan of this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried this product out today but so far I am happy with it. Before I was using Toms because my armpits itch with deodorant since they are sensitive. With Toms I started to smell bad after about 6 hrs. Today I smelt good all day! I like the scent as well since it smells a little flowery and fresh. So far a good product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Took off two stars because now that I&#x27;ve used it a couple times I notice I get small bumps and irritation under my arms. Toms is better for sensitivity. I won&#x27;t be able to wear this deodorant anymore.</li>
            <li> good product, reasonable price.  I like degree better, but dove does the job too.  smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave heavy residue</li>
            <li> This deodorant is great! It smells awesome, goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes, and it works well.</li>
            <li> Dove is a very good brand of beauty supplies. Good fragrance, it isn&#x27;t over powering. It shouldn&#x27;t give one a bad headache.  A very mild deodorant.</li>
            <li> whitens my armpit after using it for the first 2 weeks then darkens it, so i bought a different scent (flavor) and when my armpit starts to darken from this after a week of usage, id use the other one which is also a dove go sleeveless, then i dont have to suffer a darker armpit from these.. i have to keep alternating the 2 so i dont get a dark underarm.</li>
            <li> This is a good buy and easier than going to the store to purchase the same item.  Also it is less expensive.</li>
            <li> It does help my sensitive skin, but really, as long as I don&#x27;t smell I don&#x27;t really care. Good and not too expensive.</li>
            <li> Dove keeps you drier than some of the other brands and has a soft light scent. Does not show on any of the clothing and does not &amp;#34;roll&amp;#34; up under your arms. I am completely sold on this product, will make it my #1 choice for deodorant.</li>
            <li> I like the smooth feel of this deodorant and it&#x27;s not greasy or quick to moisten. I don&#x27;t use that much deodorant and I don&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> Not sure what why i like this so much but I just do, it works for me. Keeps me fresh</li>
            <li> The product arrived very quickly, and it smells like light perfume, in addition to fulfilling its main function. I am really happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this product works well, but the intense smell is too difficult to get past.  I don&#x27;t wear perfume or loud-smelling hair products.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times, but the fragrance makes me a little nauseous.</li>
            <li> Does the job.  What else can I say it is deodorant and is the brand my wife likes and is cheap on Amazon.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about deodorant, but this smells good, makes your underarms feel nice, and using the Amazon coupon I got it at a price that even the big discount stores couldn&#x27;t beat. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Smelled nice, i don&#x27;t think it made white stains, would purchase again</li>
            <li> This deodorant definetely moisturized but it left a white residue. It also made my pits really rough after i washed it off. You would be better of with the Dove Clear tone!</li>
            <li> I got deodorant for my fiance, and she loves it.  It&#x27;s a very subtle scent, and she says it works as well as move expensive deodorants.</li>
            <li> Dove is always a good product to purchase. The deodorant smells really good, and it last a long time. With a coupon from amazon, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was only $2 dollars so i decided to try it. It says it reduces underarm wetness and protect you for up to 48 hours and i couldnt be hapier. I been using it for 5 days now and it works great. I think this has been the only thing that has work for me that fast. I&#x27;ve tried women and man deororants and nothing worked for me until now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dove deodorant for years and absolutely love it. I decided to try the &amp;#34;go sleeveless&amp;#34;, because it was on sale, and have used it for a month now. I&#x27;m not liking it AT ALL. It doesn&#x27;t protect against odor as well as their other deodorants. I&#x27;m needing to reapply several times a day (its August and in the 90&#x27;s) but have never had that issue with deodorant before. And, with each application,  it builds up into a goopy mess. Leaves residue on clothing worse than others as well. But, with that being said, it DOES moisturize and soften your underarms. And it has a mild pleasant smell. So, if you don&#x27;t sweat, or its cooler weather, it would be ok. Otherwise, stick to their regular deodorant.</li>
            <li> SMELLS.&lt;br /&gt;SO.&lt;br /&gt;GOOD.&lt;br /&gt;keeps me fresh all day and I love the smell of it!</li>
            <li> I love this product. The smell is like soap and shower gel, so it doesn&#x27;t block your perfume, it just gives a &#x27;clean&#x27; smell beneath your perfume. I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it! Long lasting, smells great! I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my armpits but I like it anyway. Maybe takes longer use. Maybe I&#x27;m not looking hard enough, it&#x27;s tough to say. But I do live it for smell, texture and performance as a deodorant and if my pits end up looking nice, such a plus.</li>
            <li> This deodorant has the most overwhelming scent.  I thought there was someone around me wearing too much perfume for hours before figuring out it was my armpits.  Maybe I would get used to it in time, but I haven&#x27;t been able to wear it since the first time.</li>
            <li> Nice sweet smell. I like that the smell is very soft so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with other perfumes. Keeps me dry all day and I smell better.</li>
            <li> im using over a month , seeing slight change , not much though. im not using it continuously :) that could be a reason .</li>
            <li> It works okay the first part of the day.  After that, no protection.  I&#x27;ve had this problem with several other deodorants I&#x27;ve tried.  Like  a lot of things, I guess it just depends on the person.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if helps the look but it&#x27;s definitely a better deodorant than a lot of the others I have used before. It&#x27;s not sticky and it doesn&#x27;t produce more sweat. It stays on you for a long time.</li>
            <li> This product does not last as long as other Dove deodorants.  Will definitely go back to other scents of Dove</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as to whether or not it would actually make my underarms look better. I&#x27;ve never really cared too much before, but in the mornings, I am a little self conscious. My underarms have always been dark, no matter how often I shave them. After 3 days, the darkness was gone! It only leaves a residue on my clothes if I put too much on, but other than that, it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 14 year old daughter however ended up using it myself because I ran out of deodorant before she did. I love it.  It&#x27;s not harsh on my skin (which is why I purchased it for my daughter as she has sensitive skin) It has a good scent to it and it works. I work out in the heat all day long and this actually keeps me scent free and works for the entire day and not just the first few hours. I do not have to reapply it after a few hour&#x27;s like my other deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, will keep it on the auto subscribe. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I like that the deodorant lasts a long time.  The smell lasts well over 24 hours.  I am not sure about it making my arm pits look better but I like the way it goes on. I  highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;No worries about sweat when you&#x27;re in public or in school around your friends.</li>
            <li> I love and hate this deodorant at the same time I love it because my armpits feel amazing they are soft and smooth it feels wonderful but I hate it because the deodorant smells horrible I literally smell like an old grandma it&#x27;s horrible It makes sick I&#x27;m so sad because I love the way it makes me feel but I really wish it smelled good I just smell old</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to rate deodorant, but I like this.  The smell isn&#x27;t heavy or offensive, and it&#x27;s really nice.  It has made my skin under my arms softer.  It does work--in fact, it works better than the men&#x27;s deodarant I was wearing before.  Well played, Dove, well played.</li>
            <li> This is ok if you arnt working out or getting hot.. It will fail on you is you r working out or sweating</li>
            <li> I like using Dove deodorant. This deodorant does not leave film on my clothes. It also does not cause itching.</li>
            <li> This is currently my go-to brand.  It works pretty well as an anti-persperant, and while I&#x27;m not sure the moisturizers work quite as well as advertised, my skin does seem smoother when I use it regularly.  I like the scent very much.</li>
            <li> You can always appreciate an excellent deodorant, and i really like this one. This is one i would purchase over and over again</li>
            <li> It gives great lasting protection and I would recommend it to others. I love the smell very pleasant and non messy.</li>
            <li> When i used this for the first time i was so amazed and happy of how it felt on my skin and how long the scent last. I did not mess up your clothes, just perfect, I will be using this from now on. Love it.</li>
            <li> It smells great. However, it does not have the staying power I need on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a lady who &amp;#34;glistens&amp;#34; instead of sweat, this is the product for you.  For us non-glistening women, steer clear.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why this is called Go Sleeveless...I have never been able to figure that out. This gets all over black and dark colored clothing...so I will be switching to something else.</li>
            <li> As antiperspirants go.... this one did not really work for me.  I don&#x27;t perspire much and here it is winter.  The silver bottle clinical one my husband has WORKS 100%.  After mild work out this one failed.</li>
            <li> I have seriously tried ever brand of deodorant ever created. I don&#x27;t know if its me, but no matter the brand or the amount applied, my deodorant cakes up into white balls in my arm pits. It drives me crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I bought this stuff. And man, this stuff is amazing. I never thought I&#x27;d actually like a deodorant, but I sure do now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hooked. Give it a try and so will you.</li>
            <li> dove makes all of the best deodorant. period. I will never ever use any other brand. dove deodorants actually do what they say they&#x27;ll do and go sleeveless nourished beauty smells sooo good! there&#x27;s also a scent that has the word &amp;#34;cashmere&amp;#34; in it, I can&#x27;t remember the exact name, but that one smelled fabulous, too. I even got my mom hooked on dove lol. I&#x27;ve been using dove for years. please, never stop making this deodorant!!</li>
            <li> Really smells good and fresh. Definitely would buy again. Now whether it changes textures or something in your armpit area I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I began using this product just before summer.  My underarms have been bumpy for years, no matter what I have done to try and correct it.  After three days of using this deodorant, I began to notice a change.  Within a week, my underarm bumps were nearly gone completely, and with very little effort on my part.  This deodorant is magic and I love it!  The scent is flowery but not overpowering - I don&#x27;t even notice it after I have applied it.  And it works great as an anti-perspirant deodorant, too.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months now and my underarms have remained smooth!  The one flaw is that it is not totally invisible, so it will leave some white marks on your clothing (esp. black clothing).  And if you overapply it, it will appear as a white cream in the creases of your armpit.  Still, this is my favorite deodorant and one which does all that it claims to!</li>
            <li> I had gotten this item shipped to my house and it was great. Then I went away on a trip for 2 weeks (i have a special travel deodorant) and when i got back, the deodorant was all dried out and now its useless!!!</li>
            <li> it actually works on the tone of your skin!</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected for so,e reason, but smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> great deodorant, last long, smells great, doesn&#x27;t get on my clothes, I will continue to use this and it is cheaper to buy on here with the subscribe and save then in stores, and easier to just have it mailed so I always have it when I need it!</li>
            <li> I really love this deodorant but the only thing is my airports still aren&#x27;t sleeveless after a few weeks of use. But it works all day and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I had the chance to try this in a research study and fell in love with it.  It goes on smooth, lasts all day long, and my underarm skin looks much lighter and smoother... It Really Works!  This was my first order and I&#x27;m happy to say it&#x27;s the same product that I tested... I just hope the price doesn&#x27;t go up because it&#x27;s a great deal for such a good product.</li>
            <li> Great purchase and was a nice gift to my wife. Got it in a good deal. I do recommend this product</li>
            <li> This is a awesome deodorant,my wife and daughter like the smell and that goes on smooth and kinda clear.Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This deodarant is amazing! Soothes under arms after shaving every day and very good odor protection, the only thing that could be better is if it were clear</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this deodorant.  Long lasting and I totally trust in the product.  I can have a busy long day and I can still smell the freshness of the deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dove deodorant for years. I typically go for the cool essentials cucumber &amp; green tea scent but this one was offered at a price I couldn&#x27;t pass up so I decided to give it a try. I found the scent to be surprisingly nice. In my experience the non-fruity scents are typically overpowering and obnoxious with an overabundance of floral and musk but that&#x27;s not the case at all here. This one has a nice light scent that&#x27;s not overpowering in the least, yet it lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove deodorant is great stuff and this variety is no exception. I love how smooth it goes on, the fact that it moisturizes, and for someone like me who epilates I find it to be incredibly soothing. My underarms are one of the few places I don&#x27;t get irritation bumps post-epilation and I attribute that to my Dove deodorant. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li> It does make you a little softer but does not hold up to my work out routine or the daily heat in Texas.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this deodorant. I used to buy another brand for years, until I happened to come across this one on Amazon and decided to purchase in order to meet the minimum for free shipping. So glad I did! They aren&#x27;t kidding about it making your underarms softer. I felt the difference immediately. I am also very prone to allergies (both skin and scent) and this one has only done good for me. With the other deodorant I used to buy, I used to sometimes feel an itch due to dryness and sometimes a slight allergic reaction. Not to mention, the scent lingers and protects the entire day. I get home to shower and the scent still there.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t experienced anything but flawless protection with this product. :-)</li>
            <li> what can I saty anytime I can buy things I use everyday at a better price I am on it.</li>
            <li> Dove go sleeveless Beauty Finish Deodorant&lt;br /&gt;Really like how well the Dove deodorants work for me keeping me dry even on workout days.&lt;br /&gt;This one is not overly scented so it does not bother my allergies and it works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;I do like that i can use this deodorant without any break outs happening even after shaving.</li>
            <li> The scent is very strong, though it works fine.  My husband complained about how strong it was.  It did leave a white residue on my clothes like all other deodorants.  Wish they could solve that problem.</li>
            <li> The scent is great and I do feel dry through out the day, BUT unfortunately I got this one because a few reviews said they don&#x27;t get red bumps under their arms. Unfortunately that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case for me.</li>
