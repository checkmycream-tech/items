    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Suits me perfectly and will buy it again when needed.</li>
            <li>The color is wonderful, too.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees is an incredibly moisturizing lip balm/shimmer/gloss!  </li>
            <li>Wonderful Burt&#x27;s Bees product.  </li>
            <li>It is like lipstick but with the wonderful Burt&#x27;s bees chapstick with moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The perfect lip stick/lip moisturizer from my favorite cosmetic/naturals&lt;br /&gt;company!</li>
            <li>This is great stuff.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, a great product.</li>
            <li>My lips feel so good after wearing this all day, but it looks as good as lipstick!  </li>
            <li>color is great, not too strong, and a bit transparent~&lt;br /&gt;Tastes fine~&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Beautiful rich color.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and would certainly buy again.</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d known it was a dead-on dupe for Revlon&#x27;s Lip Butter lipstick in &#x27;RASPBERRY PIE&#x27;, which I already own, but never wear bc</li>
            <li>The color is nice and just a tint.  </li>
            <li>I keep it in my pants pocket, so it&#x27;s always handy.</li>
            <li>This is a great, natural line of lip products that feel great and wear well.</li>
            <li>it is super duper fuschia and bad-looking on my fair skin.</li>
            <li>just a nice light hint of color.</li>
            <li>I like it better as a blush than as a lip color.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite go too beauty item.  </li>
            <li>I love the color and the feel of this lip gloss.  </li>
            <li>If you put a gun to my head, and told me to wear the lipstick that most makes me look like &amp;#34;Frankenhooker&amp;#34;, I&#x27;d def choose this one over Revlon&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I love these lip shimmers and carry them everywhere.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know better.  </li>
            <li>You do need their lip shine on top of it to add color layers for it to show up more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this lip shimmer.</li>
            <li>Can be layered to appear darker for more formal occasions.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect lip stick, lots of moisturizer, with a little color, great smaller size, great price, and a lot of color choices.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good Burt&#x27;s Bee lip product.  </li>
            <li>importantly, the ingredients seem to be safe.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to put on and have a bit of a minty taste to them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if you want full color, better to just use lipstick.</li>
            <li>It keeps your lips soft and the color is not too glossy or matte...just perfectly for a natural look.</li>
            <li>It does the job, lasts, and if you start out with lipstick and then eat it off, just a dab of this makes your lips feel great, and refreshes the color instantly.  </li>
            <li>A great winter alternative to regular lipstick.</li>
            <li>But, this time I got a tube from Walgreen&#x27;s and the minty shimmer goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It is light but shiny</li>
            <li>It feels less like something to make me attractive and more like something to draw flies to their death, getting hopelessly stuck in the goo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My new favorite.</li>
            <li>The color stays on and is pretty rich.  </li>
            <li>The formula of this lip gloss is nice enough, and I like the mint tingle, as others have mentioned.  </li>
            <li>It is a tad intense, but looks great on a gal with dark hair and eyes.</li>
            <li>It is slightly deeper than a bright fuschia, once applied.  </li>
            <li>love this product and use daily.</li>
            <li>i love Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s it is the only thing that keeps my lips from getting chapped.  </li>
            <li>I like the transparent colors and same Burts Bees protection that I have come to love.</li>
            <li>so you may need to exfoliate first.  </li>
            <li>Bought more than one in different colors.  </li>
            <li>After application, it has a very cooling peppermint feel to it.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;zing\\&quot; does last for awhile and while I enjoy it, others may not</li>
            <li>Sometimes I just used lipliner and fill in with this...gives the color and has a much nicer feel than lipstick.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much brighter on that it appears to be in the tube, and it just looks garish.  </li>
            <li>This product is much richer than the tinted lip shine--</li>
            <li>Great natural way to have subtle lip color.  </li>
            <li>I look forward to trying some of the other Burt&#x27;s Bees lip products but between the 2 this is the better for color. .</li>
            <li>After hearing all the great reviews about Burt&#x27;s Bees and their \\&quot;fantastic\\&quot; lip balm, I was curious enough to buy several of their products to try.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent way to touch up color if your normal stuff wears off, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.  </li>
            <li>Also, if your lips are dry, the pigment will mostly absorb into the dry areas first</li>
            <li>I read that commercial red lipsticks contain lead which is harmful, so I like using Burt&#x27;s Bees as a more natural choice.</li>
            <li>I am a matte lipstick person, so this was a new look for me.</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised with the results!</li>
            <li>Lip balm with soft color.</li>
            <li>Appreciate the natural look with a bit of added color.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the price (at my local target it costs the same)</li>
            <li>love the way it feels on, moisturizes without feeling thick or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>While it seemed to glide on smoothly, upon further inspection, I noticed that the color tended to settle a bit too heavily into the lip creases.  </li>
            <li>I also like the fact that the lip shimmers  are sheer and 100% natural.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, the Rhubarb color is, as a prior reviewer mentioned, a little intense.  </li>

            <li> My problem with normal lip gloss is the heavy feeling of goo on my lips.</li>
            <li> It was a lighter color than expected (see photo) but was definitely red!</li>
            <li> It has some mica in it to give it a pleasingly soft (almost imperceptible) shimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried this before and it was clearly an old tube because the contents were dried out</li>
            <li> It also accented dry patches all over my lips that I didn&#x27;t know I had</li>
            <li> My lipsticks are lonely, this lip shimmer</li>
            <li> I bought this in Rhubarb, as it looked like it might be a darkish pink.  </li>
            <li> I applied my regular lipstick (Lancome Rouge Sensation/Dior Addict Lipstick) to one half and Lip Shine to the other half and inspected it.  </li>
            <li> Recently, I ran out of my usual cream blush and decided to try using this as blush.</li>
            <li> If you have trouble with your lipstick bleeding, you might have trouble with this one or apply a lip liner.</li>
            <li> Usually anything this moisturizing does not have the amount of color that this has.  </li>
            <li> At least the Burt&#x27;s Bees has a pepperminty smell and taste.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the color is all wrong on me-</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t sticky or smell bad like a lot of lip glosses, either.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Recently, I ran out of my usual cream blush and decided to try using this as blush. I was happily surprised with the results! It goes on creamy and blends well. It doesn&#x27;t add a lot of color; just a nice light hint of color. I like it better as a blush than as a lip color.</li>
            <li> This arrived on time and made my lips feel moisturized. It was a lighter color than expected (see photo) but was definitely red! Overall for the quality and being organic (thank god no rashes for allergic reactions with this company) I think it&#x27;s worth the price (at my local target it costs the same)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite go too beauty item.  I wear it no matter what and the color is fab!</li>
            <li> I love the color and the feel of this lip gloss.  I carry one around in my pocket or purse 24/7.  It keeps your lips soft and the color is not too glossy or matte...just perfectly for a natural look.</li>
            <li> Lip balm with soft color. love this product and use daily. havent used lipstick in years!</li>
            <li> I bought this in the shade RHUBARB. I wish I&#x27;d known it was a dead-on dupe for Revlon&#x27;s Lip Butter lipstick in &#x27;RASPBERRY PIE&#x27;, which I already own, but never wear bc it is super duper fuschia and bad-looking on my fair skin. Dammit. At least the Burt&#x27;s Bees has a pepperminty smell and taste. If you put a gun to my head, and told me to wear the lipstick that most makes me look like &amp;#34;Frankenhooker&amp;#34;, I&#x27;d def choose this one over Revlon&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> After hearing all the great reviews about Burt&#x27;s Bees and their \\&quot;fantastic\\&quot; lip balm, I was curious enough to buy several of their products to try.  I purchased three of the lip shimmers, one in Rhubarb, Champagne, and Nutmeg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the Rhubarb color is, as a prior reviewer mentioned, a little intense.  It is slightly deeper than a bright fuschia, once applied.  After application, it has a very cooling peppermint feel to it.  The feeling reminded me of the \\&quot;Softlips\\&quot; brand.  The \\&quot;zing\\&quot; does last for awhile and while I enjoy it, others may not (It&#x27;s like forgetting to wipe Listerine off of your lips).  I also like the fact that the lip shimmers  are sheer and 100% natural.  It has some mica in it to give it a pleasingly soft (almost imperceptible) shimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I did not like about the product:  While it seemed to glide on smoothly, upon further inspection, I noticed that the color tended to settle a bit too heavily into the lip creases.  It also accented dry patches all over my lips that I didn&#x27;t know I had - I applied my regular lipstick (Lancome Rouge Sensation/Dior Addict Lipstick) to one half and Lip Shine to the other half and inspected it.  With the Lip Shine, I got patchiness.  On the lipstick side, no patches.  I have never seen \\&quot;patchiness\\&quot; like this.  But I&#x27;ve got an entire stick to get through now, so I guess it&#x27;s going in the purse &#x27;till it&#x27;s done or I lose it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict?  It&#x27;s a decent way to touch up color if your normal stuff wears off, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.  I think I&#x27;ll try a different brand, such as Shea Terra Organics or Beesworks next time.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  It does the job, lasts, and if you start out with lipstick and then eat it off, just a dab of this makes your lips feel great, and refreshes the color instantly.  Sometimes I just used lipliner and fill in with this...gives the color and has a much nicer feel than lipstick.</li>
            <li> A great winter alternative to regular lipstick. Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Shimmer is a keeper!</li>
            <li> Appreciate the natural look with a bit of added color.  Suits me perfectly and will buy it again when needed.</li>
            <li> I use this every day! My lipsticks are lonely, this lip shimmer&lt;br /&gt;is my all-time favorite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it feels on, moisturizes without feeling thick or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;The color is great, not too strong, and a bit transparent~&lt;br /&gt;Tastes fine~&lt;br /&gt;Very medicating, but doesn&#x27;t taste medicin-ey, just right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfect lip stick/lip moisturizer from my favorite cosmetic/naturals&lt;br /&gt;company!</li>
            <li> I love these lip shimmers and carry them everywhere. They&#x27;re easy to put on and have a bit of a minty taste to them.</li>
            <li> The formula of this lip gloss is nice enough, and I like the mint tingle, as others have mentioned.  I bought this in Rhubarb, as it looked like it might be a darkish pink.  Unfortunately the color is all wrong on me- it&#x27;s much brighter on that it appears to be in the tube, and it just looks garish.  I might purchase another one, but only in a much different color.</li>
            <li> I tried this before and it was clearly an old tube because the contents were dried out and it would fall apart in clumps when you tried to put it on. I didn&#x27;t know better.  But, this time I got a tube from Walgreen&#x27;s and the minty shimmer goes on smoothly.  The color is nice and just a tint.  You do need their lip shine on top of it to add color layers for it to show up more.&lt;br /&gt;However, if you want full color, better to just use lipstick.</li>
            <li> Great natural way to have subtle lip color.  I keep it in my pants pocket, so it&#x27;s always handy.</li>
            <li> I love this lip shimmer. The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was the peppermint oil in the product. Otherwise, a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great, natural line of lip products that feel great and wear well. The color is wonderful, too. It is a tad intense, but looks great on a gal with dark hair and eyes. Go for the Watermelon shade if you want a lighter look. I especially like the peppermint oil zing.</li>
            <li> i love Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s it is the only thing that keeps my lips from getting chapped.  And the color is an added bonus...</li>
            <li> My problem with normal lip gloss is the heavy feeling of goo on my lips. It feels less like something to make me attractive and more like something to draw flies to their death, getting hopelessly stuck in the goo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gloss is different. It is light but shiny, it is sparkly but not glittery. I am a matte lipstick person, so this was a new look for me. I like the transparent colors and same Burts Bees protection that I have come to love.</li>
            <li> I read that commercial red lipsticks contain lead which is harmful, so I like using Burt&#x27;s Bees as a more natural choice.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect lip stick, lots of moisturizer, with a little color, great smaller size, great price, and a lot of color choices.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is an incredibly moisturizing lip balm/shimmer/gloss!  Usually anything this moisturizing does not have the amount of color that this has.  My lips feel so good after wearing this all day, but it looks as good as lipstick!  It isn&#x27;t sticky or smell bad like a lot of lip glosses, either.  It has no taste (no strawberry, for example).  I think I am one of the last holdouts to try Burt&#x27;s Bees, but now I am a believer!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful rich color. With one swipe, it&#x27;s MLBB. Can be layered to appear darker for more formal occasions. My new favorite.</li>
            <li> I have been using &#x27;Burts&#x27; forever and will continue!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good Burt&#x27;s Bee lip product.  The color stays on and is pretty rich.  If you have trouble with your lipstick bleeding, you might have trouble with this one or apply a lip liner. Also, if your lips are dry, the pigment will mostly absorb into the dry areas first so you may need to exfoliate first.  This product is much richer than the tinted lip shine-- I look forward to trying some of the other Burt&#x27;s Bees lip products but between the 2 this is the better for color. . .Most importantly, the ingredients seem to be safe.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Burt&#x27;s Bees product.  It is like lipstick but with the wonderful Burt&#x27;s bees chapstick with moisturizer.  Bought more than one in different colors.  Excellent product and would certainly buy again.</li>
