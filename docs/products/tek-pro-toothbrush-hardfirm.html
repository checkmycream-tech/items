    <ol>
            <li>Very happy I ordered these!</li>
            <li>They are perfect for what we need.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>Very happy to find them.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re in great shape after over 80 years.</li>
            <li>Very effective</li>
            <li>Good quality, at a great price.  </li>
            <li>I am hopelessly searching for a good firm-bristle toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Tek is a good name to rely on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The tooth cleaning ability of the ones purchased is as good</li>
            <li>i love these brushes, can&#x27;t wait til i have to order more!!</li>
            <li>MY HANDY DANDY HOUSEHOLD HELPERS, GOOD FOR SO MANY JOBS</li>
            <li>So I was real excited to try these TEK brushes.  </li>
            <li>These are not very firm and would be \\&quot;Medium\\&quot; at best.  </li>
            <li>I just wish the color selection was better.  </li>
            <li>-- I don&#x27;t think they make them any more.  </li>
            <li>, I LOVE THEM AND HOPE THEY NEVER STOP SELLING THEM.</li>
            <li>using a firmer toothbrush lets me massage my gums and get a better feeling on my teeth as well...</li>
            <li>Many years ago my parents invested money in my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more triangular.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>5 more words required ok</li>
            <li>These are my favorite tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>Oz ones were better</li>
            <li>when I read the info on this &amp; the $, I was very excited.  </li>
            <li>Please note that my review is 100% about the product, and not the 3rd party merchant who fulfilled the purchase (they arrived very quickly and in perfect condition -- they just sell crappy products!!).  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering them by the bundle at not a bad price either!  </li>
            <li>The brushes worked out just fine.</li>
            <li>For the price they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping these fit the bill.</li>
            <li>Just a basic toothbrush but at a great price.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush was once good for it&#x27;s firmness, but they have changed its quality into one of soft ineffectiveness.  </li>
            <li>Tek Pro toothbrushes are user friendly....</li>
            <li>Not recommended for your gums, but brushes your teeth and stay clean throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I got them quick fast and in a hurry and now my gums and teeth are smiling again!!!</li>
            <li>Others have stated the Tek has a larger-wider handle, &amp; that&#x27;s true, but that didn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is not one of those fancy tootbrushes just a good basic one.</li>
            <li>We find the softer bristles do not do an adequate job.  </li>
            <li>since I can&#x27;t buy firm toothbrushes in the store,I really appreciate that I can buy them online and at a great price!</li>
            <li>These are good, cheap little brushes.</li>
            <li>The description says they are Hard/Firm, but they are more Medium or Soft.</li>
            <li>Item was as described and the price was right.</li>
            <li>THEY ARE INEXPENSIVE AND CLEAN YOUR TEETH VERY WELL</li>
            <li>Would love to be able to find a good truly Hard or Firm toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>the VERY FIRST try, the bristles started separating and were very soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>Dentists say hard brushes aren&#x27;t good for you.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased and when they came in they were exactly as expected.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always appreciated that.  </li>
            <li>Also, the head itself does not have the big lushy bristle rectangular shape I used to enjoy on Tek Pro toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Fast delilvery.</li>
            <li>simple cheap and do the job</li>
            <li>a nice firm</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase a Tek in the old stiffness overseas recently, so</li>
            <li>you want to actually have clean teeth</li>
            <li>SINCE I CANNOT FIND A PROPER NAIL BRUSH, TO CLEAN UNDERNEATH NAILS, THESE WILL SUBSTITUTE FOR THAT</li>
            <li>The soft toothbrushes don&#x27;t seem like they are very affective to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We have several people using the same bathrooms, and it&#x27;s nice to have different colors</li>
            <li>The old one is very well made, and I hope the new ones are too.</li>
            <li>My favorite was the old Colgate Classic firm bristle brush</li>
            <li>I found they were very soft.</li>
            <li>Yeah they&#x27;re not as soft as those labeled soft, more like halfway between soft and hard.</li>
            <li>how old it is, but it could be as old as 30 or 40 years old.</li>
            <li>It is probably the firmest toothbrush made today but does not compare to the old Rite Aid brand.  </li>
            <li>Dentists recommend using soft toothbrushes to preserve tooth enamel and gums.  </li>
            <li>I started using it and thought -- wow,</li>
            <li>Rite Aid used to have a generic version that was very close.  </li>
            <li>I suggest they be re-labelled as SOFT.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll have to pay a little more for a big pack of the bigger brand name to get my tough/firm bristled toothbrush.</li>
            <li>So hard to find firm toothbrushes -- these are great and last forever!</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are also longer than the ones I usually use, so they don&#x27;t fit in my travel toothbrush case.</li>
            <li>In looking at the brush itself, I found that there are not as many bristles (or groups of bristles) as other \\&quot;firm / hard\\&quot; bristled toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I will attempt to attach a pik w/the Tek on the left, &amp; my (other brand) on the right.  </li>
            <li>To my dismay I could not find them, as of last year, I was searching high and low for them and nothing.  </li>
            <li>Recently, I had found an old one of these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>and is the only brush that is firm enough to clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I like a nice hard and firm toothbrush.</li>
            <li>These brushes are described as hard/firm, but hard they&#x27;re certainly not, not  nearly as hard as the toothbrushes labeled hard I&#x27;ve bought for many years.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The bristles are so firm that they will eventually begin to break after a period of time, so I try and always keep an extra new one on hand for when that happens.</li>
            <li> AND LAST A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe that one is supposed to use firm brushes on real teeth (due to potential damage to gums), but they may be useful for false teeth.  </li>
            <li> I tried several other brushes but finally , I found the one that I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to find firm toothbrushes locally, so was thrilled to discover these, at this price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, the new Tek Pros don&#x27;t seem to be as hard and firm as the old one that I have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had far harder toothbrushes from Tek in the past</li>
            <li> Overall, I was disappointed with these toothbrushes, but they are a little bit better than some of the Medium and Soft toothbrushes I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> They are rather empty brushes.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a firm toothbrush in my local stores</li>
            <li> The (hard/firm) model is the only brush that has actually firm bristles, . . .</li>
            <li> They did arrive faster than expected so this does not reflect on the seller.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and just as expected.</li>
            <li> Even reading the other reviews, I thought \\&quot;I just gotta try it\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I donated the other 11 brushes to charity).  </li>
            <li> Bought them to give to homeless people along with other hygiene products.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find hard  toothbrushes in my local stores.</li>
            <li> The Tek hard toothbrushes have a different handle to the ones  </li>
            <li> The bristles are not very good, and they are already starting to bend from just a few uses.</li>
            <li> The bristles seem fairly firm, BUT due to the lack of bristle groupings (?)</li>
            <li> In order to find a firm or hard toothbrush, I had to go with a &amp;#34;Wisdom Smokers extra hard&amp;#34; toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> They are firm, but as other people said, they are not dense like reach crystal firm.</li>
            <li> Disappointing considering I paid so much for freight.  </li>
            <li> I still can not find a firm brush.  </li>
            <li> They were plenty firm for me.</li>
            <li> And I like my bristles firm, so</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.  </li>
            <li> The firm bristles remove debris that softer brushes cannot.</li>
            <li> IF YOU WANT A FIRM TOOTHBRUSH</li>
            <li> If your goal is to get a firm bristle, then Tek Pro is not for you.  </li>
            <li> Not as firm as I like</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used one, but it&#x27;s not as hard and firm as the old one that I found, so I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Well, I prefer to have teeth that don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re all wearing little sweaters!</li>
            <li> I prefer a really stiff toothbrush, and am having trouble locating them at this time- used to buy Colgate &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; andth en Rite Aid made a hard one</li>
            <li> They may &#x27;say&#x27; hard, but they are not and do not clean your teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its so hard to find firm toothbrushes in the stores</li>
            <li> I usually use my electric brush, but when in a hurry</li>
            <li> However, my intent is to use them as cleaning brushes for small mechanical &amp; electrical parts.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to find the Tek Pro Toothbrush in any of the local stores.  </li>
            <li> I like a  hard toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Looking for hard toothbrushes which are very hard to find.  </li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t get confused.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s impossible to find hard toothbrushes today in stores.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these toothbrushes were not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I knew within 10 seconds that I made the wrong choice</li>
            <li> so these were disappointing.</li>

            <li> I usually use my electric brush, but when in a hurry I use the Tek Pro....time to order more.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s impossible to find hard toothbrushes today in stores.  They may &#x27;say&#x27; hard, but they are not and do not clean your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to actually have clean teeth get these.  Dentists say hard brushes aren&#x27;t good for you.  Well, I prefer to have teeth that don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re all wearing little sweaters!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these toothbrushes were not what I was expecting. The description says they are Hard/Firm, but they are more Medium or Soft. The bristles are not very good, and they are already starting to bend from just a few uses. I also don&#x27;t like the shape of the toothbrushes, especially the head of the toothbrush which rubs the roof of my mouth and has made it sore. These toothbrushes are also longer than the ones I usually use, so they don&#x27;t fit in my travel toothbrush case. Overall, I was disappointed with these toothbrushes, but they are a little bit better than some of the Medium and Soft toothbrushes I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I tried several other brushes but finally , I found the one that I was looking for. I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> Its so hard to find firm toothbrushes in the stores so when I found this bulk pack of 12 I was pleased and when they came in they were exactly as expected. Very happy I ordered these!</li>
            <li> Looking for hard toothbrushes which are very hard to find.  I&#x27;m hoping these fit the bill.</li>
            <li> It is probably the firmest toothbrush made today but does not compare to the old Rite Aid brand.  I still can not find a firm brush.  Let me know if you find one?</li>
            <li> Dentists recommend using soft toothbrushes to preserve tooth enamel and gums.  We find the softer bristles do not do an adequate job.  We also like to switch toothbrushes often to prevent contamination.  It is very difficult to find firm toothbrushes locally, so was thrilled to discover these, at this price.  They are perfect for what we need.  I just wish the color selection was better.  We have several people using the same bathrooms, and it&#x27;s nice to have different colors so they don&#x27;t get confused.</li>
            <li> Simple toothbrush that works with  features  that are basic.</li>
            <li> This s a personal choice for my teeth. Not recommended for your gums, but brushes your teeth and stay clean throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Recently, I had found an old one of these toothbrushes. I have no idea how old it is, but it could be as old as 30 or 40 years old. It had not been used. I started using it and thought -- wow, a nice firm toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked up the brand online and found it here on Amazon. I ordered the 12-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used one, but it&#x27;s not as hard and firm as the old one that I found, so I was disappointed. I like a nice hard and firm toothbrush. The soft toothbrushes don&#x27;t seem like they are very affective to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, the new Tek Pros don&#x27;t seem to be as hard and firm as the old one that I have. The old one is very well made, and I hope the new ones are too.</li>
            <li> The brushes worked out just fine. They were plenty firm for me.</li>
            <li> Tek Pro toothbrushes are user friendly....</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2ND5QKXS8066M]]I LIKE having extra toothbrushes around, friends, trips, etc.  And I like my bristles firm, so when I read the info on this &amp; the $, I was very excited.  Even reading the other reviews, I thought \\&quot;I just gotta try it\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, it was not to be.  In looking at the brush itself, I found that there are not as many bristles (or groups of bristles) as other \\&quot;firm / hard\\&quot; bristled toothbrushes.  Why? ya got me...  The bristles seem fairly firm, BUT due to the lack of bristle groupings (?) it just doesn&#x27;t add up to the firmness I like / require in my \\&quot;brushing behaviour\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just did a bristle test, side by side, &amp; the Tek either has weaker bristles, or as stated above, just ineffectual (to my mouth) bristles.  I will attempt to attach a pik w/the Tek on the left, &amp; my (other brand) on the right.  Others have stated the Tek has a larger-wider handle, &amp; that&#x27;s true, but that didn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to pay a little more for a big pack of the bigger brand name to get my tough/firm bristled toothbrush. ;-(</li>
            <li> I am hopelessly searching for a good firm-bristle toothbrush.  My favorite was the old Colgate Classic firm bristle brush -- I don&#x27;t think they make them any more.  Rite Aid used to have a generic version that was very close.  So I was real excited to try these TEK brushes.  I bought a 12 pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the VERY FIRST try, the bristles started separating and were very soft to the touch. I knew within 10 seconds that I made the wrong choice (I donated the other 11 brushes to charity).  Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.  Please note that my review is 100% about the product, and not the 3rd party merchant who fulfilled the purchase (they arrived very quickly and in perfect condition -- they just sell crappy products!!).  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe that one is supposed to use firm brushes on real teeth (due to potential damage to gums), but they may be useful for false teeth.  However, my intent is to use them as cleaning brushes for small mechanical &amp; electrical parts.  The firm bristles remove debris that softer brushes cannot.</li>
            <li> MY HANDY DANDY HOUSEHOLD HELPERS, GOOD FOR SO MANY JOBS, I LOVE THEM AND HOPE THEY NEVER STOP SELLING THEM. NOT FOR MY TEETH, OH NO, I USE A PHILLIPS ULTRASONIC, BUT IF YOU WEAR DENTURES, MAYBE THESE WILL WORK FOR THAT!  NEWEST USE: SINCE I CANNOT FIND A PROPER NAIL BRUSH, TO CLEAN UNDERNEATH NAILS, THESE WILL SUBSTITUTE FOR THAT UNTIL I FIND ONE!</li>
            <li> using a firmer toothbrush lets me massage my gums and get a better feeling on my teeth as well...i love these brushes, can&#x27;t wait til i have to order more!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Can&#x27;t find hard  toothbrushes in my local stores.</li>
            <li> These brushes are described as hard/firm, but hard they&#x27;re certainly not, not  nearly as hard as the toothbrushes labeled hard I&#x27;ve bought for many years. Yeah they&#x27;re not as soft as those labeled soft, more like halfway between soft and hard.</li>
            <li> Using these for cleaning...not teeth</li>
            <li> They are rather empty brushes. They are firm, but as other people said, they are not dense like reach crystal firm. For the price they&#x27;re fine. I probably will not be buying them again.</li>
            <li> So hard to find firm toothbrushes -- these are great and last forever!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a firm toothbrush in my local stores so I decided to look online. Very happy to find them.</li>
            <li> Just a basic toothbrush but at a great price.  This is not one of those fancy tootbrushes just a good basic one.</li>
            <li> I prefer a really stiff toothbrush, and am having trouble locating them at this time- used to buy Colgate &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; andth en Rite Aid made a hard one</li>
            <li> I only use Hard/Firm tooth brushes on my teeth.  To my dismay I could not find them, as of last year, I was searching high and low for them and nothing.  Now that I have found these from Tek Pro and no not used :0)!!  I will be ordering them by the bundle at not a bad price either!  I got them quick fast and in a hurry and now my gums and teeth are smiling again!!!</li>
            <li> IF YOU WANT A FIRM TOOTHBRUSH THESE ARE FOR YOU.  THEY ARE INEXPENSIVE AND CLEAN YOUR TEETH VERY WELL AND LAST A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find the Tek Pro Toothbrush in any of the local stores.  The (hard/firm) model is the only brush that has actually firm bristles, . . . and is the only brush that is firm enough to clean my teeth.  Many years ago my parents invested money in my teeth.  I&#x27;ve always appreciated that.  I have all my teeth and they&#x27;re in great shape after over 80 years.</li>
            <li> These are not very firm and would be \\&quot;Medium\\&quot; at best.  I&#x27;ve had far harder toothbrushes from Tek in the past so these were disappointing. I was able to purchase a Tek in the old stiffness overseas recently, so maybe it&#x27;s just a problem in the U.S.?  Would love to be able to find a good truly Hard or Firm toothbrush.  It&#x27;s a problem.  They did arrive faster than expected so this does not reflect on the seller.</li>
            <li> Although the label says hard/firm I found they were very soft. Disappointing considering I paid so much for freight.  I suggest they be re-labelled as SOFT.</li>
            <li> These are good, cheap little brushes. Bought them to give to homeless people along with other hygiene products. They are about the quality you would expect a dentist to give to patients after a cleaning, so no complaints.</li>
            <li> Also, the head itself does not have the big lushy bristle rectangular shape I used to enjoy on Tek Pro toothbrushes.  It&#x27;s more triangular.  I sent them back.</li>
            <li> Lasts longer than the others.  Good quality, at a great price.  Tek is a good name to rely on. Recommended</li>
            <li> If your goal is to get a firm bristle, then Tek Pro is not for you.  This toothbrush was once good for it&#x27;s firmness, but they have changed its quality into one of soft ineffectiveness.  It is now what a medium toothbrush used to be.  In order to find a firm or hard toothbrush, I had to go with a &amp;#34;Wisdom Smokers extra hard&amp;#34; toothbrush.  The &amp;#34;Wisdom&amp;#34; toothbrush though will let you know when you need to replace it.  The bristles are so firm that they will eventually begin to break after a period of time, so I try and always keep an extra new one on hand for when that happens.</li>
            <li> Love it. Very effective</li>
            <li> This is the one and only toothbrush to use. Improved gum health immensely, brushing properly.</li>
            <li> Item was as described and the price was right.Would do business with again. Fast delilvery. 5 more words required ok</li>
            <li> These are my favorite tooth brushes. simple cheap and do the job</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and just as expected.</li>
            <li> I like a  hard toothbrush. Not as firm as I like but I have tried boar , smokes toothbrush and for the price 1 toothbrush last me 2 or 3 months.</li>
            <li> The Tek hard toothbrushes have a different handle to the ones  I used to get in Oz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oz ones were better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tooth cleaning ability of the ones purchased is as good</li>
            <li> since I can&#x27;t buy firm toothbrushes in the store,I really appreciate that I can buy them online and at a great price!</li>
