            <li> I bought this as a gift for my teenage daughter for her stocking at Christmas time. She uses it for all her hair barrettes and hair ties. She loves it.</li>
            <li> A good decent product to use. I ordered this before, and order another one because I want a backup. You get what you paid for, and for me it was good enough to use. My family don&#x27;t travel much, but we use this couples weeks ago on a 4 days short weekend road trip. I like it for the good size. It made of the durable reusable rain poncho material. Zipper is good and run deep from one side to the other side. Be aware that the width of the bag (both sides) are made with mesh. This is a lot more perfect to use at the beach or at the pool since the purpose is to drain out water/sand. Plus, the material make it easy to wash if things spill in there. I was able to store toiletries including toothbrushes for 4 people. We kinda overpack, but the bag fit everything really well. If you travel alone, you can pack your makeup in there too, just make sure to ziploc those shampoo/conditioners. One neg thing, this is not for a long time use. Those who travel alot may not want to get it, but those who don&#x27;t, you could get a good amount of usage from it.</li>
            <li> Great bag to carry makeup in</li>
            <li> Broke the first time of use.</li>
            <li> Zipper broke soon after I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Love this little bag. Great for packing toiletries. Fits easily in my suitcase. Exactly what I needed. The price was right, too!</li>
            <li> For two bucks, it does what it&#x27;s intended for however it looked bigger in the picture. Also it is very cheap (obvious) and thin, which again can be expected for $2.</li>
            <li> It comes in time , looks nice, but is very thin... holds all my makeup so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m happy for .</li>
            <li> As expected. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This product is not the quality that I expected. It looks cheap and flimsy. Not at all what I expected.</li>

            <li> this is adorable!  I&#x27;m going to use it when I go on my road trip to carry my snacks in, I know it&#x27;s supposed to be for cosmetics, but this will work for that also.</li>
            <li> needed a bag to keep items in found it, bought it, got it, put stuff in it. I works the items are still in it!! I&#x27;m happy.</li>

            <li> I just received the purple one I ordered and am very happy with it. It is a very cute bag that can be used for a gift bag for a birthday party. It is very roomy and ideal to carry in your luggage. I did not notice a strong odor to it.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price on this! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Super cute, small cosmetic case.</li>
            <li> Just really not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product because how cheap it was. When it arrived I gave 2 away and kept one for myself. It is a great little bag. I use to to store and carry my makeup. It is really sturdy and easy to clean. I will definitely buy again for myself and gifts.</li>
            <li> This bag is very affordable and can be used to store any thing not just cosmetics. I purchased 3 one to hold the many pair of sun glasses, one to hold the baby toys, and one to hold my daughters color pencils and markers. This bag is very useful. You can see through it to see what is inside. I also love the colors and design. I Love Purple.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t help but smile when you see this bag. It is so cute!&lt;br /&gt;Holds a lot of stuff.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that the sides are netted so if anything spills, there is no guarantee that it&#x27;ll stay inside the bag.&lt;br /&gt;I use little plastic bags on my liquidy stuff before I stuff them in this.</li>
            <li> It was larger than I expected (but I also didn&#x27;t really pay attention to the measurements). It holds all my makeup with room to spare.</li>
            <li> The plastic is soft and the sides are mesh. They are cute and I think they will come in handy.</li>
            <li> A lot nicer than what I thought it was going to be. And for a $1.00 it was a bargain.</li>
            <li> Adorable.  Wish I would have gotten more. Very multi-uses.</li>
            <li> These are cute. They have a smell at first but after they air out, they&#x27;re good. I use them for my coupons, my make up, travel items, etc. I bought four of them over a year ago and one is just now starting to come apart a little at the straps.</li>
            <li> Will not buy this item ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bag is made of a very bad quality of materials. Yo can&#x27;t fit a lot of stuff. I will just give it to girls to play with it, no  to use it by an adult.</li>
            <li> Very cute plastic cosmetic bag. I was pleasantly surprised with the size also. Bigger than I thought it would be. Going to use it as my travel cosmetic bag because it&#x27;s see through enough, yet still cute.</li>
            <li> Thin, but works great for me to put makeup in.</li>
            <li> I bought this purple bag to help me with organizing my beauty products . It&#x27;s a nice size and holds my extra makeup . I&#x27;m glad I found it !!</li>
